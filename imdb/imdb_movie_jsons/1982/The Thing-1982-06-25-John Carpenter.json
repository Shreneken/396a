This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won.\"John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made \u0096 fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission, but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the \"dog\" is actually a shape-shifting alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims \u0096 in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural prison.\"The Thing,\" the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic \"Alien\" (1979). Many comparisons have been made \u0096 the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off one-by-one. However, \"The Thing\" \u0096 for all practical purposes \u0096 came first.Based on the famous short story \"Who Goes There?\" by John W. Campbell, Jr. (writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was \"The Thing From Another World,\" an unarguable classic. But to be fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.\nFrom the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all time, \"The Thing\" \u0096 by any standards \u0096 is unconventional Hollywood at its best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, \"The Thing\" performed poorly in theaters, and \"E.T.\" \u0096 released the same year and featuring a much kinder alien \u0096 became the higher-grossing picture of the two (by far).In the long run, however, \"The Thing\" is superior in almost every conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th Anniversary Re-Release. \"The Thing,\" on the other hand, has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics \u0096 it is one of the most famous non-famous movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career \u0096 from his amazing \"Assault on Precinct 13\" (1976) to the magnificent \"Halloween\" (1978) to the disappointing and silly \"Escape from L.A.\" (1996), \"The Thing\" remains his very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to land it a spot on most \"great movies\" lists, \"The Thing\" is still one of my favorite horror films, and \u0096 upon close inspection \u0096 masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is simultaneously unique and chilling \u0096 a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is genuinely unpredictable.",

            "content": "A classic film. John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I'll put any of \"The Thing's\" old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see \"The Thing\" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend? Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?\"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.\" John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!! 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",

            "content": "John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a \"what is in the shadow\" sequence, the film is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and see what happens indeed. 10/10",

            "content": "\"The ultimate in alien terror,\" it says. It's not wrong. This is it. This is the greatest horror film ever made. John Carpenter's A-#1.Cinema is full of great creature designs, yet The Thing bests them all. Every incarnation we see of the creature, and all the practical effects and set pieces that bring it to life, are the best that the industry has to offer. The most realistic CGI will never compete.The paranoia and distrust in the outpost is palpable. Carpenter crafts a tangible atmosphere of desperation and suspicion, from the unassuming beginning to the classic, ambiguous end--one of my very favorite endings from any movie, ever.Composer extraordinaire Ennio Morricone lends his great skills with a minimalist, synth-driven score that adds immensely to the building unease. It very well complements the performances of the excellent ensemble cast that bring every feeling of terror and wariness to life. Kurt Russell once again shines as Carpenter's lead, MacReady, and Keith David is superb as the antagonistic Childs. It's easy to overlook other cast members with smaller roles and less time on screen--even the unmistakable Wilford Brimley--but have no doubt, they're all just as good, just as essential to the picture.Once again: not only is John Carpenter a master storyteller, a fantastic director generally, but his greatest skill is in slowly building the tension and suspense in his pictures until the explosive finale. He does it so well that it's impossible for the viewer not to experience the same misgivings, the same sense of horror, as the characters on-screen--not because you're watching it, but because you FEEL it just as deeply.It's violent, it's gory, and broadly it may not be for everyone. But this needs to be seen by anyone with the slightest interest in horror, or creature features, or with a keen interest in cinema history as a whole. Similar stories may be told, but there are no and will never be any imitators.",

            "content": "Remake of the classic 1951 \"The Thing From Another World\". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette \"Who Goes There?\") and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off, heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful. You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with \"E.T.\" and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up!",

This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off.

Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.

All the Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this. Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!",

Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was prepared \u0096 moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.\nIt then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained such a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks' version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story \"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire cast.\nIt opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.\nThis scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film history.\nEnnio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper, compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.\nA satisfying example of a movie that today \u0096 18 years after \u0096 looks downright muscular in its simplicity.\nThe budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film, making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.\nHorror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque special effects. Be warned \u0096 there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find them disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a crowd of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research facility) terrorized by an alien life form.\nWhere Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece, his own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every way.\nThe husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it never barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of - DVD version).\nWatch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at a human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not the point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror movie.\nCarpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection, making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.",

What really gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread, isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling, freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day, they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished, but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few of the fine cast.

I certainly consider it Carpenter's joint best, along with that one with the Michael Myers guy. This is a film based on John W. Campbell's story \"Who Goes There?\", which also inspired the 1951 flick THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD which saw James Arness as a killer carrot-man in the same setting. Carpenter is closer to the original story, as his menace is a gory shape shifting alien which consumes and imitates its prey \u2013 forget the T1000, he has nothing on this thing. The look of the creature is extremely disgusting and disturbing and hard to forget \u2013 imagine some Lovecraftian terror in the flesh, covered in blood and tentacles and other less describable body parts, and you're halfway there.The rest of the special effects are incredible; witness heads slide off bodies and turn into spiders, and the infamous and gut-wrenching kennel transformation which I had the misfortune to watch when I was but a boy. You can bet I had plenty of sleepless nights after watching that one. Plenty of blood, gore, and violence throughout make this one of the hardest of horrors. Yet despite all the effects, this is still a plot-driven movie with absolutely loads of suspense and tension \u2013 not to mention a near overwhelming paranoia throughout.There are many imaginative moments \u2013 the opening sequence, in which Norbert Weisser tries to kill a poor little doggie \u2013 to the excellent blood test scene, in which the guys are tied down whilst Russell tests their blood samples for the alien virus. Russell is subdued but great and as an ensemble, the rest of the guys are true to life and so believable, which makes it all the more horrific. Every outburst, crack-up or breakdown seems to be happening for real and we do learn to care about these very natural researchers trapped in the worst scenario imaginable.

One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways. Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien. And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly. And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications. Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than ET!",

            "content": "This movie failed at the box office and nearly ruined the career of John Carpenter. Think of that as you watch it. But did it really fail? It made nearly $20 million on a $15 million budget, but audiences must have expected more. Studios certainly did.Was it because E.T. came out at the same time, as well as so many other science fiction and fantasy films? Did the recession make people not want to watch something so nihilistic? Did the sheer level of gore turn people off? Were people upset that he remade a film some considered a classic*?After one market research screening, Carpenter asked the audience what they thought. One answered, \"Well what happened in the very end? Which one was the Thing...?\" When Carpenter said that the answer was up to their imagination, the response was, \"Oh, God. I hate that.\"How could audiences respond to a movie that did not spoon feed them any of the story beats? That doesn't have a single character to root for or get behind? That is influenced by Lovecraft - as our the other Apocalypse Trilogy installments Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness - in that ordinary people face off with supernatural horror that they are doomed to be destroyed by, which isn't really what mainstream America wants from a popcorn film?Yeah, it could be all of those things. Or perhaps, the world was not ready for it. But watching the end of this film, as everyone sits around wondering who has a disease that they can barely understand and know will eventually impact them, yeah. I think the world of 2020 is ready for it.I wonder what it's like to watch this movie when it screens every year at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. I bet it feels pretty real there, too.In an interview with the AV Club, Carpenter said, \"If The Thing had been a hit, my career would have been different. I wouldn't have had to make the choices that I made. But I needed a job. I'm not saying I hate the movies I did. I loved making Christine and Starman and Big Trouble in Little China, all those films. But my career would have been different.\"As it was, Carpenter was reluctant to make the film** and nearly quit before it ever started filming. A lifelong fan of Howard Hawks***, he felt that his version of the story - both are based on Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell Jr. - was unbeatable. But as he re-read the original story - spurred on by co-producer Stuart Cohen - he saw how he could make a movie with a vision for his time, just as Hawks had thirty years ago.Beyond Carpenter, so many talents make this film work. Of course, there are the actors on screen, like Kurt Russell, Keith David, T.K. Carter, Wilfred Brimley, David Clennon and Richard Dysart. But there's also the astounding production design and storyboards from Man-Thing artist Mike Ploog and Mentor Huebner, which were so detailed that several of the shots from this look like carbon copies of their sketches. There's Dean Cundy working to make every shot look amazing - this is his first major studio movie with Carpenter. Want it to get even better? Sure, Carpenter could have done the score, but he got Ennio Morricone****. And finally, the Rob Bottin-lef effects team were pushed to the brink of exhaustion - Bottin was only 21 years old and ended up going to the hospital for exhaustion, double pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer after working for an entire year on the film, sleeping on set - but the work they created will never be duplicated and puts any CGI efforts to remake this film to shame. Carpenter thought that having someone in a suit - like Alien - cheapened the film. He wanted something more. Well, he got it. In the last battle with the Thing, fifty different artists are operating the monster.We're lucky that this movie exists. I saw it at the drive-in this year and it felt like it could have been made today. It was too imaginative, too nihilistic and too good for most people, even nearly forty years later.*One of the reviews that upset Carpenter the most came from the co-director of the original, Christian Nyby, said, \"If you want blood, go to the slaughterhouse. All in all, it's a terrific commercial for J&B Scotch.\"**Originally, Universal was going with Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel as the team for this movie, but were unhappy with their take. John Landis was also considered, but the film was really greenlit when Alien was such a big deal in 1979.***How big of a fan is Carpenter? You can see scenes of The Thing from Another World during Halloween.****Morricone's score for this film was nominated for a Razzie, while his score for The Hateful Eight - which has some unused music from this film in it - won him his only Best Original Score Oscar.",

I have long since been a fan of John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In 'The Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but only like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an alien lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact with, and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.\nIf possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat inducing, gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.\nWatch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye",

It's a bleak, unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing, based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien, another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien. There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good, like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares. They're not nice to look at, they're not pleasant and under no circumstances should any child ever see this film. It's that frightening, that good at what it does.",

He builds the plot well, meticulously setting the scene and ramping up the tension with good effect. The period where anyone could be infected / inhabited is particularly suspenseful. Excellent special effects, especially for 1982. Very gory, imaginative and realistic. Some of the images from the movie are quite iconic and will be familiar from pop culture, they've been reused so much.Ending is maybe a bit too ambiguous for my liking. While I don't generally like neat, happy Hollywood endings, this possibly went too much in the opposite direction.

            "content": "If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, \"The Thing\" really gives \"Alien\" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his creative powers (although I consider \"Starman\" to be even better, but this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a would-be apocalypse unlike any\"thing\" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how \"The Thing\" was doing on the IMDb scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now, it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason: It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that. Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in \"Predator\") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing, claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team, once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down, but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is nemesis for a horror movie and \"The Thing\" is living proof that if you plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.",

            "content": "In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone. I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky, curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes. That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheric to a T.",

From the Norwegians chasing that dog, to a minute by minute effort to survive and save civilization from this horror. The special effects dealing with the aliens transformation are stunning, especially when one realizes it was 1982 and the CGI stuff was really barely a thought. We care about the characters but are not let in on anything, so when something jumps, we jump with it. If there is a criticism, there is no release from the tension. Even if one is able to relax for a minute or two, there is an atmosphere of threat over everyone. When you can't trust the person you've known much of your life, who works next to you, when he becomes a deadly beast, what can you do? This is one of the greatest horror films ever.",

With this film Carpenter upgraded the original with excellent use of very impressive practical special effects. These effects still look extremely good today thirty years on. But it's not just this that has been improved; the characters and dialogue are better, while the sense of paranoid mystery is an entirely new addition to the story. Despite all these aspects, it comes as a surprise to a lot of people that The Thing was a box office failure upon release in 1982. Even the fools at the Razzies jumped on the bandwagon and nominated Ennio Morricone's Carpenteresque soundtrack for 'worst musical score' \u2013 a frankly ludicrous decision. Anyway, it was only in the years that followed that The Thing built up a reputation as a cult favourite, to the point that it is now considered something of a classic.

            "content": "This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense. It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in. Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form \u0096 kind of \u0096 and is burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features some of the best special effects of its time \u0096 they have not dated a bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside, though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. \"Nobody trusts anybody\" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a 1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie!

            "content": "\"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.\" The centre-piece of this feature is the bleak, isolated Antarctic landscape in which the story is set, which Carpenter contrasts so effectively from the outset with the claustrophobic confines of the American research base. The latter was built from scratch at the edge of a glacier in Stewart, British Columbia, with the remoteness of the location shoot exemplified by the cast and crew's hair- raising tales of being transported there. Based on John W Campbell's 1938 story 'Who Goes There?', this adaptation is much more faithful to the source material than Howard Hawks' 1951 original version, 'The Thing From Another World'. Thus, it is ironic that much of the criticism levelled at this production when it was released at the box-office was in lambasting Carpenter for creating such a dark and violent vision in comparison to Hawks' treasured original treatment. In fact, Carpenter not only paid homage to Hawks' original in his version, but also in his earlier body of work. In his 1978 breakthrough, it is playing on the TV set where Jamie Lee Curtis is babysitting, while in this feature the video footage the American team watch to learn what their Norwegian counterparts have unearthed consists of clips from Hawks' version. Carpenter's version's poor critical reception was largely based on its gory special effects, with Roger Ebert dismissing it as a 'barf-bag movie', while Hawks' 1951 director, Christian Nyby, wounded Carpenter by caustically commenting: 'If you want blood, go to the slaughterhouse'. It is clear that by wishing to preserve the shape-shifting alien presence of the source material, and thereby avoid the 'man in a costume' horror of his childhood, Carpenter irrevocably tied his film's fortunes to the quality and reception of its special effects. A second upshot of this decision was in handing total creative licence to special makeup effects creator, Rob Bottin. Having cut his teeth the year previously on 'The Howling', this former apprentice to Rick Baker both thrilled and appalled audiences in equal measure with his nightmarish visions. Though a little dated today, these still retain the power to shock, and deserved at least an Academy Award nomination. In spite of Bottin's laudable workmanship, what they did earn at the time was both a notoriety which deflected attention away from the film's strengths, as well as a period of hospitalisation for Bottin out of pure exhaustion. A further critique aimed at this production was a lack of sufficient characterisation, though it could be argued that with a plot so driven by suspicion, the audience's lack of in-depth knowledge of individual characters adds further to the tension. It is clear that the screenplay, penned by the son of Burt Lancaster whose only other screen writing credit was for the light comedies of the 'Bad News Bears' franchise, is as much of a psychological thriller as it is a visceral horror story. As Carpenter himself later commented: 'The paranoia is the glue that holds the movie together'. This is gradually racked up by the director before reaching its apogee in the film's most acclaimed blood-test scene. It is also supported by Ennio Morricone's throbbing baseline soundtrack, which was so unfairly nominated for a 'Razzie'. Many have questioned the plausibility of the actions of the men trapped on the base with this shape-shifting presence, forgetting that the latter's arrival sharpens the level of mistrust and friction which had been building throughout the team's isolation from the wider world. As such, the alien interloper in its desire to survive at all costs is able to exploit the breakdown of discipline as the team's fragile relationship is tested to its limits under siege. The cast give commendable performances in capturing the escalating tension and dread, none more so than Keith David as the volatile 'Childs' whose belligerence surfaces towards Kurt Russell's hirsute, cynical, renegade helicopter pilot as they bid to take control of the beleaguered survivors. It is fitting that these two characters are the only ones left to await the dying of the flames of their razed base uncertain as to whether their enmity is purely on human terms or one biological organism against another. This is another perfect vehicle provided by Carpenter for Russell's ability to deliver an understated but memorable performance in a role turned down by both Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges. Russell also contributed the final lines of dialogue: 'Why don't we just...wait here a little while...see what happens?' Although now regarded as a cult movie which raised the bar for the horror genre, this production 's failure at the box office marked the last time Carpenter would be entrusted with a major studio, big-budget vehicle, and the virtual end of Lancaster's career, as both were removed from plans to have them bring Stephen King's 'Firestarter' to the big screen. A victim of the timing of its release to audiences warmed to a much more benign vision of alien visitation in blockbuster, 'E.T.', Carpenter's feature has finally accrued the plaudits it deserves.",

It's an undisputed horror classic that has lived on since it's slightly anticlimactic, ill received release back in the 80's (people didn't know a good fright flick when they saw it back then, I guess). Nevertheless, it's a heart stopping odyssey of ambient antarctic unease, sickening, squirm inducing practical effects, and a veil of impending danger and paranoia that blankets both the characters and the viewer, like the thick drifts of snow that blanket the screen to gorgeous effect. The story by now is timeless: a team of antarctic researchers in a remote location come across a gigantic spacecraft buried in the tundra, and unearth a grotesque, frozen creature that upon being thawed, wreaks havoc on them and their facility. It's an imitator, this monster, and can hide in plain sight, within the flesh and blood of any one of their crew. This gives way to extreme distrust, mental unraveling and mutiny as it turns them against one another. For me there's nothing quite as iconic as the opening: Ennio Morricone's ominous, rhythmical score kicks in as we see two hysterical Norwegians in a helicopter, Chasing a dog across the frozen terrain. It's one of the most dazzling, evocative entrances to a fright flick ever filmed. Kurt Russell, in his whiskered, macho glory plays Macready, the head of the team. Russell is always solid, especially in genre stuff, and he's almost as distinct and iconic here as his Snake Plissken character. T.K. Carter, Donald Moffat, Keith David Wilford Brimley and more round out the rest of the team, and I won't mention standouts because they're all just fantastic and each play their part to a T. A huge highlight is the gruesome creature effects. When the it tries to imitate something and messes up, the result is a grossly misshapen slab of slimy nondescript gore, guaranteed to freak and gross you out in equal measures. I won't spoil anything with specifics, but the dog kennel and defibrillator scenes are time capsule worthy and should be shown in special effects makeup schools as a shining example. Carpenter pulls off the second absolutely flawless horror movie of his career with this one, not an easy feat, especially in this genre.

Giving us something missing from almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many recognizable faces and solid performances.

I can promise that I won't wait another 23 years for my third viewing. The Thing is a no-holds-barred journey though some of the best that sci-fi, horror, and action have to offer. The movie never lets up and rarely gives the viewer a chance to catch a breath.If you haven't seen this movie in a while (as I hadn't), the special effects will surely have stuck with you. They're gross, disturbing, and an excellent argument against the overuse of CGI in horror movies. Rob Bottin should have won an Academy Award for his special effects work on The Thing.But it takes more than effects and gore to make a \"good\" movie. It's the interaction between the characters and their real feelings of mistrust that elevates The Thing to the lofty status it has achieved. These are men who have worked together in extremely close quarters with little outside contact. Trust is important in this kind of atmosphere. But when it becomes clear that there may be a problem with various members of the group, they're quick to turn on one another to save their own necks. The paranoia is fascinating to watch.As far as I'm concerned, The Thing's ending is perfect. Too many movies attempt to spoon-feed viewers the answer to every question raised in the movie. The Thing leaves you with as many questions as it does answers. Good call, Carpenter!I only have one minor quibble with the movie and it's based as much on my recent viewing of The Thing from Another World as anything. Try as I might, I can't help compare the two movies. I would have really appreciated a better opportunity in The Thing to get to know who these men are. The characters can be described as paper thin.

Unlike the Hawks produced original, Carpenter and writer Bill Lancaster went back to the premise of John W. Campbell, Jr.,'s novella \"Who Goes There?\" (1938) where the creature impersonates various member of the colony while they struggle to destroy it. No, this horror movie is not for the squeamish. The eponymous monster is a slimy, creepy, critter that imitates the physical characteristics of anybody that it consumes. \"The Thing\" is the best film that John Carpenter ever directed and probably his most expensive. Rob Boktin's creatures are hair-raising, and the scene when the guy gets his arms bitten off at the elbow while he is administers CPR to a dying man is terrific. This tense, humorless, all-male yarn takes place in Antartica in 1982 and opens with a Norwegian chopper pursuing a Husky across the snow-swept terrain. The dog manages to reach another community of scientist before they can kill it and the Americans kill the insane, trigger-happy Norwegian. In other words, the dog survives and is taken in.

There, if an alien life form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one, but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold, in hibernation. There is no escape, no end.

They bring it back to find out that it's some sort of alien form that's fused together human parts. After more research into it they find out it was buried in the ice for centuries and that it's an aggressive shape-shifter. Soon enough it starts imitating the inhabitants of the base. Causing strained tension and hostile confrontations as everyone starts to turn on each other.Halloween might have been my first John Carpenter experience, but it was this one, which blew me away and got me really into the horror genre. \"The Thing\" used to always get played on late night TV and I never missed the opportunity to sit up and watch it. I always believed that it's the best time to watch this cult classic and on this occasion I did the same again, but I had to watch it on DVD this time around. Since this basically bombed at the box-office, because of the bad timing of its released. With it coming out straight after 'ET'. Pretty much it was suicide. But gradually over the years this has deservedly become a cult favourite through video amongst horror and Sci-Fi fans. The film still holds up remarkably well today and surely was unfairly dismissed when it came out. Also the poster artwork for the film is one of the best I've seen. Carpenter was on a great trot at the time and definitely was at his pinnacle, with such films like 'Escape from New York', 'The Fog', 'Halloween' and 'Assault on Precinct 13' coming before it.'The Thing' is a experimental remake of Howard Hawk's 'The Thing from another World', but instead Carpenter was far more faithful to John W. Campbell's story \"Who goes there\", by getting the alien to conceal itself inside it's victim and never seeing the being in its natural form. Compared with the walking vegetable that had a striking resemblance to Frankenstein in Hawk's version. It's hard not to compare the two, with each one having a stronger point over the other, but for me I have to go with the '82' version. Anyhow, I just gotta say I love the burning imprint of the film's title in the opening. That scene alone sends chills down my spine and tells you what's to come.The story is far from groundbreaking, but the same can't be said about Rob Bottin's daring make-up effects, which simply are astoundingly revolting. Even today they still hold a huge amount of impact in creating a horrific vibe. Really, these grotesque monster effects are incredibly menacing and freaky, but heck these creations are ugly. The gore is worked in rather nicely, with enough blood splatter involved. Like I said the story isn't something out of the ordinary, but the paranoia part of it is beautifully constructed. This is helped by a well diverse group of moody characters that start losing it slowly and Carpenter turns up the notch by seemingly tightening the confines, where the feel of isolation and tension is sustained to the very end. I thought the ambiguity of the conclusion was fitting enough to the overall context. Claustrophobic brilliance on Carpenter's part. Even the story can be class a metaphor about trust and how it's not so easy to come by now. Carpenter creates a very sombre and downbeat atmosphere that goes very well with the cold conditions of the setting. Underneath it all it has an apocalyptic awe about it, where it looks like there's nothing anybody can do about this concealed being. What complements the chilling feel of dread is Ennio Morricone's throbbing score that's simply sublime in awe. The score packs a real unsteadiness and showers the flick with such vigorousness. Pretty much it does alienate you to what's happening on screen.The performances are reasonably solid, though nothing really to write home about. Kurt Russell is perfect as the lead figure and his charismatic presence proves it. The rest are nothing more than pawns in this game of control. They do seem a little bit more one-dimensional, but still they give such raw performances that add more to the realism factor. Also the chemistry between the men is quite believable. Although, one thing that kept on bugging me, was why they would go off alone when that creature is on the loose. Although that helped on the red herrings and crackling suspense. Where the film stumbles a bit, can be found on the script. The characters were more full and dialogue less stilted, in Howard's film. That's were I thought \"The Thing from another World\" really had the wood over \"The Thing\". It built more on the characters. But saying that there was enough suspense built up and sardonic wit in the dialog here. The heated dialog did really warmed up proceedings. The production design is perfect in every inch. From the assured cinematography with many neat angle shots to the creepy, but authentic looking station and its dark and freezing corridors. Another thing to touch a nerve were the echoing sound effects, with the gusty wind making a big impression and the eerie howling from the thing just makes your hairs stand up. Carpenter's ace direction manages to mix gruesome images with psychological elements to achieve an sensational viewing that makes you grab hold of anyone/anything tightly and leaves you with some memorable sequences fresh in mind.A definite Horror / Sci-Fi milestone. Sure it isn't flawless, but it's crafted with a passion to shock, but also compel. Although it's the innovative effects, which will make sure that it's remembered for many years to come.",

T., John Carpenter's The Thing depicted a disturbing, grotesque creature of nightmare responsible for some of film's most terrifying body horror. The Thing was so far ahead of its time in horror and effects that it brought the terror into reality. Carpenter's brilliant decision to set the film in the frozen wilderness of Antarctica deepens the isolation and paranoia of every second. The practical effects are unbelievable and so impressive, allowing the actors to interact with the horror and make their performances that much more genuine and frightening. The Thing personifies paranoia as Kurt Russell's MacReady attempts to discover who is alien and who is not, with disgusting and disastrous consequences. Carpenter's The Thing is a gut-wrenching horror masterpiece that deserved so much more acclaim and recognition than it received upon its release.",

The fact that it manages to capture an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere, from the extreme isolation of the situation to a series of brilliant set-pieces at the end to ensure that it'll be impossible to determine who's what when it comes down to figuring out the identity of the alien in disguise amongst them. Chief among these, and a film highlight in its own sense, is the classic blood-test sequence, which is just marvelously done and never once gives away it's secret twist, which is highly creative and makes the film all the better when it's followed by a scene of incredible imagination with its disembodied head gag. It's a running theme throughout the film, of intense suspense followed by rather impressive special effects to punctuate it, all done convincingly and never really allowed to dominate one way over the other in the film. It's action is unparalleled, as the finale is a huge fire-filled battle in the basement, and it's never clear who will win out, and earlier battles are just as impressive as the film utilizes a rather oft-overlooked technique of making something to be feared known to loose in a situation where they can't escape, using the situation to its advantage throughout and never letting it go. Even the gore is impressive, offering tons of splatter to shoot across with reckless abandon and making for a never-ending series of great kills.

You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror. He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien. They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr. Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.",

Behind the camera (Winston, Morricone, Carpenter himself and many more) and in front of it.But I got quite ahead of myself.

            "content": "Some time ago, I wrote about The Thing From Another World, a classic 50s sci-fi movie that focuses on an almost unkillable alien creature rampaging through a base in the arctic and causing destruction. John Carpenter, being the avid fan of horror he is, was probably a big fan of that movie and wanted to reinvent it in a newer style for modern audiences. The movie bears a lot of similarities with its predecessor, the most distinctive being the similar setting. However, the 50s film takes place at the north pole, while this takes place in Antarctica. They both involve tons of snow and frigid temperatures so it can be easy to forget which is which. Despite essentially being an unofficial followup to the 50s movie, The Thing's plot is drastically different in many ways. It begins with a vehicle that was around during the filming of the original, but was not featured: a helicopter. One belonging to a team of Norwegian explorers to be specific. They are flying near the south pole and chasing some kind of dog with the flying machine, which leads them to an american base. After landing, the norwegian helicopter blows up and everyone onboard is killed. An american named MacReady (Kurt Russell) is stationed at the base and takes a helicopter ride of his own to the base the norwegians were a part of, only to find a strange creature that appears to be dead. MacReady takes it back to base for study, and Blair, a doctor, finds perfectly healthy organs inside of it. Meanwhile, the dog the helicopter was chasing earlier gets locked up with some other ones, when all of a sudden it transforms into a grotesque, gory mess of tentacles and bones. The researchers manage to fend it off with a flamethrower, and shortly after, learn about a buried alien spaceship. Things get worse when the alien starts to kill personnel all around the base and prevents it from being reinforced. It also becomes apparent the alien has the ability to steal the appearance of any one of the team members, meaning nobody can be trusted. The alien continues to infect and kill the remaining members of the base, and MacReady is forced to lay explosive charges all around the area in a last ditch attempt to get rid of the creature. Blair is killed and his body is taken over by the alien, who uses it to attack MacReady. Nevertheless, the base explodes anyway, and MacReady (alongside Childs, the only other survivor) grab a beer. When it was released back in 1982, this movie was so hated and misunderstood that it was called \"instant junk.\" The thing is (no pun intended), this probably came about because of bad timing. E. T. Was released the same year, and also featured an alien. The difference is that it had a much more lighthearted mood and was easier and less violent to watch. Interestingly, the theme for this movie was done by Ennio Morricone, which was unexpected. The special effects in this movie are what really steal the show, since they're quite disturbing, especially when the alien is able to steal people's bodies and make all their skin peel off. During its release, lots of people hated this movie because of how graphic it is, and also because of its cynical attitude of not being able to trust anyone, since after all, they might be the alien. John Carpenter said he was greatly upset when he heard people at the time hated this movie, saying how \"he takes every failure hard.\" Many of his movies, like Halloween, also have this gory, slasher feel to them, and this contrasted deeply with Spielberg's ET. Still, more recent reviews have been more positive, citing that the movie didn't get admiration when it came out and thus deserves some now. The synthesizer music is really creepy, and the thought of being stuck in -70 degree weather where nobody can help you is pretty disturbing. When compared with the 50s original, I feel that The Thing is an inferior but still worthy remake. The original set the standard and had a different monster, one that was visible to all the members of the base. This one can be anywhere at any time. I still think it's odd how a remake ended up more popular than the original, because without that movie, this one wouldn't exist.",

The movie is an intense monster feature directed by legendary horror director John Carpenter that's presented in a paranoid infused landscape of isolation and horrific sights with production drenched in an eerie foreboding atmosphere that's felt throughout its runtime.The plot follows an American research team stationed in Antarctica as they come across a disturbing discovery of a shape shifting alien being that starts to kill of the crew and assume their appearance of each victim.The real star of this flick are the outstanding special effects and the mind-blowing creature design that's wonderfully convincing as it goes from grotesque to disturbing with a wild array of morbid transformations that are genuinely unsettling and detailed to perfection. Everything works in this flick with the claustrophobic shots, the stunning landscapes and the incredible atmosphere that creates a thick ambiance, as well as the compelling mystery which is perfectly paced and keeps you guessing as to who has been consumed by the creature. The haunting original score by music legend Ennio Morricone perfectly reflects the paranoid delusion that's so well crafted on the screen and beautifully the synth scores with John Carpenters stylish filmmaking.The cast here are stellar with Kurt Russell taking on the lead role of RJ MacReady and of course being no stranger to John Carpenter's distinct style, he's fantastic in this role, deadly serious and extremely charismatic with that cool deadpan manner he commands your attention and truly shines in this iconic role. The movie's ensemble cast is what allows this movie to thrive thanks to the excellent characters. The standouts are Wilford Brimley as Dr Blair, Keith Davids as the cool and hot-tempered Childs, Donald Moffat as Garry, T. K Carter as the cook Nauls and Richard Dysart as Dr Cooper, this cast really does a remarkable job with the material as they each inject a sense of ambiguity to their roles.Overall 'The Thing' is just a pure masterpiece through and through, a true gem for any fans of horror and YES this is John Carpenter's finest movie of his directional career.",

            "content": "Before I even start, if you haven't seen this movie, *go* see this movie! If you enjoy tension and horror in the slightest go and see it, 'cause you will probably love it. It's one of those very special and fearsomely distinctive kinds of horror movies from yesteryear that has the rare enduring charm and quality about it that just more than stands the test of time. I suppose it's a simple and straightforward enough tale of fear, distrust, and most importantly twisted alien abominations, and how they slowly but surely invade and infect the desperate souls who are trapped in a place where none of them can hope to escape or even call for help, which of course just raises the despair and unease to new levels. This group of essentially doomed men must try and prevent the end of the world, provided they can figure out who to trust and who is still human before it's too late... Damn if it isn't so near-perfectly made, everything about it is handled so well and works out so beautifully. The starkly freezing visuals and cinematography is suffused with fear and unseen menace, with the early point in the film where they visit the grim charred remains of the Norwegian camp being especially nightmarish and creepy because unbeknownst to them, that's what's lying ahead. It just draws you right in and makes you almost feel like your in their shoes, and that's one of the things that I think a worthwhile horror picture is meant to do, it immerses you in the environment of what you're watching. I like how the cast are all interesting guys who are different from one another, and while they're not super-developed or anything you definitely care about them enough that you fully share their horror at what's befalling them. I really like the performance of the dog in the opening act which isn't all that it seems, you get a very sinister vibe from it, it doesn't look like your average plain old happy dumb dog, it looks like it's thinking and waiting for something. Way to go dog.. Never looks at the camera once! I don't believe that you can truly love this film without enjoying all the aspects of it, some love it for all the psychological atmosphere, whereas myself I lean more towards the monsterfest splatter side of things(!). But the creature appearances and the mood play off each other, every build-up is paid off, and when the Thing does explode out of nowhere when you're least expecting it, it's really the cherry on the top. I'd put my money on it as the scariest monster ever, I mean what's more alarming than the terror of your own body and mind being stolen and corrupted from within and turned against you? The horrific concept of the parasite taking over is truly used to its fullest potential. As a creature, I see the overall entity of the Thing as a giant all-consuming mouth, with each separate organism a tooth, and all that they can really do is to see how long they can, stem the jaw... The complete carnage of the monster attacks is violent and revolting, but also so undeniably fascinating that you just can't look away, it's like madness given form... My favourite is the sideways snappy-head because the legendary build up to it with the blood test is so perfectly nail-biting to me every time. The moment is so hectic that it's almost absurdly comedic, the way poor frightened Windows has his head thoroughly chewed on before being spat out! It's a picture that really shows what could be done with the technique of practical effects. I could not believe that nobody ever won any awards for those effects, or that this excellent film was so unfairly torn apart by the critics at the time of its release. That was grossly unfair and messed up, but...it does seem indeed that all good 'Things' really do come to those who wait, and over the years it has got every last bit of acclaim and recognition that it always deserved. John Carpenter may not have technically created the idea of the Thing, but it's because of this movie and his awesome vision why people recognise it to this day, it was him that breathed life into it and gave it an enduring(many!) face and identity. My god this movie is brilliant, no other adaptation holds a candle it it, it gave the original story the presentation it deserved. Thrilling, perfectly-casted and excellently written, I can honestly recommend this to anyone that loves gruesome horror or edge-of-your-seat mystery and suspense. This movie is gold, savour it on a long cold night...",

Much like both of those films, it is not strictly of one genre. It is a horror film as well as a psychological paranoia thriller, an explosion and gunfire-filled action movie, and a plausible science fiction movie. On top of that, it vaguely realistically depicts life in an antarctic research station, a setting that has not yet been fully explored to my satisfaction. There's a few goofups there such as an antarctic base housing a subterranean generator room (wouldn't they be concerned that such a thing would melt the ice out from under the buildings?).It's the mindblowing special effects that make this film so memorable. Body horror and transformation effects have never been so gooey, gross, and realistically done outside of one or two David Cronenberg career highlights. Much like Cronenberg, Carpenter complements the effects with a grim and uncompromising tone that never falls into camp or forced comedic relief. Thankfully there is zero romantic subplot at all to get in the way of things, which focuses the film in a way that few horror movies do. Sure in ALIEN and DAWN, characters seemed to have preexisting relationships but none of it drew particular attention away from the horrific goings on. The characters here feel a little underdeveloped on first viewing but they feel like real human beings with realistic reactions to their surroundings and little expository dialog.My favorite characterization in the film goes to The Thing itself, which acts more alien and animalistic than aliens in any other film. When we think about how contact will go with an extraterrestrial organism, it's easy to make it either fully hostile or friendly and all-knowing, without fully examining the middle ground that it may be even more fully evolved to focus exclusively on its own survival. It doesn't really care about communication or technical achievement. It's just out to defend itself at any cost.This gives rise to many intriguing concepts that the film hints at; what is consciousness if an alien can replicate and project the personality of a human so easily? Is someone infected or replaced by a Thing even aware that they are no longer human? Is the Thing more like a virus or a collective animal such as a Portuguese Man-o-War with certain cells' sole function to perform specific tasks (such as stinging or \"taking over\" other organisms)? What we see the creature do leads to more and more questions, which leaves the door wide open for further explorations of this universe through novelizations etc., an abhorrent prequel, video games, and, best of all, our own imagination.The Thing is an intriguing, shocking, and exciting film. It's hard to find a lot of flaw in it outside of a few banal lines and continuity goofs here and there. My main complaint is that didn't go a little further in depicting alien behavior and could have used a much more clever finale than the somewhat disappointing standoff that we get. It's almost as though the budget ran out or the crew and screenwriter all just collectively got tired toward the end of the process after creating so much brilliance for 90 minutes.",

Then, add in the most dangerous creature ever to land on Earth, and all bets are off!The ensuing paranoia and terror find fertile ground in the minds of these men. When they should be banding together to face the threat, they are torn apart by something among them... in them... as them.From the classic opening, with the dog and that minimalist score, we know we're in for something different. Many critics hated this movie when it came out, probably because it was such a bold departure from the original movie.

The technical proficiency and the grotesque imagination is perfect for anyone who obsesses over strange organisms.

In the isolated wilderness, the routine lives of some scientists finds something that they could never have anticipated. From the very earliest scenes with a helicopter shooting at a dog there is a feeling of unease and mystery that quietly festers among an oblivious crew (but who could have seen it coming)?It loses none of its power as it transitions from chiller, to science fiction masturbilia to taut thriller where you don't know who to trust.If you haven't seen it just see it.

This movie ROCKS! Somehow, \"The Thing\" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.First off, \"The Thing\" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release! In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror movies being re-made these days; I doubt that this film will ever be re-made anytime soon because it just still plays so very well.Well written, acted, & shot, \"The Thing\" is one heck of a gore fest. The graphic violence in the \"The Thing\" is just amazingly shocking, realistic, and awesome! Quick plot summary: A US research team working in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted. They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer. By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and quickly began to turn against their colleagues.Will they find WHO amongst them is a \"Thing\"? Can anyone kill this creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire civilization? Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John Carpenter's \"The Thing\".I cant recommend this movie enough! Enjoy!!",

            "content": "Comparisons to 1951's \"The Thing From Another World\" are inevitable with this film, but it's the differences that are palpable. For this viewer, the original movie had more than it's share of unintended comical moments, not always a good thing for a sci-fi/horror flick when they interrupt the flow of the story. I'm thinking in particular of a scene in the earlier film when they brought the 'Thing', encased in a block of ice, into one of the camp buildings, and then proceeded to break a window to keep the room cold!!?? There was also a goofy suggestion to use something hot to throw against the creature in order to subdue it. The best that I can say about it was that it had some witty dialog, and James Arness in an early role as the titled creature, affecting a stance that would later becomes his signature during the opening to the TV series \"Gunsmoke\".The first thing (sic) I did coming here to IMDb was to check this movie's release date compared to \"Alien\"; I wasn't sure which one came first. I would have been ready to credit \"The Thing\" with the original chest-burster concept along with the disembodied talking head that appeared in Ridley Scott's masterpiece, but it turns out \"Alien\" was first, three years earlier in 1979. I was kind of relieved about that, I've always held \"Alien\" in high regard as a monster original.But I have to say, this movie works for fans of the genre. It's a bit more detailed than it's precursor, and keeps the viewer on edge trying to guess which of the scientific crew is already infected and ready to terrorize the rest. You even begin to doubt whether Kurt Russell's character is going to come out of it unaffected, but as it turns out, there are no happy campers left by the end of the story. I thought the finale leaving MacReady and Childs (Keith David) as the lone survivors contemplating their fate to be surreally effective.The biggest surprise for me here was seeing who did the score for the picture. Ennio Morricone has supplied some of the best music ever for films in the Spaghetti Western genre and that's where I'm most familiar with his work. A quick peek at his credits here on IMDb reveals he's composed for over five hundred movies! Composing the music for \"The Thing\" might have been something of a departure from his comfort zone, but it certainly caught the terrifying mood of the story. Nicely done.",

The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from N.Y.) In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to do with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting. I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day the last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even the great \"Das Boot\".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror movies: Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're not interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV and watch this miracle of a film.

            "content": "Since the very beginning we all realize that is going to be a long and difficult winter for all the men of the research station in Antarctica. Besides the fact that must be really frustrating to be working in a station like that without your family and women, the winter looks even more difficult in part because now they can't make a communication with anybody so practically nobody will hear their screams. That cold and lonely environment is perfect for the story of this film, story of paranoia, human behaviour and unknown things. That aspect of the unknown things is brilliant, first everything starts with an unusual situation: a Norwegian helicopter is pursuing a Siberian husky, trying to kill it. Not knowing why that Norwegian went crazy shooting everywhere, the men of the station kill him and the dog stays there. And since then they start to investigate, first to know more about the Norwegian station and later to know more about a thing that was defrost. Of course thanks to their science skills they obtain great information about what was really the dog and how that thing is able to imitate other life forms. Now the paranoia begins with everybody trying to survive and not trusting in anybody. Here the best part of the film begins with that thing that could be anybody. Of course every team has a leader, here is RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) who is the helicopter pilot and definitely the smartest and the only who still can think about a possible solution, also realizing that the thing is trying to survive just like them. The last part is just great with the \"still humans\" knowing that they are not going to survive but with the hope that they can take with them the thing. In the end the only thing they can do is to wait there for a little while\u0085see what happens.\"The Thing\" was the first studio film made by Carpenter but it was released just after \"E.T.\" back in 1982 and was a theatrical failure but definitely is a terrific film with many great visual scenes; of course the ones when the thing appears are my favourites. The cast is also pretty good with Russell in his best days, just after his escape from New York and now with more hair and beard ala Morrison. The rest of the team is good too and is odd that there aren't women in the entire cast.Conclusion: \"The Thing\" is just another great film of John Carpenter that gained more audience with the video, laser-disc and DVD releases. In these days when in America there is nothing but remakes of the classics, remakes of Asian films, prequels & sequels, mixes between two films and stuff, is almost a fact that another remake of a Carpenter film is coming. Now this film is probably going to be remade and if the thing will be just like in the past years, after seeing the remake where are going to re-watch this 1982 version just to take off the bad taste in our mouths. It's true that this film is also a remake but in this case is more faithful to the original story and is just great.Region 4 DVD: Although the box doesn't say this is the single-disc collector's edition of \"The Thing\". It contains many bonus materials: the really interesting and informative 80 minutes documentary \"John Carpenter's The Thing: Terror Takes Shape\" (the only problem with this documentary is that it doesn't contain Spanish subtitles), the classic director commentary also with Kurt Russell, Production Background with the description of settings and characters, photos of the cast, Production Art and Storyboards (great concept sketches), Location Design, Production Archives, Outtakes and two scenes(frame by frame and full motion), Post Production (cool photos of the premier and posters), Production Notes, Cast and Filmmakers, Theatrical trailer.

The movie starts with a very simple concept (an alien wants to disguise itself as people) which it introduces early. The rest of the plot revolves around the crew trying to distinguish humans from imposters, and destroying the imposters. Carpenter builds suspense and paranoia right from the start, and carries it all the way through to the end.Visuals/Cinematography: Perfect. Some of the best practical special effects in any movie ever. The animatronics used for the different versions of the Thing are gory, visceral, disgusting, and stick to the mind. Combined with the dark, frozen setting of an antarctic research base, it adds to the horror/suspenseful tone.Characters: Perfect. The characters react intelligently to their situation. They don't do things without reason. They're defined by actions early on, and the character personalities fit their role. Great example is Palmer. Early on, he's shown as a lazy, pretty-unlikeable guy. Later on, when he turns out to be a thing, it's not a big deal, because he was unlikeable to start with.Dialogue: Perfect. Concise. Economical.

These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually in different genres. E.T. is \"Sci-Fi Lite\" much like Starman, Star Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a few.

It is a classic, still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing pie & cake.

One day, a dog and a group of Norwegians shows up... and thanks to poor translation skills, the Norwegian is killed. Soon after, a horrible fate in unleashed upon the American station... one by one the crew become suspects in a very heinous string of murders. Who is the killer or killers? I like many -- perhaps most -- of John Carpenter's films. The original \"Halloween\" and \"They Live\" are amazing. Pretty much the bulk of his work pleases me (with a few exceptions). And \"The Thing\" is among his best, which both fans and critics alike seem to agree on. You are working with horror, which Carpenter excels at... and you are working with isolation fighting against an outside enemy (which we have seen in \"Assault in Precinct 13\", \"Pro-Life\" and elsewhere). And we have the ideal Carpenter cast: Kurt Russell as R.J. MacReady, Wilford \"The Beetis\" Brimley as Dr. Blair and Keith David as Childs.This also brings Carpenter and Dean Cundey together again. Cundey has said, \"John and Halloween really kicked off my career.\" This was their fourth film together, but their first big studio (Universal) production. It was truly a passion project for Carpenter, who idolizes Howard Hawks. The Hawks version of \"The Thing\" appeared in \"Halloween\", \"Assault on Precinct 13\" was more or less a Hawks remake, and now he had the opportunity to tackle this. And wow, they did a bang up job, surpassing the original (though the two are different enough that they can both be appreciated in their own ways).The suspense and isolation work to bring the film to a crescendo of horror perfection. And science fiction fans will love it, too (the border between the two is danced upon quite heavily). But what really makes this film the masterpiece it is -- and what will make it never remakeable -- is the special effects. If you have read enough of my reviews, you will know my strong dislike for modern CGI effects and their \"cartoon\" quality. Here, we have a prime example of what I would rather see in a film: good, old-fashioned effects. More realistic than the cartoons and just visually stunning. I have no idea why they started doing things differently, but every film since \"Jurassic Park\" has let me down in some way. Rob Bottin is quite possibly the greatest effects master in cinema history.My one concern with this film, and it is very minor, is that the characters are not easy to keep straight sometimes. This goes away with repeated viewings, but aside from the main characters, the secondary characters just seem to blend together. One guy looks sort of like another, and trying to keep the names straight will take a little focus. Some of them do not appear on screen for more than five minutes or have more than a line or two of dialog, it seems. But what good is a killer if you do not have people to kill? Beyond that, what to say? Keith David and Kurt Russell? That does not sell you? Adrienne Barbeau as the computer voice? A dog that kills people with its tentacles? Even the Internet Movie Database seems to think this is one of the best films ever made (well within the top 200) so I am going to go so far as to recommend it to non-horror fans as well. There is just something very tight about this film.Appropriately, Scream! Factory has pulled all the stops and released the film as a double-disc Blu-ray. With a 2K scan, it looks better than ever. We have commentary tracks with Kurt Russell, John Carpenter and Dean Cundey. And plenty of interviews, both new and vintage. If there is not already a book about the making of \"The Thing\", someone could probably develop one based solely off the material on the set. It is, without a doubt, the must-have Blu-ray of 2016.",

This premise provides Carpenter with the perfect disposition to build an overwhelming sense of distrust, for anyone could possibly be 'The Thing', and Rob Bottin's make-up crew magically provides some of the most amazing creature effects that still haven't been matched to this day, making this one of the most ghastly science fiction movies ever made. Carpenter has a knack for creating music and tone that induces a feeling of uneasiness and dread, and the William Lancaster script focuses on suspense rather than dialog and characterization. The most memorable and terrifying scenes include; A dog that is actually the alien is abruptly stopped just as it is about to imitate the other dogs in the first scene where the creature shows itself, and not to forget to mention the infamous \"spider head\" scene which for many is the film's most gruesome highlight.

            "content": "'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or 'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York, Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing' came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra- Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly. There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie. He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie. The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status. The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror movies ever made. 10/10",

            "content": "The Thing is a monster movie with a twist. The monster could be the guy standing next to you. Or maybe the monster could even be you. The story unfolds at an American research outpost in Antarctica. Some crazy Norwegians show up, shooting at a dog. Before the Americans can ascertain what is going on the Norwegians are dead. Soon everyone will realize this dog is no dog at all. It's, for lack of a better term, a thing. This thing can take the appearance of other creatures it absorbs. It can become a perfect imitation of any living creature. So now how much do you trust that guy standing next to you? Paranoia overwhelms the group very quickly. This thing is, quite literally it appears, eating the group alive.Kurt Russell plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot who becomes the leader of the group as they try to stop the thing before it destroys them all. If they don't stop this thing in its tracks and it manages to make its way to civilized areas it will be the end of humankind. So some pressure on our little group then. MacReady is a take-charge kind of guy. But who's to say he's not a thing now? Certainly other members of the group have their doubts. Trust is a commodity in very short supply. Where the film fails a bit is in failing to really establish any characters beyond MacReady. A couple of them stand out because they're portrayed by actors we recognize, Wilford Brimley for example. But it's a largely faceless bunch, not a whole lot of personality in the group. And for a bunch of supposed scientists they're not the smartest group either.The movie has some decent twists and turns, leaving you guessing along with the characters as they try to determine who's still human. It's an intriguing story but it certainly would have grabbed you more if you really identified with all of the characters. As it is there are too many guys whom you really wouldn't care about should the thing make a meal of them. Characters, and the story as a whole really, too often take a backseat to the gore which director John Carpenter piles on liberally. If you're looking for a gross-out movie you'll find few better. The creature effects are very well done but maybe a little too repulsive for some people's tastes. A little more story, a little less blood and guts, probably would have served the film well. It is a very compelling story. You just wish the filmmakers trusted that story enough to allow it to carry the film. The paranoia, the mistrust, there's so much great tension there potentially. But tension loses out in the quest for gory, scary moments. In a movie such as this you want to have some good frights. But you want the scares to enhance the story, not overwhelm it. The balance in this movie is just a little bit off. It's an interesting movie but there is definitely the sense more could have been done with such a fascinating concept.",

            "content": "John Carpenters' intense, grim, shocking, and garish monster movie has transcended its poor box office performance back in 1982 to take its place as one of the great experiences of its kind, and one of the directors' finest achievements. A more faithful adaptation of the John W. Campbell, Jr. short story \"Who Goes There?\" than the 1951 Howard Hawks production \"The Thing from Another World\", it gets a lot of impact from the central conceit of the story, dropped by the makers of the Hawks movie.Here, the rampaging alien has the ability to assume the appearance of any living thing that it consumes, leading to an overwhelming sense of paranoia as the men of the story have to come to terms with the reality that they can't trust each other any more.The Antarctic setting is perfect for such a story, with our characters completely cut off from contact with civilization, isolated and forced to work to save themselves. While the story is an extremely serious one, with a tone of dread established immediately, there are memorable doses of humour at select points that provide much needed and highly amusing relief. Ennio Morricones' subtle, scary music, unfairly nominated for a Razzie at the time, is appropriate to the story. Carpenter collaborates with a first rate creative team (especially production designer John Lloyd and cinematographer Dean Cundey) who lend their considerable talents to make an incredible looking movie. Carpenter uses his standard Panavision aspect ratio of 2.35:1 to arrange people and objects within the frame to great effect. Makeup effects expert Rob Bottin creates one of the most striking monsters to be seen in the science fiction genre, displaying a delightful macabre imagination all the way through; the scenes are now indelibly etched in the minds of those that have seen them. (Stan Winstons' contribution, done as a favour in order to help Bottin with the workload, should not be overlooked.)Carpenters' frequent leading man Kurt Russell delivers a superbly understated performance as the reluctant hero MacReady, and receives rock solid supporting performances from a well chosen cast of familiar character actors - Wilford Brimley, T.K. Carter, David Clennon, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Peter Maloney, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Joel Polis, and Thomas Waites.Carpenters' somewhat slow pace - at least in the early going - allows the creepiness and sense of mystery to really take hold until the nature of the threat is finally exposed. The story devastatingly illustrates just how ugly things can get when a chain of command is broken and a group of men start to mistrust and fear each other. (It's a brave move on the part of Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster to exclude female characters, something that wouldn't fly nowadays.)No matter how badly this may have fared both critically and commercially back in 1982, its following has done nothing but grown stronger in the over 30 years since its release. It represents a great effort from everybody involved.Nine out of 10.",

            "content": "The Thing being the second John Carpenter film I've watched this week, I'm starting to notice why he's such a \"big deal\" in the film business, but I'm also realizing that his style may not be best suited for my tastes in film. The Thing is a remake of a 1951 Howard Hawks film, which in itself is based on a novella, and the film was once again remade in 2011. Ultimately, this story is widely popular. But the funny thing is, the story doesn't feel all that special or unique. The film adapts the \"whodunit\" or rather \"who is it\" movie trope that has been used for as long as films have been made. I don't have a problem with that, but I do have a problem with this film feeling like a rip-off to Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien film. Right down to the chest bursting scene.Some people may say that the original novella probably influenced Scott in making Alien, which may be true. But then why not change up a few plot points and shot selections instead of feeling overtly derivative from a film that is only a few years old. It also doesn't help that for all the blood, guts, jumps, and scares, we don't really get a look inside the minds of any of these characters. None of them are memorable, even Kurt Russell's flame throwing bearded helicopter pilot. Heck, we never even see the guy fly a helicopter.I hate to keep bringing up Alien, so I'll compare the recent movie, Life. That film doesn't have anything new to add to the genre of \"trapped-in-horror-thriller\", but it consistently entertains you because you get to know each character and you care about them. The Thing's cast consists of a dozen or so men ranging from 30-65, and I don't remember any of their names or backstories. Why? Because the movie didn't take the time to establish either.The Thing does do quite a few things well, though. The practical special effects are mind-blowing for a film from the early-80's. I would love to see some of the behind the scenes featurettes and how they were able to pull off some of the shots. If only the film didn't make me cringe every few minutes with its gratuitous blood spatters and gut bursting shots. The Thing also did a nice job at pacing out the deaths and jump scares where it didn't feel too overpowering at any one point but it also never got to the point of boredom either. Not to mention Ennio Morricone's haunting main theme that plays throughout the film. That will surely send chills down anyone's spine. So overall, The Thing is another Carpenter film to get a mixed response from me. He's a good filmmaker, but I highly doubt I will ever sit down a re-watch his films as religiously as some film fans do. Perhaps I'd like Howard Hawks version better.+Score+Effects-No character depth-Feels derivative6.4/10",

From its insane all-out practical effects to Russell's stellar performance, there is absolutely nothing to not love about this film. The cinematography is incredible, and the setting provides a perfect background for the claustrophobic events that happen on screen. Kurt Russell is fantastic as always as the films obvious standout, as well as the rest of the stellar supporting cast- especially Keith David. The special effects are glorious and a pure example of why many Horror films lack the scares and timelessness that films like this do- and honestly prove to hold up better than the already dated CGI effects from the 2011 version. As I said before, Carpenter and Producer Debra Hill are at the top of their game in this one and are able to craft a story that is not only endlessly fun to watch and see unfold but endlessly suspenseful and emotional to watch as well. In my book, it's the best horror film ever made, and I honestly could never get tired of watching it.My Rating: 10/10.",

            "content": "It had been quite some years since I had last seen this movie and the earlier brilliant and fresh movie version \"The Thing from Another World\" from 1951 was more fresh on my mind. I think I can say that \"The Thing\" is actually even a better movie. It's a great horror with a touch of science-fiction.To put it boldly, this movie is like \"Alien\", only set at the Antarctic. It has the same sort of atmosphere, build up, look and of course a killer alien on the loose. However this is not an \"Alien\" clone. The movie is just too good for that to call it one.I think I can say that this is one of the most paranoid movies ever made. It's actually quite easy to make a good and effective horror movie once you know to create a certain level of paranoia into the movie. In this movie you just never known who the alien is, which makes you very uncertain of things and makes you literally trust no one or his motivations throughout the movie. With this given element the movie knows to build up a great tension and atmosphere for the movie. It's horror elements mostly gets feed from these elements and it's what makes \"The Thing\" such a superior and classic movie within its genre.You really have to give John Carpenter credit for this movie. He has done lots of classic horror movies throughout his career but this one perhaps is his most brilliant one. He builds up the movie extremely well and very effectively. What also helps with this are Ennio Morricone's moody musical score (while normally Carpenter composes the music himself for all of his movies) and the camera-work from later Oscar-nominee Dean Cundey. Why doesn't he do horror movies anymore? Now days he mostly makes bright looking, happy movies, while in the past he did the camera-work for some fine and classic horror flicks, including \"The Fog\" and \"Halloween\", which also got directed by John Carpenter.It's also a quite gory movie to watch. The still at the time very young Rob Bottin did a very good job with all of its make-up effects. Some truly gory and unexpected things are happening throughout this movie, so know what to expect.It also knows to remain a realistic movie throughout, even though it of course doesn't feature a very likely main plot. It's because of its directing handling, acting and its writing that the movie works out that way.The movie doesn't feature many characters and also no big names playing them, except for Kurt Russell of course. This also keeps the movie realistic and keeps all characters on the same level. It helps for the atmosphere of the movie, since you also don't know who is going to die next and where and how. It increases also the overall paranoid feeling of the movie.A brilliant classic atmospheric genre-piece!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "review_title": "Proof that once upon a time John Carpenter was a fine filmmaker (spoilers)",
            "content": "When I first watched it, I wasn't terribly impressed by The Thing. I can't recall precisely what I didn't like about it, that first viewing being maybe a decade or so ago, but I seem to remember finding it a little confusing and I can remember not being a fan of the special effects (some would consider that last statement heresy). But watching it a second time, I enjoyed it immensely. I wouldn't place it at the top of the genre like some people would, but it wouldn't be far off.First things first, I appreciated the special effects a lot more this time round. I think the problem when I first watched it was just how bizarre it all was. Tentacles? Bloody flower guts? Giant snapping mouths? Maybe I found it hard to suspend my disbelief, or perhaps I found it repulsive \u0096 I don't mind gore in horror films, but I'm not a fan of what I'd call 'gloop' (for some reason I can happily watch limbs get blown and sawn off, or see people get shot, stabbed and eaten, but my sick trigger is sensitive to 'gloopy' film monsters \u0096 I love David Cronenberg's version of The Fly, even though it does make my stomach turn in a couple of places, but I do actually come close to gagging watching The Fly II, and not just because it's cinematic manure). So perhaps I didn't appreciate the special effects for those reasons. But they're actually pretty great. One of the best bits has to be when an imitation human head sprouts a tentacle from its mouth and pulls itself along \u0096 and earlier on when the head begins to detach itself from its body. It's nasty and unpleasant and great to watch. And then there's the bit when Palmer's face rips apart and a giant alien mouth sprouts and bites a guy in the head. Neat. (And to make it even better, the man who's getting bitten is shaken from side to side, and in a couple of shots it's obviously a dummy\u0085which is amusing.) But not all the special effects work is great. Although I love the head being ripped off and I love it when it shoots a tentacle from its mouth, it does look silly rather than disturbing when it sprouts antennae and spidery legs. There's a fine line between great and crap. And the bit at the end isn't particularly impressive either \u0096 the bit where we see huge tentacles and a massive monster. It's overkill and the effects don't match what has come before.Much better than all the big stuff are the little bits. Right at the end, right before the silly tentacle business and the unconvincing alien dog, is a bit where Garry encounters an assimilated Blair and Blair sticks his hand in his head. It's brilliantly done. And then after that you see Blair dragging Garry along by his face. Again it's sick and nasty, but in a much more believable way.However, it's not the monster that makes The Thing such an enjoyable film, it's the confusion and the paranoia that its presence generates in the humans (I guess when I first watched it as a kid I didn't realise that confusion was the point). After all, seeing as The Thing is a shape-shifter, and it can take on any form, everyone's a suspect.This climate of paranoia and suspicion is best illustrated in the scene where MacReady (Kurt Russell) ties the surviving scientists and workers to chairs so that he can check their blood to see who's human and who's not. The scene really is tense, as you haven't got a clue who's been assimilated and who hasn't. You're not even sure if MacReady is who he says he is, as even he's been built up as a suspect. But it literally could be anybody and the scene's a powder keg.Another great scene is when MacReady declares that he knows for certain he's human and the camera slowly pans across the rest of the group. Do we believe him, and who among the group isn't what he says he is? As well as the scenes of tension, I love the creepy moments too (they're often a lot better than the 'scary' bits). My favourite is when a half assimilated Bennings is caught trying to escape the camp (he's almost a perfect copy but his hands are deformed) and he lets off an eerie howl before he's burnt to a crisp (there's a lot of torching in the film\u0085which I love!). And there's also the bit where MacReady visits Blair, who's been locked in the tool shed. MacReady opens a slit and Blair's sitting there by a noose while eating cans of food. He then begs to be let out. He insists that he's much better. It's a superb scene. And as simple as they are, I love all the lingering shots of the dog. It's a creepy mutt, I tell you. It's got a thousand yard stare.Also rather creepy is the ending. After all the pyrotechnics, MacReady thinks he's the sole survivor, only Childs shows up. His explanation is that he got lost in the snow. There's a bit of an awkward conversation, and even though Mac kind of knows that it isn't the real Childs, he's become tired and resigned to his fate and shares a smoke. It's an ending that, in the best way, keeps you wondering.And on a final note, I must say how much I enjoy Mac's snow-sombrero and his bad geography. \"Hey Sweden!\" he shouts when he visits a Norwegian camp. The film's funny, too, and intentionally so.",

Of course this was a very bad mistake; one which will cost many lives. The dog wasn't actually a dog; it had been taken over entirely by an alien creature at a cellular level; an alien that isn't content to take the form of a mere dog! When the people realise what they are up against paranoia sets in; anybody could be alien and nobody trusts anybody else. Each time they thing of a way to identify or beat the creature it is thwarted and eventually they realise if they are to prevent it getting off Antarctica and infecting everybody on the planet they may all need to die.This is a classic horror where a group of people are trapped in a confined area with no means of communication or escape to the outside world. In the respect it reminded me of the superior 'Alien' although the way the alien here could mimic its victims increased the sense of paranoia. The effects looked pretty good and were delightfully grotesque in a way that could only be achieved with models and make-up rather that the CGI that would inevitable be used today.

The movie is set in a place where everything is about the same colour palette (even the buildings) and I think when characters are on screen or the thing or fire which is commonly used it makes all that pop out a lot creating a really unique visual look. Again seeing the cast go against one another in a high tension kind of mystery thriller where even the audience is unsure of who the thing is at times is great for the story and makes everything more effective! You really get into the shoes of the characters in the story as you feel what they feel and are constantly on edge and guessing. It has psychological elements in the movie which I always love in movies, I'd say it thrives more off that element and creating a guessing game which is insanely tense instead of showing the monster all the time and it definitely succeeds.

Of course it was ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that makes it a classic. Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha Christie \"who dunnit\" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien. Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses until the final showdown.After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making production the special effects in \"the Thing\" don't carry the same weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all round with some great performances by the cast.",

            "content": "The Thing is regarded to be one of the best horror movies of all time, and I can see why. It has the intensity, the uncertainty, and the atmosphere. I love The Thing as a horror movie so much because it doesn't use the classic jump scare technique to scare it's audience. In fact, The Thing is more intense than actually scary, and in my opinion, it's better that way.The plot is so clever and unique for it's time. The Thing is about an alien who imitates organisms by consuming it. This plot is so perfect for creating an intense and uncertain atmosphere. The screenplay is one of the smartest horror screenplays of all time. The screenplay purposefully focuses on MacReady and no else. By doing this technique, it makes all of the characters suspicious, even MacReady at times. There is one issue with not focusing on all of other the characters; it's very hard to know who's who, but by the third act it narrows down and gets less confusing.One of the most important aspects of a horror movie is its setting. The Thing takes place in Antarctica, which is one of the first horrors to take place in such a setting. The Thing uses Antarctica as a setting not just because it adds in isolation, but it's necessary for the plot. The thing (alien) wants to be frozen for it to live on; so the setting is actually important for the plot, instead of it being added in just because Antarctica is scary.The special effects are masterfully done too. Since The Thing was released in 1982, there has to be practical effects. The Thing uses practical effects in such a smart way that it actually makes it scarier than CGI. The special effects were truly ahead of it's time, and it's really sad that there was only one nomination for the special effects.The Thing was truly ahead of it's time. It's brilliantly filmed, the special are perfect, and the screenplay is smart. The Thing is one of the most intense movies I have ever seen, and maybe one of the scariest. The Thing will go down in history as John Carpenter's best movie and one of the most legendary horrors of all time.",

            "content": "You know what I appreciate most about this film? The title. There are hundreds, if not thousands of movies out there about foreign creatures and a lot of them have the name of said creature in the title: Gremlins, Ghoulies, Critters, Alien, Leprechauns, Pumpkinhead, etc. This movie kept it--as they say--100 (or as we said when I was young, \"real\"). They didn't know what it was and I know that when I don't know what something is, it's a \"thing\".The movie was as good as the title. This was a quality production for 1982 and one harrowing situation. Imagine being stuck in Antarctica, nothing but ice and polar bears around for hundreds of miles, incommunicado with the rest of civilization, a deadly storm brewing, and a creature in your midst that consumes its host and assumes its identity. I, for one, would be scared to death. If it weren't for everyone else having the same fears I'd have thought that cabin fever had set in and was causing me to be paranoid.\"The Thing\" played out exactly how it should have. There was rampant fear and distrust with everyone ready to take the life of his mate at any moment. The few times this thing showed itself it was a thing of nightmares and again I have to say that it was good special effects for the 80's. I never saw this movie as a kid, thank God, but seeing it today I know I would've been spooked watching this.",

            "content": "Unfortunately I spend much of my time berating John Carpenter in regards to his recent lazy and mediocre efforts. What a refreshing change it is to relive his earlier  seminal work and remember just why he once had a reputation as one of America's most exciting and inventive film makers! 'The Thing' is quite possible the best movie Carpenter has ever made, and sadly it seems, ever will make. He is at the height of his powers with this dark, tense and claustrophobic thriller, and is blessed with a superb ensemble cast, and (a rarity for him these days) a decent script will believable, fully rounded characters. Kurt Russell gives his best work for Carpenter here, in arguably his strongest performance to date. The supporting cast is flawless, and includes fine character actors such as Wilford Brimley ('Cocoon'), Keith David ('Dead Presidents'), Richard Dysart ('Being There'), Richard Masur ('Who'll Stop The Rain)', and Donald Moffat ('The Right Stuff'). I highly recommend the DVD version of this movie which features one of the most entertaining and informative commentaries I've ever heard. (from Carpenter and Russell) Much maligned when it was first released, 'The Thing' now looks like a masterpiece of paranoid science fiction, one of the very few remakes that surpasses the original version, and absolutely essential viewing for any self respecting horror or SF fan. It really doesn't get much better than this! Highly recommended!",

            "content": "The critical response to THE THING was par for the course: having been brainwashed by kiddie corn like E.T., they could hardly be expected to view objectively what has turned out to be a timeless masterpiece. From an opening evocative of any of a number of 50's sci-fi schlockers (not to mention the closing moments of Carpenter's DARK STAR, itself) to an ambiguous though not unsatisfying ending, it's clear that this masterfully macabre monsterpiece is a bona fide tour de force- a coup de grace, par excellence.The 50's version, which plays out more like the James Whale FRANKENSTEIN, pales by comparison. Carpenter is a meticulous craftsman (he has contemporaries, but no peer) and, for those of us who like our flights of fancy tempered with a bit of storytelling, he does not disappoint: by simply returning to the source material and notching up the suspense in his patented manner, he and scenarist Bill Lancaster have fashioned a claustrophobic chiller that plays the e-t incognito exactly the way it should've been played the first time around. The players, to a man, are excellent. Carpenter's overriding concern is clearly this band of enjoyably eccentric misfits and their reactions to the malevolent monster in their midst. He navigates the tight rope between fantasy and reality like an expert. (Which he is: this is his frightening forte.) The \"thing\" itself is truly the stuff of which nightmares are made: the movie showcases, without catering to, some marvelous mechanical makeup effects by master monster maker Rob Bottin. Under Carpenter's artistic aegis, these effects are utilized as dramatically as possible. If there's another candidate in the running for greatest monster movie of all time, I haven't seen it. Nothing else comes close.",

            "review_title": "A mess and a travesty of the 1951 classic",
            "content": "There is a good reason why the 1951 The Thing is a classic. Howard Hawks influence is obvious and it packs the excitement, bravado and camaraderie that he brought to his westerns. It introduces us to a variety of characters that are amiable and sympathetic, and balances that with the conflict that erupts between the scientists and military in dealing with the alien threat that confronts them.Looking for anything of similar depth or entertainment value in John Carpenter's woebegone remake is pointless because it simply does not exist. This film adheres a bit more closely to the source novella by John W. Campbell Jr. Carpenter's version adopts an Invasion of the Body Snatchers mentality, wherein a creature \"infects\" others and takes on their appearances to move about at will. It is an interesting concept, but it becomes apparent that the sole interest Carpenter has is in crafting progressively gorier and grotesque effects to gross-out the viewer.The film keeps the same setting in Antarctica and opens with some Norwegians attempting to kill a sled dog. The chase intersects with a group of Americans at a neighboring research facility, who think the Norwegians are crazy. When the dog is sheltered in the American facility, it is revealed to be The Thing of the title. The remainder of the film is basically a guessing game as to who is really human and who has become an assimilation of The Thing.The storyline sounds infinitely more exciting than it plays out. Carpenter has little to no interest in the characters populating his thriller. There are no women at the base and the men have little to no discernible personalities. There is not a role that is not filled by a capable actor, but no one manages to make much of an impression. Even lead Kurt Russell - doing another one of his lamentable John Wayne imitations - just blends into the bland background of bottled testosterone. Unlike Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where it seemed a distinct tragedy that the central characters were being turned into cold, unfeeling beings, the characters in this film are already relatively emotionless and so we feel no tragedy over their assimilation.It is easy to understand why Carpenter has no interest in plot, character development, or even building genuine suspense, his attention is too focused on the next special effects/make-up freak show extravaganza. All of the imagination seems to have been funneled into the next gore scene. The initial scene where The Thing departs its guise of the sled dog and launches an attack on the other dogs in the kennel is revolting on more levels than one can care to count. The dog's head splits open and the tentacled creature goes on a bloody rampage assimilating animals all around into a giant writhing wall of quivering flesh and fur that splits open in various spots to reveal writhing bloody innards. Animal lovers be forewarned. Full disclosure, when I initially attempted to watch this film (and being a fan of the 1951 original) I actually walked out of the theater shortly after this sequence. Several years later, I decided to give the film another chance and made it all the way through to the end.Later sequences are just as repellent. Body parts fly to and fro, chests are crushed, arms are bitten off, limbs take on lives of their own and try to skitter away. Again, lots of imagination, but it would have been far more impressive if Carpenter had channeled this initiative into more substantial areas of his epic. At the time, this depiction was a bit of a surprise coming from Carpenter, whose thrillers had heretofore largely eschewed graphic violence. Here, he makes up for it a hundred fold.Gradually the men are wittled away. Unfortunately, no one cares. There is no sense of urgency or concern for any of these people. They are all unknowable ciphers and easily interchangeable. We truly cannot tell who The Thing has infected less because of its diabolical nature than because the men are all written and played as colorless cookie-cutter tough guys from the average grade-C action film. Carpenter seems to have no idea how people would genuinely act in such a tense situation and there is no camaraderie amongst the men at all. None of them seem to be friends or work well together - they are a gaggle of lone wolf Marlboro Men braving the great unknown. Despite being isolated together and living in close quarters for months, none of them seem to know even the most minor of things about each other.The vague, ambiguous ending with two of the characters resting amongst the carnage, sharing a drink and trying to ascertain if the other one is human or The Thing is exceptionally vacuous. For one thing, knowing that The Thing propagates itself through body fluids, why in the world would the two men chance sharing a drink from the same bottle? Then again, do we really care about either of these guys? The answer would be a resounding no.Interestingly, the film has developed a cult following and fanatics talk about it like it is some sort of a classic. Unfortunately, nothing could have been further from the truth. At the time of release the film was a major box office disappointment and the majority of critical reviews were scathing. In fact, the only people who really seem to consider this some lost classic are gore hounds who think bloodletting should trump storytelling.",

John Carpenter's best movie in my opinion! Some people don't like this movie I don't know why I love this movie to death! To me it is better than Halloween (1978) that movie get's all the praise but The Thing get's hate from harsh critics and reviewers on IMDb. I don't get the hate because I love this film to death. The Thing is the third ultimate John Carpenter / Kurt Russell collaboration between two working together. One of the best monster horror movies I have ever seen of the 80's. It is in my top 10 favorite horror movies of all time. I Love the great 80s classic horror movies and The Thing, it is a great classic sci fi horror movie by John Carpenter with Prince of Darkness.The Thing is a remake of the 1951 movie The Thing from Another World which this remake to me is much way better, more atmospheric and creepy than the original. Kurt Russell's best performance ever, he looks great and very clear on blu ray in HD with a great cinematography worth getting for any horror fan. I love it, I love this movie to death. The movie begins in Antarctica during winter 1982 in the opening scene we see two Norwegian pilots hunting a sled dog in the helicopter. They land in American research station and Norwegian accidentally throws a grande and blows up his helicopter. Than Norwegian fires with his rifle and shouts at the Americans, they don't undestand what is he saying, later he is killed in self defence by Garry (Donald Moffat). When researchers invevestigate what happened they discover an alien burried under the snow over 100.000 years. The sled dog they bring in the station, turns in to shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of the dogs and the group is firing with the rifles at the thing, Childs (Keith David) one of the members torchers the monster with flamethrower. It turns out that there are more shape-shifting aliens out there in the base and they assume appearance of the men. Now group has to fight for their survival. No one trust anyone anymore. They have to figure it who is human and who is not a human and a shape-shifting alien, while The Thing keep killing researchers one by one and wreak havoc terror.I love this movie to death, I love the FX and special effects for the Alien thing. Creature effects were degined by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston was brought in to help complete the effect. It was operated on a raised set with puppeteers working below. Stan Winston worked on Aliens (1986) creature effects and desigen and Leviathan (1989). I love the custom and great effects for the creature it is not dated people who are saying those harsh things about this movie I disagree with them! The effects hold up great nowdays for this movie! Visuals and lighting, the story, the idea are great and they are briliant! This movie is great till its day, I am glad the The Thing get's fanbase. John Carpenter's favorite horror movie of mine from the 80's an end of days on an apocalyptic way. Prince of Darkness is my number one Carpenter movie this is my second favorite one I just love this movie to death, it is amazing!The cast everyone in this movie is great: I love R.J. MacReady played by Russell him self it is my favorite character. It is a bad-ass character. Clark played by Richard Masur I love him because he love dogs, I am a dog lover my self. When MacReady fiers at the dog and kills him Clark shouts NO and he stopps MacReady. He love dogs and I respect him so much. Childs played by Keith David was awesome, he reunited in 1989 with John Carpenter in movie They Live. Windows played by Thomas G. Waites I love Windows he was great. I love Garry played by Donald Moffat with a gun he was excellent. Nauls played by T.K. Carter was great I love the cast evan Norwegian actors are great. Great music score by Ennio Morricone who wrote several music scores for the movie. Carpenter loved his music score.This movie come out three years later after the realese of Alien (1979) and in my opinion The Thing is better than Alien (1979). That movie is overrated but it is a classic and it is great. But just like fans are saying that Alien is a masterpiece, well The Thing deserves to be called a masterpiece too. I love the script for this movie writen by Bill Lancaster. Great dialogue and great lines.This movie belongs with Aliens (1986) that I just love to death I love this two movies and it is one of my personal favorite horror films. The Thing is a classic masterpiece by a horror master John Carpenter. I recommend this movie to any horror fan.",

            "content": "John Carpenter's The Thing is in my opinion the Greatest horror film ever made. A brilliant mixture of great direction,acting,special effects,score and screenplay making this a all time classic horror film. This is Carpenter's greatest film and It's not only my all time favorite Horror film it's one of my favorite films of all time period.The Thing tells the story of 12 researchers in a u.s outpost in Antarctica with nothing really happening until the researchers discover that an alien that came to earth years before is stalking them and killing them and imitating them. Which raises the question:Who can you trust?Released in the Summer of 1982,John Carpenter's The Thing came out at a bad time having been released three weeks after Director Steven Spielberg's Blockbuster E.T. The Extra Terrestrial a much lighter take on Alien life and The Thing was ignored by audiences and hated by critics. Thankfully,The Thing has become a Cult Film and is now considered a classic and one of the best Horror films of all-time and the praise is rightfully deserved. The Thing is a film I love for many reasons because it brilliantly works as Horror film and Remake. One of the reasons I love the film besides the direction and special effects is the paranoia aspect of the film and when the characters stop trusting each other and start wondering who's human and who's not and Carpenter creates a dark end of the world feeling where the end will come from either aliens or man's own disturbing self destruction. The film is scary and frightening not just because of the effects and atmosphere but because of the characters and how they react when the alien invasion happens. It's very believable,scary and gives the film it's edge. This film was released before AIDS and HIV was more known around the world and Carpenter's film could be a metaphor. Even though The Thing is a Horror film,the issues and themes of fear,paranoia and distrust is still relevant in today's world.The screenplay by Bill Lancaster is superb and well-written giving the film and characters great lines and dialog. We don't know much about the characters and who they are but,we know them well enough to feel sorry for them and don't paint the characters as faceless victims. The snow and cold adds to the dark and frightening claustrophobic feel of the film and you feel isolated like the films characters where you feel that there's no where to go and no salvation for the men. The only film that can match the chilling and dark atmosphere is Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Both films in my opinion are the two of the most terrifying films ever set in the winter and make me never,ever want to stay in a house or a hotel by myself in the snow. The Thing also succeeds as a remake and one of the rare occasions where the remake was different and better than the original.Where in Howard Hawks The Thing From Another World the alien was a big and large Frankenstein-like creature,The Thing in this film looks different every time it transforms so the alien can look and different and sound different each time and it's very inventive and terrifying. The Thing was the first in Carpenter's great apocalypse trilogy which also includes other Carpenter classics Prince Of Darkness and In The Mouth Of Madness. While none of these three films have nothing in common in terms of story lines or characters the thing they all have in common is the concept about the end of the world. The Thing is my favorite and the best of the trilogy because of the storyline themes,characters and great ending which has been discussed for many years. The Thing also moves at a fast pace and never slows down until the very end. The violence and gore in the film are intense and brutal truly match the horrifying tone of the film and the violence happens you as the viewer will feel it and will be disturbed. The ending of The Thing is uncompromising,dark and will have viewers talking about the ending for years,leaving you with many unanswered questions than easy answers and wouldn't fly in today's Hollywood and it's one of my all time favorite movie endings and one of the reasons the film is truly brilliant and why I love The Thing. The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Kurt Russell is excellent as R.J MacReady,the man who becomes the leader when things fall apart. A.Wilford Brimley is great as Dr Blair the doctor who goes crazy. Keith David is wonderful as Childs and is tough as nails. Donald Moffat is effective as Garry bringing depth and sympathy to the role. T.K Carter is great as Nauls and brings some humor to the film. Richard Dysart(Dr.Copper),David Clennon(Palmer),Richard Masur(Clark),Charles Hallahan(Norris),Thomas Waites(Windows),Joel Polis(Fuchs)and Peter Maloney(Bennings)give great performances as well.The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant because Carpenter is always moving the camera giving the film a since of dread,eeriness and doom of not knowing what's going to happen or where. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by Ennio Morricone is frightening and scary and matches the dark,grim tone of the film. One of Morricone's best scores.The special effects by Rob Bottin are excellent some of the most ingenious,bloody,gory imaginative effects in film history. Shocking,surprising and unexpected,Bottin's effects set the standard for make-up effects still hold up years later.In final word,John Carpenter's The Thing is a flawless Horror classic that is amazing from beginning to end and is a film that belongs in every Horror fan and movie buffs collection and is John Carpenter's greatest film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

The team soon realises that an alien life-form with the ability to take over other bodies is on the loose and they don't know who may already have been taken over.....It seemed in the eighties, well the majority of the decade, Carpenter made a career defining movie, every time he made a movie, especially if it starred Kurtz Russell.He changed the face of horror for over twenty years with Halloween, Changed the attitude of Science Fiction with Escape from New York, BTILC, They Live, and this, probably his greatest film of the eighties.And it's great because its so simple, it's tense because you put yourself in their situation, in the middle of nowhere,with literally nowhere to go or to hide, and not being able to trust anyone.And that's the premise, it could be any film, any genre, any setting, but the fact that its in the middle of the coldest place on earth, and the inclusion of a body morphing alien, that generates the terror, and it generates it in droves.Before anything happens alien wise, there is still an air of tension between the crew, after all they are confined to the setting, so they must get tired of each other from time to time.And then the dog arrives.After that, it just goes bonkers, and even almost thirty five years after its initial release, those special effects are still amazing, oh to see this on its initial release must have been something else.The cast are brilliant, Russell appears and acts a lot advanced in his years, and the film keeps you guessing until the end.If you do enough research, one of the survivors isn't as he seems during the final reel, and it makes it all the more chilling.Groundbreaking stuff.",

            "review_title": "A textbook example of suspense and horror",
            "content": "Much as Star Trek: Nemesis was released terminally close to The Two Towers and fell well below box office expectations, Universal chose to try and kill the then-rising star director John Carpenter's career by releasing The Thing a mere two weeks after a little feel-good piece called E.T. It is somewhat funny, the spin history can put on things, because now as a Lucas-like special edition has failed to reinvigorate interest in the family-friendly box office hit, The Thing has found a new life as a cult piece. This is not to put down Spielberg's career-building piece, as it is a well-made film in its own right. But years after I have forgotten Spielberg's effort, and dismissed it after he tried to make even more suitable only for infants, I still remember the mood it put me in, the first time I saw The Thing, and watched as the creepiest score I have heard in at least a thousand films played over elegantly understated credits. Put simply, The Thing should be shown to film-making students as an example of how you build suspense.The film starts out innocently enough, with what appears to be a husky running from a helicopter as a (lousy) sharpshooter tries to kill it. Running and flying into an American research station, the husky tries to bond with the present staff as the sharpshooter emerges and tries to warn them in broken-sounding Norwegian. As the helicopter is accidentally destroyed and the sharpshooter shot dead, the husky works its way into the confidence of the camp, eventually placed in the kennel at the insistence of one of its edgier residents. The new husky soon reveals itself to be an alien creature, not that this is any surprise to the audience. As the alien absorbs the other huskies, the men at the research centre are fortunate enough to get to it before it finishes. Whether one of them has already been absorbed before two of them pay a visit to the station the Norwegians came from is a matter of debate, but things take a definite turn for the worse when they bring back some artifacts from the site.Screenwriters like Ehren Kruger could learn a lot from The Thing. Although the scenario itself is incredibly harrowing, especially when you consider what could happen if the chameleon found its way into civilisation, its the details that make the story what it is. One of the men, considering the what could happen question, destroys every means the team has to call for help or leave, cutting them off completely. While most of the others do nothing quite so dramatic, their anatognism towards one another makes scenes that would normally be test patterns into something that may make viewers bite their nails. In contrast to the The Thing From Another World, this tension comes from the important fact that destroying the evil alien is almost secondary to identifying it. And in one of those happy coincidences, the scene where our hero does learn to identify the alien is far from the end of the tension. In point of fact, the scene in which he administers the test to identify who has been absored is unequalled in American film when it comes to tension. I still leap out of my seat in the quick shot where the \"infected\" blood sample is tested.Although it is generally bad for a film to rely on its special effects, both the story and said effects are top of the line here. The Thing was the eighth film on which Rob Bottin provided special makeup effects, and is among the films cited when his godlike reputation in the field is discussed. Regardless of whether one considers makeup effects an extension of special effects or otherwise, both can be summed up as an art where the goal is to fool people into believing they are seeing something they're not. I doubt that anyone is going to believe they are seeing an alien organism of any kind until it becomes commonplace, but like the acting, writing, and music, Bottin's artwork is a wall in a tense atmosphere that dares the viewer to look away. As in all the best films that ask the viewer to accept unreal elements, The Thing does this the right way, by suspending disbelief in graduating steps. By the time the most outrageous unrealities are unleashed upon us, we have been so drawn into the world of the story that there is no going back. It never ceases to amaze me how much the filmmakers of the 1980s could get away with in terms of stretching reality compared to their present-day cousins.This would be (at least) the third of many collaborations between Kurt Russell and John Carpenter. The two never work better than when they work together. Russell has shown a number of different modes under Carpenter's direction, from the loud arrogance of Big Trouble In Little China to the hoarse understatement of Escape From New York. In The Thing, Russell starts at the latter end of his acting spectrum and ends a couple of steps toward the former. Not that Russell is the most versatile actor in the world, but this film calls for an everyday man type, and Russell more than fits the bill. The audio commentary recorded for the Laserdisc goes into the less than noble motivations the men have for being at the research station, and Russell is best among this cast at giving the viewer a character they can see the events through the eyes of. Not that the rest of the cast let the side down in any way. Everyone from Wilford Brimley to David Clennon gives their character all three dimensions, and the story benefits enourmously from it.I gave The Thing a ten out of ten. In a season of remakes for the sake of remakes, see this for an example of a remake done right.",

It makes No sense as to why he's not cast? I mean he was good friends with John Carpenter at the time he had just starred in carpenters The Fog (1980) & Escape from New York (1981) & Tom said in an interview that he had discussed how much he loved the 50's original film & so did carpenter, so they talked about the movie & John must've known how excited Tom would have been to be apart of it & yet he cast every other guy but him? Makes No sense & Tom Atkins would have lifted the movie even more in quality, he would have been the best in it!!! Anyway that was a huge missed opportunity.The cast is an ensemble cast of know the face actors & Carpenter regulars, i love the paranoid mood of the movie & the thick Atmosphere of dread that hangs over the film, this is one of Carpenters best films!!!I used to watch this on video & absolutely loved everything about it & i still do!!! \"The Thing\" yes it's a classic gory horror film & many class this as Carpenters masterpiece, my personal fave carpenter movie is \"THE FOG (1980)\" but i can see why many love this great movie, it's in my top 5 of Carpenters films & in my all time favourite top 20 films list.The always great Kurt Russell (a childhood hero of mine) gives an iconic performance & has created another Classic character as he did in other John Carpenter films such as \"Escape from New York\" & \"Big Trouble in little China\" as we know Carpenter & kurt work perfectly together.Kurt Russell is awesome,cool & iconic as \"Mcready\" & the location is isolated & scary & like i said the fx are amazing so much better than the silly cheap looking c.g.i today!!!The Thing is a Horror CLASSIC.I love John Carpenter films & i consider him my favourite Director.All in all this 1982 sci-fi Horror is a Classic of it's genre & is one of Carpenters best films!!!Check out the equally excellent \"The Thing\" 2011 prequel, it's just as great & surprisingly still very atmospheric & exciting.",

Unlike with The Shining, The Thing isn't bogged down by unlikable characters and scenes which don't advance the story in important ways. Kurt Russel always seems to be a huge presence in his films. His likability always makes the movie itself more likable. The whole cast deliver convincing performances. This movie doesn't hold back on gore and suspense. The paranoia is real as everyone is suspicious of each other not being human. The need for a strong leader arises and Kurt Russel's character is the obvious man for the job. Even so, the fear and lack of trust creates tension between the characters and apprehension in the viewer. This alien monster puts an abundance of blood, slime and grisly images on display. So much so that the initial shock factor proved to be a bit too much for its viewers in 1982. Even all these years later, the special effects hold up well. This movie has a lot going for it. I believe it will only continue to age well as a classic science fiction horror film.",

            "content": "Very few horror films remain locked under cult favourite status while at the same time being hailed by critics and widespread audiences as possibly the greatest horror film of all time.While it has been pointed out by movie legends such as George Romero and Stephen King that people love being scared by a good horror movie, it is not specifically the case with majority audiences. Films such as The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween may be classed as the best of all time, they have also proved too much for the mainstream, who like their horror slightly more psychological, less physical and most often promising a happy ending.This may explain why master filmmaker John Carpenter's 1982 powerhouse science-fiction horror 'The Thing' did so poorly at the cinema box office, besides the unfortunate fact that the darling of Hollywood, Steven Spielberg, had released E.T: The Extra Terrestrial at the same time.The film is cold, dark, uncompromising, you can cut the paranoid and petrified atmosphere with a knife, but you'd do better to incinerate it with a flamethrower just to feel that little bit safer before you go to bed. There are no warm and endearing characters to care for, every moment this mysterious but absurdly terrifying Thing from another world strikes, you are left with goosebumps, your imagination running scared and out of control and in the end... have you made up your mind how the end will come? An American Scientific Research base isolated in the Antarctic finds itself witness to an incident where the members of a not too distant Norwegian base have seemingly gone mad. The Norwegians are killed in regrettable circumstances. leaving no answers as to their actions leaving chronically drunk and depressed helicopter pilot MacReady with no choice but to fly a couple of the concerned scientists over to the Norwegian base where they discover a horrific aftermath of grisly death and destruction. The remains of a mutated and seemingly inhuman corpse is found within the cinders of a burned out bonfire and very quickly the tone is set and the scientists' reality turned upside down.Aliens are amongst us! Very quickly, shock and disgust turn to fear, fear gives birth to anger and paranoia sets in deep as the remaining life-form next targets the American base and secretly multiplies within their ranks in the hopes of outnumbering the remaining humans before it is discovered and destroyed.Hopes of containing the alien life-form, before it is discovered that it is not only an intelligent life-form but also a very contagious one, fade very quickly as the whiskey and sleep deprived R.J. MacReady - played with literal ice cold awesomeness by the one and only Kurt Russell - and the few men he feels he can trust begin to fall apart under the strain of fear and isolation, setting themselves apart from those they feel will only lessen their chances of survival.As time grows short and the numbers die off, it becomes clear that nobody can be trusted and the only way of stopping this nightmare is by effectively ending their very own chances of survival.Carpenter writes possibly his best ever script, the scenes setting the way for a nightmarish Cold War paranoia tale where the fate of the world could very well be put at risk by the fears of a handful of men. There is nowhere to run and hide. Outside, Antarctic Winter is setting in and deadly sub-zero temperatures make it impossible to escape. Where safety in numbers ought to make a man feel safe, the danger is multiplied and to sit alone in the dark is practically suicide. The dog pound is a slaughterhouse, the medical bay is contaminated, people are losing their minds and cabin fever is setting in and the Thing never sleeps...An eerie theme by musical genius Ennio Morricone sets the tone; dark, depressed, suspenseful and doom-inspired. Master of animatronic special-effects Rick Bottin provides the most ghastly practical horrors ever devoted to film and a craftily untypical and notably mature ensemble cast (Kurt Russell, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Thomas G. Waites and Wilford Brimley) provide a sense of reality that no kid that wants to make yet another slasher/zombie flick could ever hope to.If you haven't seen this film before and for some reason you have an intolerance to anything outside of CGI, pop music soundtracks, laugh a minute characters and damsels in distress in any shape or form then I dare you to see what a real horror film is and watch this. Call it an education because there is not a director out there who will ever rival John Carpenter or make a film as cold and creepy as The Thing!",

            "content": "The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original. The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier. Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans, see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you will see the genius of this movie.10/10",

Let's get something right that Spielberg recently had a bone with over the first three Indy films. matte paintings that look good are fine, CGI that looks like a play station game is not. The effects in this film are real, you know you're looking at something real and this makes for a film that is all the more unsettling.Next the acting and the script. In this film we feel the sweat and unpleasant camaraderie that people cooped up in this kind of environment feel. There are uneasy alliances and downright detestation of some people, they're not friends they're colleagues and it shares with Alien the distinction of putting these human relations in perfect transfer to the big screen. The script and acting make the effects real because you believe in how the people are with each other. Its ordinariness makes it real.For those of you who have not seen it watch past the first 30 minutes when you might think you're watching a kitchen sink drama in the Antarctic.

I was both shocked and scarred and excited at the same time- this was a movie that had just short circuited me- I had to see the rest of it!And I did- and I have watched it several times since then. I have also watched the interviews with the director etc...Carpenter has made some CRAP films in his day. This is not one of them- and in the interviews he blames short schedules and low budgets for the crappiness of some of his films (not in so many words) and judging by this masterpiece of science fiction horror I think he's onto something. Give John Carpenter enough time and money to do it- and he'll do it right!The Thing is based on a science fiction novel called \"Who Goes There\" and was inspired by Carpenter's repetitive viewing of an earlier film of the same title- but this version is a thousand times better, scarier, and also much more true to the original written story and it also captures such an awesome feeling of isolation and spookiness with the scenery and the camera angles and lighting.What can I say- it's a masterpiece.PLOT: A number of scientists and their support team are out in the arctic doing research- one day a crazy Norwegian shows up wanting to kill a friendly dog. They keep the dog.big mistake. What ensues next is a captivating tale of horror and suspense with special effects that still hold up to today's standards- more than 20 damn years later. I can't praise this film enough. It is a classic for the genre that has already stood the test of time.",

I mainly found it suspenseful. What's missing, is well, a Ripley. Or any female for that matter. The entire cast is male. Mmmn, I could overlook that, but kept feeling a lack of something, and I think that was it.It has a great little track of a suspenseful sound effect, almost like a heartbeat slowed down and with the pitched changed. All the acting was very good. The ending was a little disappointing. I don't know if they were setting up for a sequel, or the director wanted to leave it mysterious. I would have preferred a more defined ending.I just watched it for the first time, and for 1982, it has held up very well. If you like the Alien movies I think you will definitely like this movie.",

            "content": "Based on the famous short story Who Goes There? (which was previously filmed as The Thing From Another World), this 1982 version of The Thing is an exciting and fairly gruesome slice of science fiction. It has its fair share of shortcomings, which I will mention later, but on the whole this is a commendable film. A bunch of US researchers at a secluded Antarctic base rescue a stray dog. Little do they realise that the dog's body has been inhabited by a deadly alien organism which can take the shape of its victims so that no-one knows it is there. Seems that some Norweigan scientists at a nearby base unearthed the murderous extra terrestrial from the ice, where it had laid frozen for hundreds of thousands of years. Pretty soon, the guys in the American research team are being infected by \"The Thing\" one by one.... but how can they tell who is who when it can imitate any one of them with such accuracy? The Antarctic setting complements the suspense perfectly. The isolation of a scientific station in the middle of nowhere is an ideal metaphor for the fearful isolation that each character experiences, miles from help and surrounded by other characters who may or may not be what they seem. Rob Bottin's make-up effects and Albert Whitlock's visual effects are memorably (and intentionally) unpleasant. And some performances, notably Kurt Russell as the suicidal hero, are absolutely spot-on. As I touched upon earlier, the film has a few shortcomings. There is never a satisfactory explanation as to how the alien actually infects its victims, and some moments near the end seem illogical (e.g. what's going on with A. Wilford Brimley's character in his last scene, and why does Keith David go running around alone knowing that the alien is on the prowl?) Also there are clumsy goofs - for instance, it is widely-known that Antarctica experiences six months of uninterrupted daylight and six months of uninterrupted darkness, so how come day and night occur on a daily basis in this film? The film is best enjoyed as an exercise in suspense and a show-stopping display of innovative special effects, but if you start to unpick the plot in closer detail the holes begin to show.",

The effects of the creature are great, no CGI here, all practical and it holds up quite nicely which makes it all the more terrifying. The acting is great and every man has a different personality, though it lacks character development. Love the fact that it takes place in Antarctica, cut off from the rest of society, and with few weapons, only one really works against the monster. I won't reveal if there are any survivors, but I will give you this advice, don't assume that it's over until you see the credits.",

But it's also an important milestone for two reasons.\nFirst it was one of the very first horror films to actually give you in detail, a really good look at the various monstrous expressions of the key villain. Up to that time most horrors were implied and as soon as you saw the the rather dodgy special effects representing the actual monster, the illusion started to fade.\nSecondly, despite this challenge, absolutely no CGI or anything like it was used. Computer graphics in those days were so primitive that it took the makers several days to create a simple computer screen showing the cells of the monster transforming into those of a host. Instead the special effects team took a delirious joy in dreaming up ingenious ways to show various horrors using simple techniques like reversing the film, the use of plentiful amounts of plasticine, string and goo, and stop motion photography.\nLastly there was brilliant use of a trained Alsatian dog. The strange stillness and focus of its gaze before it's finally revealed that it has been invaded by the alien sends a chill down the back and was completely convincing.\nWatch and enjoy!",

            "content": "Even after seeing the majority of John Carpenter's films, \"The Thing\" has still very strongly remained my favorite of his, and, let's be frank, it is one of the best horror movies ever made. From its awesome opening sequence to the ominous ending, \"The Thing\" is an atmospheric and cold journey through a siege against the unknown, masculinity in crisis, distrust, and, to this day, the most amazing practical effects galore.John Carpenter's initially underappreciated horror gem is perhaps not exactly flawless, but it is, in my opinion, one of the very best exercises in the horror genre of the 20th century. Taking place in a remote research outpost in Antarctica, \"The Thing\" executes a kind of a haunted-house atmosphere and finds the horror in the tension between the all-male inhabitants. The Thing is found (well, the Thing finds them) and an icy bucket of fear, stress, paranoia and distrust is thrown onto the characters. On one hand, the characters are not very deep or multi-dimensional, Kurt Russell's MacReady has as much character as Clint Eastwood in most of his westerns, who is merely a clever and brave hero figure with good morale; on the other hand, during my every watch of \"The Thing\", it has never mattered much. As far as I'm concerned, there's no space for more. Although \"The Thing\" is most likely best known for its special effects, I think that the horror and atmosphere exist there independently, a work of a great director at his prime. The special effects are the tastiest cherry on the cake ever - gory, gooey, macabre, highly creatively and professionally made, the kind to remember and get impressed at every next visit. On top of everything, the cast seems to be enjoying their every minute & Ennio Morricone delivers the least Morricone original score ever, and makes it as disturbing as the film demands..\nWhenever the topics of wintery, gory, sci-fi or 80's horror movies get brought up, or the theme of best horror movies ever for that matter, \"The Thing\" is one of the first movies popping up in my head. Thank god for John Carpenter. If you somehow haven't seen it yet, December is the time. My rating: 10/10.",

Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien. Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems... Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer, there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!",

It is cunning, incapable of compassion, and goes forth with a steel resolve.Morricone's music is perfectly unsettling throughout.Talk about a piece perfectly fitting; Morricone paints a musical portrait of the snowy landscapes. The music is so foreboding. And it foreshadows the (possible) doom of the crew. More than that though, the score really personifies the (non-person) evil presence. It's so effective, what should be the pristine white beauty of the landscape, feels instead, like a bleak & contaminated graveyard.I don't like spoilers much, and if I did reveal specifics of the story here, I'd be doing the film an injustice.

            "content": "Let me get this out of the way: I am not a biased fan of this movie. I did not grow up with it, I did not see it once, get scared, and then love it when I was older, and I did not watch it with any hype or weighted opinion whatsoever. I'm not really a John Carpenter fan. I am a hardcore horror fan who has seen the majority of what the genre has to offer. I am an adult, and I watched this last night, 9/17/08. I'm not sure it's possible to find an opinion that is more unbiased than mine when I say: The Thing rocked.First and foremost, the reason The Thing works is because it does not bash your over the head with a block of cheese, unlike most \"classic\" horror movies. Some of the effects are a bit outdated, despite what the lifetime fans would have you believe, but not so much as to look cheesy. At all. There is very little gore\u0097nothing that the average parent wouldn't let a 8-year-old see\u0097and the gore effects are also outdated, but it doesn't take away from the movie. I just found it downright refreshing to watch a movie that didn't try to kick me in the balls. I've watched so many ultra-gory movies lately, The Thing made me remember what it was like when movies didn't use gore to make the viewer feel like crap, but instead used gore as part of the actual story. It's the perfect movie to watch on a snowy night with your girlfriend/wife or your kids.The reason The Thing isn't cheesy is because it submerges you in atmosphere and suspense and mystery, then it punches you. The creatures are not generic whatsoever, and some of them are downright weirdly awesome. (Spider-head, anyone?) The plot is pretty generic, if you can even call it a plot at all. Here is one of the greatest movies of all time, and it does something that you wouldn't expect: it doesn't really have a plot. No, The Thing is true survival horror. There is nothing here except the desire to survive, and that is the only plot. The opening scene hints that the creatures are aliens, but, really, the movie never says much about their origins other than that. Watching this movie is almost like watching people in an arena try to survive\u0097you don't watch it for the story. What makes The Thing original and different from the other movies like it is the small details, like setting, the creature designs, the characters, the ending, and so on.People who get bored with this movie don't understand suspense. I can understand that, because in the generation that we live in, suspense is dead and buried. Suspense has been replaced with either (1) lame action, or (2) lame dialogue scenes that \"build characters\", even though the characters are pure clich\u00e9s. Suspense is the feeling of \"I know everyone is going to die . . .\" that you get before anything happens. I can count the amount of movies that get suspense right on one hand, but The Thing honestly pulls it off. If you're a fan of suspense movies\u0097and no, I don't mean Wolf Creek, I mean like Alien\u0097I do not know why you haven't seen this movie already.Then there is one more thing I need to mention: The Thing isn't Alien. It never will be Alien. It is not quite as good as Alien, though it has more action. It is, however, the only movie I would ever mention in the same breath as Alien, because it does come very, very close.Overall: This is by far the best Carpenter movie I've seen, and one of the few movies I've ever seen that understands suspense. It's easily one of the best horror movies of all time, and I'm saying that as someone who find most \"classic\" horror movies pure cheese. Watch this movie. Watch it now.9/10",

Whilst Guy introduced me and my family to countless other great films over the years,he mentioned that The Thing was still his all-time favourite film.In early March 2019,Guy suddenly passed away at age 46. Wanting to pay a lasting online tribute,I decided that my IMDb reviews 1996-2000 would be reviews of his top films,which led to this 2000th review being of Guy's favourite film.View on the film:Iced out with a new 4K restoration, Arrow present an incredible transfer, where the finely balanced soundtrack and glittering restored image are joined by extensive extras.Proving the third time to be the charm, Kurt Russell reunites with his friend and gives an incredibly subtle, brooding performance, gradually building on MacReady's isolation in withdrawn, back to the wall body language, raging with fear over who is the thing. In the middle of nowhere from anywhere else in the world, the rest of the cast give outstanding performances as the fellow research scientists,with Keith David as the ambiguous Childs and Richard Dysart as the fearful Dr. Copper being two of the highlights of the cast.Being the first \"outside\" composer for the director,and ending up with a \"Razzie\" nomination for his work,Ennio Morricone drills a utterly chilling, low-key score,pressing on the loner state of the team with shards of the score casting cracks across the ice. Continuing to build on the visual themes that run across his work, directing auteur John Carpenter reunites with cinematographer Dean Cundey and masterfully expands on their distinctive dolly shots, in the long, slow wide-shot dollys down corridors with a single figure or shadow haunting the location. Tangling the research scientists in Rob Bottin's spectacular,otherworldly practical monster effects, Carpenter and Cundey continue to build on their themes for contrasting appearances for the outside/inside locations, as the inside horror of a blood red monster and the dripping with tension wide group-shots being stabbed in the merciless outdoors of the low-lighting miles of snow in the wilderness.The first feature film by Carpenter that he did not write himself, the screenplay by Bill (son of Burt) Lancaster impressively continues to expand on Carpenter's theme of \"The Shape\", thanks to not giving the monster any dialogue (or dry exposition),and instead focusing on characters attempt to survive the unrelenting onslaught of The Shape. Not featuring a single woman in the film or in the crew, Lancaster makes this isolation of masculinity one which is fuelled on fear and mistrust, exploding in MacReady holding back from making a true attachment to any of his fellow scientists, leaving him shaking with a nihilistic fear over being left in doubt over if he has confronted all of the thing.",

Here was a John Carpenter movie that broke all the boundries of what horror-scifi is all about, & then some. Based on the excellent movie \"Thing from Another World\" (1951) it tells the story of a crew of men at an Antarctica research base & their deadly encounters with a deep space shape shifting alien, which infects people it wants to replecate. The Thing 1982 makes Alien 1979 look like childs play! This move actually follows the original 1938 novella called \"Who goes there\" by John W. Campbell quite closely as opposed to the 1951 film & the result is nothing short of spectacular with ground breaking special effects, great acting & a screen play that is nightmare inducing. The minimalist score by Ennio Morricone who uses simple bass tones to invoke a sinister foreboding is equally chilling & fits the back drop perfectly. If anyone of the younger generation enjoyed the 2011 remake & loved it, it's well worth giving this a try. Some of the other, less impressed reviews are amusing, saying they found the Dog-Thing disturbing & gross. What you find disturbing is actually a sock puppet operated on the arm of monster genius Stan Winston & basically if a horror film creeps you out then it has done its job. Don't like the genre. Don't watch it then! Another reviewer on here said this was a \"man\" film (?) Well I am a woman in my 50's who has adored this movie over & over for the past 38 years! So I appeal to the new generation of young lady horror fans (yes us ladies like horror movies too!) If young ladies who like the horror/Sci-Fi/gore/fantasy genre, then go for it. You will adore John Carpenters \"The Thing\" I would bet on it!When this movie was first released it was bombed with negativity because of the gruesome special effects done by 22 year old Rob Bottin, with a crew of 35 artists. In fact this movie almost cost John Carpenter his career as he lost his next directing job \"Firestarter\" because of the back lash of The Thing. Stan Winston who helped Bottin with the Dog-Thing when the work made Bottin so ill he had to be hospitalised, refused to be credited, however this was later corrected by a thank you note in the credits. Personally I have always loved this movie because I simply like the old style puppeteered monsters, which, when done well is pure magic, however, because I do love this movie it's faults are glaringly obvious to me. & the genius level special effects in this movie is one of those faults. The alien has many forms, but no form & the viewer can not latch onto what the alien actually looks like, when it appears to be just a writhing gory mass of exploding body parts. The gore is very excessive, even dare I say stomach churning although I liked the head-spider-thing animatronic which was a work of art in itself. Other problems are lack of character development. The men at the reseach base do not appear to have individual characters, & they kind of blend into one. There is little tension building, & instead going for strait up gore. But I did like the sense of building untrustworthiness between the crew members & the overall nihilistic themes in the film... Who was going to be next?Despite all this, The Thing went on to achieve horror cult status all over the world. Fans of gore-horror will absolutely love this, but it is not a movie for everyone. This movie special effects are brain scramblingly good, but this lets down the story telling aspect & even effects continuity. The acting is very good but don't expect fully formed \"characters\" which lets the film down some what. New viewers should beware for gore galore, & the monsters will bend you're mind. If you don't like this then steer well clear. There is no sex or nudity & foul language is minimal. Lastly a huge well done to all the cast & crew, but Rob Bottins special effects are genius. Poor guy put himself through hell to bring us this. He ended up in hospital with exhaustion & double pneumonia. He even suffered nightmares from the monsters he had created. This kind of dedication is really admirable & quite rare in movie making. The problem was back in 1982 audiences were not really ready for such monsters & the back lash was awful. Created nightmares really do have consequences, when man is the warmest place to hide!",

Blair may seem mad, but he is very rational trying to destroy transportation so the thing cannot reach the world outside of Antarctica. What I love is that saving humanity is an implied motivation for various characters within the film, but it is hardly stated by any of the characters.This movie is a thrill ride, science fiction film with a concept not unlike \"And Then There Were None.\" One thing bothered me in this film: remember how I said Blair is rational? This is due to a lazy bit of writing, in which a computer states before the camera that humanity could be wiped out in a short amount of time due to this thing, and this is based on a few seconds of analysis by the computer.

After what seems like forever the dog reaches the US scientific outpost #31 and as the men stationed there run out to see what's happening the pilot starts shooting and throwing grenades all over the place like a man gone insane.

By MacReady and Dr, Copper taking back one of the dead bodies to be examined they brought,together with the runaway dog that was already taken into in the US encampment,into play one of the most hideous monsters that was ever put into a motion picture. A monster that laid dormant for tens of thousands of years until the Norwegian Antarctic expedition dug it out of the ice and inadvertently released it.

Unlike the original 1951 movie \"The Thing from another World\" the John Carpanter directed films storyline follows very closely the famous 1938 Sci-Fi short story \"Who Goes There\" by John W. Campball that both films were based on. Surviving through the process of replicating itself in it's host body \"The Thing\", after wiping out the Norwegian outpost, turned itself into a sled dog and then ended up getting into the US base #31. At the base \"The Thing\" started to take over the bodies of first the sled dog and then the men stationed there by initially infecting them in order to enter their system. Then, like an unending row of domino's, \"The Thing\" goes from one person to another until \"It\" destroyed every living thing, human animal and plant, on earth. Looking something like a cross between a giant spider and octopus \"The Thing\", when it was in it's natural state, looked like a nightmare that came straight out of hell. But when it infected and took over someone on the base, and hid itself inside the persons body, it acted perfectly normal and human until the opportunity presented itself for \"It\" to strike again. It was only too late that the US military men and scientists at the base-camp began to realize that once \"The Thing\" got into their camp the only way that it could be stopped was for them to destroy everything living that it came in contact with, the entire base-camp with them along with it. Not making the same mistake that the Norwegians did by unknowingly allowing it enter their encampment and then later escape, after wiping them out, and continue it's murderous rampage on earth. With the fires that were started by him and his men, battling \"The Thing\", slowly burning themselves out MacReady and Childs,Keith David, the last two survivors of this inferno wait for the bitter minus 100 degree Antarctic winter to set in and thus put them out of there miseries. Shearing a bottle of R&B whiskey to numb their senses they both sit and wait for the end to come knowing that with their actions they put an end to \"The Thing\" and it's ability to use them to farther it's demonic goal in destroying all of mankind.",

            "content": "An intelligent and reasonably tight story set in a research outpost in Antarctica, where scientists have inadvertently dug up some form of parasitic, shapeshifting alien out of the ice. It quickly becomes a study in paranoia, where behavior amongst the men becomes a game as difficult as that chess match against the computer Kurt Russell has early on: if one of your colleagues may not be what he seems to be, what's the best move? Attempting to determine who it might be, and selectively isolating him? Destroying everyone so that you might survive? Attempting to use reason and science in a helter skelter, chaotic situation? I loved the setting and the very cool ways in which the thing manifests itself, which at the time seemed so excessive that it turned reviewers off, but which today appears highly creative and refreshing in light of modern CGI, at least for me. There may be a couple of moments when one wonders about character motivations and it's a pretty simple story, but the latter keeps it focused, and the pace of the film is good. Kurt Russell and Keith David stand out in the cast, which also includes A. Wilford Brimley and Donald Moffat.",

            "content": "This is an interesting film, mainly because it is one filled with some of the most disgusting special effects I have ever seen - though I admit that I am fairly new to horror flicks of this kind.What's good about it? For one thing, it is a very clever touch not to reveal who has been infected and who hasn't until it is absolutely necessary. It is completely impossible to tell who is who, and the suspense raises sky-high because of that.Also, the performances are actually pretty good, considering the cramped confinement of the set and the sparse and somewhat lame dialogue. These are ordinary men talking, though most of them seem to be more or less criminal in some way.The beginning is very clever, and it takes quite a while before one gets the hang of why these crazy Norwegian are so eager to hunt the dog with machine guns and hand grenades (!) that they injure one of the Americans in the process. Of course, the first time I saw it, I knew what was coming, but it makes it better nonetheless.I have a favorite scene in this movie, it is one I will remember forever: when the doctor is trying to resuscitate one of the team members, who has been infected, he gets his hands caught in some weird mouth that opens right in the guy's chest. That is awful. It doesn't matter much that the doc's hands seem to break off by themselves...What else? Well...it's a cult classic, and deserves it. Like many of those, it's very far from brilliant, but are nonetheless very good and entertaining to watch.",

In this version, the title alien starts to inhabit many of the dogs and people that are stationed in the Antarctic Circle. Among the crew: R. J. MacReady (Kurt Russell), Nauls (T. K. Carter), Dr. Blair (A. Wilford Brimley without his familiar mustache and glasses), Vance Norris (Charles Hallahan), Garry (Donald Moffat), Clark (Richard Masur), Dr. Cooper (Richard Dysart), and others. I'll stop there and just say how fascinatingly weird and gory this movie is. I mean from the dog scene to yet another creature-coming-out-of-someone's-body sequence, there's plenty of entertaining blood-drenched visual effects courtesy of Rob Bottin and Stan Winston. And the pulsating score of Ennio Morricone is positively riveting. I can't always make sense of the dialogue in Bill Lancaster's screenplay but as long as those monster effects come on, I'm never bored. So on that note, I highly recommend John Carpenter's The Thing.",

            "content": "A masterpiece of unrelenting terror, nail-biting suspense & persistently looming paranoia, John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the greatest films of its genre(s) that presents its esteemed filmmaker at the apex of his talents for the remarkable simplicity with which Carpenter succeeds in infusing the storyline with a chilling sense of dread, tension & uncertainty right from its opening moments and then effortlessly sustaining those vital horror elements throughout the film's runtime is no mere achievement in itself.Set in Antarctica, the story of The Thing follows the crew of an American research facility whose expedition is interrupted when a couple of seemingly delusional Norwegians barge into their station while pursuing & shooting a dog, and are killed in defence. But when the dog mutates and reveals its true identity, the crew deduces that they are being confronted by a parasitic alien lifeform that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them perfectly. With no one really sure of who's human & who's the imitator among them, paranoia develops within the group.Directed by John Carpenter (the mastermind behind Assault on Precinct 13 & Halloween), The Thing is without a doubt my favourite film of his. The plot creates an atmosphere of impending doom right from the beginning as we can sense that something is definitely not right with the dog, and thanks to the minimal but menacing track that accompanies that sequence, the build-up is quick & effective. Bill Lancaster's screenplay deserves a mention too for it retains the mystery from start to finish, keeps the premise unpredictable & although the characters aren't fleshed out that well, they do have an identity.The technical aspects further help in setting the film's desired tone & atmosphere, starting with its isolated set pieces that have this sort of a raw, unrefined feel to it which, in addition to its remote location, cleverly brings the element of claustrophobia into the narrative. Cinematography makes excellent use of its camera for the wisely chosen angles, minimal lighting & slow but fluid movements encapsulate the whole picture with an unsettling vibe which only amplifies as the story progresses. Editing is carried out in a very methodical manner as it allows the suspense to settle in at its own pace and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats throughout its 109 minutes of runtime.The work in the special effects & make-up department might have been groundbreaking during its time of release but it looks a tad dated now and at times, unintentionally funny as well and yet it fits & work in favour of this narrative for the most part. However, the most impressive aspect of The Thing in my opinion is its background score, composed by Ennio Morricone. What's amazing about the soundtrack is that it sounds exactly the way Carpenter himself would've scored it, with simple, synthesised tracks that help enhance the sinister mood of the picture and elevate it to a nerve-wracking level. It's quite possibly the best John Carpenter score that wasn't composed by John Carpenter.Coming to the performances, Kurt Russell spearheads the rest of the cast with a good show and plays the role of the research team's helicopter pilot. The script doesn't delve into the background of its various characters but it does give each one of these scripted people their deserving moment on the screen. There is much similarity to Ridley Scott's Alien as far as its casting goes for each character has a role to play here and even if we don't get to know enough about any of them, their predicament and the situation they find themselves in on the isolated continent is deeply felt. Also, both Russell & the rest of the supporting cast do well with what they're given and deliver truly convincing performances.On an overall scale, The Thing is as suspenseful as any cinema can get. It deserves to be ranked amongst the greatest horror films ever made, has aged amazingly well over the years despite its dated effects and still remains John Carpenter's finest directional effort to date. It may not be scary on a visceral level but its tense ambiance, claustrophobic setting & the omnipresent danger of the unknown can run havoc on the senses plus it leaves enough pieces for viewers to put together once the whole story has concluded. Immortal for its contribution to cinema, absolutely living up to its legacy, and continuing to inspire & influence modern chillers, John Carpenter's magnum opus is one chiller no horror fanatic should miss out on. Strongly recommended.",

            "content": "Being a fan of several of John Carpenter's early oeuvre of works (Halloween, The Fog, Big Trouble in Little China, They Live), I've got to say that I was disappointed in recently getting around to watching his remake of THE THING (1982) and am a tad surprised by how revered this movie is. Having seen the original 1951 Howard Hawks' classic a few times, I was stunned that Carpenter's remake is actually SLOWER than the original film, which moves at a brisker pace, never lets up, and is still fun to watch even over 60s years later! Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a \"slow\" film if there's a method to the madness, but there is none here. The Thing just drags and drags and drags and really goes nowhere.Not to mention, I was not much impressed by the casting in this 1982 remake. I thought most of the performances were rather monotonous and lifeless throughout, which a bunch of interchangeable characters. Even the usually reliable Kurt Russell really brought very little to the table in terms of personality. The ONLY character the remotely piqued my interest was the one played by the veteran actor Wilfrid Brimley, and low and behold, Carpenter sidelined him for virtually the entire 2nd and 3rd acts! Other than the talented Brimley, the rest of the cast was literally just there.Getting off to an interesting start, with an alien spaceship hurtling toward Earth, we are immediately introduced to the crew of an Antarctic research and discovery station, who witness the pilot of a helicopter from a nearby station shooting at a seemingly harmless dog. The station captain kills the pilot and they take in the dog, who turns out is an alien beast that kills it's prey, then replicates them in every detail. So that this remake ends up functioning as a mystery-whodunit, as the station crew become paranoid (although it's hard to tell through all the mediocre acting) for the rest of the movie not knowing who is really who.I found this remake to be overly long and very slow. It literally got to a point where I thought the film was over, then it went on for about another 45 minutes! Some of the stuff in the climax was kind of interesting, whittling down the crew to the remaining \"humans\", but the getting there was very tedious. I found it strange that as soon as they found out they were dealing with an alien life form, none of them seem flabbergasted or blown away by their discovery. Also, I wondered why they didn't try harder to call for help as the alien threat became increasingly ominous. Plus, the ending left a LOT to be desired. A bit too ambiguous even for my taste. Also, the initially shocking, gory effects wore off quickly as the film progressed and became redundant.Carpenter's film usually have a penchant for thrills and suspense (see aforementioned movies of his that I actually LIKE in my first paragraph), but this one strangely left me cold (pardon the pun!). However, I do give it points (thus, the 5 out of 10 rating), for having some obviously unique (if a bit too gory) effects and piquing my interest early on, just not being able to maintain my attention.",

However, My 6yr younger brother, watched it a few months later and was not at all scared by it. I don't think there is such a thing as \"scariest movie of all time\", for sure some are scarier than others, but when it comes down to the best scary movies, some will affect more than others because of their inherent content. Some people think John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" is terrifying, I didn't find it scary in the least, but it is a very good movie none-the-less. I recommend knowing as little about the thing as possible, and not expecting it to be really scary, just enjoy it for what it is; a well-mace piece of sci-fi horror. I won't say anything about the plot, especially any of it's revelations, it\nis best enjoyed going in blind. This is not a fast paced movie, it takes it's time to develop and if that bugs you, don't watch, but it is this slower pace that can make it creep under your skin, the shots are often lingering on the creatures, and we are able to spend a decent amount of time with each of the characters in the film simpler because of it's limited cast and location. The arctic location makes it feel bleak and desolate just by nature, and also gives it a vast sense of hopelessness. I enjoyed many of the characters, from Mcready's crustiness, to Window & Palmer's sarcastic nature, to Blair's intelligence and paranoia, to Rawls incessant music and rollerskating. The characters are all distinct and likeable, even if not all of them are necessarily compelling. This is something that really distinguishes it from most sci-fi and most horror films. The score is always effective and interesting, it is one of the best scores of any movie I can think of, and is integral to the overall success of the film, it is never over bear and always adds to the moods of the moment within the film. The cinematography is beautiful, especially the arctic shots, and there inside shots are well-done, they set the claustrophobic mood right out of the gate, often making the cramped quarters seem even more cramped, even in the larger open areas, even outside, simply because of the below freezing arctic temperatures. If this movie doesn't scare you, hopefully you can at least appreciate the effects in the film. One of the greatest achievements of this film, is the practical effects that pushed the boundaries of those effects to their limit, and with a $10,000,000 budget($33,000,000 today), it has the budget to allow this, unlike most sci-fi/horror films, which have tight budget constraints. The effects are grotesque, but not so much for the sake of being grotesque, but rather by necessity, this is one case where a more is more approach actually works, each grotesque sequence often topping the next. I am always amazing, every single time, by the effects that were achieved, now some 36 years ago. The 2011 \"The Thing\" prequel really proves just why practical effects often work so much better than digital ones, the digital effects often are to fast and jaunty, and over time, tend to look cartoonish; even mediocre practical effects do not suffer from this as much as digital ones. This is exactly why there has been a move back towards practical effects recently, they will almost always look more real. I believe both have their place, but in some movies, they have no place at all, and the original thing proves this, the only place the original thing may have benefited from digital effects, is in the last 20 minutes.We only ever know as much as the characters in the movie know, and that isn't much, so if that bugs you, you probably shouldn't watch this. This is a who-dunnit in a way, and things do not wrap up in a neat package, not at all, why this will drive some crazy, it is one of the best things about the movie, you never have all the answers, and you never will.~Amy",

Ever since then I'm careful when I see a Hushky...John Carpenter's version of the \"Who Goes There\" story is fascinating, scary and pretty gore at several times but it surely is highly recommended. The creepy atmosphere is unique and very few movies equal to it or even come close. The Thing is some sort of Alien monster that has been safely frozen for the last 100.000 years but now it has thawed. That's the fault of a few Norwegian guys...In the form of a innocent looking dog, the thing ends up in an American Station. This is the greatest power of the enemy. It's fully capable to take over any life form and therefore it's hard to detect. And ... even more importantly ... it doesn't take long before anyone can be trusted. Everyone could in fact be \"The Thing\" This rather simple - but at the same time original and innovative - aspect about the enemy allows the story to create a unique claustrophobic atmosphere. First of all, you have the isolated landscape of the Antarctic Circle. The groups ' space to run and hide is very limited since it's unbearably cold and there are lots of storms. Secondly, the Thing to itself is very unpredictable. The tension between the characters can almost be smelled by the viewer and I think that's Carpenter biggest achievement about this movie. Although, there ain't much dialog in this film , you're kept close to the screen in order not to miss anything. Basically, Carpenter does pretty much the same as in his other horror classic Halloween. Although this is a complete different plot and complete different setting, there's not a message to detect, no psychological undertone or no form of humanity what so ever. Just a raw battle to survive between a bunch of tough men.And last but certainly not least ... some credit for the special effects and make-up department. This crew is just brilliant and pretty explicit for the 80's if you ask me. They managed to visualize a perfectly scary looking creature. Several shocking scenes will haunt your head long after you've seen this movie. Don't matter if you're a hardened horror fan already or not, but the images of a splitting dog and a human head marching on spider legs won't leave you senseless. Excellent Class A horror. Also worth a mention: the subtle but memorable score by Ennio Morricone... Highly recommend to all film-fans, a must see for horror freaks. The original version from 1951 is highly recommended as well. Lovely 50's SciFi-movie, that is !!Favorite \"rewind\"-scene : The Doctor desperately tries to save a crew-member and prepares himself to give him a heart-massage.

Not everyone is human, so the remaining workers must figure out who to trust. That is where the horror and thrills arise. Push aside the gruesome, terrifying, hideous looking aliens that are constructed to precision for now. It's the isolation that sends chills down the spine.

Now we can throw in the inventive practical effects to enhance the film onto a-whole-nother level. Wow. It was so disgustingly delicious that I had to rewind back, hold up my phone on snapchat, and record those scenes so that all my friends can appreciate what I went through. Even the cries that \"The Thing\" yelps is nightmare inducing. John Carpenter's direction was slow, but it worked! He took his time to bring life to the characters and to create the chilling tension. I found the scene transitions slightly basic and jarring, simply fading to black. Also the ending was a tad underwhelming, was hoping for a final minute twist or something.

Those folks have not seen this version of \"The Thing\" because it is right up there with \"Halloween\".John Carpenter's work shines in this film. He took a film that was already made and instead of \"re-making\" the film, he made the book the first film was based on! Brilliant.The casting of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me scared, made me guess, made me laugh, made me question, even up to today \"who goes there?\" in that film. This film had no Hollywood sweetie pie or funny-type ending, and what a bold move not to have one in 1982. Another brilliant move.I was at the screening for this film when I was on vacation in Southern California. The audience at the screening went wild! I carry those memories for years, it was so much fun! We all thought that there was no way on God's green earth this film was not going to be a hit. But by box office receipts, it was a dud because of \"ET, The Extra Terrestrial\" and \"Poltergeist\" two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out.This film was what I, as a horror film adult buff was looking for, a horror/thriller with an adult script, and real adult actors. Not kids playing adults. Not little Miss \"big-breasted\" scream-queen of the day running around screaming for titilation BUT real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. Heck, being a feminist, I didn't even MISS women in this film! And good for Mr. Carpenter by not putting one in there, it really wouldn't have made sense! (Unless, \"The Thing\" was actually feminine! Something to think about!)I saw special effects of that time I had never seen before, I saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights. This is what horror/thrillers of today are missing. Today, the Directors wimp out. Today, the Studios wimp out. Too much CGI and not enough belief, too much CGI and not enough story, not enough imagination. You leave the theater and in a week -- or less  -- you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening. This one stays with ya. That's one of the marks of an excellent film.On many reviews I've written how now paying $10 for a film is horrid. For films like this one, you'd pay it and not feel slighted. This film is NOT for everyone.I find it horrific that they lable this film a \"cult\" film. I find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad. After John Carpenter's film, many people copied many techniques, make-up, special effects and story lines from this version of \"The Thing\".I am now excitd to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time, very much under rated. Please see it uncut, please see it in letterbox and please hear it digitally. You'll talk about it for years as well.",

            "content": "I first saw this in the theater at its initial release in early 1982. This is definitely a testament of how horror films should be made. Although their is copious amounts of gore, it never lags in suspense, good acting, taut plot buildup, and enthralling drama. This is a time when CGI was nearly unheard of and special effects and horror make-up were made from scratch in an artists studio. Yes, they literally had to build and create tangible/three dimensional puppets, robots and props to enhance the movie monsters and horror effects. By the early 80's there were several notable horror make-up artists that earned the majority of the business. Therefore, they were at the height of their craft due to competition and a deep appreciation and desire to explore the depths of their creativity that the imagination could fathom.The drama is also excellent as the story envelops e are immersed in the crew's journey and struggle to examine what is happening to their camp due to this alien intelligence that has invaded upon them. Kurt Russell is simply great as the unshakable MacReady. The rest of the cast offers some good performances as well.What makes this movie so frightening is that eventually the crew members all become feverishly suspicious of each other as this inevitable terror befalls them. They must decide to either collaborate or fight each other in order to survive. Being stranded in the desolate arctic snow is claustrophobic enough; but add the ominous and elusive alien presence with the growing resentment and distrust for each character and we are left with a confounding morass destined for doom. A sequel to John Carpenter's version was made in 2011 and is supposed to be the backstory to his version. These two movies should never be confused for the 2011 version is far inferior and lacks the good acting and character development. It also relies to much on the usage of CGI to be taken seriously.",

            "content": "The Thing is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest of all of Carpenter's films. It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization. The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted by the alien, the more the paranoia grows. I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn into MacReady or would I become \"the thing\"? I get goose bumps just thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good. We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse, and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits. Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved, but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late). When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it. The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly all the way to the end.",

The storyline follows a group of American researchers in the artic when a group of Norwegians mysteriously are seen chasing a dog and trying to kill it. When the Norwegians have no regards for the Americans and accidentally start shooting and injuring them in their pursuit of the dog the Americans take them down and take in the dog. It doesn't take long for the Americans to discover why the Norwegians wanted the dog dead...This movie is directed by John Carpenter (Halloween) and stars Kurt Russell (Big Trouble in Little China), Keith David (There's Something about Marry), Wilford Brimley (Cocoon), Charles Hallahan (Dante's Peak), T. K. Carter (Domino) and Donald Moffat (Popeye).This is one of the top 5 horror movies of all time in my opinion. This is a brilliant blend of science fiction and horror elements. The characters are also outstanding and the cast is perfectly selected. The special effects were way ahead of its time with some great transformation and kill sequences. The dog cage scene, the spider human head, the defibrillator sequence, the blood testing scene...there's just too many good scenes to list them all. The ending is also brilliant.Overall this movie stands the test of time as one of the greatest horror and science fiction pictures of all time. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",

If they do, it's either a very minor mistake, or it doesn't factor into the group as a whole (like when Fuchs follows the thing outside. We don't actually know what happened to him, but he was found burned). The smart decisions are what keep the characters alive, but the thing is so powerful that it can work its way through it and still penetrate them.

We know every character so when one doesn't make it, we know who it was. The practical effects are remarkable, and it is a creepy movie. It's creepier than most horror movies today. It is a highly underrated movie, and it did not get that much appraise during the time. Kurt Russel has a strong performance and Ennio Morricone's haunting score and theme really helps.",

            "content": "The Thing, the 1982 film by John Carpenter came highly recommended from several close film sources in which I trust. It is a horror movie, it's directed by a horror master, what's not to love for a fan of the genre. No one was more surprised than me that The Thing couldn't even hold my attention, necessitating 3 viewings before I could complete it. Mental note: if you fall asleep during a movie not once, but twice, it just may not be the film experience for you. I persevered, however, because I truly thought I would appreciate the film. The film stars Carpenter's most often collaborator, Kurt Russell as a researcher stationed in Antarctica that is suddenly impacted by an alien life form. A seemingly engaging premise left a lackadaisical impression and further left me with the idea that I may not like John Carpenter as much as I thought I did. During the first ****amn week of winter, a team of American explorers in Antarctica are shocked to find their base being swarmed by a Norwegian helicopter from a nearby base. When the helicopter crashes, the American team goes to investigate only to discover everyone at the base dead or missing. The team does find something of interest, however, when they happen upon the burned remains of an unidentified creature. The team gathers the charred remains, and take it to the base with them where they deduce that it is an alien life form. The most shocking aspect of the remains are that the creature can assimilate into any lifeform it inhabits, and it inhabits like a virus, easily spreading to person to person. The implications of this discovery mean that any member of the team may be inhabited by The Thing, creating tension between the group as they each struggle to distinguish between the unaffected members and the ones The Thing has taken over.I don't even know where to start here. I'm not typically a science fiction fan, and this film had a much more sci-fi than horror feel to it. As far as Carpenter's other work goes, I've only seen Halloween and Big Trouble in Little China, hardly enough examples to lay blame with the director. The narrative seemed to rely largely on an ominous feeling that was never properly established. Maybe my main qualm lies with the poor title. I do know that this film is a remake, I have never seen the 1951 original, but in Carpenter's film, I never knew what I was supposed to be scared of. A shapeshifting organelle that inhabits its host without them knowing is a good premise for a fearful mood, but it never materialized as such for me. There seemed to be several opportunities for more (or better) scares that were not seized upon. I'm so disheartened to learn that the directors I thought I enjoyed were really just responsible for one or two films that I enjoyed rather than the director himself. Wes Craven immediately comes to mind as I have now seen a few of his films, none of which replicating the magic of the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, for me. Of course, I must see more of Carpenter's work before writing him off, but The Thing isn't the film to convince me to put any of his films at the top of my watchlist.",

            "content": "I was round about 15 when I heard about THE THING. A couple of trailers were shown on television promoting the cinema release . A few months later friends started discussing it in class ( They had seen it on pirate video . Obviously I will not condone this but it was very very common to watch pirate videos in the early 80s because that was the only way you`d get see the latest Hollywood blockbusters in those days ) So as soon as I could get my hands on a legal rental  copy of THE THING I did so , mainly due to people saying things like \" Watch THE THING Theo . The special effects are brilliant \" and I was very very disappointed with it. Not only that but I became educated to the fact that good special effects usually = bad film .Over the years however THE THING has grown on me slightly . It`s a scary disturbing film but one that is ultimately destroyed by its characterisation and plot holes . For example why should we feel sorry for people who are totally unsympathetic in anyway ? I was under the impression that when writing a script you are to feel for the characters in it . I felt absolutely nothing for the men in the base in the Antartic , though maybe I`m doing Bill Lancaster a great disservice and the characters are written in such a cold way to match their surroundings . But the script suffers from several plot holes , the most obvious one being the fact that a research base in the South Pole comes equipped by endless supplies of explosives , guns and flamethrowers . What may I ask do you need all that for ? Is that in case you get attacked by a gang of vicious penguins ? And there`s a ( *****POSSIBLE SPOILER*****)  credibility defying scene in which the base members - who have all been proven not to be infected by the alien -  all split up for no other reason except to have an ambiguous ending where one of them might be infected by the alien after all . If they`d all stuck together the alien would have been unambiguously killed.THE THING does have its good points, though not very many. Best plus point is the special effects. If it`d been made 10 or 15 years later it would have been CGI dominated. I think CGI is a pretty poor and unconvincing effect and I`m sick and tired of seeing it constantly used in movies , the effects in this are much better than what we have been used to recently.  This is an extremely dark bleak film , perhaps too dark and bleak which caused its disappointing box office sales, and lets not forget it was released at exactly the same time as ET. I`m a big DOCTOR WHO fan so I expect aliens to be nasty scumbags  who have got a really nasty streak towards the human race , I don`t expect to see them befriend middle American children or fly around on bicycles , but that`s what aliens did in the 1980s , so I guess that THE THING was the last \" they`re coming to get us \" sci fi movie to come out of Hollywood for a while",

            "content": "The Thing is a 1982 sci-fi horror film directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell as Mack MacReady, a researcher based in Antarctica and our protagonist in the film. Upon its release, The Thing was met with a lot of mixed reviews and overall a negative reception, however over the years has gone on to gain a cult following and a legendary status in the history of sci-fi, horror and cinema as a whole. While The Thing does have its moments, as in the grand special effects of the horrific, repulsive monster itself which still don't look particularly dated by todays standards and the great sense of vulnerability in our characters. It is in these characters that lies the problem. Not one of them is particularly likable or relatable, even Kurt Russell himself. You never get a great sense of caring or hoping for a certain character to make it out alive, rooting for a character just doesn't happen in The Thing. We are also left hanging in the balance by the end of the film with no real climactic epic fight or showdown. The Thing can be tense and generally scary at times, but in reality is a pure gross-out film rather than a well crafted horror. The music however is another strong point which does add to the suspense and the very clever idea of blood samples in the latter part of the film really has us guessing and wondering who is human and who is the monster. While I don't agree the statement that The Thing is one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it does have its tense, pseudo horror moments and shrieking horror soundtrack to build on this. Overall it does feel more of a gross-out, gore-fest with unfortunately unlikeable characters, some rushed scenes and disappointing third act which leaves it feeling incomplete, but with brilliant special effects. 6/10",

The story which is indeed a re-make in some regards, is by Bill Lancaster, and is extraordinarily well done. It's a familiar sci-fi/horror plot premise, but never done as well it is here, or since. It keeps you guessing right up until the end, and I don't exaggerate.The effects by Albert Whitlock and Rob Batitin are extremely bad ass, all before the times it got so easy with CGI. It's grotesque and beautiful all at once, being one of the high-points in effects history. The stop motion animation is one of the best of its kind, and continues to terrify. And to top it all off the legendary composer Ennio Morricone does the score.

This movie plays it straight right down the line, although that's not to say there aren't a few laughs to be had, there are some classic lines of dialogue.The movie's soundtrack and score establish a sense of foreboding from the get go, and as the characters witness one scene of unimaginable horror after another, the fear and paranoia grows palpably. The imagination and thought put into the special effects lifts the movie to a level as yet unsurpassed, Rob Bottin deserved an Oscar for his work here, with an honourable mention going to Stan Winston who stepped in to alleviate the workload, providing a particularly memourable scene.I can't believe I didn't see this at the cinema at the time of it's release. This is partly down to the critics, who should hang their heads in shame for panning this film. But beyond that, the trailer was awful, failing completely to convey the brilliance on display here.Another criticism levelled at this movie is there are no female cast members, but there really wasn't any need for them.

But this time hot director John Carpenter was given the green light to re-invent the film. Carpenter decided wisely to remain faithful to the original story line and created a dark and depressing movie about alien mutations and co-habitation within humans. He also create an atmosphere of hopelessness with no light at the end of the tunnel. This film is also the first part of his Apocalyptic Trilogy.A group of scientist and technicians are living inside a U.S. research base in the middle of Antarctica. Nothing but the cold and cabin fever accompanies them. One day they get a taste of excitement when a helicopter from a nearby Norwegian research base is chasing a dog. They fail to kill the dog and die in the process. The guys were left wondering why they wanted to kill that husky so bad. unfortunately they do find out but by then it's too late. A mutating copy cat alien is living within the base. One by one it kills off the crew refusing to show itself. Paranoia and madness soon sets in and no one trusts anyone. By the end of the film, the men destroy their own refuge. The last two survivors sit in the ruins not trusting one another and die in the cold Antarctic wastelands with weapons in hand waiting for the other to show their true self.Another great film from John Carpenter. Too bad he couldn't keep the streak going. His next film was a unwise choice. Due to the lack of box office drawing power, Carpenter was forced to jump on the Stephen King band wagon and adapt one of his works for the silver screen. It was a failure as well, but nowhere as cool as THE THING.Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Back in 1982, John Carpenter made a sci-fi horror film, a remake of a flawed yet beloved cult classic from the 50's. It bombed horribly, mostly due to poor marketing, but critical word of mouth didn't help. It was panned by critics, who called it one of the worst films of that year. But then, like a phoenix from the ashes, the home release of the film allowed people to actually see it.It was then that everyone, including these critics who condemned it, realised that The Thing is one of the best films ever made!It is the perfect set up for a horror story. A handful of men at a small research base in Antarctica, during a blizzard, are attacked by a shape-shifting being that could be anybody and anytime. Everyone gets paranoid and isolated as nobody knows who is human and who is the thing.Cabin fever and paranoia play a huge part in this film. It feels so claustrophobic and isolated that it is uncomfortable to watch even without the gruesome monster popping up at random points. We follow Kurt Russell, but do we know he is actually still Kurt Russell? No we don't. That's the genius of the film.Carpenter, as much as I love his films, tends to direct in a workmanlike style. This one feels more finely crafted than his usual output. That isn't a slight against the likes of Escape from New York or They Live, it just means that The Thing feels more special. There is not a flaw to be found in the execution here. The characters feel like real people, played excellently by some of the best character actors of the time, and the atmosphere is relentless, aided by the films excellent musical score.You can't talk about The Thing without mentioning the effects. Rob Bottin made some of the best effects of all time in this film. It isn't just that it's all practical (something the prequel discovered to its cost), it's that they are even better than most other practical effects. How each is used and shot is masterful. They were seen as too repulsive that it made critics overlook the rest of the film, which now should be taken as a compliment.The only reason I can think of for The Thing being as panned as it was is that critics and horror (much like comedy) have never really gone hand in hand. Similar, though less severe, examples belong to such classics as Alien, The Shining, Gremlins and Predator. I guess, particularly at that time, blunt and gruesome was seen as artless trash. It isn't much of an excuse, but it does fit.The Thing is a near flawless masterpiece. You are doing yourself a disservice for not watching it. Just like David Cronenberg's The Fly and Chuck Russell's The Blob, it blows its original out of the water. Terrifying and compelling, it will stay with you forever.",

            "content": "Trust has became a scarce commodity, because of the simple fact we never really know a person, because in reality it's impossible to know a person fully, there is just always something to hide.This film is my favorite film from my favorite movie director John Carpenter as well as my favorite horror film and favorite films in general. The film really helped pave the way for the way we look at most horror and suspense films but also was an inspiration for video games like \"Dead Space\", parts of \"Resident Evil\". It's also a prime example of a remake when done the right way, don't get me wrong I like the 1950's film it's good in it's own way but I love the 80's version more because of just that being good in it's own way, a way I just like the most.There is so much I really love about this film, I love the creature effects from one of my favorite make up/effect artists Rob Boltin as well as the late great Stan Winston. I liked seeing the dolperganger alien whenever it pops out it just seems to always transform into whatever the heck it's suppose to look like, it just seems to be a mixture of things, their slightly inspired by the monster from H.P. Lovecraft's stories which always had bizarre otherworldly monsters.I love the location it really sets up a atmosphere of fear and isolation. The music from Enccio Morone is excellent, it's one of my favorite horror scores ever, the theme song is memorable it just has that evokes the feeling of cold lonely fear. But most importantly it was in the suspense which is the best thing and a common thing with Carpenter.You are just on red alert throughout the whole film, because the danger doesn't let up even in it's peaceful moments. I actually jumped a few times watching this movie and that was a great feeling that I don't get often. Like that infamous blood test scene, I was at edge having both anticipation on who the Thing is but at the same time scared of the possibility of the Thing. You really feel just that sense of paranoia. From the enviorment which feels palpable, just the cold, darkness, and sheer isolation knowledge that these people are in the middle of nowhere and there is no one out there to help because their miles away. There is also the fact that no one can really run or even hide, because you really can't get out of the facility there is nothing out in that envorment to run to, you'll freeze to death in mere minutes. And due to the Thing being anyone along with how small the facility is it leaves few places to really hide. So it leaves you with that sense of doom and dread because of the lack of those options.It's true these characters don't have much depth and you don't get to really know most of them despite some personality on them but that's the point. Even though these characters all live under the same roof you can see their all not really close, and it just goes to show that just because your in the same enviorment doesn't automatically mean all will be friends, it's like with the high school and collage I've been to there are hundreds or almost thousands of people that I pass by or go to class with and barely know a mere fraction of them.Though a couple of characters stand out for me mainly MacReady and Childs played by two favorite actors of mine Kurt Rusell and Keith David. Both just have some of the best lines and both are proactive in the situation, I like how both are scared but their don't wimp out against danger they fight back, let alone that really is the only option available. Let alone both are likable and easy to emphasize with a bit because both are bored and just want to get the heck out of the facility. I don't blame them, I might just go nuts being there to long without a anime convention or girl around that can really suck.The Thing itself it an enigma, we don't really know it's motives or if it even has any. Nor does it seem to have really a true form since it can replicate itself by being viral. I even like how it behaves which makes it feel all the more real, despite primal it's capable of intelligence it was able to fly and tried to rebuild it's spacecraft after all. It's also kinda like a game hunter, the Thing doesn't really do anything at first but you know it will once it's moment comes, the humans it imitates are practically it's camouflage which is it's edge, and what makes it a hard opponent to nail. Did the Thing come from another planet we haven't discovered or may'be another galaxy. Was the alien suppose to be some kinda scout for invasion of Earth or could it of been some sort of bio weapon some alien race created to help destroy Earth's inhabitants. I don't know your theories are as good as mine, but that makes the creature all the more scary.This film was an acknowledgment of cold war paranoia as well as paranoia of disease in the 80's decade but I also feel it's relevant today with our decade with our war on terrorism and chemical weapons/disease epidemics. The main theme is about distrust of our fellow man, how it is not the enemy seen that will destroy people but it is fear of the stranger that becomes our undoing.It's not the enemy that you see that should be fear, it is the enemy unseen.Rating: 4 stars",

I remember this film from my youth and watching it recently I confirmed that that film knowledge (lines, scenes, etc.) never really went away - they just lie dormant in my mind waiting to be reanimated. The minute the film starts events are in motion, all the way through it, right until the second the credits roll. An alien parasite/monster has infected a human host and taken its body, wearing it like a shell or a mask and taken it for a walk. It manages to get into a US run, scientific station in the frozen wasteland of Antarctica. The American scientists are about to get cut off from society due to adverse weather condition - little do they know, of what is trapped in there with them - a shape shifting evil alien that can take on the form of its victims and shapeshift at will. The film primarily uses Kurt Russell as its vehicle and he puts in a great performance, as does the entirety of the cast for that. Stuck in a remote location with an unknown killer they all come across as authentic. The strength of this film has been proven time and time again. During the year it was released it bombed, people were more interested in \"E.T.\" and nicer films. Fast forward ten years - this film still has a following, and it's grown too. Fast forward another ten years and yet more fans and followers, and the film is still adored. If film is art and all good artists are looking for their one masterpiece, then this cult film has to be John Carpenter's masterpieces. The chilling synth soundtrack, works, it's spooky and more so - with the film emerging the viewer in the action, its believable to think hat this is the only musical score we have access to when locked away in the Antarctica. When I started writing this reviews I swore that I'd never give a ten out of ten because that would indicate perfection, and to my knowledge and beliefs there are always things that could improve - with everything. This film however, pushes that believe to the limit. In its horror genre this scores damn high, when compared to films in other genre's too - this still scores highly! I'm going to write 9 out of 10 - but then I'm going to have to run away and take some deep breaths as this pushed my rating rationale to the limit. It may even have broken me for today - Film fans, you cannot go wrong watching this classic masterpiece - it still stands tall nearly 40 years later!",

            "content": "It's not so often I encounter the chance to revisit a classic on the big screen yet yesterday I had that privilege to watch John Carpenter's cult horror classic 'The Thing' at the Cineworld Cinema near Piccadilly Circus. The film begins in the midst of the Antarctic snowfield where a helicopter is circling an American research base chasing down a husky with a sniper. When the helicopter crashes and the pilot is killed, the passenger survives only to continue his mission of pursuing and killing the dog and in the process shots one of the members of the research team to get to the dog. The gunman who appears to be Norwegian is shot down by the captain of the base as he obviously appears to be steered crazy and incredibly dangerous.When they eventually find out that this dog isn't what it appears to be, two members of the team, one being MacReady (played by Kurt Russel who gives a fine performance here), goes on a search for the Norwegian base to see what clues they can find. When they do find the abandoned base, they find a large block of ice which looks as if something had been frozen in it for centuries and a half burnt corps that looks like something they've never seen. Of course this corps is brought back to the base, and after a few autopsies are made, one of the doctors makes the shocking discovery of a creature that imitates cells When one of the members of the base is left alone with the remains of the creature, another team member enters the room only to discover the creature is not dead and is now in fact imitating a member of the team. When help comes forth, the creature has almost finished the process and looks exactly like the team member except for a few last features. This is where the tension really begins; paranoia hits everyone and hits them hard. Did they kill the creature? Are there any remains of the creature left? If so, has it taken shape of any other team members? Who is human and who is the creature? Who can they trust? You can even feel the tension in the atmosphere of the base, the silence, the darkness, and the reactions of the team members when they suspect another team member.If one person gets out of their sight for an instant then that person is automatically a suspect. The best example of paranoia is shown by Dr. Blair played by Wilford Brimley who delivers the best performance in the film. He discovers that if this creature reaches civilization, it will eventually imitate mankind little by little and this drives him over the edge and wants no one from the base to escape for the sake of mankind. I felt quite fortunate as to have previously visited Howard Hawk's original Sci-Fi classic 'The Thing from Another World' which is quite an impressive film especially for 1951, did not feature a shape-shifting creature, instead it featured a gigantic creature that required human blood in order to reproduce. The director John Carpenter, being a fan of Howard Hawks did not try to copy the original; instead he went back to the original novel 'Who Goes There?' by John W. Campbell Jr. from 1939 which did feature a shape-shifting creature, thus making the film more tense and more suspenseful.John Carpenter has never been known for his character build up; in fact the villains in his movies are usually mindless and lack emotion or personality as shown in this film and many others such as Michael Myers in his merciless masterpiece 'Halloween', the car Christine in 'Christine' or the zombie-like ghosts from 'The Fog'. But he is famous for his tense scenes and his dark and creepy shots as hardly any of his movies contain more than ten minutes of daylight. This is a well paced, well shot film and with these sorts of movies, that's rare.Watching 'The Thing' again I couldn't help but be reminded of Don Siegel's Sci-Fi classic 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' from 1956, where a doctor in a small town practise finds numerous patients of his claiming that their relatives or close friends are not who they seem to be but in fact impostors who look exactly them. These two films feature the same sort of paranoia, only John Carpenter makes the decision of showing the shape-shifting commence by using extremely grotesque and gory special effects. Although I am not a fan of grotesque special effects, especially as over blown as they are here, John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing' still succeeds as a haunting tale of paranoia and is a highly entertaining and action packed sci-fi film that is sure to entertain even if it's not as great as Don Siegel's classic.Upon the film's release back in 1982, the film did not do so well in the box office, maybe because it came out only two weeks after the phenomenon 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' or maybe it's simply due to its extensive use gore and violence which it earned it an \"R\" rating by the Motion Picture Association of America. It instead went on to become a cult favourite and is now considered to be one of the best and scariest horror films ever made.",

John Carpenter sows the seeds of mistrust early on and that feeling just compounds as the story unfurls. This is a masterpiece of paranoia.

            "content": "Wow, John Carpenter really loves Howard Hawks, doesn't he? Well, he was hired onto this project after it had been through several drafts, managing a new draft written by Bill Lancaster, and didn't originate the idea, at least. Still, what Carpenter helped script and ended up directing is an ideal remake. Returning to the ultimate source, the short story \"Who Goes There?\" by John Campbell, Carpenter recast the whole concept with a twist while firmly planting the new film in a new time, never feeling like he's just repeating what Hawks and Nyby had done before in The Thing From Another World.One of the key differences between Carpenter's remake and Nyby's original is in terms of its construction. The original starts away from the remote, icy camp and moves into that team finding the alien trapped in ice. The remake starts with the creature having already been dug up, torn apart a Norwegian camp, and arriving at the American camp with our heroes in the form of a dog. This is important for one big reason, the monster is incredibly different. In the original, there was just a monster (that apparently looked like a carrot in color) that needed defeating. In this remake, pulling more from the original source material, the monster is vastly different, able to morph from one shape into another as it absorbs the essence of other creatures. There's a lot of questions that arise about how it does it and how perfectly it can hide in its form, and the movie, having the refuse of a previous encounter to sift through, provides those answers on the front end of the film.The dog runs into camp, the final Norwegian dies by a gunshot to the head, and Mac (Kurt Russell), the helicopter pilot, flies to the Norwegian camp to investigate with a couple of others. There, they find the half-burnt remains of something. There are distinct signs of human appendages and two heads melting into or away from each other. This is obviously not human, and we get a scene where Blair (Wilford Brimley), their biologist, dissects it, finding perfectly normal human organs inside. This is telling us that whatever this thing is, it's not human and it will look human down to its organs. There will be no telling it apart from anyone else. It's great that this information is introduced early because once the questions about who might or might not be the creature, we're not bogged down with questions of how. We already know that.The dog wanders the enclosed hallways of the camp for a day, and there's something to be said about the dog's performance. I guess I wouldn't have thought of this if I hadn't had my most recent watch of this film with my visiting mother (the movie was her idea) who noted it as we were watching, but there's an eerie quality to the dog. It's too calm, collected, and still to be real. How it steadily wanders the halls, eventually choosing a room to go into, or how it stands perfectly still at a window looking outward is off-putting. Anyway, after a day roaming the camp, Mac tells the dog handler Clark to put the dog with the rest, and things go pear shaped quickly. Alone with the sled dogs, the creature changes shape into an amorphous set of tentacles, jaws, and flesh, spraying dogs with liquids, grabbing them and absorbing them while chaos erupts.This points to another of the film's great attributes: the creature effects. Done by Rob Bottin (with some work by Stan Winston), the creature work is amazing. The wide variety of manifestations of the creature represent months of work, and there's a fleshy, other-worldly quality to all of it that unites them as one. Everything changes from one situation to the next, but they all feel like they're part of the same thing at the same time. My favorite is the variety of effects that make the head independently crawl away from the burning corpse. So well done and creepy.To get to that moment is a series of steadily increasing doubts that each man has about everyone else around them. It becomes obvious that no one can truly trust each other, especially after the doctor proposes a blood test that would identify the creature and the store of blood gets sabotaged. No one knows who does it, but suspicions are directed in some specific directions at the same time. An admirable element of all this is that we, the audience, are completely in the dark about who is or is not the creature, as much as anyone else in the movie, and it never feels like a lie. It never feels like Carpenter is artificially keeping information from us, even though we see the moment that leads the dog to infect the first person in the camp but we can't see who it is. It never feels like a lie to us. Instead it feels like we're reaching the edges of perception based on point of view that's pretty solidly set in the film. Most of it is told directly from Mac's point of view, though we do move in and out of it here and there, and it never feels like a cheat.That lack of clarity about who is who is the ultimate source of tension in the film. We're never sure if anyone can be trusted, and there are moments where we even begin to wonder about Mac, even though we've walked most steps along with him. The centerpiece of creating clarity amidst the confusion is the blood test scene where Mac takes blood samples of everyone and uses a hot needle to see if the blood will react violently in response. It's an amazingly tense sequence because we honestly have no idea what's going to happen. One of them, at least one of them we figure, has to be a creature, and we don't know who. We also don't know how its blood will react or how it will react if exposed. It's also remarkably cleanly filmed, providing a very clear sense of geography around the room that helps to hide some of the special effects when they pop up.There's a remarkable professionalism to the filmmaking in general here. That's a way of saying that this movie simply looks great. There was something about the generation of filmmakers that came about in the 70s that gave them this great combination of old school aesthetics with new school sensibilities. Like how Coppola's The Godfather is rather perfectly framed from beginning to end but focused on a more grounded, dirtier, and more detailed violence than gangster movies of the past, Carpenter's The Thing has the roving Steadicam shots of a new filmmaker while framing several men in small spaces without every losing sight of the focus of the scene, helping to keep the variety of men separate in our minds. This extends into the special effects sequences where the detailed puppets are filmed in the perfect light to keep them looking real and terrifying at the same time.And what do I think of the ending? Both are human and are going to die a very cold death. They won, and they will die heroes in the cold.",

            "content": "I've of course seen this film many many times before, edited for TV, on VHS, laserdisc, DVD, and now in crisp HD, and am happy to report that John Carpenter's classic horror film still holds up today as just as shocking, grotesque, claustrophobic, and as scary as hell as when it first came out in 1982. Also, my favorite line in the film still holds up. \"I dunno what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off.\" Without spoiling too much of the plot, Kurt Russell is part of a US outpost in Antarctica who encounter an alien life form that kills and then assumes the form of outpost members, leaving those still human unable to figure out who is friend or foe, ALA \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\" A remake of the Howard Hawks produced \"The Thing from Another World,\" Carpenter ups the suspense tenfold by not having one alien terrorizing the isolated team, but has any and all of the characters a potential enemy. It's utterly chilling when at one point a desperate Russell tells the group, \"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human.\" Members of that team are played by an excellent and varied group of actors who include Keith David (\"They Live\" \"Pitch Black\"), Wilford Brimley (\"The Firm\" \"The Natural\"), T. K. Carter (\"Runaway Train\" \"Southern Comfort\"), Richard Dysart (\"LA Law\" \"Being There\"), Richard Masur (\"Risky Business\" \"My Girl\"), Donald Moffat (\"The Right Stuff\" \"Clear and Present Danger\"), and other character actors you'd know their face if not their names. The script is credited to Bill Lancaster (son of Burt), and is his only original film script outside of \"The Bad News Bears\" (arguably the greatest sports film of all time) and an okay sequel, \"The Bad News Bears Go to Japan.\" The script is efficient and stripped down in a way that perfectly matches Carpenter's directorial sensibilities. When this film originally came out it was considered wildly gory in its graphic violence, courtesy of special effects wizard Rob Bottin. SPOILER ALERT! I remember my mind exploding the first time is saw the a head extricate itself from it's burning torso and then sprout spider-like legs to escape. The same can be said for the chest cavity opening up to bite off Richard Dysart's arms, and for so many other wild moments that are a result of Bottin's truly monstrous creations. All of this is masterfully shot and edited by Carpenter and crew. The crisp, stark photography by Carpenter's regular DP Dean Cundey, who'd later go on to work regularly with Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard on high profile Hollywood films, is absolutely dynamite. And enough cannot be said for the score by Ennio Morricone, which interestingly sounds more similar to a John Carpenter score than most Morricone scores. Morricone at this point had done some work for Hollywood films (\"Days of Heaven\" and \"The Exorcist II\"), but this is the film that really started landing him bigger Hollywood pictures such as \"The Untouchables\" and \"In the Line of Fire.\" It's also fun to watch rewatch this film if you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino's \"The Hateful Eight\" due to Tarantino's many nods, intentional or not, to Carpenter's film. Overall, if there was ever a perfect marriage of science fiction and horror, \"The Thing\" is that film. And if you ever want to have a vigorous argument with me, let's start a discussion about what is the most perfect horro film of all time.",

            "content": "In an era where nearly every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being remade for audiences weaned on horror flicks of today that are not too terribly good, it is instructive to look back at John Carpenter's 1982 opus THE THING, which itself is a remake--of a childhood favorite of the director's, Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi/horror classic THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not initially that big a box office hit when released in mid-1982, it has since garnered a very large following.In fact, Carpenter's film is less of a remake of Hawks' film than it is a reworking, as he goes back to the original idea posited by the source material, namely the John W. Campbell story \"Who Goes There?\", in which a US scientific crew in Antarctica is menaced by a shape-changing alien thawed out from the ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who had starred for Carpenter in the director's 1979 TV movie ELVIS and the 1981 film ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, heads a cast of stalwart character actors, including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and Richard Masur, in this tension-filled exploration of paranoia, as the shape-changing \"thing\", which first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog a Norwegian team is trying to kill, takes over each of them one by one. It isn't long before everybody in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man. The ending of the film, in which Russell and David are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity akin to the similar codas to both THE BIRDS and STRAW DOGS.Almost universally, when the subject of THE THING is bought up, the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects make-up and alien designs created by Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter on the 1980 horror classic THE FOG, and on Joe Dante's 1981 werewolf film THE HOWLING. These effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also be quite stomach-turning. But all of this would make Carpenter's film nothing more than a high-end splatter epic if the direction, the story, and the acting weren't up to snuff; and thankfully, each of them are. When he's not concentrating on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences, Carpenter builds suspense in the same Hitchcock-influenced way that informed his previous films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, with cinematographer Dean Cundey's prowling camera-work, particularly through the corridors of the station, a significant help. The acting enhances an already-fine screenplay adaptation by Bill Lancaster; and we are also given a taut score by Ennio Morricone, whose work on director Sergio Leone's classic 1960s Italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all, including of course Carpenter himself. THE THING also features additional fine visual effects from Albert Whitlock (who worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE BIRDS), and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and JAWS 2.Carpenter's film was not the success it could have been because Universal chose to release this graphic shocker a mere two weeks after it had released Steven Spielberg's far more family-friendly E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (not surprisingly, critics and audiences at the time favored Spielberg's excellent film over Carpenter's equally excellent but exceedingly different one). Also, most of the horror film box office business in 1982 was going to another Spielberg-produced film, POLTERGEIST. As a result, at a cost of $15 million, THE THING suffered from lack of attention in its time.Over time, however, many have come to see Carpenter's film for what it is--an extremely gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, done with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of its story. Though it is still quite gruesome, THE THING should be as much remembered for the skill by which the story is put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make-up effects; for it is the storytelling skill and the suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis.",

I didn't find it particularly scary or anything and would probably classify it more as a creature thriller more than horror but that's not a bad thing. The tension this builds is incredible, the way the characters all twist and turn on each other is intriguing and seems realistic enough to be believable. So this psychological aspect was completely unexpected for me and I loved that. Then there's the effects themselves which are mindblowingly good even to current standards almost 40 years later. The Thing makes me want to sing the praises and pine for the days of practical effects, when a movie could still look so good regardless of the passage of time or advancements in technology.This really was a remarkably good movie and my only disappointment is that it took me so long to see it. Any film fan should absolutely check this out, do themselves the favor of seeing this. It's a visual feast, the story is still strong, the performances are definitely there and it's just an incredible movie. 100% recommend.",

            "content": "When I first saw this movie at the ripe old age of 9, I was beyond terrified. John Carpenter's sci-fi horror masterpiece about a shapeshifting alien gave me nightmares for years. After another 30 years and about 50 more viewings, it isn't frightening to me anymore, but that hasn't diminished the value of this tense and suspenseful classic. The critics liked Starman more, and Halloween was more influential, but The Thing is John Carpenter's best movie \u2013 no frigging contest. Considering how many great movies Carpenter made in the '70s and '80s, that's saying a lot.In the late '70s and early '80s, the horror genre hit its peak. Ideas were still fresh, but the taboos that kept the truly horrifying movies like The Shining and The Exorcist off the screen were gone. Young directors like John Carpenter brought inspiration and energy to the medium. Without $100 Million CG animation budgets, directors were free to focus on storytelling and script. This is the stage in which the film industry found itself when Carpenter made The Thing. The script is almost air tight, leaving virtually no plot holes or loose threads, other than a couple of mysteries that are better left unanswered. The cast was perfect, and the direction was excellent. Most of the actors were no-namer types who didn't do much after The Thing, but there are no weak performances in this film. The soundtrack is also a huge asset to the film. I still get chills whenever I hear it during the introduction and over the closing credits.Best of all is Rob Bottin's absolutely incredible work on the film's visual and special effects. The monsters don't get a ton of screen time, but when they do, they are gruesome and horrifying. The practical effects in the movie still trump any computer generated garbage that has been made in the past 15 years. Although they are a product of a wild imagination, the monsters in the movie seem incredibly real, and because they seem so real, they are also threatening. In the recent 2011 prequel, the monsters simply weren't as scary, in large part because you couldn't shake the idea that you were watching a high-tech cartoon.The movie begins with two crazy-looking guys hunting a dog from a helicopter, shooting at it as it flees across the Antarctic. It is one of the best opening scenes of all time, drawing you in immediately. There is a whole rich backstory at work, and at the start of The Thing, you get to see the aftermath. After the dog incident, the story unfolds almost like a Lovecraftian version of \"Ten Little Indians\". Once The Thing is first truly revealed, the rest of the movie is filled with tense paranoia and fear. Adding to the tension is the extreme isolation of Antarctica, and the knowledge that nobody can come to rescue the scientists. All the while, we realize that these men are not the only ones in danger. If the Thing kills them all and escapes the continent, the world is doomed. At one point, The Thing also gives you the best jump scare in the history of film. I have introduced this movie to about a half dozen people, and the \"test\" scene has made somebody jump out of his or her chair every time.Another of the great qualities of this film is the memorable cast of characters. Even though there are lots of them, they all look, sound, and behave differently enough for you to get to know them almost immediately. After only one viewing, you can probably remember that there was the cowboy-ish MacReady, the cook on roller skates, the guy who loved dogs more than people, Wilford Brimley going crazy, the doctor, the weak-willed radio operator, the crazy guy, and the big tough looking black guy. Unlike almost every other horror movie with a body count, every death feels significant, because even minor characters are well developed.In my humble opinion, The Thing is one of the Top 10 greatest movies ever made, and the #1 movie of its genre. This is why the movie has such a strong cult following despite its lukewarm reception on release, and why if you see it for the first time, you will probably still enjoy it even though it is 30 years old. If you want to see the best of the true horror genre (i.e. not the idiotic slasher genre misclassified as \"horror\"), The Thing is absolutely essential viewing.",

The blood samples was being heated with a copper wire to see who's an imitation and one of the guys turned into a giant monster and that scene was really good too.

I like this movie because we got to be one of the boys in the film and because of that, we closely follow what they do and say and care for them. That's the idea! When the movie takes off, it is hard to determine who is who and when but one doesn't have time to figure it all out. The intensity prevents that and before we know it, we went along for a thrill ride! Kudos to everyone involved and a hearty well-done. I have a small gripe about this and the 2011 film. In the 1951 version, the head scientist goes without sleep for days during the whole \"thing\". I get it too. Who would want to sleep with this type of discovery. Also worth mentioning is they don't waste anytime trying to access the spaceship. Both the 1982 and the 2011 completely dismiss both the spaceship for exploration purposes and more investigating of the \"THING\" . Now ask yourself, wouldn't you want to see the inside of a spaceship from another world? Its weapons? Food? Clothing? Endless items? Finding and exploring the ship is one thing and understanding what we find is another. Who could sleep? Both films avoid going there. Shame too. In any event, the premise remains and holds like no other: A spaceship and its occupants. What do they want? Where did they come from? Wow!

            "content": "Before this adaptation of John Campbell Jr.'s novel, \"Who Goes There?\", came The Thing from Another World (1951). Many people liked it at the time for its effects and thought provoking story line. But, I'm not sure if anyone suspected someone could overpass it. John Carpenter, the director of famed slasher movie Halloween (1978), takes on this project and executes it without a hint of weakness anywhere. At least none that I could see which seemed like a real flaw.The story is about a group of scientists in Antarctica than happen to come across a perplexing and dangerous threat. The threat is a creature of unknown species that has the power to perfectly copy the DNA of any organism it comes in contact with. Because of this, it allows the creature to devour its prey very easily. Over time, this creates high tension amongst the men because no one knows who is really themselves. However, the one individual who does his best to keep his cool (pardon the pun) is R.J. MacReady played by veteran actor Kurt Russell.It does not surprise me that Russell is in this film. Russell began working with John Carpenter back in the TV movie Elvis (1979), and they continued to make movies together since then through the 1980s. Along with Russell is Wilford Brimley (better known for having a mustache but shaved for this role), Richard Masur, Keith David and so on. Through the whole film, each actor gives their best performance in displaying the sheer terror in not knowing who is human and who isn't. But like most fans, Kurt Russell is the star of the movie and he puts in the best out of all performances because he's able to keep calm.Besides Kurt Russell, another notable part of this film is the overall set design and special effects. There are only a few places where a viewer can tell that it's not real but it won't matter because it will complete the whole picture. As for creature effects, Stan Winston is the main reason why everything worked so well. The gore is absolutely horrendous. It's not like tons of blood are being thrown everywhere but it's not pleasant either. The sounds are just plain icky and imagery is gross. Oddly enough, what impresses me even more, is that by the end of the film, the viewer still won't be able to give a good description of what this creature's original form truly looks like. It really just is, \"the thing\". There's no other way to explain it.The final touch to this film that really strikes fear into most viewers is Ennio Morricone's haunting film score. The instruments that play a big part in each track are the harps, flute, violin and bass notes that repetitively beat in the background. If that kind of music were to be played on a dark night in an alley or dim lit subway, I would feel very uncomfortable. But the reason why it is so much more effective in this setting is because besides the base that is man made, where else can one run? Antarctica is no beach walk. That's the scary part. This movie isn't in it for the jumps and shouts - its goal is to make you feel terrified. A true horror piece.John Carpenter's version of the 1951 film increases the gore, the terror, the musical dynamics and brings in a great cast to boot. Not for the queasy.",

            "review_title": "A classic with its practical visual effects, great influence on similar works, its atmosphere of tension and for bringing a narrative that so well develops its conflicts",
            "content": "\"The Thing\" (1982) is one of the greatest classics of the sub-genre of science fiction called Cosmic Horror, and one of the most acclaimed works of director John Carpenter. It can be considered at the same time a remake of The Arctic Monster (1951) and a readaptation of the short story Who Goes There? (1938) by John W. Campbell, the screenplay by Bill Lancaster follows an American research station in Antarctica that is threatened by a strange alien parasitic species that assimilates living organisms and imitates them, creating an exact copy of it, thus generating an atmosphere paranoid of who is really human among those men.The film follows a group of twelve men in the remote Station 4 of the US National Institute of Science. After they shoot down a Norwegian helicopter that was trying to kill a dog, pilot J. R MacReady (Kurt Russell) offers to travel to the other base and try to find out what was going on. Upon arriving at the scene, he realizes that an alien capable of transforming into an exact copy of its victims is among them and everyone could be a possible threat.Allied to this, the director had a competent team that helped create the entire suspense scenario that the film carries since the beginning. Starting with the soundtrack by Ennio Morricone, which opens the film by introducing the tone of the story. The beat of the synthesizers, which soon mixes with the noise of the helicopter, helps to create a feeling of strangeness. When the public realizes what the shooter has in his sights, the mood is not one of action, but that something is wrong. This union between diegetic and non-diegetic sound, extends throughout the narrative, keeping the tension always high.The Thing is characterized almost as an exercise in genre, and naturally does very well in that sense with the sure direction of John Carpenter. There is no concern in developing most of his characters, since we see MacReady (Russell) from the beginning of the plot assuming the exclusive prominence of the story, when in the first sequence he is seen isolated from the rest of his team, and we realize his impulsive behavior, but also leadership, as basically none of the other men question his actions or his orders. Thus, the deficiency in the characterization of those people would not generate the well-known identification in the viewer, however, this is not what happens, since the script ends up betting well on the construction of paranoia and fear, curiously giving each character the same importance in given moment of the movie, since anyone can be the thing.The screenwriter Bill Lancaster's (\"The Bad News Bears\") goal was to work the chaos - he wastes no time in building the conflict, which starts to affect everyone with just a few minutes of production - and to bring a minimum of depth while the plot. Advances. If it works on the one hand, it also makes none of the deaths-except that of the dog-have any more significant importance. The atmosphere of paranoia owes a lot to Dean Cundey's setting work. The filmmaker's well-known cinematographer - they had previously worked together on \"Escape from New York\", \"The Fog\" and \"Halloween\" - it is he who transforms the research base into a cramped and claustrophobic environment. The corridors narrow with the camera angles, and towards the last act they look more and more like a maze. In addition, close-ups help create the feeling that danger can be anywhere. Even with the dark corners continually appearing, Cundey doesn't hide the being, showing just how horrible the threat is.And it is precisely the creature that holds the visual tension of the film. The creation of then-rookie Rob Bottin, the monster is the essence of H. P. Lovecraft, which matches the film's aesthetic. The scene in which one of the team members is sucked into the belly of a contaminated companion put Bottin's name in the circle of special effects stars - in the following years he would start a partnership with Paul Verhoeven and be responsible for the makeup of \"Seven\". Here, he manages to synthesize evil as something that cannot be defined and helps the characters' continuous feeling of delirium.The film addresses themes of subjectivity and human relationship in a genre film. Films that, even using a usual theme that is invasion and alien possession, were not what people were looking for in cinema in 1982, the year of their release. In fact, the slasher was at its peak, with sequels to \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Friday the 13th\", films that were sensational at the time and were not concerned with existential questions. The film was not successful at the box office and with critics in the year it was released, largely because of the changes made by the director in view of the first adaptation of the short story, \"The Thing from Another World\", an American film from 1951. In the same year \"E. T\" was released, a much more commercial and family-oriented film, which ended up helping to take the focus off Carpenter's work. In 1982 Ridley Scott's \"Blade Runner\" was also released, another film without much repercussion at the time, and, like \"The Thing\", gained a survival when released in the home video industry and today is worshiped by those who dare to watch.In the opening credits we see a spaceship crashing on a planet that looks like Earth, the date on which this happens is not specified. Right in the foregrounds, we are set in the snowy immensity of the desolate Arctic. We managed to have a very precise definition of space, this is important because this isolated environment will be essential in creating the feeling of despair and hopelessness that the film gives us. The director uses shots that lend themselves to showing the environment, and aligned with a dark and unusual soundtrack composed by Ennio Morricone, but with great influence from John Carpenter's synth horror, we have already identified this space as a threat in itself.The atmosphere of tension and discomfort that the soundtrack gives us takes on another dimension from the moment we get to know the characters who work at the station. The camera several times uses the dog - which was being chased in the opening credits - as a narrative tool following the premises and helping with the development of some characters. Even with the montage giving us a docile air of the animal, we remain apprehensive and questioning due to the initial scene in which the Norwegian helicopter chases it. From the initial incident, Windows (Thomas G. Waites), who appears to be a communications technician, tries to report what happened to the outside world but is unsuccessful. Meanwhile, MacReady (Kurt Russell) and Dr. Blair (Wilford Brimley) go to the Norwegian station in an attempt to get answers. They come across the abandoned and destroyed station. In a certain room they find a holed glacier, and soon determine that something may have come out of it. Among the bodies found, there is a strange, bizarre humanoid creature, here we can see an explicit example of how body horror will be used in the film. They take the disfigured body when they return to the American base, and after an autopsy, it is confirmed that it is a human.The film feeds the feeling of fear until we are introduced to the organism. The purpose of the unusual scene is to shock, whether by gore or gore. Practical and animatronic effects are used in most moments where we really see the creature in its multiple forms and bring some iconic and disturbing scenes to life. In most of the clashes and dialogues, paranoia is placed above the sense of collectivity, this is successfully conveyed by the direction and ambiguous performances. Due to the naturalness and closeness of the characters, we can see that they have been there for some time. But from the moment it is not known where the threat, the urgency and the will to survive the creature will come from, these relationships are put into play.With a very curious central theme - contact with the other can make me sick - and a good exploration of the threat in an environment that should offer security, Enigma from Another World is one of those films that hold us from beginning to end and leaves us horrified in several moments of its projection. The ambiguous ending, another hallmark of the filmmaker, is also present. And here, with a special touch of irony, which concludes without needing to close, opening parallels with the investigation at the beginning in the Norwegian base. The dialogue between MacReady and Childs in front of a bonfire and seeing the station on fire is uncomfortable and to some extent nihilistic. Not knowing which of the two is infected, they decide to wait and see what happens.The Thing is that feature that became a cult. Among its greatest qualities, the idea of a creature without a definitive face is surprising. After all, it manages at the same time to highlight to the viewer the danger and mistrust between all the characters. And when she does appear, her plastic effect of teeth, tails and tentacles is strong enough for a visual horror that bears a strong resemblance to the writings of H. P Lovecraft. Even being a remake of another feature from 1951, The film manages to create its own atmosphere that undoubtedly marks the feature. Also very well for the technical components, such as the direction and the closed environment, as well as the soundtrack, which insists on distressing and \"errant\" sounds during the narrative. John Carpenter's film is considered a cult classic today for all the impact it has had on the horror film industry over the years. With its practical visual effects that have become a great influence on similar works, its atmosphere of tension and for bringing a narrative that so well develops its conflicts.",

            "content": "Carpenter actually managed to make his \"The Thing\" far inferior to its predecessor , the 1951 \"The Thing From Another World\". If you have read my comment on the latter you may know what I'm talking about, but the fact remains that you cannot make this sort of movie based purely on some cheesy monster, it has to be character driven first; that's why \"Predator\", the whole \"Alien\" franchise and some other monster movies work. And what does \"The Thing\" have to offer; well not much; Kurt Russel is his hillbilly self, taking the leader role from the very start and the rest of the cast doesn't amount to much either. The best part of the whole movie is the opener which really got me thinking and hoping what Carpenter had in store, but it just proved to be a disappointment. The movie also excluded some of the best scenes from the original, like showing  the discovery of the space ship. The 1951 movie made that scene very thrilling, showing less than more, making the viewer yearn for a glimpse but never getting one. And don't get me started on the monsters; the comments I read from the IMDb users make you want to think the effects are better and scarier than anything you've ever seen, but the honest to God truth is I'd choose even the original creature from \"Alien\" any day. There are just so many things popping and bursting out of those creatures it's hard to swallow, and the head-turn-to-spider scene is a real gem when it comes to idiotic comedy. Plus it shows just how much the special effects creators were influenced by \"Alien\" which came out only a couple of years ago; the thing even lived off of the same thing, it needed a host and then it just ate whatever it could find. There were even similarities with the whole blood scene; alien's was acid, this one just lived forever and didn't like fire. I thought Morricone's score was quite good, the whole 5 minutes of it which I'm guessing is one of the reasons it got a Razzie nomination. Ha. Overall, a movie that doesn't pay much tribute to the original, nor does it manage to surpass it, not by a long shot. Not enough atmosphere, a poor script and a bad climax don't amount to much and probably the most inventive and positive thing in this whole mess is the very ending, which reminds us \"The Thing\" is definitely a Carpenter movie, sadly just not one of the better ones. 5/10",

            "content": "The Thing contains pretty much everything there is to love about horror and to this day is easily one of the best films of the genre. For starters, it is scary, no question about it. The film is able to create a terrifying atmosphere and combines it with a sense of paranoia and dread from the first frame. The dark and moody tone continues throughout the film and builds off the ever increasing amount of suspense and claustrophobia. It doesn't take too long either for the things to get freaky; extremely freaky! The cast is another thing that's well worth mentioning. They bring humanity to the characters with vivid life and even a bit of humor. It's Kurt Russell though that really shines. He's as good as he's ever been,\nsarcastic and unafraid, making for a milestone in his career of performances. The elaborate special effects though are the undeniable highlight of the film because they leave absolutely nothing to our imagination and push the boundaries of gore to their very limit. It's the stomach-churning visual excess and outright disturbing use of realism that make this film so horrifying. This is the movie that shows you how to love the horror genre and appreciate its relentless desire to be as unpleasant as\npossible. Bloody, creepy, frightening, shocking, and very wellacted, The Thing is a horror classic full of grotesque effects and chilling scares.",

            "content": "The easiest kind of horror these days are obviously clich\u00e9 fests overloaden with cheap jump scares. All of which require little in the way of intelligent writing or cohesive storytelling. The Thing (1982) however, takes us back to a time when psychological and intelligent horror films were in abundance, and this is definitely one of the best in that regard.The Thing is undoubtedly one of the scariest movies ever made. There are very little cheap jumpscares, since The Thing focuses on the most difficult kind of horror to create; The psychological. The scare-factor in The Thing is simply because of the combination of excellent framing, eeriness in atmosphere and ofcourse the haunting soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. The extremely disturbing roar for 'The Thing' also contributes to the terrifying feel of it. All of these factors give the audience an uneasy and on-edge feeling that both enhances the tension significantly and creates a haunting atmospheric feeling. Ofcourse the practical effects ( Possibly the most discussed and praised aspect of The Thing ) are also a significant factor in the creation of actual fear and disgust throughout this film. When comparing these special effects to those of a later prequel, The Thing (2011), a painstakingly obvious verdict is that the latter's overuse of CGI really looks phony, ridiculous and not at all scary in any way. You could call the practical effects of The Thing (1982) absurd, and that is exactly what it was going for. The practical effects look disgusting, haunting and menacing. Besides which, the 'Thing' was shown far too often in said prequel, as opposed to the little screen time in this particular film, which significantly drains the tension as the psychological side of a largely unseen 'thing' is about the most intelligent feeling of unease one could get. That is why this is more than just a mere 'monster' flick, as the emphasis is on the tension and paranoia instead of the actual gore.As stated before, the original soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is an absolutely haunting piece that breathes fear ridden atmosphere like no other. A sense of hopelessness, paranoia, and a literal mimic of a human heartbeat are all present in the score. The opening scene of a helicopter attempting to shoot down a dog/wolf while Morricone's score is playing is quite possibly one of the most absorbing, haunting & beautiful opening scenes ever made.The acting is excellent, which is ofcourse a pretty rare thing in a horror film. There isn't a single weak performance visible, and a unique stand-out has to be the half dog, half wolf actor Jed. Never looking at the camera or crew, while maintaining this sense of alienism in him ( Especially the scene where he is first lead to the kennel, followed by his haunting wall-stare ), truly make it seem like this is the actual Dog-thing. Characterization is not as thorough and in depth as for example Alien (1979), but none of the characters are forgettable and each acts according to their personalities. Most of the characters are shown to be resourceful and intelligent, since they quickly figure out the Thing's intentions and origin, as opposed to the usual stereotypical horror dumb characters. There might not be much interesting in terms of the narrative itself, but The Thing's strength comes from the way that the situations themselves are filmed, and director John Carpenter purposely left a lot of key events off-screen, to feed the eager anticipation of the audience even more, and leaves us wondering, just like the characters, who to trust.With very little over the top exposition and a superb flow of visual storytelling ( Like the scene in which 'twoface' revives and assimilates someone, which is shown with a slight movement beforehand while blood starts dripping down, as opposed to ham fisted dialogue ), The Thing is indeed an intellectual piece of horror filmmaking, and Carpenter was ofcourse one of the best in the business at this regard. There is a lot of purposeful ambiguity ( Especially in the much discussed final scene ) which only enhances the paranoid and unknowing feel the audience receives.The Thing is one of the most frightening films ever created, and does this through superb direction and tension building, extremely disturbing and terrifying practical effects, but above all, the creation of paranoia and inner fear and mistrust. When you analyze the situation our characters are in, there are very little films that have a more terrifying premise, since this alien organism is disguising itself as a normal human being, and could be anybody next to you at any time. Thus it is definitely one of the greatest horror flicks ever created.",

Though I knew that the dog was infected by The Thing from the start, the movie still had its suspense and paranoia for 100 minutes. While I agree that the special effects and the grotesque visuals were amazingly creative for a movie made 40 years ago, I think the movie's strong suit lies in its writing. The script is airtight and Mr. Carpenter's direction doesn't allow us for any room for breathing. Everybody is at constant paranoia and doubt of each other in the isolated Antarctica camp, and such fear does not feel forced or arbitrary. The only one that the audience is certain that is not infected is MacReady, because he is the main character. However, the character does not feel like he's invulnerable because he's been put at plenty of danger, even the suspicions of his own teammates. His fate remains unknown as he faces Childs, whom many argue online that is the final Thing, which I agree with.Music was also another nice touch, composed by the legendary Ennio Morricone, which I just realized he passed in 2020. I was so out of things at that time. RIP to the legend. I'm very glad I got to watch this movie now. Certainly a milestone in the movies of the 80s.

The setup is standard stuff, establishing that the characters are isolated and can expect no help from the outside but it is the realization there could be an alien among them, and any one of them might not be human, is what launches The Thing into a spiral of escalating tension. The quest to identify the alien consumes about half the movie's running time, and includes several red herrings and the gripping blood test sequence in which MacReady uses a hot wire and samples of everyone's hemoglobin to clear some members of the crew and damn others. The final confrontation with the alien, despite providing the most grotesque special effect of the movie and allowing plenty of pyrotechnics, is anticlimactic. Then again, after the extended suspense of the middle section, it's hard to see how any resolution could rise to that level.

            "content": "Watching John Carpenter's The Thing, I was reminded of how good a filmmaker he used to be.  In the 1970's John brought us Assault on Precinct 13, Elvis and one of the most profitable and copied films of all time, Halloween.  In the 1980's he was involved with no less than 8 films including Escape from New York, The Fog, Big Trouble in Little China and Starman.  However, it was his 1982 release of The Thing that is most revered in the new millennium and now it is re-mastered and re-issued on home DVD.Based loosely on the original 1951 film, Thing From Another Planet, John Carpenter set out to remake the film keeping only a few of the original ideas in tact.  To ensure success, John assembled an A-list of B-list stars including Wilfred Brimley, Keith David, Richard Mauser and Richard Dysart and circled them around best friend Kurt Russell (Escape from L.A.) in an isolated compound in the Arctic. The film begins with an encounter with a Norwegian group of men who are trying to shoot and destroy a dog from their helicopter.  The chopper is soon destroyed and the Norwegian killed, so Kurt (Mac) and the others set out to discover the origin of their visitors.  Upon arrival at the Norwegian camp, they discover dead frozen bodies and a block of ice that seems to have transported something to the compound.  Outside, they find the burned remains of a creature that has human-like qualities and they inevitably bring this hideous piece of flesh and bone back for examination.  \nIt's not long before the dog they took in exposes itself to the group as an alien lifeform that can take on the identity of another being, and soon one by one, the humans become victims and hosts to the alien's intentions. \nShot almost 23 years ago, I am amazed at how the special effects still hold up today.  The creature effects by Roy Arbogast (Jaws, Return of the Jedi), have not been bettered by new technology and the scene where Norris (Charles Hallahan) has his chest collapse and literally loses his head and we watch it grow spider legs and run out of the room, is as potent and memorable as John Hurt's creature birth in the original Alien.This movie had a lot of things going against it in 1982.  It had a cast that consisted of only men (not one woman appears in the film), it had effects deemed too gory for the times and most importantly, it was released the same year as Steven Speilberg's cute alien movie E.T.  However, where E.T. ,upon present day viewing, shows signs of dating and blue screen special effects, The Thing continues to show like it was made just yesterday with precision and craftsmanship.  The movie has a sense of claustrophobia and urgency and its end, which is far from Hollywood typical, might leave room for a sequel possibility, but not with the same cast of characters.  I also appreciated that John Carpenter did not fall prey to the typical horror film ending that we are now so accustomed, where just when you think it is all over, the killing entity gets one last cheap fright out of the audience.The 90's and post 2000 have not been kind to Mr. Carpenter.  He has directed such stinkers as Ghosts of Mars and Escape to L.A. and Body Bags, and John's reluctance to work under the Hollywood umbrella of a major studio and budget now show with his cheesy effects and locations.  However, he and Kurt Russell can look back proud to the summer of 1982 when they put one of the best horror films in history on celluloid.",

The Shining and Exorcist are also coined the same thing, which are actually scary. It had a great plot. I loved the whole mystery thing it had going on, not knowing what 'it' is. And it was made by John Carpenter. He's the director who has created the iconic character of Michael Myers and made the classic horror film. So with all these added up, I was really excited to see what was to come. It had all these things that had it coming, but here's the biggest shocker: it was horrible. The Thing has all the components of a horror film, and the strangest thing is that it uses them, but for what reason? So the beginning was done fantastic. My expectations were huge, kept me wondering what this film could do. Ready to be scared off my seat. But maybe my expectations were too high.. Carpenter thinks he can create an eerie feeling throughout the entire thing, which he's half right/half wrong. The sense of paranoia IS there, but it just dies down every time something happens. Carpenter also takes the gimmicky effect of gore itself, and uses it to make these far-fetched images, that he thinks will scare us, but then comes off a bit silly. One scene was this guys turn into some crawling creature, which way back in 1982 would surely look stupid. And it does. And Carpenter's vision of aliens itself are just absurd. I imagine aliens as short, green fellows with one eye and a laser gun; the stereotypical vision of them. Carpenter thinks they are shape-shifting guys that we never get to see. And that's the problem with me. Carpenter uses the gimmick to not show the aliens, which sort of comes of as a mixture of stupid and curiosity, but for me? I sat in half-confusion, half-bored. There was no sense of tension between the characters, and the slow-burn pacing never helped either. So I wouldn't recommend The Thing. It's cracked up to be one of the greatest horror films of all time, but it never ever shows this. It's was boring, slow, pointless, and tension-less. It's not even one of those horror films that you want to watch with your friends, because all you would be doing is watching the gross-out scenes that seamlessly go nowhere. If you loved Halloween, and hate the gimmicky effect of gore, The Thing will be hated by you. If you hate Halloween, love gore, love horror movies that come out today, then this is your sort of film. I didn't like it, my opinion, my fact. The end.4/10.",

It takes a liberal stand in exposing the tension of men when confronted with an alien . Based on the novel by John Campbell , the screen-writer Bill Lancaster rejects out the hand the idea that the alien might be worth attempting to understand or communicate with research team . Thrilling and intriguing musical score by the maestro Ennio Morricone . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Dean Cundey . \u00a8The thing\u00a8 produced by Larry Franco emerges as distinctly Carpenter movie and one might be recommending for its FX , masterfully made by Rob Bottin . B-Film or not , though it's still a masterpiece . The earlier first version results to be \u00a8The Thing from another world\u00a8 by Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks with Kenneth Tobey , Margaret Sheridan and James Arness as the monster ; it holds a subtle but efficient intrigue . The modern version is The Thing (2011) by Mattijs Heijmingen with Eic Olsen , Ulrich Thomsen , it serves as a prelude to John Carpenter's classic 1982 film of the same name in which a Paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has traveled to the desolate region for the expedition of her lifetime. Joining a Norwegian scientific team that has stumbled across an extraterrestrial ship buried in the ice, she discovers an organism that seems to have died in the crash eons ago.",

            "content": "Let's start with the good: The special effects are fantastic, the actors are good (despite what they have to work with) and the over all setting is good.So why do I dislike it so much? First of all, the characters have very little personality. Besides their work and their mood, there isn't much to define them by. Bennings and Garry are supposed to have been friends for ten years, but you wouldn't ever have guessed so since you never hear about them actually having known each other that long until Garry says so. When somebody dies, nobody seems bothered. Garry is the only one making a halfhearted attempt to not make Macready burn Bennings body... only to join in and watch Bennings burn. When I first saw the movie, I was confused as to why nobody suspected Garry be a monster... who would be so casual about their best friend for ten years dying? After Bennings is burned, Garry never mentions him again as if they never met. It's also kinda ironic that Macready is the one calling Bennings \"George\", but Garry never does.And the characters are so unbelievably stupid. Of course there is always somebody ending up alone or walking off alone, making them at risk to be contaminated. And in the end, they have figured out the only one who could possibly be contaminated is Blair. They have figured out flamethrowers will kill the monsters in just a few second. They have figured out that staying together is the best option. So what do they do? They split up to look for Blair and they blow up the whole base with dynamite! So of course someone dies because they walked alone, but then they realize they will freeze to death because they blew up the whole base. Which they didn't need to since Blair was underground! Who thought that was a good idea? Of course they never actually show a scene where they agree it is a good idea..Overall, if you can look past the glaringly obvious stupidity of the movie (everybody keeps walking off alone all the time despite knowing they can get contaminated), the lack of character development (if any), then you got an action-packed movie with an eerie setting and some of the best special effects of its time.",

It's powers are extraordinary and the staff find themselves in a fight for survival.This remake of the classic Howard Hawks film `The Thing From Another World' takes the guts of that story - improves some things but loses others. Obviously the film greatly improves the special effects and frights provided by James Arness in 1951, however it does so at the loss of some of the suspense of the original.  This still has a great feeling of paranoia about it that filters through everything.  The story is basic but it has plenty of chills at the start, but once the effects start we see everything and it's more gross than chilling.That's not to say the effects aren't good.  They still look good now - despite being 20 years old!  It's telling of how much work went into this to reflect that effects wizard Rob Bottin was checked into hospital with exhaustion once the movie was finished.The cast are all pretty good.  Russell is a good lead, although this is more of an ensemble piece than a star vehicle.  The cast are gradually whittled down until they reach the ending that is not only downbeat but subtle and intelligent.  It's flawed if you think about it too much but it works really well after so much gore.Overall it'll never have the classic status of the original but it is definitely a good example of a modern sci-fi that is almost as good as Alien in terms of atmosphere and thrills.",

It is virtually indescribable, even to one who has seen this film multiple times and that is what makes it so good. A similar film, 'Alien,' three years before this used the same formula or darkness and setting to create tension and the monster was also elusive, but here, the Thing isn't just elusive and predatory. After watching the film you should know what I mean.Essentially this film is a near perfect balance of psychological as well as visceral horror. The tension of the film is only equaled by the terrifying carnage and that, my friends, makes for one horror film that you cannot afford to miss. 10/10Rated R: graphic violence/carnage, horror, and profanity",

It's a reinvention and is largely better than the earlier version. Kurt Russell and a group of scientists working at the North Pole become prey to a shape-shifting alien that has the ability to look just like any one of them, and the real tension in the film comes from the mens' increasing inability to trust one another -- after all, who's an alien and who isn't? This adds an effective punch of psychological complexity that was missing from the 1950s version, which presented itself as a straight-up monster movie. In John Carpenter's version, the paranoia and claustrophobia that develops from being trapped in your own worst nightmare are as scary as any of the oogie-boogies running around in the snow.But the film relies too much on its gross-out effects, which no doubt looked state-of-the-art in 1982, but which look silly and dated now. Carpenter didn't take to heart the lesson he taught audiences in 1978 -- that a person's imagination is going to cook up something ten times scarier than anything a filmmaker can actually show you on screen.This is a worthy addition to the horror canon, but its quality has been overrated by fanboys.Grade: A-",

This is a man's and a big boy's movie. And for this reason alone no man should ever miss out on this film.Maybe John Carpenter felt under pressure and had a hard time making it (so I read somewhere). But looking back there is no doubt in my mind, now as then, that The Thing is a wonderful Masterpiece (big thumbs up from me).And that was the review\u0085But IMDb need more words to accept a review, so therefore I will continue:When The Thing first came out I was already the biggest John Carpenter fan ever on planet Earth. So no wonder that I went for the first screening a Friday at 12:00 noon at the (at that time) second biggest screen in Copenhagen, Denmark (Palads cinema screening room 1). Dolby Stereo was still a new thing back then and when the film faded up in a hand held panoramic wide shot of the cold ice at the South Pole together with the heartbeat drum of Ennio Morricone the tense atmosphere was set and ready. I knew from the first twenty seconds of the film that I was about to watch a Masterpiece and I also knew that I wasn't going to be disappointed\u0085 If you have never watch The Thing and there is a given chance (somehow) that you in the near future of your short life will have the chance to watch this Masterpiece on a big screen in a cinema, you should wait for this option rather than watching it on DVD or whatever digital media you can find. That is if you want to experience the initially Oomph that this film's first scene brings to its audience\u0085In any regards all big boys and men should see this MAN FILM !!!",

There is literally nothing I would change about it; everything from the setting, to the characters, to the pacing is perfect. This movie manages to have an entire crew of distinct personalities and is anchored by the phenomenal Kurt Russell and Keith David.But let's be real, the star of the show is the The Thing. The practical effects here are legendary at this point. The creative, disturbing visuals and artistic/technical mastery on display here is truly awe inspiring. Honestly, nowadays they throw hundreds of millions of dollars at visual FX, but few movies leave the impression this one does.The Thing as a character is purposefully vague and underdeveloped; it's a being that humanity would have no reference to. It's supposed to be mysterious; the trap that so many movies fall into is over explaining. Here is the perfect example of not doing that. It's kind of amazing to consider how generic the original \"Thing\" was - a hulking humanoid monster - vs the creative genius of this version.The Bad: There are a couple of weird visual FX here and there (the Thing is shown in stop motion briefly towards the end) and I do wish we got more time with Blair and saw how he got infected. But those are pretty minor.The Ugly: The Thing is Carpenter at his best. It's amazing to consider how great of a run he had in the 1980s. Yet, to also reflect on how this movie bombed back in the day. It's a masterpiece, probably the best remake ever and one of the best horror films in the American canon.",

            "content": "The story is very smooth. From the beginning, the Norwegian drove a helicopter to chase the dog for thousands of miles, which caused suspense. Why on earth was such a big deal? And at that time, I discussed with the male ticket that this dog's behavior is not \"dog\", and seeing people do not wave their tails also has a sense of alienation. This question was quickly answered, it turns out that this is not a dog at all, but \"the thing\"\nBehind the monsters gradually showed a fierce look, using psychological warfare to kill the scientific research personnel one by one and make everyone self-endangered. The picture is also bloody and full, there are many classic monster deformation lenses, and even some unique beauty. The scene of the doctor's electric shock to save people really shocked me. It was a completely unexpected scene.The blank space at the end is also just right. Is the black team member who returned suddenly a monster? The tired protagonist was paralyzed on the ground, thinking that the monster was finally resolved, but did not expect despair to strike again.And I think the settings of this film are more frightening than aliens. For the aliens, I always have a sense of separation from reality, because the spaceship / alien looks / story background and other settings let me always clearly know that this is not true and will not happen. The strange setting is that the monster will absorb you, imitate you, and eventually become the real you. This setting makes it very easy to extend, what if the monster escapes quietly? Is it true that there are many \"the things\" lurking in the society that are gradually eroding human beings, if our surroundings are already occupied by such monsters? We never know. This is the biggest fear this film brings to us.",

But worse, a \"flying saucer\" was incredibly cliched in 1982, even more than now. But far worse, it looks like the Jupiter 2!The second big problem is the Norwegians after landing the chopper. It gets borderline slapstick. Tossing the grenade back instead of the pin, destroying the chopper. Then the Norwegian marches through the camp and is shot, again in a slapsticky way.I get the idea, it's to show the Norwegians have lost their minds for some unknown reason. To me, it seems like the Norwegians following and shooting at the dog from the chopper quite effectively conveys this. I don't get paid the big picture bucks, but I would have had the chopper never land (they are terrified of the dog) and they just scream at the Americans as the dog runs to them when they start petting and protecting it. Then, the chopper crashes for some reason.",

            "content": "John Carpenter's The Thing is an amazing (horror) movie. With an outstanding cast, unbelievable special effects, an eerie Antarctic setting and a creepy score, The Thing is one of my absolute favourites and one of the most gruesome, scariest horror movies made! After a group of Norwegian scientists uncover some sort of aircraft in Antarctica, a deadly shape-shifting alien escapes. A group of American scientists are also in Antarctica and soon enough the alien has found them and begins to wreck havoc on them as they each get more suspicious as to who is human and who is the Thing! This is a remake of the black and white The Thing From Another World. Although it takes more from the short story 'Who Goes There?' John Carpenter has created a timeless sci-fi/horror classic. The cast (Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat and Charles Hallahan) are great as the scientists who soon begin to turn on one another. The special effects are the highlight, though. They are outstanding and are much better than any CGI you'll see. They are sickening and not for the weak-stomachs out there. The score (although not done by Carpenter) is still very much like him, it is eerie and it sets the mood perfectly. The Antarctic setting gives the us a feel of isolation and the' can't escape' feel.Surprisingly, this didn't do well when released. Probably due to Spielberg's friendlier E.T. But today the cult status and fan base is huge and it's thought of as one of the greatest horror movies ever made. This is recommended for any fan of sci-fi, horror or Carpenter.5/5!",

The movie continues its sense of disquiet for a while, letting you worry without quite knowing why.Unfortunately, after that the movie becomes focused on special effects and explosions. The characters are generic, the story is a little muddled, and some of the most effective scenes are also the least realistic. For me, the most interesting thing about the movie was how much Kurt Russel looked like someone from the band the Bee Gees. I always think of his as Snake Pliskin, but here, in spite of an authoritative role and bushy beard, his baby face and blow-dried hair make him look like a Hollywood actor pretending to be a tough guy. I wish they'd made him a little scragglier. To be fair. I didn't care much for the original movie from the 1950s either. So perhaps this is just not the story for me.",

That night, bewilderment turns to terror when the dog abruptly mutates into a howling tentacled beast \u0085John Carpenter's remake of The Thing is one of the best science-fiction/horror movies ever made. It's better than the original, much more faithful to the short story it comes from, is extremely well played by a fine ensemble of character actors, features incredibly inventive and horrifying makeup effects, and is an utterly riveting suspense yarn about distrust and paranoia taken to the ultimate level. Scary stories tend to break down into two distinct types; the externalised campfire story, where the monster is out there (Jaws, Frankenstein) trying to get at us, and the internalised Edgar Allan Poe confession, where the monster is within us (Psycho, The Exorcist) and trying to break free. This movie is a perfect example of the latter. The Thing is both a slimy alien creature waiting to eat us but also a metaphor for pretty much anything you like (cancer / xenophobia / nature gone mad). The first half maps the scientists' discovery of what's happening, and the second pulls all the tension out of the situation as they snap, bicker, point accusatory fingers and fail to follow through on half-hearted plans of action. The 1951 movie is a model of men behaving with calm organisation in a desperate situation. This film is much braver, as it depicts a little society splintering into pieces and self-combusting; rarely does a film revel so much in tragic misanthropy. Carpenter's films deal again and again with isolation as a main theme, both celebrating the individuality of the lone hero but mostly reinforcing the grim reality that we are all ultimately alone. On a technical level it is a stunning film; the base and its snowy exteriors are brilliantly realised by designer John Lloyd, and Dean Cundey's fluid, unhurried photography is dazzlingly beautiful, all frozen blues and fiery oranges. The eye-popping effects by twenty-two-year-old Rob Bottin are nothing short of astounding, as dogs mutate into nightmarish beasts, a man's stomach turns into a gaping maw, a disembodied head grows spider legs, and flesh and blood dissolve into plant-like monstrosities. These elements, combined with a creepy low-key Ennio Morricone score, create a tremendous realism to what would otherwise be a totally insane story, and the end result is a powerful, disturbing, terrifying film. On its release, this movie had many critics, most of whom could not see anything beyond the special effects. Some who did also argued that the story is confusing and badly plotted - when and how do Blair and Palmer get infected, what happens to Fuchs and Nauls, does Norris even realise he's been taken over, who framed MacReady with the shredded clothes, and always, why don't we find out what happens in the end ? This for me is perhaps the best aspect of the movie - the answer to any of these questions is we don't know, and that's the entire point. The movie is about not knowing what's going on, not knowing who you can trust, not even knowing if you're human or not; that's what real fear is, and few movies show it, but this one does. Watch it, and figure it out for yourself. Based on a great 1938 novella, Who Goes There ?, by John W. Campbell Jr. Trivia - the dog/Thing in this movie was played by a malamute/wolf half-breed called Jed, and for my money he gives the best animal performance in all cinema; a lot of Oscar-winning stars could learn from him.",

            "content": "John Carpenter is certainly an interesting film director. Most of his films are often hated upon release and then years later, are considered cult classics. That would be the case with 1982's The Thing which I consider to be more based off of the original story \"Who Goes There?\" and not the 1951 film, The Thing From Another World. I have not read the story or even watched the 1951 film. With that being said, when this film was released, nearly every one hated this film. But, years later, people now consider this film to be one of the best John Carpenter films and one of the best horror films of all time. This is notably one of the few John Carpenter films to not be scored by John Carpenter himself and rather was scored by the late Ennio Morricone. The film notably stars Kurt Russel in one of his many roles in John Carpenter films, Keith David (who would later star in They Live, and Wilfred Brimley (famous for the diabetes commercials that are so nostalgic). This film would later see a soft reboot/prequel in 2011 titled The Thing.The film follows a group of American scientists who are stationed in Antarctica. One day, some Norwegians are in a helicopter and chasing a dog. The Norwegians die and the Americans are left with this dog that they know nothing about. But it isn't a dog and the Americans learn that very quickly. The Americans learn what this thing is and they start to grow suspicious of one another....I am going to be honest here. I do not believe that this film is John Carpenter's best film. But where do I start? This is a horror film and a good one too. I do enjoy the setup here. You have a group of people who are in the middle of the Antarctic and they cannot trust one another because of what this thing can do. It is quite scary when one goes and thinks about it. One can really feel the tension between the characters in just about every scene and that there is genius. But where this film fails is that nothing comes out as really really scary and if your gonna call a film the greatest horror film of all time, it has to be really really scary. That being said, there are a few instances where there are jump scares and are fairly effective. But what this film wants to rely on for scares is in it's special effects. Now, the special effects are really good and even hold p to this day for the most part. Sure, there are a few instances where you get that smooth, rubbery look but it is not too often where that occurs. The effects are grotesque and are not for the squeamish. But the effects are really fun to look at and one can tell what hard work has been put into them. Many people who grew up with this film can say that the gore in this film has really had an effect on them and I will admit that it is one of the goriest films I have seen but I have seen some (and they are not necessarily horror films) that are much gorier. What is really interesting is that this is the first Carpenter film (and so far only one that I have really seen so far) to have a lot put into special effects of this magnitude. I was at first disappointed to find out that Carpenter did not do the score for this film. But, when I found out that the late Ennio Morricone scored this film, I was excited. This film's score is really good and uses ambiance and it is one of the best film scores in a horror film. Now, here is where I find the film lacking and maybe I am just being a straight up film snob here but, the characters are not written well at all. Upon release, this film was seen as a late Alien cash in. Yes, Alien is the better film and an amazing film at that. Alien had a cast of characters that were developed fairly well and each character is likeable in their own way. In The Thing, the only character to get developed is MacReady (played by Kurt Russell) and even still he is the hero character. Yes, Russell has that charm to him, but there has to be more to it than that. The characters are not all too interesting and if they have any traits, it is the usual traits like the comic relief or crazy person or what not. The only reason why I would like any of the characters is because I am fairly familiar with the actors that portray them and I am not saying I hate the characters because I do not. Typically this happens in a few Carpenter films but I can most of the time overlook this like in They Live (but that is more because it is a cerebral type of film). But this is kind of hard to overlook because you can have well developed characters in a film like this. On a final note, this film has some great cinematography. I love the scenes shot in the dark because they fit well with the tone and I do like the lighting in those shots (for example when there is flares or even a flamethrower) which help create shadows which look really nice in this film.The Thing is a good film and was fun to watch but for me it falls short of being the best horror film of all time and even the best John Carpenter film.",

            "content": "\"The Thing\" is based on SyFy author John W. Campbell's classic novella, \"Who Goes There?\"which was first published in 1938. Thirteen years later, in 1951, Hollywood film director Howard Hawks released \"The Thing From Another World.\" Hawks knew he had a terrific story with Campbell's frightening little Antarctic saga. And so did filmmaker John Carpenter. Thirty one years after Hawk's film, in 1982, John Carpenter unveiled \"The Thing.\"Carpenter had previously dazzled the film industry and secured a fierce loyalty among movie fans when he introduced \"POV handheld tracking shots\" in Halloween (1978). The Halloween horror film franchise, along with his various excursions into science fiction, would cement Carpenter's fame, and provide him with some well deserved respect as a screen writer and director.\"The Thing\" was made when technology such as CGI special effects was quietly evolving, but not yet practical for some filmmakers. Nevertheless, lack of certain technologies only served to fuel Carpenter's creativity, and many of the special effects in this film were so groundbreaking (and shocking to audiences) that contemporary filmmakers became inspired by his mixture of \"old school\" and \"new school\" innovations. Indeed, some particularly graphic scenes are unforgettable; images I first saw in 1982 are still quietly burning in the back of my mind. And unlike Hawk's black and white version, Carpenter's version was released in jaw-dropping color, with the story and plot lines far more faithful to Campbell's original novella. Carpenter perfectly captured the very human emotions of fear and paranoia, themes which helped to further define the genre of science fiction horror films.\"The Thing\" follows a group of American scientists working in a remote and desolate Antarctic research outpost. Their work is suddenly interrupted by a couple of visibly determined men in a Norwegian designated helicopter who are attempting to shoot a clearly frightened looking Husky Sled Dog. After a few missed shots the dog luckily finds shelter in the American research camp. Both Norwegians (the helicopter pilot and shooter passenger) are killed during the pursuit.With so many lingering questions, the Americans quickly decide to explore the Norwegian camp which is several miles from their own base camp. What they find at the Norwegian's decimated campsite is both repulsive and frightening. Shocked and thoroughly stunned, the Americans return to their camp. Within a few days their previously boring but peaceful research center becomes a nightmare of horror, fear and paranoia. It is then that they learn the Norwegians had discovered a crashed spacecraft as well as what is apparently could have been the ship's pilot. Both the saucer and its pilot are firmly encased in frozen, ancient Antarctic ice. The researchers conclude that the alien may have either been thrown out of the saucer upon impact, or had been injured in the crash and was attempting to crawl to safety before being frozen solid by the -100 below freezing temperatures. Either way, it's a stunning find.What happens when they bring the body of the flash-frozen alien back to their camp for further study is a perfect example of classic science fiction and horror, broken up with carefully placed moments of droll but effective humor. And it all works, indeed, it works extremely well!The fine cast includes screen veterans such as Kurt Russell, Wilford Brinkley, T. K. Carter, David Clennon, Keith David, Richard A. Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Peter Maloney, Richard Masur, Joel Polis and Norbert Weisser.There would be one more \"Thing\" remake to follow Carpenter's version: The somewhat gory but interesting version by Dutch filmmaker, Matthijs van Heijningen Jr., \"The Thing,\" released in 2011. As of this writing (2022) John Carpenter has recently hinted he is considering filming a new sequel.No spoilers here as usual, but I will reveal that because of the film's industry and fan \"buzz,\" nearly all of the actors that ended up in this movie became instantly Hollywood elite. Carpenter had a enviable budget of $15,000,000 to make \"The Thing\" (by comparison, in 1977, \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\" had a mere budget of $11,000,000). For \"The Thing,\" Universal Studios attempted to attract and secure some of our Hollywood's biggest stars for the all male cast. These names included Jeff Bridges, Nick Nolte, Sam Shepard, Kris Kristofferson, Nick Nolte, Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Peter Coyote, Fred Ward, Isaac Hayes, Tom Berenger, Tim McIntyre, and John Heard. All of the actors or their agents had been contacted by the studio, but they had either turned down the project or were simply unavailable.",

            "content": "It is a debate that my buddy Jack and I have been having for decades now: Which is the better version of \"The Thing\"? The original classic from 1951, actually entitled \"The Thing From Another World\" and directed by Christian Nyby (and, it is conjectured, Howard Hawks), OR the 1982 remake directed by John Carpenter? People who know me, and of my love for all things pertaining to 1950s sci-fi, as well as my dislike of unnecessary remakes, will perhaps be surprised to learn that I have always been the champion of the latter film. The original, I have long maintained, is a slow-moving, overly talky affair that is only sporadically punctuated by a few bursts of excitement. Its overlapping dialogue, although realistic, is often incomprehensible, and its central monster something of a letdown, as played by James Arness with clawed hands. But perhaps my central attack on the film is the fact that it is hardly in keeping with John W. Campbell's terrific novella of 1938, \"Who Goes There?,\" on which it is based. Campbell's Thing was a shape-shifter that could assume the identity of any person who it assimilates, and his tale was one of intense paranoia, with none of the men in the Antarctic station near where the Thing had crash-landed sure of any of his fellows' true identity. The original film threw out that shape-shifter angle and instead turned the Thing into a vegetable humanoid; a \"walking carrot,\" as one of the characters calls it, which for me has never been nearly as frightening a proposition. My opinion of the '51 film, to be fair, was ticked up a notch recently, when I got to see it on the big screen in a brand-new print that both heightened the visuals and made those overlapping sentences easier to follow. And to be honest, that original film still does contain two scenes that are amongst the very best of '50s sci-fi: the one in which the scientists form a circle about the perimeter of an alien spaceship buried in the ice, and the closing scene, with one of the characters telling us to \"Keep watching the skies.\" Still, there is that walking carrot. Anyway, my feeling has long been that Carpenter's remake, which does indeed present the Thing as a shape-shifter, is both far more intense and closer to Campbell's vision. I had only seen this remake once before, with my buddy Big Al on a stormy afternoon, at home, back in the late '80s, but had never forgotten its power. And a recent rewatch has only confirmed for me which film is the superior shocker.Carpenter's film opens with a most memorable sequence, as two men in a Norwegian helicopter pursue a Malamute sled dog across a snowfield in the desolate Antarctic, firing at it with a shotgun all the while. Their pursuit ends in disaster when they finally land at the Americans' National Science Institute, Station 4, with its 12 male occupants. One of the Norwegians is killed when he attempts to chuck an explosive at the fleeing mutt, while the other is shot down by the station's commanding officer, Garry (Donald Moffat), in the belief that the Norwegian has gone mad. The poor mutt is taken in by the Americans and placed in a kennel with other dogs...a big mistake, as it turns out. Before long, that mutt is seen to slowly and horribly change, absorbing its fellow canines and morphing into some kind of alien monstrosity. It is quickly flamed out of existence and later autopsied by the group's biologist, Blair (Wilford Brimley). The station's chopper pilot, MacReady (Kurt Russell, who had already appeared in Carpenter's cult classic Escape From New York and would go on to star in his Big Trouble in Little China and Escape From L.A.), and the station's doctor, Copper (Richard Dysart), fly to the Norwegian base and find it deserted, except for an incredibly yucky-looking humanoid who looks to have been burnt to a cinder. Before long, and after discovering the remains of a crash-landed spaceship that had been buried for 100,000 years in the ice (yes, a scene that rivals the one in the '51 film), the truth becomes apparent: What they are dealing with is an alien shape-shifter who can assimilate any of the men on base and replicate them perfectly. Can any of the men trust any of the others now? Who is a genuine human, and who an alien monster? And there are more dire matters to consider, as Blair discovers. If allowed to reach civilization, this Thing, within 27,000 hours, could conceivably take over all life on Earth....The promotional poster for the remake of \"The Thing\" proclaimed it to be \"The Ultimate In Alien Terror,\" and Carpenter & Co. surely do bust a literal gut here to make the film a horror to behold. The special FX by Rob Bottin (who had worked on Carpenter's \"The Fog\" a few years earlier) are truly remarkable; both disgusting to look at and fascinating to behold. And indeed, this is surely not a film for the squeamish, the viewer being treated to such visuals as an arm being stitched in close-up, a shotgun blast to the face, that horrible-looking corpse at the Norwegian station and the intensely gross autopsy of same, finger slittings, and, most famously, the \"chest chomp,\" in which Copper's arms are bitten off by the alien creature as he performs a defibrillation on what he had believed to be a fellow human. Every manifestation of the Thing is both horrible and hypnotic to behold; you will not believe when the creature's stomach starts to sprout mouths, or when the head of its latest victim sprouts spider legs and begins to crawl away! Carpenter's direction is typically intense; the script by Bill Lancaster (whose only other screen credits are for two of the Bad News Bears movies, of all things!) is taut and no-nonsense; the film's score by the maestro, Ennio Morricone, is atmospheric and memorable; and the cinematography of the picture by Dean Cundey (who had already worked with Carpenter on both \"Halloween\" and \"The Fog\") is just gorgeous to look at. Filmed in part in the Tongass National Forest in Juneau, Alaska and in Stewart, British Columbia, this film really does convince the viewer that he/she is in the frozen Antarctic. The film is what the Campbell novella originally set out: a self-contained crucible of intense paranoia and mistrust. And it is never more intense than in the scene in which the men, to ascertain who is what, submit to a blood test; a scene taken straight out of the Campbell work. In the film, as MacReady takes a heated wire and dips it into each blood sample, the viewer waits in tense expectancy. And when MacReady finally does dip that wire into the alien blood sample, the viewer will most assuredly jump out of his or her seat. It is a supremely well-done scene, followed by an appallingly horrific sequence of events, and this segment of the film alone easily excels any single scene in the original film for intensity and scares. The Thing here is a true monstrosity, hardly a walking vegetable, and whereas the 1951 picture would dish out maybe two scenes in which the men confront their alien menace, the 1982 film gives us many, including a socko and explosive conclusion. Kudos to Kurt Russell here, for his terrific portrayal of the icy MacReady, and to the filmmakers who decided, after much back-and-forth deliberation, to end their film on a note of distrust and uncertainty.\"The Thing,\" after its June 25, 1982 release, proved to be only a fair performer at the box office, pulling in around $20 million after being produced for $15 million, but to be fair, it had a lot of competition in the theaters that summer. \"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\" had been released the month before, and its cute and cuddly alien would help turn it into a box-office megasmash. On June 4th, \"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\" had been released, to the great delight of all Trekkers everywhere. And on that same June 25th, Ridley Scott's future cult item \"Blade Runner\" was released, as well. Of those four films, \"The Thing\" would result in the most critical lambasting, both for being an affront to the original and for its yucky visuals. But the years would be kind to it, and the film today is revered as something of a classic in its own right. And to be quite honest, I quite prefer it as a work of cinematic art over both \"E.T.\" and \"Blade Runner,\" although hardly as much as \"Trek 2,\" which I still love to bits. This most recent watch of the remake has only confirmed my long-held belief that while the original film does have much to offer, talky and static as it is, Carpenter's vision is the one that I prefer. It is a film that puts the viewer through the proverbial wringer, and the after effects of watching it will linger for days. Yes, the 1951 picture got there first, and will forever be deemed, justly or not, as a classic (and no, it does not even crack this viewer's Top 10 Greatest Sci-Fi Films of the 1950s list), but the Carpenter film is the one with the power and the scares. It is one of the very few remakes that I find preferable over the original (another remake favorite of mine is the 1941 version of \"The Maltese Falcon,\" by the way), and that should tell you something....",

And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over-styled parodies. And there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending, or cameo celebrity appearance, or lame pseudo-romantic subplot.And I REALLY miss on-set physical effects; with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. In the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, An American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Company of Wolves, A Nightmare on Elm Street...what an era for horror effects! And don't get me started on the death of matte painting. The matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless.What do we have now?

Campbell Jr. novel it was based, with an updated screenplay by Bill Lancaster (son of Burt), and directed by John Carpenter (Halloween, Starman), this is a special effects extravaganza. Basically an alien ship crashed to Earth, and then we see a helicopter circling an Antartican snowfield, trying to shoot a dog, and this is where American researchers work in their facility. They let the dog into their facility, but what they don't realise is that it is an alien copy, and it is only when they see the remains of a mangled body they discover and realise this \"Thing\" can transform and take the appearance of anyone amongst them. Everyone is now a suspect, because they don't know who is the \"Thing\", and one by one, the unlucky few are suffering the horrific terror attacks to it. The only way to determine the alien is taking blood and putting it in a dish, to see reaction to a hot needle, and they have to make sure all other remains of it are with it to be destroyed. Starring Kurt Russell as R.J. MacReady, Wilford Brimley as Dr. Blair, T.K. Carter as Nauls, David Clennon as Palmer, Keith David as Childs, Richard Dysart as Dr. Copper, Charles Hallahan as Vance Norris, Peter Maloney as George Bennings, Richard Masur as Clark, Donald Moffat as Garry, Joel Polis as Fuchs and Thomas G. Waites as Windows. It is almost unbelievable to think that absolutely every effect in this film was created by animatronics, no CGI whatsoever, and you have to remember that things and people are being ripped apart, and they still move! The story is good, the acting is as good as you can get, and the special effects, what can I say, a good horror classic. For some reason it was nominated the Razzie for Worst Musical Score for Ennio Morricone, I'll admit it isn't amazing, but it's not that bad. It was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments.

            "content": "'The Thing' was one of those big cinematic blind spots for me. This film like many cult classics didn't enjoy critical or box office success at the time of its release, but has gradually over the years become a very popular and loved movie. This was my first viewing of the film and my review is based on a single viewing.I don't think it is possible to watch 'The Thing' and not get reminded of Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. Both films came out in round about the same time within a span of 3 years. Both films are about a team of people isolated in the middle of nowhere being hounded by an alien monster. However, 'The Thing' didn't impress me anywhere near as much as 'Alien' does every time I watch it.Let me first point out the elements of the film that I liked. The practical effects that are on show in the film are some of the best ever put on screen. There are moments of sheer terror due to the convincing nature of the practical effects. Another positive aspect of the film is that John Carpenter really knows how to build up the tension. He knows how to subtly move the camera or hold a shot for just the right amount of time to create a sense of dread in the mind of the viewer. Another great aspect of the film is the dog that we meet right at the beginning. Carpenter somehow got the dog to perform as well as any animal I have ever seen perform on screen. My problems with the film stem from the lack of depth in the script and lack of depth in the characters. 'Alien' works so well because it has so much going on underneath the monster film surface. It is a commentary on the gradual loss of human qualities in the age of capitalism along with the exploration of disturbing themes like rape and unwanted pregnancies. Unfortunately I did not find any subtext in 'The Thing'. I have read some articles where people have tried to find an allegory for the Cold War, but I just didn't observe any depth in the screenplay to think along those lines. Another huge problem is that I found the characters to be very bland with no depth what so ever. In 'Alien' we don't get much back story about the characters either, but Ridley Scott used multiple scenes where we found the characters engaging in small talk and being as realistic as possible allowing us to relate with them. 'The Thing' has almost no quiet scenes where the characters are talking about ordinary, banal stuff. That just didn't make the characters interesting enough and since the characters weren't compelling enough, I found myself losing interest slowly and at the climax of the film I really got bored.As I wrote earlier, this review contains my opinions about the film after watching it once. I might change my stance with subsequent viewings. But right now, I have to say 'The Thing' left me underwhelmed.",

I guess it's slightly unfair to judge with hindsight as the special effects are made less spectacular by the fact that we have seen them in Alien. What puzzled me most was Morricone's soundtrack which sounded is exactly like the music Carpenter himself composes. Why hire someone to copy you?

They are a twelve man research team in Antarctica and have discovered that a shape shifting alien is capable of imitating anything and infects and imitates its host. If it reaches civilization, it could mean the extinction of all life on planet Earth. The special f/x by Robert Botin are state of the art and truly remarkable. The tone of the film is stark, apocalyptic and dead serious. The atmosphere is cold and tense, enhanced to great effect by Ennio Morricone's brilliant score. Performances by the cast are very solid and another one of my favorite actors Keith David also appears and gives our lead, Kurt some competition as alpha male of the show. Keith David also worked with John Carpenter on They Live, another classic and huge favorite of mine. This was the first film which John Carpenter refers to as his apocalypse trilogy. The three films have nothing to do with one another, but deal with a potential end of the world situation in different ways. The other two films are Prince Of Darkness and In The Mouth Of Madness which are both very good as well. The Thing is one of his best films and you can feel the coldness and isolation as this group of men struggle for survival on this Antarctic glacier.

Kinda strange the (early) 1980s are this far away already. Anyway, I see there are several versions out there, but the most common one, also the one I saw the other day, is the one that is slightly closer to two hours than to 90 minutes. The language is really English from beginning to end with a very tiny amount of Norwegian early on. But really just minimal. This is considered one of the best and most famous film by director John Carpenter, a bit of a horror film icon, but I hope it is not really one of his best because that would mean that the many, many films he made are mostly genuinely mediocre or even weak because I am not particularly impressed by this one here at all. But I shall get to that a little later. The two writers were Bill Lancaster and John W. Campbell Jr. And they are both deceased now unfortunately. Lancaster was still fairly young here and died at an early age 15 years after this movie and Campbell was about as old as Carpenter is today, so he would be 110 now, which of course did not happen. For both of them, this film is by far their most known career effort. As for the cast, you will not find many familiar faces either. The one big exception is of course lead actor Kurt Russell. Or he is the closest to a lead maybe, also because of his character, from this ensemble cast. He is also first credit. He was 30 here. Keith David also deserves a mention. He won three Emmys and Russell was \"only\" nominated for one, but yeah feel free to check out everybody's body of work if you care what (else) they did. They were no rookies and acted before and after this film of course, but no performers that you recognize immediately and remember the name. On the crew members I will not elaborate in detail, but most did a fine job. Nothing to complain about for example in terms of costumes or sets.I think the bginning was really solid when we have that dog run away from the guy trying to kill it out there in the Antarctica. Of course, you wonder what is the reason for this absurd scenario and it is maybe an even better watch when you know the story and are maybe not watching the film for the first time. This is pretty much only the introduction though. The Norwegian guy is killed as the Americans think he has lost his sanity and is a loose cannon and this is also one of not that many graphically violence movies. We see very briefly that the bullet went right through the Norwegian's eye into his head on one occasion. Oh well. I guess this was one of the moments they removed from more family friendly versions of this film. Or would have removed. I don't know if those exist. The one I saw the other day had all these inclusions and I am glad it did. What happens is pretty much expected. The Americans try to find out what was going on. We see them move to the Norwegian's polar station and they see they are all dead and now they also understand something terrible must be going on. It's really all about the drama and horror and maybe also thriller component here. There aren't many moments where you will smile and probably not a single moment during which you will laugh. The absurdity of this cute dog (I love huskies!) carrying the virus though and how we see it sitting/lying there peacefully on several occasions was one of the (to me) lighter moments because such a contrast between the dog's kindness and what was really going on inside him. The first escalation really happens when the dog is together with the other dogs and basically transforms. And from that moment on, also with everybody from the crew witnessing that, the tension is there from beginning to end.However, this is not one of these films during which we have a character die every ten minutes. On the contrary. We do have people dying early on too. I mentioned the Norwegian and there's one or two other crew members infected and killed by the beast. By the thing. But basically everybody is still alive before the big final sequence in which they really go all in. This is where (almost) everybody dies though. In-between, it is also about suspense and coonflicts between the crew about who could be infected and we see how they do not trust each other at all. The best example is when they stand up against Russell's character because they think he is the one who carries the thing inside him. We never know. Unfortunately, this also resulted in some cringeworthy and gimmicky moments. Honestly, there were parts during which the dialogues and delivery felt really hammy. I cannot deny it. It's not (just) Russell, but the other cast members and you can see why almost none of those became truly successful actors and really famous in the long run. In general, this is a film that goes over the top on too many occasions for my liking. I will not mention every example, but it was pretty bad for example during one scene when we see several (four?) cast members on the screen at the same time. And with what they say and how they say it. And then there is the idea that Russell's character may be infected because no way he in his human form could have managed something spectacular before with the temperatures out there. Or you can also take the chess computer scene and how Russell's character makes sure he wins in the long run after being defeated initially. That was admittedly still a bit funny. There were way worse alpha male moments later on. I guess this was actually meant in a funny way because this was long before the creature showed up at the polar station.What I liked about the film was a bit of the scientific aspect. The idea of the protagonists that they wanted to use their blood to mix it with other blood to find out if one of them is infected, even if the idea that the blood they stored there was contaminated and the suspense arising from it did not really win me over. But also the actual experiment by Russell's character then showing us he is not only the strongest, but also the smartest man in the room was one of the highlights the film had to offer. In addition to that, I also liked how the creature was depicted there. It was scary, yet felt pretty creative and for 1981, it was really convincing as well. Thumbs-up for that and a key aspect in the film's favor that had me decide in the end that the film deserves the positive recommendation. It was a pretty close call to decide after I watched this the other day to be honest. I was not really won over and there were definitely moments and sequences where I was in favor of two stars less than I actually gave it. The soundtrack is by the legendary Ennio Morricone by the way. I did not know that before either, but yeah he was not just very talented, but also very prolific and not everyone can be a winner. I did not like the soundtrack here too much. It felt pretty generic for a horror film movie and nothing stood out. Sometimes it was also too loud for my taste, but this may not have been his fault. The ending was another letdown. We have alpha male Russell (or I should say his character) survive and (surprisingly) he is not the only one there and he and his buddy just sit there now and wait basically. Also went a bit against the idea that was really shoved into our faces before that they will all die in the process and for the good cause of the thing being defeated. But Carpenter (or most of all his writers) did not pull through with that.So yeah, not much else to say here. I don't think the film has aged particularly well to be honest and I find it baffling that this is comfortably inside the imdb's highest-rated 250 films of all time. For me it is maybe among the best 250 films from 1982, certainly not from the 1980s and also probably not even from the first half of the 1980s. Could be that I lower my rating on rewatch at some point. But probably not. Another thing that caught my attention is how long hair for men was still a sign for masculinity back then. Russell gives us the vibe of a tough male lion here, especially when he executes another member of the crew who attacks him. There they tried to bring in some conflict of morals as we find out said crew member was not infected. Meh.. did not work out too well. But what I actually wanted to say is that if you look at Statham, Diesel, The Rock, Bruce Willis... and their hair, you see that perception there has really totally changed. Speaking of genders (yes, they do exist, sorry), this is also a really rare movie that did not have any female cast members. Well, except the computer voice. Admittedly, she was the only one able to defeat Russell's character on one occasion. Not too many female crew members either. For a new version, they would have squeezed one in for the sake of #metoo I guess. Bad enough. Even if I am curious now about the recent (but also not new anymore) film with a trio of actors I appreciate. One of them is a (stunning) female of course. That's it. Nice to see the husky from early on had a really, really long life affterwards and also made a return to movies a couple times. Oh and Carpenter also has a really tiny cameo in here. All in all, this film gets a thumbs-up, but far from an enthusiastic thumbs-up. Also the beauty of the Eternal Ice was missing completely, which disappointed me a bit. Probably because the film almost never played outside. The elaborations on (especially one character) going insane in the face of the situation was okay. Nothing less, nothing more. Go watch this film. But go for may other instead or only if you are a Carpenter fan/completionist. I was clearly underwhelmed here. Not even in my personal top2500 I assume. Oh and I was a bit surprised to see several Black actors in this rather small cast. Not a given for 1982. That's it now really.",

It looks like the Norwegian base camp uncovered it to their cost. The Thing can ingest and then assume the form of any living being whether human or animal.In some ways John Carpenter's film is similar to Alien as the members of the base camp will be knocked off one by one, not helped that they seemed to be left alone or go out on their own too many times so they can be taken over by the shape shifting creature.The film actually starts out slowly and the characters are painted in broad strokes, in short thin characterizations. There are no female characters in this film but there are two black actors in the cast, one rather stereotypical who seemed to have walked in straight from the hood listening to Stevie Wonder. Rather a few of the characters including star Kurt Russell did not convince me that they were research scientists.What the film did have was gross out special effects that would had scared the hell out of people in 1982, it certainly scared me in that era.

The idea of being trapped in a building with no escape and your with a bunch of people and one of them is a killer but you don't know who? Terrifying concept!!! It was great to see all these palatable characters turn against each other in a realistic way. They weren't just cardboard stereotypes, they were realistic and interesting characters and it was scary to see them decay to paranoia. I was at the edge of my seat trying to figure out who was lying, and whenever an alien was revealed I nearly died from the shock. It's a shame that critics bashed the movie back in 1982 because it was too gory for their snobby old stomachs to handle. Who cares about the gore? The effects and gore are super good, but the real scary thing here is the tension. The Thing needs to be a lot more popular then it is. I had never even heard of the film before my film school and that's a huge shame because The Thing is now one of my favorite movies. I'm a senior in college now and I've seen it at least 10 times and own it on Blu-ray.",

Strong cast, the effects are great for its time and it over all holds it's creepy atmosphere it set out to have. I would recommend this movie to any horror movie buff, that love the whole monster/alien theme. The Thing does it, and it does it well. I am pretty excited for the prequel coming out next weekend.

If you don't get anxious and ask important questions about what exactly happens that we don't get to see, and when, during the course of this, then you, my friend, were not properly engaged, and, let's be brutally honest here, this film probably wasn't meant for you(and hey, that's no problem, nothing is for everyone). A lot of debate is possible over the answers. And that's part of why this is so enormously terrifying, and what keeps this working for the audience, even with many viewings. It's difficult to be certain. The plot is marvelous, and its progression feels natural without being predictable. The concept is well-thought out, interesting and fascinating, and the execution does not disappoint. The pacing is spot-on, there is not a misplaced moment to be found in this. When this intends to be, it is rather intense. The atmosphere is expertly crafted, and builds at the proper speed, never rushed. The tension is so thick you can practically *see* it. The gore is plentiful, and while quite frightening, it isn't the point, nor does it ever feel like it is. And whether you like them or not, ya gotta admit, they look pretty darn good for when they were made. All the special effects in this do, almost entirely on account of Rob Bottin, the newcomer who literally exhausted himself creating them. The key is the balance, how far you push the shocks, and John's got that down to a science. The humor is of the same type and close to the same amount as his usual efforts. The acting is average or above. The characters are sufficiently developed and varied. The dialog is well-delivered and well-written. The mood is helped by the brilliant composer Ennio Morricone, who applies his talent, and puts together music that fits Carpenter perfectly. If your nerves are not in tattered rags before this is over... see the beginning of this review. All of these things together... the isolation of the people and the setting, the long, claustrophobic hallways, the genuinely successful scares, the gruesome violence and the haunting, unsettling score... it creates a strong horror piece which still holds up today, and which manages to get jumps out of yours truly, after having watched it around a dozen times. The DVD holds a feature-length behind-the-scenes documentary and a commentary track with Kurt Russell and the director, who are cool to listen to together, and which is both entertaining and informative. The menus are a tad flat, and one can tell that the release was done years after this hit theaters. I recommend this movie to fans of all that were involved in making it... in particular the man who helmed it. 9/10",

            "content": "Carpenter is an outstanding horror-suspense director, but he simply outdid himself with \"The Thing,\" crafting a horror film rarely touched by any other in intelligence or quality of the ensemble cast. The film truly captures the horror of Campbell's short story, light years ahead of the 50s version, while maintaining the same fearsome idea: that there could be things out there that will take us over, absorb us, and we would not even really know. It's a hysteria that drove many 50s science fiction flicks, but by the 1980s it could be reduced to its pure essence, without that heavy-handed \"US vs. the Soviets\" thing.When I saw this in the theater in 1982, I felt queasy several times during the film. Yes, as in \"about to throw up.\" It was the uncanny realism of the special effects. It has been remarked that The Thing, and the special effects that embody it, are truly a living character in this film, and it is true. Rob Bottin, Stan Winston, Bill Sturgeon, and the makeup/creature crew did things that could never be done as realistically with CGI effect. And director Carpenter uncompromisingly selected only the best of it for the final cut, as anyone who has seen the \"deleted scenes\" can attest. Gone are any stop-motion animation or slightly imperfect scenes. The artistic triumvirate and its perfectionist director created the ultimate thing.The ensemble cast of characters, trapped in an Antarctic science station where a creature that absorbs all life forms in their own image gets them one by one, is amazingly good. Yes, Kurt Russell gets first billing and survives to the last, but every character, down to the Norwegian rifleman who tries to warn the Americans of their impending doom when a seemingly harmless husky trots their way, is perfectly cast and plays his perfect role in the grand scheme of things.The film scares, amuses, excites, spellbinds, disgusts, simply everything you could ask of a horror film. Every time I see it, I like it better despite knowing how every character will end, and how the web of dread, hopelessness and helplessness is cast to the bitter end by The Thing.",

            "content": "I find it quite remarkable that Christian Nyby's The Thing From Another World (1951) is always held up as an all-time towering sci fi classic, yet when viewed against John Carpenter's 1982 'remake' it is blatantly clear which version has the edge...and how *bad* the 51 movie actually is. I saw Carpenter's movie long before I saw Nyby's, so maybe that is why I'm biased towards the former, but let's face it, people, the original film is stagy, badly acted and horribly overrated. On the other hand, Carpenter's film is edgy, paranoid, brilliantly shot and perfectly performed. I'm not being paid to say this, my friends; like Mr Tarantino, I freakin' LOVE this movie.I suppose it helps that Carpenter actually chose to do an adaption of the source novella, Who Goes There?...Nyby's movie is really nothing like the book at all. William Campbell's often tripped-out 1938 story has been translated by Carpenter into an artifact of its' early 80s era. That is to say, plenty of gore, post-Watergate world-weary 'heroes' who react instinctively rather than earnestly, and a distinct lack of hope. One might almost call it the welcome antidote to the mawkish saccharine (another and wholly opposite facet of the early Reagan era) that was The Thing's box office opponent, ET.Carpenter in The Thing is light years from the rubbish he'd trot out after his last truly great movie, Prince Of Darkness (though In The Mouth Of Madness was a rare return to form amidst some truly lousy movies from Mr C). Here, he's the youthful, edgy, guerilla filmmaker with a touch of stoned poetry that made him the cult icon he is today. The direction is sparse but deft, showing great economy of movement and some of the best examples of 'directing lots of people in a tight space' work I have ever seen. Carpenter knows when to not direct and just let scenes play - he makes you think you are watching a tape of true events at times, just as our heroes do at one point in the story.And it's genuinely *scary*, too. Our scruffy band of Antarctic outpost scientist heroes are confronted by and trapped with a defrosted alien menace that can imitate any life form it encounters...and imitate it so perfectly that it seems that even the duplicates don't know they're duplicates. Our characters are forced into a nightmare where paranoia is actually a virtue, where you can literally trust no-one. There's one thing the creature wants, and that is to reach a populated area and begin an infection that could swamp the entire human race in just 27,000 hours....The oft-mentioned gore is pretty extreme, and there are numerous examples of sheer gross-out body horror. The most famous example has to be *that* bit with the defibrillator paddles- oh God, that bit made me jump out of my skin the first time I saw it. Leonard Maltin might claim that the 'non-stop parade of icky effects' are off-putting, but the grossness of the effects is the *whole point*, Lenny! This creature literally devours a victim, absorbs its' DNA and changes into the victim! To show this process as anything other than flat-out crunch-and-splatter would be..well, silly.Kurt Russell gives the performance of his career here as our hero, Macready; a shaggy-haired, alcoholic, sombrero-wearing chopper pilot who's the only one of our isolated protagonists who realises the truth -that survival is all that matters - in time to save himself. But that's not to say that the rest of the cast are slackers; each of the other 11-odd people in the all-male cast are top-notch. Wilford Brimley excels as the doomladen Blair, Keith David's his usual great self, and a nicely cast-against-type Donald Moffatt (remember him from Logan's Run: The Series?) gets the film's best line when he's tied to a chair.And who can go past Ennio Morricone's music? It's one of his last scores, and one of his best...a moody, pulsating collection of mainly bass tones that serves the same function as Bernard Herrman's slashing strings in Psycho - to heighten the palpable sense of unavoidable doom.There is literally NOTHING wrong with this movie, folks. Not a single false step in the whole flick - even the so-called 'cop-out' ending is perfect. It is up there with Alien and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers '78 as one of the three best sci fi horror movies of all time. Forget the RKO original, because it really is not very good at all.

What he did in remaking a 50's science fiction movie into a super horror movie was just genius. The story has these guys (and it is all males, not a female to be seen) at some sort of research facility in Antarctica, I think. They discover something that has been removed from the ice at another facility, having been led there after witnessing a helicopter chasing after a dog with the purpose of killing it. Well they explore the base and take said dog back to their base, which in turn leads to some thing moving about the facility. It seems to infect or take on properties of those it kills, it is kind of hard to say, but when you find it out it goes all out to defend itself making for some of the most gruesome special effects you have ever seen. I love the scene with the shock pads and the head, who can forget the head? The movie also has such tense moments as you do not know who could be the thing and the group of dwindling survivors gets more and more nervous and paranoid as their numbers go down. The monster effects would inspire a lot of horror movies and games, just look at the recent \"Dead Space\" video game for things that look like they came straight out of this movie. This movie would also be Carpenter's greatest movie, looking at this one wonder's how he could have made a movie as bad as \"Ghosts of Mars\". This is also one of Kurt Russell's best roles as well, he and Carpenter always make a good team and this movie makes for a good night of fear, suspicion and gore.

So few truly good films come out of this genre, this is one of those rare gems that sets the benchmark for excellence. I saw this movie when it came out as a young teen, it scared the s*** out of me in a way no horror movie before or since has been able to.John Carpenter's strength lies in his ability to create intense mood in his films, and \"The Thing\" is by far his best work in this regard. The musical score, the sets, the cinematography and the dialogue all work together in perfect harmony to create an incredibly eerie and terrifying setting for the viewers to be dropped into. You can feel the isolation and paranoia he creates almost as if you're trapped down there alongside the characters. The film brilliantly plays on some very core fears in the human psyche with chilling effectiveness.The buildup is purposely slow, and by the time the reality of situation the characters are in is realized, you feel like you're right there with them due to Carpenter's masterful ability to draw the audience into the film. The balance of tension is perfect, and keeps you feeling uneasy and frightened throughout the entire film.\"The Thing\" is extremely well cast, every actor delivers a solid and convincing performance of his respective character. Character development is a touch on the weak side, but it's more than ample for this particular film, and where it's lacking, Carpenter more than makes up for it with his ability to draw you into the events and setting of the film.The conventional special effects are top notch, even by today's elaborate CGI standards, and have aged quite well. Compared to the CGI alien from the disappointing 2011 \"prequel\", Carpenter's alien has the material substance and realism that computers just can't deliver, making it far more frightening and believable than its later CGI counterpart. Gory by any standard, but not depraved...some of the truly horrifying images created will stay with the viewer for a long time after viewing.Here's a personal example of exactly how effective this movie is...last Halloween I was showing my teen son and stepson different horror movies from my collection in an attempt to scare them. They are typical teen boys from today, jaded and desensitized by the constant digital bombardment they receive from video games and cable television. One movie after the next was shrugged off, laughed and yawned at. Then I showed them \"The Thing\".....both of them sat wide eyed and transfixed, not uttering a word throughout the entire film. 10 minutes after it was over they both still sat there silently, until my stepson weakly said \"that was the most terrifying thing I've ever seen\"....my son nodded and uttered an agreement. Neither of them slept well for a few nights following.Initial reception and box office returns in 1982 were mediocre, but the passage of time has allowed this film to be recognized as one of the true masterpieces of the horror genre, and an excellent film in its own right. It currently enjoys a spot on this websites top 250 films, and top 10 ranking on practically every online list of best horror movies. For best effect, view it alone at night, preferably with a good snowstorm raging outside.And remember,......\"it ain't Fuchs.....it ain't Fuchs\"",

            "content": "John Carpenter's update of 'Who Goes There' and 'The Thing From Another World' came out 31 years ago to seemingly little fan-fare and even less critical reception. Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.' released the same year was a more popular take on the alien invasion story. Apparently people weren't too keen on seeing hideous creatures from outer space wreaking havoc in the same way.Which is a shame, because 'The Thing' has a lot going for it. The opening sequence with a pair of Norwegians in a helicopter chasing down a sled dog, with the steady synthesized beat of the soundtrack, proves something eerie, and leads into a brilliant set up.Unfortunately, once things go wrong and sh*t hits the fan, the paper thin characterizations of the cast come to the forefront. All of these 'scientists' and researchers on this base are rather bland, and the viewer never gets a sense of having known these guys. For example, in 'Alien', you feel like there is real camaraderie among the crew of the Nostromo, with subtle rivalries and edgy small talk providing so much detail and backstory to their characters (much of it ad libbed). But in 'The Thing', you never get a chance to hear these guys talk, or develop as interesting human beings at all. The most you see is them playing ping pong or getting high. The only insightful one is Kurt Russell's \"Macready\". Everyone else is simply fodder for the alien.Carpenter seems to rely on mantaining the viewer's interest with the next highly inventive, but over the top special effects gore scene. Some say that \"the less you see, the more frightening it is\". Well someone forgot to tell Carpenter this on set, because each creature appearance is gooier and more in-your-face than the last. Even worse is the concept of the shape-shifting alien itself. It seemingly has the ability to transform into whatever shape with whatever powers it wants. A lot of it seems to depend on the amount of material (people) it absorbs, but in some cases the survival of the characters seems entirely arbitrary and not down to the rules that should have been established in the beginning. The main concept is that each piece of the alien is a living whole. But the film doesn't account for the idea that even the tiniest, invisible molecules that float through the air are part alien. And if the alien transmits itself through bodily fluids, why can't it just breathe onto someone and absorb them that way. Because of this and the weakly written roles, the atmosphere of paranoia and claustrophobia that should be developing is instead undercooked, and leads to many of the characters going crazy and acting unrealistically way too soon.It's literally only 10 minutes into the assimilation process, when one key scientist character realizes that mankind would be doomed within a year of the alien reaching the mainland. So what does he do? Round everyone up like a sensible person and try to weed out the alien? No, he suddenly destroys the radio and the helicopter, therefore dooming his companions to be trapped on a remote base with an enemy they can't see. Oh, and he tries to kill them all.Of course, the alien isn't too smart either. Rather than laying low and maintaining its disguise, it would rather transform at the most inopportune moments to get itself destroyed.Honestly, the film has little depth to its story or plot, and is really just a B-grade slasher flick, like Carpenter's last film 'Halloween'. With characters that seemingly want to die, how else could you describe it?",

            "content": "In \"Night of the Living Dead\" (spoiling paragraph), the lone survivor ended up being shot as randomly and mercilessly by a posse gunman who didn't even give him time to say \"I'm not like them!\". The guy looked like a racist asshole but we can ask ourselves if the emergency or the pressure were too big to take a chance. One of the most wicked aspects of John Carpenter's \"Thing\" is to make the gunman's point in a way that brilliantly betrays our own inclination to distrust.It starts with a helicopter firing gun at a running sled dog in Antarctica, we can't sympathize with the shooter, and when the dog makes it to that camp, we're almost relieved. Then the helicopter lands, and the man with the rifle, a Norwegian, starts shooting again uttering incomprehensible words for the camp members, all American. Of course, he was warning them about the dog, but he didn't realize he was endangering himself and a bullet hit him before the realization. Garry (Donald Moffat) isn't your typical trigger happy guard but he didn't trust the Norwegian. This is distrust's establishing moment as the pattern-instinct that will drive the plot and command most actions.Lack of trust or refusal to trust... the merit of John Carpenter is to have brilliantly exposed one of humanity's most detestable traits in a powerfully metaphorical story brilliantly dressed up as a horror movie but closer to the spirit of the original novel \"Who Goes There?\". Indeed, to call \"The Thing\" a remake is an insult, if anything this film highlights the limitations of its predecessor. While in the black-and-white film, the all-clean-cut American team had all their members sticking together against a clearly identified Frankenstein-like enemy, here, you'd better not watch the skies but anyone around you, which is enough to fuel the atmosphere with pure paranoid terror.Literally, they had another \"Thing\" coming, the alien has no place to hide except for hidden organisms, which means dogs or eventually humans whose shape it can imitate and recreate. The original tag-line said \"Man is the warmest place to hide\" before it was stupidly changed to \"The Ultimate Thing in Alien terror\" milking on Ridley Scott's success while the film was a whole new experience by making humans the potential containers of the ugly creature. Carpenter reconciled between Scott and Romero's concepts with the background of the 1951 film more convincingly restored, and the result is both visually stunning and captivating. Even the cold and the solitude were powerfully rendered. Hell, even the dogs act well.Yet the film was criticized for its overuse of gory effects. Personally, I thought they were so spectacular and effective they should have beaten \"E.T.\" (\"The Thing\" wasn't even nominated) as if Spielberg reinvented the wheel after \"Star Wars\" or \"Close Encounters\". It's not just about the practical effects but the way the corpses and hybrid-versions of the Thing looked like real biological structures in their gruesome and grotesque way and pushed repulsiveness to eleven without undermining the realism. On the contrary, they made the original lose any credibility with its \"man in suit\" villain. The film was also criticized for its lack of characterization and this is why I have to play the devil's advocate again. Granted Kurt Russell plays the bad-ass hero with the right intuitions and the other cast members seem to fulfill a few archetypes, there's never a moment where the acting feels unrealistic, everyone is aware that they are in a situation where splitting up is the worst option yet the turns of events always force them to split up causing the suspicions to reappear, it's not contrivance, it's brilliance in a twisted way. And by the time Blair (an unrecognizable mustache-less Wilford Brimley) realized the apocalyptic implications of the Thing, it was too late, and even with a buddy-system, they couldn't trust each other under that eschatological pressure. It's easy to sit as viewers and be all analytical about it, but maybe some of us would have hidden in the safest place to avoid any contact, hence endangering ourselves even more. I think the film played it real enough so I could find it plausible... starting with defensive moves that enhance the danger and then strategies to sabotage the Thing's plan while leading to other tricky situations. And everything leads to that sequence where Charles Hallahan's belly literally snatches Richard Dysart's arms and the head turns to a spider-like monster, this scene is delightfully hideous, so is its enthusiastic retelling in the \"making of\" film. We've reached the film's high point and it's immediately followed by the blood test; perhaps one of the most riveting and suspenseful moments from any horror movie. It's not just in the outcome but the way eyes' glances and death glares are exchanged and when you see this scene a second time, you realize that the \"trusting\" issue is the spice that makes the meal so delicious. They don't want to trust each other but the most nightmarish aspect of their situation is that they must do it. And to close the \"trusting\" arc in the most satisfying way, you've got to love the final exchange between Russell and Keith David, when they realize that they've reached a point where trusting isn't an issue anymore and it's time to share a peace-pipe-like JB bottle. That scene might echo the perception the film received when \"E.T.\" was praised for its more friendly visitor and universal message; but retrospectively, \"The Thing\" has just as much depth, as strong visuals, and if not the box-office gross of \"E.T.\", it finally earned a wonderful afterlife elevating it among the classics of the genre... and deservedly so!",

Ba-Da-Bum, thank you I, or whoever copies me, will be here all week.They also say this is the best remake of all-time as well as the best horror movie of all-time. While I disagree with both statements, it's still one helluva good movie. It's essentially 1979's Alien on Earth, but less concentration on the characters. Where Ridley Scott's movie really defined the victims in space, this one was all-but a slasher movie where very few of the men (and yeah, only men) had enough personalities to distinguish them to remember their names. Sure, I recognized some of the actors from other films, and the always-excellent Kurt Russell stood out, most of the researchers were just body counts.The movie revolves around said researchers segregated in the Antarctic when the title character shows up to replicate anything it comes in contact with. Paranoia ensues between both the men and the audience on who is \"The Thing\" and who is for real. One by one, they're taken apart, sometimes literally and it's up to the strong and smart to outthink the THING\u0085Now, I've seen this movie before many years ago and more recently, I saw the prequel in 2011. I liked both, and still have yet to see the original from 1951. I can imagine the original's total camp from that sci-fi, alien vs. the world-era. In addition to so many things I liked about this movie was the (I suspect) homage in the opening credits where a generic flying saucer, or U.F.O., comes crashing down on Earth. So cheesy in an otherwise incredibly inventive and ahead-of-its-time feature. Nicely done, Mr. (Director) Carpenter. I know the background. I know this was Carpenter's pet project since he made my personal favorite horror movie, 1978's Halloween. I also know they made the entire set themselves \u2013 pretty\u0085damn\u0085impressive. So kudos to Carpenter and gang for such a remarkable and non-modern, CGI-feat. We don't get real filmmaking like this today and I, like most film- buffs, miss terribly. Sure, CGI is most cost-effective, it's just not as effective\u0085visually.While the two biggest issues I had with the film upon my initial viewing was the paranoia \u2013 \"Who Is The Thing?\" got kinda tedious (until they straightened that out) and at times, they seemed to be making things up as they went along (i.e. What Special Creature Effect Can We Come Up with Next,) the enormously original ending, or last few frames, made up for any shortcomings from my own end. LOVED THE ENDING. Overall, it's an absolute classic and refreshing to revisit from time to time. Completely timeless, it can be seen many years from now and still have the same effect as it had almost 35 years ago upon its initial release. This well paced, tense and never boring film is completely recommended for not just horror buffs, but movie-lovers, as well.***Final thoughts: I have to find that YouTube video again. I remember seeing a review of this in which they showed a bunch of comparisons to the original and made fun of how many doors the characters entered through. Now that\u0085would be a fun way of (mostly) watching the original without having to put up with cheap, early 50s FX.",

            "review_title": "5 Reasons why John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) remains iconic even today!",
            "content": "Forgive me for expressing my undying love for one of the best sci-fi horror flicks of all time. I (re)watched 'The Thing' for the umpteenth time today and my admiration towards the film and for all those behind it, has only augmented. Here are five reasons why the film will remain a cult-classic for the decades to come:1. The man himself. John Carpenter. Fresh off 'Halloween', 'The Fog' and 'Escape from New York' which were all commercial successes, Carpenter took over the reigns to direct his first studio picture \u2013 'The Thing', which would be set in Antarctica and deal with a bunch of researchers who come in contact with an extra-terrestrial being. Unlike the one-massive-monstrous antagonist in Christian Nyby's 'The Thing from Another World', Carpenter wanted to present a more devout adaptation of the science fiction novella by John W Campbell Jr, and introduce a shape- shifting, human(or rather all living being)-assimilating alien. While this meant a lot of additional work, Carpenter seemed up for it. He shot the film in artificially frozen sets, and extensively applied practical FX to recreate the claustrophobic terror. However, the movie was a box-office failure, owing partly to the success of Spielberg's E.T and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.2. Practical FX by Rob Bottin(A then 22 year old) Bottin worked on the sets of 'The Thing' for a year, a project he worked his butt off for, so much that he had to be treated for stress-relief afterwards. Bottin worked with concept artist Mike Ploog to design the various gruesome creatures, their transformations and assimilation phases that would take centrestage in the film. The creatures looked absolutely scary yet the suspension of disbelief while witnessing the set-pieces was kept minimal. The spider-creatures, the two-body assimilation, the defibrillator chest chomp, the dog-things, everything looked on- point and downright grotesque. What is indeed sad to notice is the fact that while the 2011 prequel starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead had also employed practical FX by Amalgamated Dynamics (ADI), they were almost completely replaced digitally with the application of subpar CGI. The irony here is, critics and audiences alike wrote off the 2011 film citing horrible CGI in place of practical FX. Even the 1982 film's FX were shunned by the critics at the time of its release. Some even went on to call it a moronic, B-grade slaughterhouse film that used stuff like rubber, foam latex, gelatin, creamed corn, mayonnaise, strawberry jam and KY jelly for its effects. However, when the movie eventually achieved its cult status, the effects work was slowly getting the appreciation it had always deserved (some uncredited work from Stan Winston too!).3. The minimal soundtrack by Ennio MorriconeThe minimal beat-and-eerie-tune compositions (especially the Main theme) make my hair stand up every time they start playing. 'The Thing' is also one of the rare instances where Carpenter himself hasn't composed the music. It was indeed satisfying to see Morricone win the Golden Globe and the Academy Award 33 years later for 'The Hateful Eight' which held so much similarity to his compositions in 'The Thing'. I'd rate the OST for 'The Thing' as one of my personal faves when it comes to music in film. An ironical fact is that Morricone was nominated for a Worst Musical Score Razzie. I wonder what those guys were even thinking (or smoking!).4. Kurt Russell (& to an extent, Keith David)Kurt Russell as helicopter pilot R J MacReady left the audiences with a character that was certainly going to be remembered for ages. He was a bold, quick decision-maker who did just about anything to survive. It is impossible to fathom another actor who could have pulled off MacReady so well. Fun-fact is that Kurt almost blew himself up while throwing a stick of dynamite in a scene towards the end of the movie. That climactic scene where MacReady and Childs (Keith David's character) finally sit down to share a scotch while they decide to wait out, is truly unforgettable. It is also notable that the cast comprised purely of men.5. Legacy \u2013 The prequel, the video-game, the comics, the theme-park attractions, the yearly screeningsIt took nearly 29 years to spawn another film set in the same universe (which ended up as a prequel detailing the events at the Norwegian camp mentioned in Carpenter's film), that was partially able to recreate the ambiance and narrative style but lacked memorable characterization and the replacement of CGI over practical effects made it look sluggish.The video game (that served as a sequel) received positive reviews and it was deemed an excellent showcase in survival horror. The 'trust' system was met with praise. Personally, I loved every bit of it.. the storyline, the voice-overs, the in-game mechanics, the seemingly impossible-to-defeat boss levels.Alan Dean Foster, Dark Horse Comics and Clarkesworld Magazine published comics based on 'The Thing' at different points in time, all contributing as off-screen prologues, additional material or simply as heritage for the film.Haunted attractions based on the film were featured at some of the theme parks in the U.S.A.It is indeed inspiring to hear that 'The Thing' is annually viewed by members of the winter crew at the Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station during the first evening of winter. It is also viewed by scientific personnel at the Summit Camp on the apex of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",

Not everything is confined inside the buildings all the time. Action steps outside a little which feels like danger is not as controlled and might actually get out of there.Another thing is that since the action happens on Earth, albeit on a very remote place, it seems like horror could have an immediate, quick and devastating effect on the entire population. It feels defenitely more humane and natural than the Alien movie.",

The Thing is an great movie that ever made in 1982 and still had it today. The Thing is a first movie in the Apocalypse Trilogy, which continued with Prince Of Darkness and ended with In the Mouth of Madness.The Thing is widely regarded as one of John Carpenter's greatest masterpieces, and I would personally consider it a contender for the title of the best horror film ever made. It didn't always receive such a rosy reception, though. It was released in theaters just weeks after Steven Spielberg's much more blockbuster-friendly E.T., and its theatrical performance and initial critical reception weren't anything to write home about, the movie had became a beloved cult classic over the years.The movie is a remake from 1951 The Thing From Another and was directed by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby and adapted from a John W. Campbell short story; however, implicit Lovecraft allusions abound.The Thing. The story concerns an alien creature found frozen in Antarctic ice that can absorb, digest, and then imitate perfectly any creature that it comes into contact with. What follows from its discovery is a classic meditation on paranoia, punctuated by some of the best practical special effects ever put on film. The Thing is a remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks film The Thing from Another World, which was itself based on a short story by John W. Campbell called \"Who Goes There?\"Once it is revealed, the titular Thing is almost entirely unknowable. Not only is it alien in the most literal sense, but it's also outside of normally understood biology, genetically dissimilar from all life on earth. When discussing how the Thing can do what it does, or how it can live after being frozen for so long, one of the characters (played by Kurt Russell) says, \"Cuz it's different than us, see. Cuz it's from outer space.\" And that's about all the more understanding of its reasoning the characters ever get. Though the creature can obviously speak perfectly when it is imitating one of the humans, it never explains itself.The Movie is awesome in every way with an strong story, great actors and with great special effects.

As he proves in The Thing, and also with The Fog his level of scare goes into the psychological and makes your skin crawl with every detail of it. The Thing is put together beginning to end to scare and not just with the alien life form itself but the setting and the characters and everything else around it.The Thing takes place in the Antarctic which plays such an enormous role in how this film makes you feel. You couldn't possibly be any more isolated than these men are. Despite all there modern equipment and living arrangements they are thousands of miles from any other human being or contact and all they have is each other. Each one of them have their own skills and reason for being there and overall they have it pretty easy considering their location. That is until another local expedition brings something over to them that will uproot everything. A Norwegian expedition uncovers something in the ice that eventually makes it's way to the American expedition and now is determined to get inside each and every man in order to eliminate them so no one can stop him from continuing on world domination. It's a shape shifter but so much more than that. It literally takes over the person or thing that it inhabits. Given time it can act, speak, think exactly like it's host. What does this mean?? It means that any one of the men in the American expedition could be infected with The Thing. That drives up the level of paranoia wondering who is infected, which one of them is it and when will it be revealed. And when it is Carpenter reveals it in a horrible, gruesome, gut wrenching way. This really is one of the ultimate sci-fi horror films of the eighties. Anyone watching this will have their nerves on end as much as everyone locked away in that habitat.The cast is good!! Kurt Russell is great in the lead role as the tough as nails, quasi-leader R.J. MacReady. He's very rough around the edges, mean almost but bent on survival not only for himself but to protect the world from this thing getting out. Wilford Brimley plays the doctor of the crew who immediately becomes overtly paranoid when he realizes any one of them could be the alien. Unfortunately his behavior marks him to everyone else as the possible alien and they lock him away. T.K. Carter plays Nauls, somewhat of MacReady's adversary especially when it comes to looking at who may or may not be next. Everyone's performance is very intense and adds to the action. Each one of them plays the victim and the paranoia very well. More than anything this film is about isolation and these men being hunted in such a small area with no other option but to try and stop it. It's an intense thrill ride and any fan of sci-fi or horror must see this absolute John Carpenter classic film!! 8/10",

Director John Carpenter's gruesome splatter version of the story is much truer to the original (John W. Campbell's 1938 short story 'Who Goes There?') than 1951's 'The Thing (From Another World)'. As noted elsewhere, the film was largely reviled when it was first released for its over-the-top gruesome special effects and its cold, nihilistic vibe (at the time audiences and critics were used to the cheerful optimism of 'Star Wars' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and the saccharine-sweetness of 'E.T.'). Led by Kurt Russell, the film's all male cast makes no effort to make their characters heroic or likable, but as the premise of the story is that you cannot trust anyone, asocial hostility is a realistic, if not very pretty, reaction. Carpenter has never been known for his subtlety, and this film's special effects are (in)famous for their shocking ugliness. Standards have changed in 40 years and the ingenious mechanical effects might seem quaint to fans reared on CGI but some (but not all) of the images are highly memorable (the spider-head for example). Sci-fi films have depicted aliens that can mimic people for decades and while the concept makes for a good yarn, it makes little sense and 'The Thing's plot is no exception. Key to the story is that individual parts of the alien are independent creatures, and since the conservation of mass seems to be conveniently ignored, every spilled drop of alien blood is therefore a new creature, making hunting down one pointless. Definitely a film to enjoy (albeit not to everyone's taste) but not think too hard about (but 'so what'). The early shots of the Norwegians finding the Thing's circular spaceship is a nice homage to the iconic scene in the 1951 film.",

THE THING is a great horror movie with plenty of spine tingling chills, and much genuine suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. State-of-the-art special effects and make FX provided by Rob Bottin (ROBOCOP, TOTAL RECALL) help propel THE THING above the usual films of the science-fiction/horror genre.\"The Thing\" has been discovered by a dozen explorers at the Arctic. They've made a startling unveiling of a mysterious life-form...but little do they realize the destructive capabilities of this creature. This alien creature is so malevolent that as it mutates, it assimilates the form of its nearest, most unlucky victim. Later, the creature masquerades itself as whatever the life-form it has consumed and deformed. The leader of this expedition, Kurt Russell (STARGATE, SOLDIER), must deploy the explorers into employing ways to stop this alien mutant before it's evil spreads into worldwide, global proportions.  However, as the toll rises, any one of Russell's colleagues...may in fact, be part of the demon already...THE THING is an engrossing horror film with some of the most grotesque special effects seen on the screen. The literally eye-popping effects include melting faces, cremations, walking heads, deformity, heads bursting out of stomachs, and other sequences too gruesome to print in words alone. THE THING though, has been sadly criticized by film connoisseurs as merely exercise of disgusting special effects.  In my sincere and humble opinion, THE THING is a film with more substance than what most movie critics have said.This film is a parable.  The expedition must learn to trust one another and stick together in order to essentially survive. Another interesting aspect about THE THING is that this movie shows what would happen if fear and isolation conquer a whole group.  The consequences are devastating, people end up fighting each other and debating violently, instead of trying to work together to alleviate the problem.  This film conveys a lesson saying that trusting one another and teamwork are the two main components for survival against the odds.  Without those two traits, then everything else, even technology itself...is meaningless...THE THING is a great movie to watch in the dark during midnight. You will be guaranteed to jump out of your seat at least a few times.  THE THING delivers its fair shares of shocks and jolts.Although the story-line in this film is not very efficient, it doesn't distract from the tension and suspense of this movie. If you enjoy truly frightening horror films with AWESOME special effects, then THE THING is a highly recommended movie perfect for you.WARNING: If you have a modicum of squeamishness inside you, then steer clear of THE THING.  Otherwise, get ready for an exciting and suspenseful presentation.  Plenty of effort integrated into this film, thanks to the direction of John Carpenter, and the believable performances of the main characters including Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and the rest of the cast.RATING: **1/2 out of ****.",

This however is truly a thing as opposed to James Arness's plant man from 1951.It also takes place at the other end, the bottom of the world. Kurt Russell and others are on a scientific outpost there when they come upon some remains of something they can't quite identify.As I said it's not the plant man of the first film. Instead it's like a parasite invading the human or at first canine hosts which are the expedition's sled dogs. After a while the humans don't know who has been taking over.Lots of elements of both the Alien franchise and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers present in this film. But it doesn't hold a candle to my favorite plant man.",

            "content": "If 1979's \"Alien\" was the original hypothesis that the best science-fiction thrillers are psychological, then John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" is the study that proves it true. A remake of John W. Campbell Jr.'s 1951 classic \"The Thing from Another World,\" Carpenter's re- imagining is another brilliant execution of quiet suspense that gets quickly into your head and hooks into your brain.Kurt Russell, Carpenter's star from \"Escape from New York,\" takes the driver's seat again as one of a team of scientists living in Antarctica when a helicopter with two Norwegian scientists arrives at their facility trying to shoot down a husky. The Norwegians are killed and the husky lives, only the husky is actually an alien from another planet that survives by taking the identical appearance of the organisms it kills. Having had the dog in their possession for 48 hours, the men realize that any one of them could be a thing, causing a huge build-up of distrust and tension.The key part that makes \"The Thing\" stand above most other alien/creature/monster kills off a group of people one-by-one movies is that last bit about distrust. In other films, the creature is identifiable -- a shark, an alien, etc., but in \"The Thing,\" it could be any of the characters -- now that's both terrifying and awesome. Instead of a thriller where we're just curious about the gruesome way in which the creature will kill the next random dude, we get the simultaneous thrill of wondering which person the creature is. It's like rolling a mystery into a sci-fi horror film.The nice part about that dual entertainment is they feed off each other. While we're busy wondering who isn't human, Carpenter can fully utilize shock and awe when the thing actually does attack and boy, does he ever. The amount of prosthetics and mechanical devices used to create the constantly moving spool of guts mixed with slimy Venus fly traps that is the thing and the people its imitating are incredible. More than 25 years later you almost wish more films stopped pushing computer-generated images so hard and stayed devoted to developing better and better prosthetics. But can shear paranoia and suspense along with the fulfilled promise of excellent visual effects drive a science-fiction story? Apparently so. Russell is the only known actor and there's not a whole lot to the characters other than the way they deal with their fear and paranoia. Another less obvious reason \"The Thing\" works so well is the parameters the story sets up for itself. Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster establish a very specific set of rules for what the thing is and isn't capable of, even going so far as to show us the science of how cells from the thing devour other living cells. We know that the thing only reveals itself when its alone with its victim and that it is driven primarily by a survival instinct. These rules lend legitimacy to the story and make it much more interesting for the viewer trying to stay a step ahead of the plot.When it comes down to it, \"The Thing\" is just smart formula film-making, even though the formula arguably came after this film. It has a director with impressive horror and suspense credentials in Carpenter, who directed \"Halloween,\" one of the greatest film composers ever in Ennio Morricone to do the suspenseful, haunting score and a creature with more than meets the eye who wreaks psychological havoc on the characters and consequently, us. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",

            "content": "John Carpenter's The Thing, is a film about an ice station research team in the Antarctic during the first week of Winter. The film opens with a Dog being chased by a Norwegian Helicopter pilot and a passenger shooting at it. After accidentally blowing up the helicopter, the last surviving Norwegian begins to follow the dog into the American base until the dog is saved by the American group, who believe the Norwegian team have gone crazy. Upon being moved into the kennel, the dog begins to mutate into a disturbing creature that attacks the other dogs. We soon find out that this 'dog' is in-fact an Alien that has the ability to change it's appearance of anyone it assimilates.As the Alien begins wreck havoc amongst the crew this leaves us with a group of characters unable to trust each other. As they are being picked off one by one, and replaced by the Thing. When the group begins to learn that this creature is of Alien origin the doubt and mistrust begins to further set in. The group is lead by McCready(Kurt Russell), who takes charge of the situation. His unwillingness to let the Thing go free, and suspicion towards the group begins to breed mistrust and paranoia. Whilst on the other hand the group aren't sure whether he could be the Thing, and trying to deliberately fracture the group.The film is directed by John Carpenter and was his first big studio film after having previous critical and commercial success with Halloween(1978), and Escape From New York(1981). The film ended up doing badly at the box office not even making it's budget back. The film also received critical backlash, which wasn't aided at the time by going up against Steven Spielberg's family friendly E.T.Carpenter directs this film with expert craftsmanship, the film is incredibly well shot, with scenes that are genuinely horrific and scary. It's also helped by the cinematography of long time collaborator Dean Cundey(Halloween). The film is shot on location which gives the filman authentic isolated setting. This exacerbates the film sense of dread and paranoia which seeps through the film, from the opening shot too it's hauntingly ambiguous ending.The film should also be praised for it's excellent use practical effects, that still hold up incredibly well today. Carpenter and his team create some of the most disturbing creature designs in cinema history. The score by Ennio Morricone is brooding and filled with tension that adds another layer of depth to the film.John Carpenter's The Thing Is a stripped down thrill ride that pulls no punches. It asks us to keep our eyes open at all times for even the slightest clue as to who may or may not be The Thing. It's also a film filled With characters that we genuinely care about, they're fleshed out and have fully developed personalities. Something which Horror films have forgotten to do in the last decade. The Thing is a film that will be remembered as a classic in the Horror genre for decades to come.",

In other words, it's capable of 'Shape-Shifting' and becoming any creature it comes in contact with. Much more menacing than before, it soon has the entire cast wondering which of them will be next to be absorbed. Dark and horrifying, the movie is both dramatic and suspenseful and with the shadowy world of the space alien, it's only a matter of time before all the cast become prey.

            "content": "John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made. Sadly as with most Carpenter movies go it is also one of the most underrated movies being panned by critics shortly after it's release for a reason that is almost pathetic. It seems that at the time people were overwhelmed by the idea of the \"good\" alien. An idea spawned after the success of \"I.T.\". And the very thought that a movie dealing with aliens could deviate from that idea was regarded as heresy. Human ignorance is truly a frightening thing, people need to judge films for what they are not for what they want them to be.\"The Thing\" itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of a U.S. Antarctic base discover the presence of an alien being (refered throughout the movie only as a \"thing\") able to imitate any form of life. Not knowing who might or might not be the creature, we see how every character reacts to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic just a slow and gradual descent in to chaos as more and more people turn up to be... not quite human.Carpenter succeeds into elevating this movie into something far more than your average Sci-Fi/horror. There are no \"whats behind you?\" jumping moments here. Instead relying on an intense atmosphere of mistrust and pre-apocalyptic despair along with some nicely balanced moments of visual terror with no small thanks to Rob Bottin's impressive creature effects, he gives us an experience not matched by many other horror films.Instead of just throwing facts and plot elements at our face Carpenter offers us a much a more gradual and delicate approach. By implying a sense of mystery he gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret-ate what has transpired in certain scenes, while giving enough plot to those who are not so fond of interpretation in movies.Ennio Morricone's score works all the way. It's minimalistic and depressing sound perfectly fits the movie's overall tone. Although I've always wondered how would it have sounded if Carpenter (he has been known to compose all of his movies's OSTs except this one) did it? Characters while not as deeply developed are still memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors especially Kurt Russel who plays the \"down-out\" apathetic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady. Its worth noting how his character transforms through the movie. From his disregardful \"don't give a ....\" attitude in the beginning, to that of a unifier and leader of the group of men who try to fight \"the thing\". But even with that said, there are no false heroics here, there are no \"laughing at the face of death\" moments and there certainly isn't any sort of comic relief, the movie keeps its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last. Speaking of which, here once again Carpenter keeps his tradition of creating a powerful ending.Quarter of a century after its release \"The Thing\" doesn't feel dated. And with the disturbingly growing use of computer-generated effects it feels even stronger then before because it shows the life's work and dedication of human beings not computers. Combined with its openness for analyzing it gives the viewer a lot more reasons to watch it for a second or third or fourth or ... time. A masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.",

It's rare that every single actor is exceptional and supplied with effective dialogue. All the cast from Kurt Russell to Wilford Brimley as Blair are all captivating, great casting by Anita Dann.

The scenario is based on the story 'Who Goes There?' by J.W. Campbell. The story line is similar in both movies with the men fighting for their lives inside a claustrophobic and remote environment.Nonetheless, a number of differences between the two movies are evident. Hawk's film is fast-paced and events unfold around a people versus 'monster' story. Carpenter's film, instead, is slower and takes its time to develop. Carpenter also creates a strong disbelief and suspicion that the person you see is not what he appears to be. The 'Thing' is a foe who attacks from the 'interior' and not from the 'exterior'. The men in the base are more vulnerable and their fight is more desperate. Special effects are simply amazing and show us the alien being in a grotesque and horrifying manner that the human mind cannot easily comprehend. And that's precisely the problem: it takes time for humans to understand the nature of the extraterrestrial threat. A 10/10 from me.",

This movie has up and away the best special effects that have been created during the 80's! The best thing, though, is that \"The Thing\" also has an interesting story to back up the gory moments.Even more so than its elder brother \"Alien\", John Carpenter's movie creates a tension of suspense that has yet to be rivaled by a similarly themed sci-fi/horror-movie. Up until the very end the director makes great usage of the basic premise that a monster from outer space can disguise itself by taking on the form of any living being. The movie is tense and tight all the time and with Kurt Russell it's got a badass-hero, too. Still, Carpenter never falls into the trap of making any of the characters in the movie a stereotypical clich\u00e9 of the 80's like so many later flicks who stole from \"The Thing\" would. There is almost no moment here where you can only shake your head because of the obvious stupidity of some of the characters' actions.So, having seen the real, the untouched version of \"The Thing\" I have to say that I think this is John Carpenter's best movie and one of the most effective horror movies of the 80's period.

The movie starts off slow, and never really gets going. There's no character development with any of the characters sans Kurt Russell, and the movie relies on Gore & special effects for it's scares. Trust me when I say there's absolutely nothing suspenseful about this movie, and the paranoia theme doesn't work here. What we basically get is some shape shifting Alien that apparently was frozen for thousands of years, which apparently a group of Norwegians was able to carry to their base, which then escaped and started attacking the group of Americans. That's the plot right there. What it does is it basically stays hidden as a dog for a very long time, apparently not in the mood to make it's attack, and only gets caught because apparently the sounds of dogs barking annoys it enough. And let's not forget how the seemingly immortal Shape Shifting Alien dies in such a laughably easy manner. Kurt Russell and his crew spend the entire time burning it down, and yet it somehow still finds a way to survive, making it seemingly immortal. Then at the end Russell blows it up easily with a stick of dynamite, which for some reason he never thought of doing before. We also have no idea what happens to the Nauls character, as he just disappears into oblivion. Apparently his character wasn't needed anymore, so the makers of this film decided to get rid of him by sending the character to go investigate something he saw, even though the character Nauls knows there's an Alien out there waiting to take over his body. Honestly, what sense does that make? That part right there was very poorly written. As to the ending, it really makes no sense because it features Russell's character and Childs sitting there wondering if each one is possibly The Thing, despite Russell just recently killing it. And if either one was The Thing, why didn't it attack the other? Why sit there drinking whiskey with a human when you could easily finish him off? It makes no sense to me. Also, neither apparently care to leave the freezing area, apparently leaving us to believe they both just die there. Anyway, the only points I give this movie for is the special effects, and the atmosphere. The location of Antarctica was fantastic, and the special effects for it's time were astounding. Other then that, this movie is poorly written and really boring. Pass on it, 3/10.",

Pair that with a fantastic cast and you just get a horror film for the ages. But you know what I'll admit? The suspense does take a little while to build, and to be quite honest I don't remember the first act of the film being so slow.

The creature is unconventional to say the least and this adds an eerie component to an already otherworldly and confined Antarctic setting.There are no females and therefore no romantic complications. The characters are thin so the story focuses on the thing and how the crew tries to track it down and eliminate it, if they can. The nature of the gruesome entity, how it functions and how it can or cannot be killed leaves you with a lot of questions.

An American scientific expedition in the Antarctic is laid siege by a shape-shifting alien, and no one is able to stop it. Kurt Russell stars as the expedition's bearded, quirky pilot. Shot in Canada, the movie is stark and shocking at times, and the creature effects -- prosthetics, the forerunner to CGI -- are simply amazing. They look great to this day. The opening is haunting: a sled dog is pursued across frozen terrain by a gun-toting helicopter crew from a Norwegian camp. The dog reaches the American camp, and it soon becomes apparent this is no ordinary dog. It is an alien in disguise, which the Norwegians inadvertently released from its 30,000 year old frozen slumber. Carpenter respectfully pays homage to the 1951 Howard Hawks version, but takes his remake to levels Hawks could only have dreamed of. Great supporting cast, including Wilfred Brimley and Keith David. For those unfamiliar with the source material, it is a short story called \"Who Goes There?\" Carpenter's version is much closer than Hawks' to this Cold War tale. Hawks' version is essentially the Frankenstein monster loose in the Antarctic. The remake is notable for its all-male cast and sense of claustrophobia and impending doom.",

Once audience inures to its animatronic gimmicks, the movie's scary quotient begins to lessen (save for Morricone's minimal, ominous score) and what Carpenter plays up is the burgeoning distrust among those Yankees under the bleak, claustrophobic circumstances, yet, character-molding is not right up his alley (Ridley Scott's ALIEN 1979 is a far superior antecedent), ergo THE THING is considerably deficient in ammunition of imploding conflict and treachery, and high on explosive ruckus after survivors are routinely rubbed out by ringing the changes of optical spectacles, no one is safe apart from the top billed Kurt Russell, as the helicopter pilot MacReady, who is granted with a protagonist's halo and inexplicably brainy enough to float the idea of testing remaining crew's blood to identify who has been infected, on account of the thing's innate survival instinct. However, there is a loose end in the extrapolation that MacReady has been assimilated on the ground of his torn clothes, which goes unsolved. THE THING is Carpenter's foray into studio filmmaking and it relishes in its dazzling production value, its refrigerated setting in L.A. is a huge project and the matte painting of the place where the alien life first crashed on earth significantly enhances its filmic quality, although ineluctably, an analog proto-computer is a dead giveaway of its time and superficially deployed in spoon-feeding us with information such as how fast an apocalypse is at stake if the thing gets out of the station alive. Lastly, Carpenter discloses his ace in the hole in the end, when two survivors seem to calmly wait for their slow death from cold in the now blown-up site, an ambiguous gesture may or may not intimate that one of them is infected by the thing, which beckons various theories from cult followers after its initial tepid reception, in hindsight, THE THING, a seminal gore-fest that beckons a glut of imitations in the years to come, is arguably Carpenter's best.",

            "content": "John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" is a rarity among movies. It's a remake of a classic (\"The Thing From Another World\") that managed to eclipse the original. It did so by hewing closer to the source material (John W. Campbell's classic novella \"Who Goes There?\") and by showcasing some incredible visual effects.The story concerns a group of American scientists stationed in the Antarctic. In the film's opening, they encounter a group of seemingly mad Norwegians frantically pursuing a dog in an attempt to kill it. Unbeknownst to the Americans, the dog is actually an alien that assumes the shape of its victims. When the Norwegians are killed, the dog is taken in by the Americans and begins to turn them against one another.The plot is rife with paranoia as tensions arise over who may or may not be an alien in disguise. The story is as bleak as the Antarctic wasteland that provides its background but is enlivened by the extraordinary special effects of Rob Bottin (and, in one sequence, Stan Winston). Admittedly, not all of the effects have aged equally well but there are several memorable sequences scattered throughout the film.Meanwhile, John Carpenter's direction shows a deft control of building suspense, maintaining it and, ultimately, paying it off with unexpected scares. Another vital element in the film's atmosphere is the icily foreboding score by Ennio Morricone.In terms of acting, though, I find the movie to be fairly undistinguished. Kurt Russell's OK in the lead role but I find that he's better suited to lighter material (eg. \"Big Trouble in Little China\"). The supporting cast includes a few recognizable individuals like Wilford Brimley and Keith David but, for the most part, the ensemble's composed of relative unknowns who perform their roles satisfactorily though unexceptionally.Taken altogether, \"The Thing\" is a well-executed horror/sci-fi movie that's deserving of its cult status. The special effects may be the main attraction but the story is equally important in the scheme of things. John Carpenter and company undoubtedly delivered a movie that was worthy of its landmark predecessor.",

            "content": "Up until the last ten minutes of its running time, John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" upholds its contemporary, well-deserved legacy as one of the best of recent science-fiction films. Actually, the picture is more of a mishmash of science-fiction and horror, with a tremendous amount of impact being held up on the part of the second. It is based on the novelette \"Who Goes There?\" by John W. Campbell, Jr. which was also the source for a much-lauded 1951 Howard Hawks film with a pre-\"Gunsmoke\" James Arness and, more recently, a prequel to Mr. Carpenter's film. Comparing all three films, I think it is fair to say that Mr. Carpenter's has held up the best: it's the trimmest, the most purely enjoyable, even if it's somewhat unpleasant to watch. Then again, that was the whole idea.It's also the closest to the original story, about a research team in Antarctica composed of a large group of men who find themselves placed under attack by a shape-shifting critter from outer space, which can seamlessly adopt the characteristics of organisms (men included) that it comes into contact with and walk about undetected until it decides to change shape again. The Howard Hawks version had a monster that, as described by Mr. Carpenter, was a \"Frankenstein's monster\" as opposed to the other-worldly thing in the story, and the 1982 film.It is such a fabulous, smashing idea for a science-fiction film as well as a straight-up gross-out horror flick, which \"The Thing\" marvelously, not clumsily, combines together. One of the fabulous tactics that the filmmakers make is not giving the alien creature a definable, recognizable shape. We never see what it looked like before it started assimilating dogs, men, and who knows what else from all corners of the universe before and after its crash into the Antarctic ice a hundred thousand years ago. This in turn produces a truly effective sense of dread about the creature, as it can appear in and out of nowhere whenever it chooses to. It adds another dimension to the \"Jaws\" theory, that the unknown or unseen is more effective.And when we do see the thing, it is done with special effects so tremendous that they actually surpass the digital concoctions in its 2011 prequel. When it changes shape, its disguise starts to spurt blood and protrude with all sorts of strange figures, oftentimes from life forms it attacked before. Whereas Mr. Carpenter kept visual blood to a minimum in his classic 1978 film \"Halloween,\" here he lets it pour in spurts, hoses, and torrents from the disfigured assimilated bodies and the effect is superb. To an extent, the gross-out effect may be a show-stopper, but I think it works to a strong degree. After all, what would it really be like if a human stomach split open and a big pair of jaws appeared at ragged edges of the sliced flesh? Also effective is the decision of Mr. Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster to reduce the number of characters to a minimum. Some might find problem with the picture for only a few of them being defined, much since the alien is devouring many of them early on, this seems to be hardly a problem at all. Best of all is the way in which the filmmakers develop a sense of animosity and tension between them and this is the core effect of the picture. \"The Thing,\" while gripping and scary, is more or less a \"who's who?\" fright-tale with the cast, headed by Kurt Russell in one of the actor's very best performances, trying to decipher who is human and who is an alien in disguise. The strongest scene in the movie is when the characters, who think like human beings, learn that every part of the alien reacts to pain, so they strap each other to chairs and draw blood before exposing it to a hot needle. It combines both parts of Hitchcock's surprise/suspense theory and utilizes both of them to a hilt. The tension of waiting for the bomb to go off (or in this case, the creature to get loose) is nail-biting.The last ten minutes of the movie, do however, prevent \"The Thing\" from being a wholesome masterpiece. Its raw power, developed by the aforementioned suspense scene, begins to loosen as it approaches a climax which is unfortunately a little rushed and not striking with as much of the intended dread. It's not that the ending of \"The Thing\" is bad or not effectively done, it's just not as good as what came before it.However, this is an easily-forgivable weakness, as more than seventy-five percent of this classic is immensely enjoyable. It's a great idea done with skill and affection. Clearly, John Carpenter was in love with the original story and one can feel his affection for it in the way he has cleverly directed it. Best of all is his understanding that it was meant to be a nightmarish tale and his understanding of how much to balance the intrinsic horror and science-fiction elements. Even though it has, in a way, been done, there really is no need to adapt the story again, as John Carpenter has done it in the best way possible, save the very end. It's one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewing and still very effective even when you have seen it a few times and know what is around the corner.",

For years now, I have been hearing nothing but great things about this film and admittedly, my expectations were as high as they get. Also, I didn't really know what this film was about apart from some vague idea I had. And perhaps another problem was that I really wanted to like this film.

Although it was a critical and commercial flop when first released, it has since gained its own cult following--not as large as the former, but large enough to convince horror fans to reevaluate it. Set near the South Pole, the film concerns a deadly space creature that infiltrates a scientific outpost. This being can absorb any living organism and duplicate its characteristics with chilling precision. If left unchecked, it may wipe out the human race. After a good twenty years, it still holds up for the most part. It is a simply-plotted but well-crafted effort, generating an eerie, desolate atmosphere, not unlike that of Ridley Scott's influential \"Alien.\" Filmed in Alaska, the bleak cinematography makes it seem like it really was filmed in Antarctica. There is an acute feeling of isolation, the sense that we are thousands of miles away from any other human being. It is just them...and it.\"The Thing\" is a more explicitly violent film than \"Halloween,\" but delivers just as much in terms of good, honest shocks. There are moments that still compel the viewer to jump, moments that are genuinely creepy. The special effects work used to bring the alien to life are still very good--nice and gooey, and the fact that the creature makes its presence known when we least expect it only adds to the terror. Inevitably, it attempts to infiltrate this unfortunate group of people. The screenplay cleverly second-guesses the audience's attempts to devise the identity of the creature. Just when we think we've guessed who it is, the film surprises us. The paranoia and claustrophobia is nearly unbearable at times. The creepy music adds more to the atmosphere.In some ways, this is arguably a better film than \"Halloween;\" Carpenter's pacing is more assured, and the shocks more intense. Yet, the characterizations prove to be the film's major weakness. Aside from Kurt Russell, most of the characters tend to be fairly interchangeable, unfortunately hampering the effectiveness of the material to some degree. It's still a well-made thriller that is obligory viewing for genre fans. I will not compare it to the 1951 original, unseen by myself.

            "content": "I feel it is appropriate to use John W. Campbell Jr.'s 1938 novella, \"Who Goes There?\", as a baseline by which to compare the two films that strived to bring it to the screen; that is, \"The Thing(From Another World)\" released in 1951, and \"The Thing\" released in 1982.  Keep in mind that I consider Campbell's tale one of the best sci-fi horror stories ever written, and that it would be quite a feat to successfully adapt it to cinema. The 1951 film, directed by Christain Nyby, deviated so much from the story that it is difficult to draw many parallels between the two.  In the story, the alien is a 4 ft tall being with three red eyes, rubbery,blue,wormlike hair and multiple razor- sharp tentacles.  This alien \"chameleon\" is so intelligent that its species figured out long ago how to imitate any living creature through DNA duplication and replication.  This uncanny, insidious imitation extended to the personality and mind of it's victims.  The end of the story further highlights its superior intellect by featuring a strap-on anti-gravity device powered by a small atomic generator that it had built within the mere span of one week by scrounging spare parts at the compound - coiled wires, radio tubes, coffee-tins, glass, magnets, leather and cloth belts, etc.  The alien was killed before it could make it's escape and eventually imitate the living composition of the entire planet! In the 1951 film version, the alien is portrayed as an 8 ft tall hairless Frankenstein-like humanoid, with flesh of a vegetable- like quality which needed blood to reproduce itself through seedpods.  The film is standard horrorfare, with the expedition crew uniting together to fight and destroy the alien menace, which they eventually did, via electrocution.  The alien is not characterized as particularly intelligent, rather as a rampaging, blood-thirsty monster; making it hard to imagine such a brute was advanced enough to participate in interstellar travel.  So while, \"The Thing(From Another World) featured excellent direction, acting, dialogue, score and so forth under the watchful eye of producer/shadow director, Howard Hawks, I feel he took artistic license and deviated too much from Campbell's story. There was suspense and terror to be sure, but it lacked the pervasive paranoia that Campbell conveyed so well in \"Who Goes There?\" In sharp contrast, director John Carpenter's 1982 version, \"The Thing\", both brilliantly captures the alien's insidious chameleon-like powers (through Rob Bottin's effects) and the paranoia it induced amongst the expedition's crew.  Instead of bonding together as a cohesive unit as in the 1951 film, to fight a readily discernable foe, they fragmented in the face of a remarkably cunning enemy capable of imitating any one of them; they become deeply suspicious and paranoid of one another as any of them could be the alien in disguise, and they literally ask, \"is it really you, WHO GOES THERE?\"; echoing the name of the novella's title.  This situation runs counter to classic character development, as how could anyone be stable and well-defined with their core-identity as such risk? Who's who? who's the good guy? bad guy?  Perhaps a little unsettling to viewers and critics.  I think this film has received a  battering from movie critics because they were weaned on relishing a steady, inexorable buildup of suspense and an inevitable resolution.  However, in \"The Thing\", this suspense is permeated with a claustrophobic paranoia and sullen dread, generating an atmospheric ambiguity - something the critics weren't comfortable with, hence, rejected. Combine this ambiguity with the critic's aversion to the graphic special effects, wholly appropriate to the storyline, but misinterpreted by them as \"gratuitous violence and gore\", then one understands why \"The Thing\" got butchered in the reviews. Here, as in the Campbell story, MacReady is the acknowledged hero, even before he tested himself as human, for we instinctively knew he would be.  However, in the story, MacReady, with the aid of several genuinely human crewmembers, kills the alien and in doing so, literally saves the planet. Whereas, in the 1982 film, MacReady, valiant as he is, just isn't powerful enough to stop the alien. Thus, the open-ended ending; the lack of closure being a disappointment to me; I immediately thought \"sequel\", but have yet to see one.  Also, keep in mind that in the story, the alien starts and ends with his original form, whereas in the 1982 film, the alien never has a definitive original form, being relatively amorphous throughout. In the final analysis, I like both of these films, in spite of their shortcomings; namely, the 1951 film's failure to adhere closely to the story, thereby failing to capture the essence of the imitative alien and paranoid atmosphere it generated; and the 1982 film's failure to remain faithful to the story's optimistic ending. Actually, both films stand up fairly well when referenced to Campbell's chilling tale, and even better when viewed as stand-alones. One thing is for sure, both films have earned a secure place in my video collection.",

The scares and tension hold up, the ambiguity associated with the film begs interpretation, the acting is solid, the setting unique, the pacing excellent, and the cinematography good. Hats off to this movie, at a time when it was popular to use horror movies to punish promiscuous, mean, or stupid teenagers and adults, the Thing threatened a group of grown, intelligent, good men. Despite making all the correct choices, these brave men were still killed one by one by the creature.Of course, the film is probably most famous for its ahead-of-its-time practical effects. I would agree, they were good for the time, despite a lot of the effects being outclassed today. Need I remind you that a lot of the effects were slow or slow-moving and accompanied by long, horrified reaction shots of the men. How much scarier would the spider- legged head been if it went scampering quickly away?Also, the movie feels a little inconsistent. When the blood test is taken, one guy looks nervous, even though he obviously knows he's not infected. When Bennings is killed, somebody, i think it was Garry, says \"I knew Bennings all my life\" despite the inhuman scream that Bennings uttered as he died, his warped hands. Also, is the Thing an organism or virus? It's referred to as an imitation at times. How does it replicate the host's memory? Why did the Thing reveal itself as the dog?But hey, these are just nitpicks. It's a really good film, if a little old.",

In short this is a magnificent viewing experience.I assume you know the plot so I won't go into it here. It was a strong move by Carpenter to utilize to original plot from the short story \"Who Goes There?\". The Thing has the ability to assume the identity of it's host and therefore can go about undetected among the men. This causes the immense feeling of distrust among them and Carpenter milks it for all it's worth. In the original there was simply a guy in a costume portraying The Thing and that was a real letdown.By setting the film in a virtually timeless no-man's land, Antarctica, Carpenter maximizes the utter isolation with it's magnificent snowbound scenery and bitter cold. When all radio contact has failed, these men are quite simply alone in the world. And when The Thing starts absorbing them one by one, up until the point that we have no idea who is left intact, their isolation and despair become frightfully real and tangible to the audience.Carpenter's direction is nothing short of spectacular. This film, along with Halloween and Assault on Precinct 13, is his crowning achievement. Genuinely haunting, terribly suspenseful with an eerie, all to real ending, this is one film you won't forget easily. Ennio Morricone's music, which is very similar to Carpenter's own orchestral works, is quite simply stunning. Operating like a slow, emotionless heartbeat, it enhances the impact of every scene. Another triumph for this movie are the special effects. This is 1982 and I have yet to see a horror film that surpasses this one in terms of monster effects. Granted the effects are disgusting but, very importantly, do not lessen the impact of the story. It never succumbs to being a special effects extravaganza, it's limited to only a handful of scenes. In short, this film is unbearably athmospheric and has terrific special effects to boot. They make the film more effective, and that's a rare thing in a horror movie.The performances by the actors are superb. Carpenter regular Kurt Russell makes a solid hero and the rest do an impeccable job in varied roles.One of the best horror films ever, top 10 easily. Can't recommend it enough.",

            "content": "True to his name, John Carpenter was a major architect of celluloid terror in his prime, with a distinctive visual style, a reliance on simple musical scores that stick menacingly in the viewer's mind, and a manner of manipulating suspense through lighting, character conflict, and well-choreographed action. As both writer (often under a pseudonym) and director, Carpenter's films comprise some of the finest examples of the horror genre. However, when he's in command of someone else's script, there is sometimes a clash between the two. Upon viewing \"The Thing\" for the first time in several years, this inconsistency sticks out like a sore thumb.Now don't get me wrong. As a child I'd build my schedule (at least on weekends) around horror movies playing on cable TV, and Carpenter's interpretation of \"The Thing\" (far more faithful to the short story 'Who Goes There?' than its 1951 predecessor) was certainly a major influence on my personal taste--it was bloody, scary, and very cool-looking (Rob Bottin's makeup FX put all the CGI offerings that have come since to shame). And that minimalist score by Italian composer Ennio Morricone produced a shiver without fail. And the ending--from its ambiguous final line to the isolated manner in which it's photographed, was enough to thoroughly creep me out as a youngster.The movie still holds up for a lot of the reasons I just mentioned, but it falters somewhat due to the weak characterizations. Bill Lancaster's script renders the dozen or so men stationed at an Antarctic research outpost (a gaggle of scientists and military types) besieged by an imitative alien life form as little more than fodder for the cool-looking transformation/death scenes (that is, when they're not tossing explanatory dialog around like a hot potato). The isolated setting in the midst of a section of the world known for extreme weather conditions casts a weariness and desperation over the whole film, which would have been more effective if we gave a damn about the characters.Carpenter does what he can, and certain actors shine (such as future Quaker Oatmeal spokesman Wilford Brimley as a crazed doctor and David Clennon as a wisecracking pothead), but most of the cast comes off as nondescript as the alien life form itself. While mostly exposition, the dialog does unravel in an intriguing way as the men become increasingly aware of what they're dealing with, and the special effects complement the story rather than overwhelming it. And perhaps \"The Thing\"'s main saving grace--in terms of its horror being so well-preserved after all these years--is Carpenter's uncanny way of capturing a mood of dread, fear, and isolation, to the point where you might be tempted to jack up the thermostat a few degrees after the end credits are done rolling.",

            "content": "It's impossible for me to discuss John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" without also discussing several works that provided its inspiration. J.w. Campbell's classic story \"Who Goes There\" was also the inspiration for the Howard Hawks/Christian Nyby version in 1950. Since Hawks/Nyby lacked the technology to portray Campbell's shape-shifting, assimilating creature, they focus on Campbell's theme of the \"red scare\". It's absolutely true communists occupied high positions in our government, including the CIA at the time Campbell wrote \"Who Goes There\". Hawks/Nyby focused on the camaraderie of the artic crew to represent \"the American way of life,\" while making the creature a \"walking vegetable,\" feeding on blood and preparing its occupation of the earth through asexual reproduction. Thus, the creature represented the \"Communist menace\" and the scientist a \"fellow traveler. By 1955, the US government, through oppressive laws against communist in this nation, as well as the Hollywood Blacklist,had created a backlash against \"McCarthyism\". As a result, \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" presented the humans as communists and the \"pod people\" as the \"fascist oppressors\". Also, in 1955, the UK released \"The Quatermass Experiment,\" AKA \"The Creeping Unknown,\" which presented a creature that possessed the assimilation half of Campbell's \"Thing\". By the time of the unsuccessful release of John Carpenter's film, the \"red scare\" portion had been utterly discarded. However, the paranoic theme of \"do you ever really 'know' somebody?\" essence of Campbell's story remained. Even better, \"movie magic\" technology had made it possible to represent the creature as Campbell presented him: a communal shape-shifter capable of masking his actual identities, but capable of viciously revealing it true multiple natures when threatened or \"hungry\". Carpenter wisely retained most of Campbell's story. Especially effective is the scene where each of the Antarctic station's crew member is tested by having a hot wire submerged in his blood. It's a pity Carpenter didn't retain Campbell's ending, which was to discover that the creature was using equipment parts to build a communicator to alert his kind that the earth was ripe for invasion. Carpenter's ending is not as plausible, but it is certainly more exciting.The television version of the movie adds narrative exposition, providing the background of each character. I believe that was improvement over the initial movie release. After all, the characters start dying off so quickly, it's difficult to identify them, much less develop some empathy. Nonetheless, \"John Carpenter's The Thing\" is taut and terrifying, a genuine classic that did not deserve it's box office failure. Kurt Russell, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Wilford Brimley and the rest of the cast turn in fine performances. Ennio Morricone's terrific music perfectly complements the dark, moody cinematography and editing. The creature effects are outstanding and quite gruesome. Only the short animation sequence lacks plausibility.\"John Carpenter's The Thing\" has finally become a bonafide classic, and that's a good thing (pardon the pun). I give it an \"8\".",

No one would have the nerve to make a film as disgusting as this in the current \"let's not offend anybody at all, ever\" climate. Without a single frame of CGI, the Thing shoves our faces right into Rob Bottin's gruesome make-up effects and proves that genuine, tangible prosthetics and monsters are a million times scarier than a cheap, obvious effect done on a computer in post-production.I don't understand why people keep referring to this as a remake. It's far, far removed from Howard Hawks' version. Even Carpenter himself, a Hawks admirer, says that The Thing is it's own movie, and much closer to the original novella 'Who Goes There' by John W. Campbell Jnr.Set in the lonely Antarctic, The Thing takes the form of a wolf and bounds across the snowscapes to a US research station, pursued by frantic, half-mad Norwegians. Unable to communicate with the English-speaking American team they end up dead before being to warn them that the cuddly dog is actually a hideous shape-shifting monster. The team eventually discover the wreck of an alien spaceship that has been entombed in the ice for at least 100, 000 years before the monster begins to wreak havoc at the research station, intent on consuming all of the humans and making it to civilization where it can take over the entire planet.Fear and paranoia grow among the team as they desperately try to prove who is biologically human and who has been assimilated by The Thing. It's utterly horrific stuff, but it's not without its illogical moments and massive plot holes. The universal adoration of The Thing seems to forget that it doesn't make complete sense. Carpenter admits he lost track of who is and who isn't, which seems kinda lazy. Ambiguity can be a cheap way of maintaining uncertainty and Carpenter should have delivered a more focused and precise plot. Plus the paranoia was way overdone. By the halfway mark I reckon the fear among the men should have been merely implicit rather than verbally delivered at every opportunity.It's rather strange, and fitting, that this movie also comes across as a big-screen adaptation of HP Lovecraft's 'At the Mountains of Madness', which also features research scientists in Antarctica discovering an ancient shape-shifting lifeform and losing their sanity.Despite the problems, this is Carpenter's direction at its best, with long, slow, tracking cameras in gorgeous anamorphic Panavision, evocative lighting, and lonely minimalism. Even Ennio Morricone's score is very much restrained. The cast have their defining features mostly hidden beneath thick facial hair, but Kurt Russell once again proves why he is Carpenter's favorite lead, and the awesome Keith David provides plenty of badassness just with his mere presence.",

There is no mystery here. A human among the group gets infected and the group has to know who became infected.Killing the Thing in the process, it is therefore necessary. Unlike Alien, The Thing tries to create an atmosphere of mistrust in the team, and this raises doubts, creating for this a great aspect in the narrative of the film, to see the human distrusting of each other between the group companions raises the tension to the limits. The tension of the film is constant and the characters are friendly enough so we want to know about them. Be concerned about their fate is good enough to care about these characters.The filmmakers do not try to put any political messages, nor do they want to manipulate the audience. It's a great and straightforward horror movie with sci-fi to mix. It is a survival movie at its best. Unlike Arrival, who tries to pass the message that we have to unite (all nations), otherwise We will not survive. There is something greater here in this movie. A great movie to have fun in the sense of the old B-movies, but also it does not forget that our most basic instinct is survival and when we unite, forgetting our differences (as a group of Individuals, not nations), for the sake of our survival and our well-being, the human race shines in the most intense sense possible. The cooperation between several elements, to come out alive from a complicated situation. No political messages or no unnecessary melodramas (aka Interstellar).I just think the ending was a bit rushed, and needs some more focus on the final elements (characters) of the group. But the filmmakers went straight into the action and the big explosions, unlike Alien, where the tension accelerates to the very end and never stops. On the contrary it accelerates and increases. In this case, I consider Alien a superior film to The Thing (1982). Nonetheless, this movie is still a great horror movie with sci-fi elements, which makes it a great survival film.

When they get to the American base you can tell something is up but you don't know what they're saying, just that they are clearly super freaked out and don't care what they have to do to kill that dog. A great opener that leads very smoothly into the alien getting into the compound while we the audience are just thinking \"what the hell is that dog gonna do\". Then when we finally see it go full alien on the other huskies, the movie has you fully enthralled.From there, you cannot trust anyone and the atmosphere is perfect, showing you just enough of each character to get their vibe and make you wonder if they're one of \"the things\". The practical effects are really great, and have made the movie age much better than if this was CGI. The story is very interesting and suspenseful, Kurt Russel is excellent in this role and cemented himself as one of the few 80s movie-stars that I care about. I am not sure if everyone will love this movie as much as me, but I don't think that anyone could call this a \"bad movie\". Because of my fondness I will give this a 10/10, although it should probably just be a 9/10 because it has aged a little bit.",

It proves that John Carpenter's gross out remake of this 1950's Sci-Fi classic, continues to work its magic even today.Based on the short story \"Who Goes There?\" by John W. Campbell. A group of researchers in Antarctica, stumble across an alien life form at an abandoned post. You never fully see it, and it can assimilate its host whilst picking them off one by one. From there on tension rises, and trusts are tested. Leading to some of the most jaw dropping, gruesome creature effects ever committed to cinema.Watching this recently in the Blu-ray format, just shows how timeless this movie really is. Kurt Russell brings us an incredibly likable anti-hero, whose most prominent scene stealing moment is the legendary \"Blood Test\" scene. All this with Rob Bottin's spectacular creature effects, and Ennio Morricone's tense heart beating soundtrack paints \"Antarctica\" as if it was another planet (Actually frozen sound stages in Los Angeles, and British Columbia).Final Verdict: \"Halloween\" (1978) is a classic, but \"The Thing\" is John Carpenter's masterpiece. It continues to remain superior, regardless of any recent sequel-prequel homages. 9/10. Brilliant Sci-fi Horror.",

Stuck in Antartica on a base with a handful of men and a deadly morphing alien that takes over your body which was dug out of the ice.Considering the age of the movie, the effects are OK. I can get past them...even the \"spider head\", which was quite horrifying to a 10 year old boy.Another thing I like about this movie was the absence of any pointless love affair. In fact the movie lacked females altogether, which seems to be quite rare in today's movies. In all honesty, I felt this added to the atmosphere of the movie.There are a few minor dumb dialog and plot decisions, but does not detract from the movie for me. One thing I found a little silly, was the ending with the alien managing to almost build a spaceship out of spare parts. Ummm....

            "content": "This 1982 remake of THE THING gets my top rating, and few films do. I was awestruck by it from my very first viewing and continue to watch it at least once a year for good measure. An ambitious rehash of Howard Hawks' 1952 THE THING and clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 ALIEN, JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING roughly follows the plot of the original: An alien life form that can imitate anything it desires kills and absorbs humans and other animals left and right. If let loose on the world, it will soon be the only living thing on the planet. A bunch of American scientists and their support team working at an Antarctioc base try to contain the beast, with little success. Hawks made his creature a close copy of Universal's Frankenstein monster, while Carpenter opts to have his Thing morph into all sorts of things, including a sled dog, various people and occasionally a snarling pile of absolutely disgusting ooze and flesh. There's even a funny if stomach-turning moment when the creature is an upside-down head running around on tiny feet. I wouldn't have been surprised if one of the men had said, \"Now there's something you don't see everyday.\" It's a fight to the finish, with a very ambiguous ending. The incredible special effects have never been surpassed. The cast is superb, and includes a very hairy Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Keith David and Richard Dysart. Plus some wonderfully trained dogs, with an astounding opening sequence involving a suspenseful chase across a snowy landscape. The film was shot in Canada, for the record. While each character is nicely defined, Russell is definitely the tie that binds, the John Wayne-type hero facing down the black-hat villain. Several sequences pay fond tribute to Hawks' original. I like that as well. See it. But definitely not at meal time.",

            "content": "John Carpenter exercises as much control over his films as possible. As a pointer to this, many, including The Thing, bear his name as a suffix of sorts in the title. And Carpenter's film relies on its special effects, which are among the most laborious, revolting, and shocking spectacles by its time accomplished by Hollywood's technical wizards. There are times when it appears we are jutting our heads right down into the rancid, gore-gushing jaws of the unidentifiable, as the Thing metamorphoses itself into creatures with the body parts of dogs, men, lobsters, and spiders, all entrenched in gummy intestines. And Jesus, those poor poor dogs. Designer Rob Bottin's work is groundbreaking and extraordinary, yet because it endures in a near abyss in terms of emotional investment, it becomes too aesthetically oppressive and something of an enterprise in abstract art more than film.A spaceship crash-lands on Earth a zillion years ago and is entombed beneath Antarctic ice. There is an organism in it. It is thawed out and researchers in 1982 are ill-timed in finding out that it has the ability to mimic all life-forms. Its urge to live and enlarge is ravenous. It starts to simulate the sled dogs and then the scientists at a secluded Antarctic research station. The central issue comes to be who is real, and who is the Thing.This follow-up to Escape from New York is a skillful gross-out flick, hands down, not to mention scored not by Carpenter himself as per his usual but by the great Ennio Morricone, who departs from his usual aesthetic and composes a very low-key pulse to the movie. However, John Carpenter's The Thing is ineffective in two regards: the shallow drama and the far-fetched actions of the scientists on this glacial frontier. Characters have never been Carpenter's forte. He prefers to see us cardiac than see us concerned with the traits of his characters. This time, though, regardless of some pragmatic pigeonholing and some competent boilerplates like the Leader, the Screw-Loose and the Lush, he has occupied his ice station with people whose essential function in life is to be accosted from behind, which is all the more disappointing because he casts some really good character actors like Keith David and Wilford Brimley. The few scenes that foster actual drama are submerged by the scenes in which the men are mere trip wires for a blitz by the Thing.That brings us to the other problem, credibility. We know that the Thing tends to bide its time until a character is alone, and then ambush, consume and replicate him. Well, the first instinct against this quandary is a padlock buddy system, nevertheless, constantly, Carpenter lets his characters to ramble off alone and return with odd looks on their faces, until we're almost baffled as to who may have been contaminated and who hasn't. At the conclusion of the movie, the survivors ultimately happen upon another whom they all thought before had either died or been contaminated and imitated. Because it had been made clear earlier that the Thing rips through clothing, why their suspicion of whether or not this returning character is real as he is still wearing the same intact clothing as before? I guess one way to look at all this is the obstacle in the way of their survival: the human weakness of constant proclivity for conflict and suspicion keeping them from an obvious goal. But perhaps that takes more than simply letting them disregard the elephant in the room and devolve into slasher film robots.This ostensible remake is all in all a freak carnival, a make-you-sick movie in which kids on dates can giggle every time there's a scare. There's nothing wrong with that, especially since in that sense, it delivers well. I like being scared and I was scared by various moments in this film. It's readily apparent that Carpenter made his decision at the start to focus on the special effects and engineering and to let the story and people to be a side effect. Since this material has been done before, and to superior effect, as close in release period as Alien in fact, there's no requisite to see this paraphrase except if you are intrigued by what the Thing might look like while starting from slippery, unidentifiable innards then forcing out horrifyingly enormous crab legs and mutating itself into a dog. In which case, see it high.",

And I mean this in the most respectful way.Undoubtedly Carpenter's greatest accomplishment, \"The Thing\" is a different sort of horror movie.  For one thing, there are no female roles...none, nada, zip.  In fact, there really aren't even any \"weak\" male parts. There are no individually identifiable victims or threatened individuals.  Instead there's a strange \"socialism of terror\" that comes out in teenage slasher movies and Twilight Zone episodes about the end of the world.  It's also different in that the special effects DO (as stated in several other reviews) drive the plot.  The crew of the station react to the terrifying (and often bloody) situations with a stunning combination of mystified disbelief, bravado, terror, and resignation.The beauty of this film, and where it differs from the earlier version, is that the threat to the crew is based in what is also their strength.  Up until the very last frame of the film, the men must desperately rely upon each other for their safety and security.  Yet the threat in their midst is so dangerous precisely because it preys on this need to trust others.  The men are able to destroy the creature by various means, but only when they can identify it.I won't bore you further.  See this film.

After viewing it, what I don't understand are the views of the critics. I thought this really was a superb remake of the 1951 movie of the same name, different enough to be a totally unique movie-watching experience, but maintaining the same basic plot. My attention was captured from the very beginning, with the scenes of the helicopter chasing the husky across the antarctic landscape, with a gunman on board desperately trying to kill the animal. What's going on? Once we discover that the dog is in fact the alien being (an alien who consumes its victims and then takes on their identical form) the story progresses and becomes completely bewildering (appropriately so, because a big part of the suspense is that neither the viewers nor the characters in the movie know who has been infected by these aliens and who hasn't) and at the same time extremely suspenseful, and sometimes downright frightening.Kurt Russell did a great job in the lead role, and was surrounded by a very capable group of actors who put on a fantastic show. Perhaps worthy of note is that this may be the only movie I've ever seen with an all-male (and I mean totally) cast. There's not a woman to be found in this one. The setting (in an isolated Antarctic scientific outpost) is bleak and claustrophobic, in spite of the fact that there's a lot of open space, and so very effective in creating the perfect mood. The movie is rather gory at times, and the idea for the alien creatures is perhaps borrowed a little too obviously from the movie \"Alien.\" The end is completely anti-climactic and leaves a great deal up in the air, which suggests perhaps that there was hope for a sequel which never came to pass because of the poor reception this movie got. That poor reception was mistaken, though. This is an excellent movie. 8/10",

            "review_title": "Novella to One of the Best Horror Movies Ever",
            "content": "John Carpenter takes a brilliant concept and lanches it ten fold. This movie scared me for such a long time after the first viewing then to learn that it was not only a remake but an adaptation as well it blew my mind. When talking about some of the best horror movies ever this movie comes up on several lists even all of the way at number three. This in my opinion is one of a few films that surpasses the source material.\nThe film opens in space and shows a ship being pulled into the atmosphere and thus the movie begins. After the title opening a dog is seen running in the snow from a helicopter that is shooting down at it, It goes to a camp of twelve men who all seem a little bored and a little anxious to leave, Things only go down from there for these men as the begin to loss complete trust in one another Already things are shrouded in mystery and it escalates dramatically as the movie progresses. To say anymore of the plot would spoil the movie as knowing as little as possible gives the movie a huge advantage to frighten the viewer. \nSome of the aspects and themes that contribute to what makes a horror movie for me are something unknown that lacks normal human morals, panic by the characters, isolation, and a large lack of knowledge of what to do and what is going on. These are all aspects of this film from start to finish. It hits all of the right notes and makes a constant level of mistrust and lack of knowledge. This can not be done without good direction and great acting. The cast is a group of just men fourteen men in total, the two Norwegian men and then all of the Americans, This is a big change from the novella as there are thirty-six men but this way the men have some character development and are fleshed out, so when things start to get tense in the film and you don't know what is going to happen you care for each person their. This is not only done by the acting but by how Carpenter set up each scene and leaving all of the windows open so that you feel the same mistrust that the men at the facility feel. Some of this and more themes lead to this film surpassing the novella. I watched the film before knowing about the novella so going into this film with not knowing what to expect and wanted to be scared and I can say without a doubt I was, from the mystery to the stunning practical effects this movie is one of the best.\nEvery aspect of this movie felt real, from all of the costumes to the practical effects of the beast and the setting, it feels as though I am watching these events first hand. The setting of the film is one of its strongest points, stranded in the middle of a desalite continent with no where to go as the storm covering the glacier would kill you within the hour. It creating such a feel of isolation for these men as they could not escape this thing. This film is probably most famous for its effects. They are perfect. A question was asked about how the effects look today and if they hold up, I heard some people mention that they are dumb looking now but I guarantee that if they were in the presence of the thing they would turn running with their tails between their legs. They are so real and terrifying that it has become one of the most renown horror movies of all time. \nThere is a definite main character of this story, R. J. McReady, as he takes charge of the group and it follows him, but not for the entire film. This film follows a handful characters to expand the view of the mistrust. Even if it is just with a character for a moment it gives a look to what they are thinking and feeling, adding some small things to each of the scenes brings it so much further than the novella was at. Like the scene when McReady goes to ask Blair a question in the shed and they open the little hatch in the door to see him and there is a noose hung by Blair at the table and it is never mentioned, and Blair walks by it not even looking at it. I thought that this was brilliant and it brought a lot of mental distress his character, even though he just walks past it and asks to leave. This sort of pain can be seen in a lot of the characters as they are having inner conflicts not knowing if some of their best friends have been taken over by this monstrosity. \nOne of the most prominent themes of this movie is mistrust. The men all have their composure and are level headed until they get to the Norwegian and realize something very bad is going on. Soon after that everything starts to fall apart for the men, as they can't trust each other at all in fear that the person they are standing next to might not be a person. This leads everyone to be very upset and even to do rash things throughout the film. This same feeling is felt for the viewers as you have no idea if any of the characters are themselves or not. \nJohn Carpenter's The Thing is one of the best horror movies of all time. It far surpasses all of the source material. The film as a whole was almost perfect with a few technical flaws here and there concerning time lapsing, not knowing how much time has gone by when they find the tunnel and the amount of fuel they have for their flamethrowers. Other than that I thought the movie was great and I would give it an A on a letter grade scale from A+ to F. I gave it 10/10 on here but I'd give it a 9 and a half if I could do halves",

I give The Thing a 4 out of 5 because you have to give Carpenter credit for the grotesque special effects. Everything in The Thing is perfect. SPOILER ALERT My only major complaint about it is Death of Nauls scene.  When MacReady, Nauls and Garry are setting the charges, Garry's headlight dies and Blair comes out of nowhere and kills Garry.  When Nauls realizes Garry is missing, he doesn't bother to alert MacReady that Garry is missing.  Then Nauls is attacked by the thing.

I understand that many people might disagree, seeing that it is not a deep movie (in the surface), instead it is a plain survival horror movie, which, could very well be adapted into a PC game. But, there is nothing plain or mundane about \"The Thing\" and what it promises, it delivers. Oh, boy does it deliver. The premise is a remote, isolated science base in Antarctica, with an unknown enemy hunting and killing the inhabitants, while the slowly creeping insanity and subsequent power struggle between them, culminate into an ambiguous ending, which makes you remain numb for a few seconds. I won't spoil the ending- but it is one of the best endings of any movie. The plot depicts a very real horror scenario, that could possibly happen with a few variations- I mean anything can go wrong in an inhospitable, isolated place like Antarctica, and almost all the things that can go wrong, result in death(s), so, the horror is real and authentic. From that respect, the rest of the aspects of the movie, are only secondary. The locations are (mostly) indoors, something which enhances the claustrophobic feel of the base, the direction by Carpenter is, well, Carpenteresque, the acting is solid and the music is spot on, as always. No, the real highlight and protagonist of this film, is the story. The mere idea that you could be stranded in a limited space, in an isolated, frozen desert, with a bunch of people you don't really care about, and with someone or something out for your blood- now that is real horror. This is where the movie shines and this is why I consider it one of the best horror movies. Watch it at night-preferably on a cold, windy night- with the lights out and you won't regret it.",

This film tells the story of a group of scientists and researchers who are stationed at an Antarctic research facility, and who are forced to confront a terrifying and unpredictable creature that can mimic and assimilate other forms of life.One of the film's greatest strengths is its masterful use of suspense and tension. Carpenter builds an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty from the very first scene, creating a palpable sense of danger that only intensifies as the film progresses. The creature design is also top-notch, with the Thing's ability to take on the form of its victims lending a sense of unpredictability to the film's scares.Another standout aspect of the film is its ensemble cast. Kurt Russell gives a standout performance as the film's hero, R. J. MacReady, and the other actors, including Wilford Brimley, T. K.

The film's script, by Bill Lancaster, is also well-written, with sharp dialogue and memorable character moments that help to flesh out the film's world and its characters.The film's practical special effects, created by master effects artist Rob Bottin, are also noteworthy, lending a tangible sense of reality to the film's otherworldly creature. From the Thing's grotesque and inhuman transformations to the film's unforgettable, fiery finale, the effects work is a testament to Bottin's skill and to the art of practical effects.Perhaps most impressive, though, is the film's thematic depth. At its core, \"The Thing\" is a film about trust, paranoia, and the fear of the unknown. It speaks to the human tendency to mistrust one another, especially in times of stress and fear, and it grapples with the idea of what it means to truly know someone, even those closest to us. These themes are woven into the fabric of the film in a way that makes the film's horror all the more impactful, lending the film a depth that many horror films lack.In conclusion, \"The Thing\" is a classic of the sci-fi horror genre, a film that stands the test of time and continues to scare and captivate audiences nearly four decades after its release. From its masterful use of suspense and tension to its standout special effects and its rich thematic depth, \"The Thing\" is a film that truly deserves its place in the pantheon of great horror films. If you're a fan of horror, sci-fi, or just great filmmaking in general, \"The Thing\" is a must-see. I give it a strong 9/10 rating, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thrilling and thought-provoking horror experience.",

            "content": "R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russel) is a helicopter pilot stationed at a US research facility in Antarctica along with ten other researchers and staff members. While prepping for a pending snowstorm, the team encounters a group of Norwegans desperately shooting at a lone sled dog. In the ensuing scuffle, the Norwegans both die and the dog is adopted by the Americans. It turns out, however, that the dog was really an alien lifeform capable of disguising itself as any living creature it \"samples\" and spread like a virus to other organisms. Now the team is being picked of one by one, and anybody could be a \"Thing.\" Despite the familiar and generally worn down plot, \"The Thing\" boasts some of the better visual effects ever caught on film. The depiction of \"The Thing,\" especially as it mutates from a seemingly mundane source (a dog or a average-looking human) is nothing short of nightmarish. Most times it comes off as a mix between a zombie and a spider, although at others it more ambitiously sports an extensively twisted, tortured-looking face, rows of unnaturally-placed teeth and other Hellish details. The hollow, soulless moans that the transforming Things give out is genuinely unsettling, moreso than any mere scream could achieve.The arctic setting perfectly expresses the sense of isolation and hopelessness that the titular Thing thrives in. Carpenter realizes a near \"Shining\" level of isolation through the film's bleak, unending whiteness (sharply juxtaposed against the night sky). Even during brightly lit daytime scenes, Carpenter never fails to create an atmospheric sense of unease.Kurt Russel does a commendable job in the lead role. While nothing exceptional in its own right, it does get the job done here. Keith David is an actor that I'm never disappointed to see. Even if he's not a particularly talented individual, he has a commanding presence on screen that makes him something of a poor man's Samuel L. Jackson.Despite excellent visuals and solid direction, the film never really rises beyond simply being average. It's entertaining more than anything, which can hardly be considered a bad thing. Fans of science fiction or horror alike will enjoy this eery, effects-laden remake of the original 1951 film.",

Not being a massive fan of John Carpenter's work (Michael Myers and Snake Plissken don't really impress me) I wasn't expecting much, without even considering the 80s music and effects. However, in honesty, I was pleasantly surprised. Whilst too many years have passed for the effects to scare or horrify, they at least manage to stay the right side of laughable, so there was no unintentional comedy. The cast was well chosen and stuck to their jobs, and the film was pleasingly bleak and effective. I am not sure that it is quite the classic that I'd been led to believe (maybe you had to see it in '82?) but it is a good solid movie, and worth a watch for anyone else who has gaps in their film history.",

            "content": "Something feels wrong about this movie, there is something in it that is poorly done, something that fails to drive it. The cinematography is beautiful, the visual effects are outstanding, the music is impressive, even though it is very simple and a little annoying. The cast is good, some of these actors need no introduction. The idea behind the movie is very interesting. It is about an isolated place in a very dangerous environment where a group of people encounters an unknown alien creature that can imitate any life form and is a brilliant survivor. But something feels wrong. And that feeling is not a mistake. Something is wrong with the movie. And this is what it is.In \"Alien\", for example, we very quickly get to know the characters in the opening of the movie, before the big adventure begins. They are all together, they are talking to each other, discussing things in a situation that is natural for them. By the time the trouble begins, you care about them. The same goes for \"Predator\" where we get to see them all as one unit before something bad starts happening to them. \"The Thing\" is clearly a monster movie like the two mentioned above, only it fails at the character part of things. The trouble begins at the very beginning of the movie. And our heroes are thrown into danger with no real establishment of what they are, as people. Of course, later, we do get to know them a little, but the characteristics are so basic and simple, and the plot itself is surface level. The movie does not want you to think about any of it, it does not want you to be wandering around here as one of the characters, it only wants you watching. \"Alien\" creates a comfortable atmosphere for the audience before slowly leading you out of your comfort zone. \"Predator\" does the same. Both are smart enough to understand one simple thing.It does not matter what idea you have and how fascinating it may seem, it does not matter how good your movie looks, because the only thing driving any motion picture is the story that it wants to tell. And that, in turn, only works through character. \"The Thing\" however technologically sophisticated it is, fails in that regard, alienating the audience. This movie did not fail at the box office because audiences were stupid and mainstream. It failed because it was stupid and raw. It looks good and pretends to be smarter than it is. It also wants you to take it extremely seriously no matter how questionable or plain stupid the heroes may behave. Overall, a boring experience with a jump scare or two to prevent you from falling asleep.",

            "content": "First time round, in 1982, this was a scary movie. Having seen it again, recently, it's not as scary as, say, Hallloween (1978), Alien (1979) and others. More importantly, nearly thirty years later, it's now much easier for me to spot the shortcomings of the narrative.But, I'll ignore those so as not to spoil the story which I first saw in the 1951 version (largely produced by Howard Hawks). For its time, that also was a scary movie (for a ten year old) which also served as a political metaphor about the dangers of the Soviet Union and communism. This 1982 version, however, avoids that trap by eliminating all of the military aspects so prevalent in the earlier version.Essentially, the story follows the book written by John Campbell quite well (unlike the 1951 production), showing how a particularly vicious alien attempts to take over and literally absorb \u2013 into itself \u2013 the scientists and support personnel at an American Antarctic base station. In a series of graphically violent situations, we see how the alien infiltrates and, when finding one of the humans alone, attacks, envelops and eventually takes on the physical appearance of its victims.Hence, creeping paranoia and mutual distrust invade the humans. And, very cleverly, the script and direction make sure that, as viewers, we can never be entirely certain about the true identity of each character as the story reaches its inevitable conclusion \u2013 and, by implication, beyond.The special alien effects are still worthy of special mention, particularly as it was all done without any help from CGI. The early scene in the dog pen, when we first see the nasty beast, can never be forgotten, I think; the destroyed Norwegian base camp is suitably spooky and scary; and the scene where MacReady (Kurt Russell) conducts his own blood tests to weed out the good humans from the bad ones is a tour de force in suspense. Added to all of that is Ennio Morricone's brooding, throbbing, menacing sound track \u2013 pervasively shadowing the action, its beat emphasizing the time ticking away as the desperate men battle each other and the alien.Arguably, this is equally a movie about terror as much as horror: the terror of the malevolent unknown, and the horror of one's fellow man taking on the guise of that malevolence. To cap it all, there is no escape, even for the survivors \u2013 who may or may not be human anyway. Make your own assessment if you see this movie from John Carpenter, one of the true masters of terror and horror.Recommended for all lovers of sci-fi who like to be scared witless.",

John Carpenter's The Thing is a remake of Howard Hawk's The Thing From Another World made in 1951. The film is scary because they're trapped inside with each other and one of them is The Thing and they can't stay outside because they'll freeze. The paranoia is great between the characters as they start to distrust each other thinking one of them could be it. The music score is another thing why I enjoy this movie because it's so creepy and makes this film more scary, The Thing effects are brilliant and really impressive since all of it is hand made since CGI wasn't made then. The effects are also really gory and disturbing like when Blair does an autopsy on the body of The Thing.

            "content": "John Carpenter was probably the man to beat during the late 70's and early 80's in terms of horror flicks, and ranking as his greatest film, is most certainly the Thing. This is a creature horror, a genre that rarely hit's the mark, but most memorably perhaps with this film, and Ridley Scott's Alien, a few years previously (for the best recent example, check out The Descent). The Thing also ranks as Kurt Russell's greatest cinematical moment. This came shortly after Carpenter himself had helped Russell expunge himself from his longstanding Disney poster boy image (In Escape From New York). Indeed the collaborations of Carpenter and Russell always hit the mark, and established Russell as one of the coolest, cultest, action guys of the 80's.Here the story centres around RJ MacReady (as cool a name as you'll get in cinema, perhaps seconded only to Snake Pliskin) and his workmates stationed out in a remote scientific research station in the Antarctic. When a chopper carrying Norwegian's from a nearby station fly's over their airspace, while shooting at a husky, something seems amiss. The Norwegians seem intent on destroying the seemingly innocent dog, and after inadvertently blowing up their own chopper and wounding one of the American men, the remaining Norwegian is shot down. When MacReady and Co take a look at the remains of the Norwegian camp they discover it all but destroyed with no survivors and only a hideously mutated carcass, and a huge crater. As the film progresses we soon discover that the camp was destroyed by an alien shape-shifter, that absorbs the bodies it contacts and takes over that form (the dog, and then down the line the crew members). The genius in The Thing is, from a certain point on, Carpenter builds up the tension between the American crew. No one trusts anyone, and sanity is pushed to the limit. One by one they all get killed by the Alien, or by each other. Above the amazing special FX in this film it's the human interaction that creates the most tension. Kudo's to JC for creating a really intelligent horror.As mentioned the FX are amazing. All the creature FX are top class, and of course done long before CGI came and reared it's ugly head. The FX in this, by Rob Bottin, and also Stan Winston, outdo anything I've seen done in a computer with creature makeup etc. The film is pretty creepy and gruesome at times with some nightmarish imagery, and Carpenter pulls off some brilliant jump scares in the film, some of the most perfectly set up and timed scares ever committed to film.The cast are excellent. There's a host of characters and in the support of Russell, Wilfred Brimley and Keith David are particularly good. Kurt Russell though is the man, playing his role superbly as an actor and as an action man. People seem too quick to remember Willis, Stallone and Schwarzengger as the 80's action gods, when Russell preceded them all. Russell is after all one of the few people to ever successfully pull off the mullet.Carpenter has never exceeded his work here. It's brilliantly paced, shot and edited and Carpenter has a control over proceedings that exceeds all his other work. Aided also by a fantastically uncharacteristic score by Ennio Morricone, who does a very Capenteresque score, and something that is fully of eerie menace. This is without doubt one of the best of its genre. *****",

It's based on the John W.Campbell short story \"Who Goes There?\" The film is awesome.The Thing is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models, that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell as R.J \"Mac\" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible. Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage, giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along with Alien. 10/10 from me.",

All of this leads to the discovery of a creature who's been buried in the snow.

A great story, because it doesn't reveal everything and it doesn't have to - it leaves a lot up to the audience's interpretation, and remains mysteriously ambiguous most of the time. Because you don't know who gets infected and when, the film is even more suspenseful, as the audience is in the same position as the characters. And the ending, while hopeless and depressing, fits the film perfectly. Plus, the makeup effects in this film are outstanding and just add to the pure shock of the scenes they're in.

In the beginning, the story takes its time, building on the threat and fear of the creature. But this slowly transitions into a paranoia-stricken thriller that has everyone painted as a potential threat. This worked really well, keeping the audience constantly on their toes not knowing who to trust. Throughout the course of the film, there is not an incredible amount of action. The movie thrives on the tension that slowly builds through the characters distrust, but this lends itself to making the more action-packed scenes that much more effective. The prosthetic and prop department did such an incredible job on the effects. There are some really twisted scenes combining body gore and genuine horror that was ahead of its time.Technically, this film is superb. The acting is great all around, but Kurt Russell shines in this role, taking over every scene he is in. The score is subtle but adds a sense of ominousness to the film that I really appreciated. Cinematography is top notch, with some impressive set designs and creative shots that create a great amount of immersion.Overall, this film is amazing. Although it does impact me as much as Halloween did, it is still an instant classic that should go down as John Carpenter's 1B to his Halloween masterpiece.Score: 91%\nVerdict: Excellent.",

            "content": "John Carpenter's The Thing is one of those beloved relics of the '80s that was considered a game-changer for creature-features. Viewing the movie thirty years removed from that era, the ideas it presents remain as alarming as ever; this is not a thriller in which ordinary beasts seek to destroy a gathering of unsuspecting victims, but one in which they take on the traits of earthly organisms and walk among them as part of a convincing ruse to adapt to a new foreign environment.Ominously bland shots of the Antarctic profile introduce us to R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell), a pilot with an American research crew who, along with a gathering of other morose men, is about to be involved in one hell of a tricky predicament. The marvelously disconcerting prologue suggests so, of course, as a handsome Alaskan malamute (with a little more sobriety than typically seen in dogs) gallops across the Antarctic tundra, a nearby helicopter full of eager Norwegians pursues it, hoping to shoot the animal dead in its tracks. That grim pursuit takes them right into the base of the American researchers, who respond with confounding resistance. An explosion and an assassination later, the American crew takes the dog in, only to discover too late that appearances can be deceptive. It turns out that the dog is indeed the alien creature that has assumed the guise of a dog. It soon proceeds to infiltrate the unsuspecting crew members of the camp, and the good guys try to figure out which of them may have been compromised. Throughout the course of the movie, a lot of terrible things happen to this ensemble of characters while the monster in its fuzzy new form snuggles up to its fresh banquet of victims. What it does is the unthinkable: consume people and then essentially take on their characteristics, allowing them to move undetected amongst others. When this knowledge is shared with the scientists, ensuing hysteria overwhelms their need for survival, and inevitably the movie becomes a cat-and-mouse game in which it's not just about how to destroy the fiend, but where to find it and who to trust among the ensemble of wary survivors.Carpenter's thriller is a masterful exercise in claustrophobic suspense, far superior to other sloppy efforts that have saturated the market with a relentless supply of bloodthirsty monsters jumping out from the shadows: a peerless masterpiece of retina-wrecking visuals (with remarkable special effects). Carpenter capitalizes on the dramatic possibilities inherent in the contrast between the cramped interiors of the station and the vast expanse of the wintry landscape outside. He uses this disparity to amazing effect to create an atmosphere of testosterone-fueled paranoia. The strong cast brings the somewhat underwritten characters to vivid life.Though are eyes are horrified and our hearts often unsettled, we watch on as if hypnotized by an unfolding nightmare from which there is no turning away!",

They figure out that the aliens 'hide' inside the humans and other living things, and each starts getting paranoid as to which one(s) of them may be a host.The result?  An intense, suspenseful thrill-ride where you never lose your attention!  Oh, and another gem that I can't not mention is the makeup.

It's a tough call with other films like Halloween, They Live, or Big Trouble in Little China in his filmography but it is definitely up there. Despite all the impressive aspects of the movie previously mentioned, the greatest part of this film that easily holds a candle to it today are the special effects.

Maybe we've got a creature with mind-numbing power and a real threat to the human race but there's no dramatic build-up, no interplay between characters, absolutely no humor--in other words, a good time is had by none.Would have liked to have seen a story unfold like the original instead of the steady series of blows to the gut that Carpenter delivers.

            "content": "How great is The Thing? Up there with 'Alien' and 'The Fly' as the greatest sci-fi horror ever (interesting that The Fly is also a remake of an earlier film). Ironically John Carpenter says that what attracted him to the story was that it wasn't about another group of dumb teenagers getting sliced up by some psycho when he practically invented that genre with Halloween. But he's right, all the characters in The Thing are capable, intelligent men faced with an unbelievable situation and dealing with it pretty admirably. Good things abound in this film, the special effects are terrific and still stand up after 30 years. The plotting is great, we're still debating aspects of the film to this day, you see something new every time you watch it. Set pieces such as the scene with the dogs, the defibrillator sequence and the blood test scene are simply marvellous. The dialogue is terrific; Garry's rant on the couch just pipping Palmer's incongruous spotting of Norris' head scuttling away. Also fond of Clark upon discovering The Thing attacking his dogs \"I don't know what's in there but it's weird and p*ssed off!\" Fantastic soundtrack too, amazed that John Carpenter didn't do the music himself because Enrico does a great job, full of foreboding and tension. Good acting especially given the fantastical nature of what they're reacting to. Very little bad although it does seem a little trite that The Thing turns up in the one place on Earth where you'd reasonably expect people to have flamethrowers handy but you forgive it. So what happens in the end? Personally I figure neither Mac nor Childs is The Thing (especially given the earring revelation of the 2011 film) and either a military helicopter turns up or Kate from the 2011 film arrives in her snow cat to take them to safety. But who knows what other secrets the spaceship contains? I'd love to see a scene where they are able to contain someone infected with The Thing and ask it what it actually wants? To conquer the world, to go home or is it some sort of interplanetary explorer which is taking samples in order to understand our world? All told John Carpenter at his finest",

With the arrival of a seemingly insane Norweigen helicopter crew shooting wildly at a fleeing husky dog the film starts with violence. The dog runs in to the American base prompting the hysterical rifleman to chase after him, firing blindly. Garry the base officer shoots and kills him. After trying to radio out for advice on how to proceed the base radio operator 'Windows' tells them he has been getting nothing but static for two weeks. Concerned at this crews seemingly randomly insane behaviour, Dr Copper wants to check on the Norweigen crew at their base in case anyone else is hurt, recruiting helicoper pilot McReady to shuttle him. The Norweigen base is destroyed, decimated by fire. Searching the ruins they see the grisly sight of a man who has cut his throat and wrists in an apparent suicide..what happened here to make a man do this to himself. Could they have all gone crazy out here in the frozen wilderness?. Outside they come across what appears to be the burnt remains of several men , they wrap it up and take it back for examination. Later Fuchs the dog handler takes the dog which has been wandering aimlessly about the base and puts it with the other huskies. Checking on the animal later to see how it is settling in he is confronted with something out of a nightmare..something is killing the dogs . The men spring in to action and use a flamethrower on the monster they find, but not before it cleaves off a part of itself and disappears through the roof of the dog shed. Blair the biologist does an autopsy of the dogs mangled remains and makes a horrific discovery. The dogs were not being attacked they were being taken over by this creature, and then imitated. After further research in to the imitations capabilities Blair comes to the stark conclusion ..if one single cell of this imitator reaches a populated area in 27,000 hours it will have imitated the entire population of the earth. And there is further bad news, there is a 75% chance that one or more members of the crew have now been imitated. With this realisation paranoia descends on the crew as they realise this alien can imitate anyone of them perfectly and no one would know until it is too late. With trust gone, how will the men survive ?. Part of John Carpenters 'Apocolypse Trilogy' ( the other two being; In The Mouth Of Madness and Escape From L.A) The Thing is his masterwork. A brilliant adaptation of sci-fi short story 'Who Goes There?'. Focusing on the paranoia of an enclosed group who are isolated from civilisation and the authoritys by their environment. And this is interesting, when the alien(s) can look like anybody who can you trust?. Certainly not the head of the base Garry ( brilliantly played by the reliable Donald Moffat) who the group begin to suspect when the blood is contaminated. There are no square jawed heroics in this bleak film, the characters are all ordinary men thrust in to a terrifying situation with a creature they have no control over. A being who lives by taking over, then imitating others. Ruthless decisions are made and made quickly. McReady is the loner alcoholic pilot who takes control when others refuse it. But we see he is doing this for one reason only- to protect his own hide. When push comes to shove ( and it does) Mcready is more than willing to kill any of his co-workers if he suspects one of them is a Thing. The Thing is clever and manipulative and uses the mens suspicion of each other to divide them, getting them alone so it can attack and imitate.. The acting in this movie is excellent, all the actors working at the peak of their powers to create realistic , physical characters with all their flaws and pettiness. Kurt Russell turns in one of his best performances as the pilot McReady a man who is not to be crossed when the chips are down. The ending is bleak and ambiguous. With the fires dying down and the temperature dropping Childs and McReady seemed fated to die. Is one of them an imitation?. This film will have you talking afterwards, would we all react the same in similar situations, turning on each other?. This remains my favourite John Carpenter movie and one of my favourite films of all time.",

Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron, David Cronenberg, John Mctiernan and Ridley Scott should have been the most likely candidates for directing the remake. A remake of the classic 1951 Howard Hawks-Christian Nyby film The Thing from Another World, Carpenter's film is a more faithful adaptation of the novella Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell, Jr. which inspired the 1951 film.The box office performance of the film was poor. This has been attributed to many factors, including Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which was released at the time and features a more optimistic view of alien visitation.However, The Thing has gone on to gain a cult following with the release on home video. It was subsequently 'novelized' in 1982, adapted into a comic book miniseries published by Dark Horse Comics, and was followed by a video game sequel in 2002, with a film prequel currently in the works.Full Plot: In winter 1982, an American Antarctic research station is alerted by gunfire and explosions. Pursued by a Norwegian helicopter, an Alaskan Malamute makes its way into the camp as the science station's crew looks on in confusion. Through reckless use of a thermite charge, the helicopter is destroyed and its pilot killed shortly after landing. The surviving passenger fires at the dog with a rifle, grazing George Bennings (Peter Maloney), one of the researchers. The passenger is shot and killed by Garry (Donald Moffat), the station commander. Not knowing what to make of the incident, the station crew adopts the dog.What the Research Team don't know is that the Norwegians were only out to destroy the Alaskan Malamute. Unable to contact the outside world via hand radio, helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell) and Copper (Richard Dysart) risk a flight to the Norwegian camp....... And that's when the film really begins.What were the reasons behind the Norwegian attack?

It puts to shame such films as \"Aliens\" or \"Armageddon\" that are content to inundate the viewer with special effects while their plots revolve around stunts that butcher the laws of physics, testosterone-laden one-liners, heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer Iraq, and pathetic attempts to inject \"meaning\" into the barrage on screen with \"emotional sequences\" that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience.   The supreme tragedy, of course, is that these kind of lobotomized movies are also the most popular.  I think that there is a cause for this, although it isn't very comforting.   There is an increasing trend in our culture to passively \"surrender\" to the media -- to immerse oneself in the images we see without dedicating a single brain cell to comprehending the statement the work is trying to make.  This mindset is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even the once-hallowed print medium is being diluted, thanks to the abominable \"reader response\" theory that pervades our schools and the \"tabloid brigade\" that lines our magazine racks whose mentality appears to be infiltrating the once-venerable mainstream press.  Nowadays, we just flip the switch and put our minds on \"pause.\"  Is \"The Thing\" a \"good\" movie?  For the rare individual who still values his faculty of reason, a more appropriate term would be \"entertaining.\"  Its plot keeps one guessing, its ending is uncompromising, and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia.  Upon subsequent viewings, one begins to note a conspicuous lack of depth in the acting, but the taut storyline remains compelling. Of course, \"Citizen Kane\" it's not, but then again sci-fi never was a thinking-man's genre...",

            "content": "Don't get me wrong. This film is very watchable, even more than once (which is fortunate, since the movie is literally run on the ad-free retro cable channels daily).We must accept the premise of body snatching. I'm good with that. It's the implausible circumstances and idiotic human behavior that become hard to swallow afterward.The opening scene reveals a Norwegian helicopter chasing a husky sled dog across antarctic snow. They shoot repeatedly at the dog with a rifle, at a range of less than 100 feet, unable to even wing the dog that is running an arrow straight line, on a non-windy day, over the course of several miles. That's somewhat implausible, but its necessary the infected dog make it to the American research outpost, or we don't have a movie.The Norwegian helicopter lands near the American research outpost. The shooter pursues the dog on foot and keeps shooting at the dog (missing it, of course), and thus also at the Americans. The shooter is supposedly a research scientist from Norway, yet he speaks not a single word of English, so the Americans can't understand from his screaming (in a foreign language, per the subtitles!) that the dog is a menace. 90% of Norwegians speak English in real life, so one might expect a research scientist encountering Americans at an American station to do so. Anyway... the Americans are, of course, much better shots, and they kill the Norwegian shooter dead as a doorknob with one round. The other Norwegian, who also apparently doesn't speak English, exits the chopper, and despite the dog being hopelessly out of range, pulls the pin on a thermite grenade and then incompetently drops it, thus killing himself and destroying the Norwegian chopper.Then the plot gets somewhat better. The body snatching alien that has replicated itself as the husky makes itself known, starts transmuting itself from the infected dog into the American scientists. Havoc ensues.Moving forward, we learn that the most plentiful hardware at the American research station are countless flamethrowers, an endless supply of dynamite, and glass cabinets full of rifles and sidearms. Heaven knows, when you are performing dangerous tasks like measuring temperature, wind speed, and the drift rate of ice floes, you are definitely going to need those!Then there are wall to wall computer and instrument racks inside the station that serve no apparent purpose. But, they have only one radio in the station. And after that radio is destroyed by Blair, the staff do nothing to safeguard the remaining one that is undoubtedly in their huge Triokol treaded snow machine.They blast and burn a bunch of half formed alien monsters and decide to put the corpses into room temperature storage, instead of outdoors in the cold. Cripes, from almost the beginning of the movie we know the aliens are rendered inert by cold, so why they do this defies reason. Never mind the mess and stench of rotting flesh that anybody that has ever owned a refrigerator would just say 'hell no'!They eventually lock team member Blair, who went on a rampage, destroying everything in sight with a fire ax, in the remote toolshed! Nice choice! Then, since he's locked up with no food and they have to bring him three square meals a day, one would think they would be checking on him all the time. Yet, inside a week he has supposedly been able to remove the floorboards of the shed and dig a huge underground cavern, at least ten times the size of the shed, in the snow beneath. Also he's carried very big and heavy machine tools down below, like drill presses (which nobody feeding him notice are missing), and has almost completely built some sort of jet aircraft from parts he's scavenged off the American helicopter, undetected! On top of that, there would be a gigantic mountain of excavated snow behind or around the shed, and that's not evident. And nobody noticed him constantly going back and forth to the chopper, spending countless hours scavenging parts? It's utter nonsense.Another minor annoyance is that, for most of the movie, they use flares for emergency lighting. Do they not have tactical battery powered flashlights? They even use flares indoors. That smoke must be awful. Then, with about twenty minutes remaining in the film, you see everyone using flashlights and no more flares. I just don't get it.Anyway, it's still a good movie.",

            "content": "The 1951 film The Thing from Another World is a classic of its era, but doesn't feel very suspenseful in retrospect. John Carpenter's remake from 1982 reportedly follows the original book by John W. Campbell, Jr. more closely and hasn't lost any of its effect over the almost 30 years since it was first released. The plot premise is the same in both films: a team of scientists on a research station in Antarctica comes across an alien spacecraft that has been buried under the ice for thousands of years. After discovering the hideously mutated remains of another research team, they realize that they are dealing with a hostile organism that can infect any living creature it encounters with gruesome consequences. To their horror, they become aware that some of their own team members may also have become infected... but which ones?The number of actors is small, but the twelve men on the station suit their roles naturally. MacReady, the leader of the group, is played by the always charismatic Kurt Russell, but I would also mention Wilford Brimley as Blair, the station's doctor who cannot cope with the stress, and Keith David as Childs, a strong and somewhat menacing team member. Besides the sparseness of human presence, the atmosphere is also intensified by the overwhelming isolation of the station. The claustrophobic rooms and corridors of the interior scenes contrasted with the vast empty plains that expand all around the compound create a very effective setting for the distressing tale that Carpenter handles skilfully throughout.What I like the most about the film, particularly when compared to the 1951 film, is that the effect of isolation, uncertainty and stress on the crew is explored so effectively. The tense contacts between the characters are essential for the mood, and it's enjoyable to follow the team's evolvement from a carefree and somewhat bohemian bunch to nervous wrecks. Besides the atmosphere, the film also puts more emphasis on spectacular gore effects that are a real treat for any slime fan. The tentacles, crawling body parts and the arm-chewing ribcage are not far from black comedy, but never come across as unfitting for the style.The cinematography also looks good, ranging from the blue darkness of the snowy plains lit by red emergency torches to the flaming interiors. Since the gore and suspense are in good balance and even the last shot holds on to the hopeless aura the film radiates, there is no reason why any horror or sci-fi fan should skip The Thing; it is essential viewing in both genres.",

            "content": "One thing you may notice about some of the best horror films is that they know how to portray the feeling of being alone. Nothing is scarier then knowing that no help can or will come when darkness is taking fold. Either you have to figure out a way to defeat it or you have to accept that your end is about to come. You simply have to hope. The Haunting, The Exorcist, Evil Dead, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are great examples about the terror of being alone. Even modern movies like Saw, Paranormal Activity, and Get Out use the same element to create that same level of suspense. I've said before that I considered John Carpenter's Halloween to be overrated as I found the premise slow and poorly written. While it too has the feeling of being alone, today's movie, The Thing, is a better example of that. The only thing worse then being in the middle of nowhere is having to be there with something you have no understanding of at all. That should really be the case for a lot of alien movies, as if an extraterrestrial being was going to attack, how would we know what to do? The Thing makes great suspense around that. In Antarctica, a group of American scientists are holding up for the long season as they do whatever they do. They see a Norwegian helicopter flying in, trying to shoot a dog, only for it to land and start shooting the Americans. They manage to defend themselves before the Norwegian accidentally blows up the helicopter, killing him in the process. Helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady (played by Kurt Russell) and Dr. Cooper (played by Richard Dysart) go to the Norwegian base, only to find the place abandoned with dead bodies and video tapes. The Americans keep the dog, unaware their making a big mistake.When the dog is boarded with the sled dogs, it attacks them, metamorphing into a hideous monster. MacReady manages to use a flamethrower in time with friend Childs (played by Keith David). Fellow scientist Blair (played by A. Wilford Brimley) performs an autopsy on one of the dead Norwegians, to discover that the monster can imitate anything. This creates paranoia amongst the group as they know the alien's cells are still circulating around the camp and that if it gets into civilization, it's the end of human life as they know it. It's a race to see whose lying and which member is now the monster\u0085the thing.I'm stopping right there as this movies is at it's best when you don't know much about it. The Thing may be not just Carpenter's best work, but one of the best horror movies. It all revolves around the constant feeling that the environment is a ticking time bomb (like Assault on Precinct 13), but adds on the idea that no one can be trusted. I was concerned as I didn't get into his previous horror movie, Halloween, but Carpenter has found the right thing that makes it work; interesting characters.Kurt Russell is once again a great lead, playing the leader-hero you'd expect, but now that he has that heightened sense of fright, your with him, not sure just who to trust, even though you'd like the believe those that say their alright. That's because the movie takes time to show that this is a group of guys that have been there for a while and are friends. The dynamic is tested to the limit when all gloves come off to see when the alien will stand. Which one is lying? Whose got that element that's slightly off? Is it the fear? Is it the alien? The Thing goes into that. Once the alien shows itself, you get an impressive looking set of practical effects that gives it an unnerving appearance\u0085all kinds. I can't describe the creature, as it's made up of the victims it's killed, all melded together to make something very gross, yet is still able to do anything to add on. As the story progresses, it only gets bigger and uglier, making it more of a challenge to destroy. It all leads to a fantastic standoff that sums up how well built a movie can be.I'll give this ten thing creatures out of ten. The Thing may be my favorite John Carpenter film, as it contains most of his elements, while having a lot of that suspense that I originally thought I was going to get with Halloween. This is not a duplicate or a copy of another horror story (despite being a remake). This is the read deal. Check out The Thing.",

            "content": "This is one of those movies that give me a feeling of nostalgia like few others. I remember being a kid and watching this over and over on video and on cable whenever it aired.Some would say that this is Carpenter's best work and it's tough to argue against that point because it's such a great film. It succeeds at creating this mood that's so palpable that I can only think of a few horror films released after this that achieve the same effect. I love the feeling of despair in this film, especially when the team realizes that they're not going to make it off of the outpost alive. You never know who's going to be next in line to become a mess of tentacles, teeth and slime and you never know who's going to bite it. The true horror of the situation that these men find themselves in is captured perfectly through the skillful direction of Carpenter, the acting by the uniformly excellent cast and the music by Ennio Morricone, which helps to seal the deal.The special effects by Rob Bottin still hold up even after the nearly twenty five years since the film's release. This film has one (actually, I should say several because this thing never looks the same every time it appears) of the most wildly imaginative designs for a space creature that I've ever seen.There are many scenes in the film that are classics, my favorite being the initial discovery of the creature manifested as a dog. It's one of the most revolting scenes ever, in my opinion. Another fantastic scene is the blood test scene that somehow manages to make me jump occasionally, even though I know when the big reveal is coming. The ambiguous ending is one of the best ever. We will probably never know just how things ended up* (see below), will we? This is another grade-A effort from Carpenter and I applaud him for this one. Highly recommended! RATING ***** out of *****.NOTE* They made a video game for the Xbox which was considered an official sequel to the film and it actually does answer the question of who survived.

            "content": "Spoilers exist.The Thing is a modification of ALIEN.  Not a clone, not a rip-off, but a modification.  James Cameron obviously took a lot of elements from this movie, both obvious and subtle for Terminator 2, The Abyss, and Aliens.  The characterizations are very Cameron-esque and the consistent use of props to advance the plot are extremely similar.  Horror, like action, is frequently about repeating the same core three or four elements...which The Thing does in great profundity.  Traces are evident from The Andromeda Strain, THEM!, 2001, and The Shining.  Unfortunately, the story--necessary in a film of this caliber--is more a prop to showcase Rob Bottin's wicked creations.If there are four levels of horror in the genre, with level one being ingenious, then The Thing probably is the best of level three.  There are many positive aspects to it, but so many times the story is hurt by useless cliches such as \"Guy runs off alone without telling anyone else what he's doing\".  These are minor qualms, as are my thoughts concerning the variety and quantity of weapons at the research station.  The Thing is, more or less, a condensed version of ALIENS.This is Carpenter's best movie.  He alienates the camera from the characters.  Watch the blood discovery scene, how many viewpoints and perspectives are taken into account.  Some other group scenes like the many \"fireplace\" moments aren't as adaptive.  There are the usual story deficiencies and lack of sophistication (Kurt Russell the anti-hero again, who'd have guessed?), but this time there is no budget hampering like in The Fog and They Live.  Another minor qualm is why did Ennio Morricone do the music?  Carpenter could've done it himself, it sounds like his usual work. Maybe The Thing is too slick for its own good.  Many themes are used, none to their full potential, but all are subsequently more useful than the slasher icon of Halloween.  Isolation, Paranoia, Trust, and the usual crackpot biology that requires just a little research to find the holes in it.  Is stop-motion's future in horror films?  Between Carpenter, Raimi, and Burton I thought there'd be a rebirth in the technique.  So far Chicken Run hasn't sparked any renewed interest...Overall, could've used more depth.  My last qualm is The Thing uses the two stereotypes for blacks, jive loudmouth and tough boss.  The ending, IMHO, is anti-crowd-pleasing and a radical departure from the mainstream.  Kudos. (67%)",

The cast is flawless, with each of the dozen characters fleshed out in an amazingly short period of time. Even the dog is a fantastic actor. I rarely gush unabashedly about a movie, but really, it's a masterpiece. Just the \"heart attack\" sequence alone puts this in the pantheon of great horror flicks. My complaints are few- parts of the story are a little hard to get upon one viewing, but rather than there being plot holes there is room for discussion for what's going on. What we see is not all that is going on- the people in this movie are always doing something, even if it's not on screen. The ambiguous ending also allows for tons of post-viewing conversation.

The amount of suspense that gets built here is monumental and that's the ace-point of the film.The film is set entirely in Antarctica where the researchers encounter a strange alien creature called 'The Thing' that can mimic any living thing.It kills the person it copies before taking the form. The cold and isolated location on Antarctica where the events take place induces the scary atmosphere. The music is even more haunting. There is lot of gore so have a strong stomach. Seriously, the detailing is too much. There are many moments in the film where no one has any idea whom the thing has mimicked and the suspense is at its peak.The only major problem with the film is that its doesn't induce varied characterization. There are 12 researchers and none of them stands out among the rest.I don't mean the acting was bad which by the way was excellent, but all of them have similar expression there is no unique character.Also some more interesting sub-plot development was possible which I would liked more, anyways the film is kept tight.The Thing is a must-watch for horror fans and rest can also give it go if they can handle the gore.RATING:[4/5]",

More closely resembling the novel it was based on \"Who Goes There?\" than the 1950s flick which only follows the first part of the story with the scientists finding the spacecraft, John Carpenter's remake made an icon out of the terrifying shape-shifting visitor.It's a typical monster run amok, but this time none of the characters know who's real and who's a thing because the organism is able to assimilate its victims and take on their likeness. When it attacks, it rips itself apart into a bloody blob of grotesque body parts. It really draws tension between the characters, which makes it especially interesting and the concept of not knowing who's who is pretty scary. Heck, the things are pretty scary, taking on ugly forms and making that wailing scream can send chills down one's spine. Thankfully, our heroes are armed with one of my favorite weapons of all time: the flamethrower, the only effective tool against the organisms. I'm happy that the Thing is more like the book because the 1950s interpretation of the creature is not very faithful being a blood-sucking Frankenstein-like humanoid made of vegetables.With actors like Kurt Russel and Keith David and a good balance of horror, sci-fi, and mild comedy, this is an excellent movie and I look forward to seeing the 2011 prequel.",

Although it was not a box-office success upon original release, John Carpenter's remake of the Hollywood horror classic has gone on to achieve cult success over the years, and stands as one of the scariest horror films I have seen to date.Based on a short story by famed science-fiction author John W. Campbell, Jr., entitled 'Who Goes There?', The Thing was brought to the screen in the 1950's by famed producer-director Howard Hawks in what is viewed as a seminal horror classic, although it heavily deviated from the source material, and generally doesn't stand up to scrutiny for modern audiences. When bringing a new version to the screen, Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster stuck closer to the source story and crafted a tale of paranoia and isolation that works on your nerves and rarely gives you a moment to relax throughout it's running timeSet at an American Antarctic research station in the dead of winter, The Thing opens with two Norwegian scientists from a nearby station chasing a dog across the barren wasteland in a helicopter, attempting to shoot it. They arrive at the American camp and in their attempt to kill the dog appear to attack the members of the American party and are themselves killed in the process. Curious about what would lead the Norwegian scientists to follow such a strange course of action, the American expedition's doctor, Copper (Richard Dysart) and helicopter pilot Macready (Kurt Russell) make their way to the Norwegian camp and discover it destroyed and all members of the expedition dead, some in rather mysterious ways. They also come across a video recording of a recent dig the Norwegian's performed at a nearby site as well as a block of ice that was carved out of the ground and appears to have contained something approximately human-sized. Copper and Macready then investigate the dig site and discover a large saucer shaped space craft in the ice. They quickly determine that the object in the ice was a creature from another planet that was excavated and thawed out, and shortly thereafter, the dog that the Norwegian's were chasing reveals it's true nature: an alien shape-shifter that can take on any appearance it chooses, and can spread to multiple individuals at the same time, essentially replicating itself at will. Blair (Wilford Brimley), the lead scientist, upon discovery of this fact destroys the expedition's radio and all means of transport with the intention of ensuring that the alien does not spread to the outside world, knowing that if that were to happen, humanity itself would fall, replaced by replicating things.The Thing is, much like the classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a film that asks the most basic of questions: Can you trust the person sitting next to you? As realized by Carpenter and Lancaster, The Thing keeps you guessing and unsure of all the characters throughout the film, constantly putting them in situations that could lead to them being consumed by the thing, or just as easily not, leaving the audience unsure of who is human and who isn't. The tables are turned on characters several times through the film, causing our belief of who is and isn't infected to constantly be in a sense of motion. One of the film's strongest aspects is that most of the characters, while not supremely well defined, are given enough personality and individuality for us to root for them to come out of the ordeal alive, giving us a stronger stake in the events on screen. If we didn't care for these characters at all, the tension and suspense wouldn't work nearly as well.The film is also helped by a strong sense of isolation. Like many horror films, such as Alien, placing the characters in an environment with no way out gives you an even greater sense of unease, and you can feel how the characters are trapped by their surroundings, as well as by each other. One aspect of the Thing that was groundbreaking at the time was the make-up effects crafted by Rob Bottin. In the early '80s there was a rash of films that were based around elaborate make-up effects, and The Thing is one of the standouts. Almost all the make-up effects are spectacular and create the appropriate sense of revulsion and horror that they should. Some audience members will be turned away by the sometimes extreme nature of the effects, but they are actually much less bloody and disgusting than countless other horror films that came about as the decade went on. What is featured in The Thing does not feel gratuitous.Most of the performers in the Thing were character actors who were not big name stars, but they all do the job well. Kurt Russell, a longtime collaborator of Carpenter's, is effectively low-key and straight in the face of some rather incredible situations as the film progresses. He grounds us in the film and makes us believe what is happening on screen. Wilford Brimley is also notable for his performance as Blair, a man who understands the implications of the situation they are in and slowly goes mad because of it.While hardly the most original horror film, The Thing is an effective entry in the genre, and one that is worth seeing if you like being scared.",

Hands down though, the Carpenter version is just as good as it gets for monster movies. i rank this up there with the original \"ALIEN\" by Ridley Scott. Kurt Russel is iconic as RJ MacReady in the performance of his career. The snowy plains and landscape and the claustrophobic interiors of the Antarctica station are very effective, not to mention the eerie soundtrack. This movie has it all, laughs and scary as hell.

            "content": "In 1938 John Campbell Jr wrote the horror / science fiction novella \"Who goes there?\". In 1951 Christian Nyby adapted this novella loosely in his film \"The thing from another World\".Book and film are situated on Antartica, where a scientific crew discovers an alien (\"the Thing\") that has been frozen for thousands of years. Once thawed the thing turns out to be really hostile. The location of Antartica meets a basic requirement for horror locations, it is impossibe to flee. We also see this requirement (in the form of a terrific storm) in films such as \"The old dark house\" (1932, James Whale) and \"Key Largo\" (1948, John Huston).\"The thing from another World\" became one of the favourites of John Carpenter and can even be seen on television in one of the scenes of his movie \"Halloween\" (1978). In 1982 he made his own adaptation.\"The Thing\" (1982, John Carpenter) is more true to the original novella than the 1951 version. In Carpenters film the Thing is capable of cloning his prey. This leads to mutual distrust among the members of the expedition. Who is still a human being and who has already been overtaken by the Thing? It is the same distrust and uncertainty that plays a major role in \"Invasion of the body snatchers\" (1956, Don Siegel).The weak spot of \"The Thing\" (1982) is the excessive use of special effects. Special effects in which the most bizarre body parts suddenly appear out of the normal body of an infected person. Special effects that are spectacular but have been done better in \"Alien\" (1979, Ridley Scott).So \"The Thing\" (1982) combines a few standard elements from earlier horror / science fiction movies (restricted environment from \"Key Largo\", distrust and uncertainty from \"Invasion of the body snatchers\" and special effects from \"Alien\"). It does so in an intelligent way, but doesn't add much original elements of his own.I am therefore not so sure that I appreciate the 1982 version above the 1951 version, as the IMDB ratings seems to indicate.The monster is more convincing in the 1982 version, while in the 1951 version he is little more than a big man in a scary suit.The characters however are more interesting in the 1951 version, some characters in the 1982 version being little more than food for the Thing.In a way this is remarkable because the element of mutual distrust is giving possibilities for interesting characters. Possibilities that a film like \"Invasion of the body snatchers\" makes better use of than \"The Thing\" (1982). \"Invasion of the body snatchers\" scarcely uses any special effects.",

            "content": "John Carpenter's remake of The Thing From Another World has divided the opinions of sci-fi/horror fans ever since its original release: the film was a box office failure, panned by the critics, primarily for its bleak, emotionless content and over-reliance on excessive violence and gore, but has since been declared by many as a classic for the very same reasons. Judging by the comments here on IMDb, the debate still rages...As far as Carpenter's storytelling is concerned, I'm kinda pitched between the two camps: there are some very effective scenes in which the director successfully creates an Alien-style atmosphere of paranoia, mistrust and fear between his increasingly desperate characters; and there are some equally dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks moments that simply defy logic, particularly as the film reaches its poorly conceived and annoyingly inconclusive climax.What is undeniable, however, is that The Thing does deliver some of the most spectacular and gloopy gross-out make-up effects in the history of horror cinema, and for that reason alone, the film makes my 'recommended viewing' list. Devised by FX wizard Rob Bottin, the incredible metamorphic creatures that burst onto the screen in the film's show-stopping scenes of visceral horror are quite breath-taking, and to this day, these physical effects easily hold their own against contemporary CGI movie magic.Oh, and Dean Cundey's cinematography is pretty damn good too.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",

There are so many moments in this film that will leave your jaws on the floor even after the 4th, 5th, and 6th viewing. Complementing Bottin's stellar effects work is a strong cast, masterful editing, and superb, suspenseful directing by John Carpenter. While the movie is definitely a horror film, it delightfully morphs, at times, into a great \"whodunnit\" murder mystery with many shocking twists. The erosion of trust between the main characters and the chaos this creates is pulled off wonderfully by Carpenter. Throw in a super creepy score, a great opening and closing sequence and you've got a horror classic. Look for some solid character acting from the great Keith David and Wilford Brimley, as well as a gritty, dark turn from Kurt Russell as the lead. The Thing is a bona-fide top ten all time horror film from a master (Carpenter) at the top of his game. Do not miss!!!",

John Carpenter was the most creative and inventive director of the 70's to the mid eighties.  Now he is struggling to make a film to match up with his others but that's the way it is with directors.   Carpenter spent so much time on doing things to his films back then his movies now look tired and old and to put it nicely `crap'.  Looking back on The Thing it reminds you of his brilliance and how his films starring Kurt Russell were always a success and cult classics.The Thing must go down as the greatest horror film of all time because that is what it is whether you disagree or not.  What we have to remember is that directors come and go and some stay for a while and Carpenter is definitely in the stay for a while category but how long that will last all depends on whether we ever see anything like what The Thing was and that's sheer brilliance.",

It is hard macho action and hard macho science fiction, and it does Carpenter a lot of justice I dare say. The old version of the Thing had an appeal to it, but so does this one. And this one I dare say has a lot of grit and excitement to it. The premise is an isolated Arcitc (or is it Antarctic? Who cares)) science team finds a frozen alien and inadvertently bring it back to life. In this version the \"Thing\" is very high on the evolutionary scale, and very tough to deal with. Each cell can act on its own, but also must respond to the other cells. I know it doesn't make sense, but it makes for one *$#* of an adversary you don't want to tangle with. It eats you and then copies your DNA so that it becomes an exact replica of you with even your memories. How can you beat something like that? Well, Kurt Russell finds a why. He drinks vodka at it! And then he gets flame throwing units to burn it. But which people are real and which are \"things\"? You see the dilemma. And the script plays it for all its worth, and I dare say it plays it very well. An exciting thrill ride. The characters ring fairly true, and Carpenter, as usual, does his characters much better than most directors. I could nit pick at one flaw. It didn't ring true when a certain character froze and refused to burn up a thing, who even in human form was abusive toward s him. There's my one nit pick. Not bad for over a dozen characters in a full length film. If only other directors and writers could keep it down to one nit pick. There is a question at the end, as to whether one of the survivors might be a \"thing.\" A good ambiguous ending, and enhanced by good selection of music. I think the sound effects unit deserves much praise for this film. The first time I watched it, and I've reinforced that opinion over later watchings, I thought the vodka drank by the characters at the end proved they weren't things, since alcohol kills individual cells, and the \"thing\" would not be able to tolerate it. Indeed, I believe the alien had to have a stronger weakness than just fire, or it would have taken over much easier. It did have to choose hosts that were alcohol free, because since it couldn't drink liquor, it might be found it too easily. And yes, there are no women in this movie. Which makes you feel like your watching an old war movie. Must say it is very exciting, and very mesmerizing.",

            "content": "John Carpenter is one of the most influential directors in the horror/thriller genres. He has at least four classic films to his credit in my personal order of preference - Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, The Thing and Escape from New York. I liked Assault and Halloween better than The Thing largely because of their low-budget feel. The Thing, although probably better directed, is a big-budget movie from an established and successful director who was all of 33. It doesn't have that gritty, low-budget feel that made Assault so stunning - although its certainly more testosterone fueled and there is NO female involved in the making of this film. This is the second adaptation of the John Campbell sci-fi short \"Who Goes There?\" which was first filmed in 1951 as The Thing from Another World. The original was reputedly directed by Howard Hawks but I find that hard to believe. The original was a drag, there was no atmosphere or any of that B-Movie feel that films of the period like Them! or Invasion of the Body Snatchers give fans of those films. There was also a ridiculous love interest angle which added nothing to the film. The John Carpenter remake is actually more faithful to the original sci-fi short story apart from being eminently more entertaining.The basic premise of both films is a group of scientists based at an Antarctic station come across an alien - a \"Thing\" from another world which starts attacking and killing them. A very similar theme was tackled in Ridley Scott's Alien. Alien, which is actually better than The Thing, was set in outer space and even more scary than The Thing. Its release a few years before The Thing may have been one of the reasons for The Thing's originally dismal box office returns. However, rest assured that the usual elements that make for a good John Carpenter film are all present in The Thing. Namely, great atmosphere, a good ensemble cast, thrills aplenty, a unique musical score (Ennio Morricone this time) and at least one classic scene of nerve biting tension. The classic scene in The Thing is obviously the blood testing scene which just doesn't let up on the tension - it keeps building and building.",

            "content": "John Carpenter, the filmmaker who sprung to success with his 1978 slasher flick 'Halloween', has taken on a new challenge. And the challenge is re-imagining terrifying John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella 'Who Goes There?'. Decades after the first film adaptation in the 50s, Carpenter has spawned a terrifying science-fiction/horror hybrid that blends a heavy amount of gruesome special effects with hair-raising tension and paranoia. The main antagonist of this freak show is an alien, but it's no ordinary alien like the ones from Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. It is an alien that can only be described as an abstract being that possesses the bodies of subconscious individuals, and the scariest part is you have no idea who the victim is. Carpenter brings a hefty hand at this nightmare-inducing ride, and results amount to one of the scariest cinematic endeavors of both of the horror and science- fiction genre. This film stars Kurt Russell as R.J MacReady, an American scientist who leads an expedition team including biologist Blair (played by A. Wilford Brimley), Nauls (played by T.K Carter), Palmer (played by David Clennon), Childs (played by Keith David), and Dr. Cooper (played by Richard Dysart) among other members on a research mission to a remote shelter in Antarctica. There, they witness the shooting a fluffy canine. When they take to dog to the shelter, it subsequently mutates into a grotesque parasitic monster that not only begins killing members of the team, but is secretly assimilating the bodies of other people in the shelter. So the mission becomes a battle for survival as the team grows paranoid of who's human.....and who's not.If you have a weak stomach to over-the-top blood and gore and aliens tearing through bodies in an aberrant fashion, this film is most certainly not for you. This bleak alien horror show eschews the conventional alien invasion concept in favor of a more grotesque mystery-type plot that owes elements to Jack Finney's classic novel 'Body Snatchers'. Carpenters sets the action in a dark, tension- fueled atmosphere where paranoia lurks around every corner as an alien parasite runs amok in a confined setting, and the character are trapped in a life-threatening guessing game of who's human and who's an alien life-form. This all accounts to an alarming struggle for survival with unpredictable twists and turns, and almost no moments of levity is spared. To add icing to the cake, the suspense is greatly toned up by an eerie music score by Ennio Mariconnie. Carpenter plants plenty of nightmare-inducing imagery to the screen, most of which carry inspiration from Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. Animals are mutated into grotesque looking monsters, limbs are torn off, and and stomachs open up in thoroughly unnatural manners. The cast which is greatly lead by Kurt Russell exhibits some fine performances, though the underdevelopment of their characters do not give them too much to work with. Nonetheless, Carpenter's masterful direction superbly makes for the minor flaws that ensue.The Thing is a frightening science-fiction horror piece that strikes at the heart with spine-chilling thrills and an excess amount of gore - - all of which amount to a thoroughly scary experience. While this film certainly shows its age, it still manages hold up to today's standards. This John Carpenter flick is worth your time, but only if you can digest the sheer gruesomeness of its material.",

I remember watching the original version of \"The Thing\" and it managed to make me jump a few times. Although it still has maintained the qualities of a legitimate artistic sci-fi film, some of the \"creep-out\" factors have now aged into silliness. As for the new version of \"The Thing\", it's not here to make us feel comfortable.  It's here to scare the living shit out of us!  What scares me more than anything is not the creature itself, who plays a constant game of hide and go seek with the other crew members of the research team, but the suspense.  The idea of a creature being able to recreate a perfect duplicate of another living creature was bad enough.  But when things started to get out of control, and nobody knew who was who, if they were a person or a thing, then it got really scary.  It was very paranoid, like you couldn't trust anybody except yourself.  In some moments, the characters look as if they can't trust themselves either.  Worst of all it's set in Antarctica, the coldest, loneliest place on the face of the planet.  It's like an alien world, a perfect place for an alien creature to live.  The creature is an incredible creation of design and special effects.  I liked it because it seemed like a walking germ, that had no definite shape.  We never knew what it was going to look like.  Better still, I won't spoil it for those who have not seen it, but lets just say that the fear and terror of the film is not resolved or finished even when the end credits are rolling!  And oh, that theme music that plays over and over again, brings the creep-out factor to it's peak.  It's a real tour de force of suspense, terrifying images and special effects, which are used sparingly so as to not turn the film into a mindless special effects bonanza.

I enjoyed the original film, but I feel John Carpenter managed to make a few improvements.  I remember at the time of its initial release many people were highly critical of Carpenter's heavy use of gory special effects.  However, by focusing on the special effects, the critics ignored a well-written script and some fine ensemble acting by a cast ably-headed up by Kurt Russell.  This film, darker and more paranoid than the original, is one of the few films which deliver on the promise Carpenter exhibited with his low-budget shocker \"Halloween.\"  Sadly, for every \"The Thing,\" there have been two \"Ghosts of Mars.\"",

That's not to say everything looks ultra-real, but given that two decades has passed since the original release, this movie has done pretty well.The major attraction to this film is its atmosphere. Stuck on an ice base with an alien that can impersonate anyone, a type of claustrophobic paranoia starts to take shape. This is aided that characters will disappear for long times only to reappear later and not all the action is shown - the audience is never quite sure who hasn't been contaminated.\"They Thing\" is a seminal horror film that relies on tension rather than gore to draw the audience in. It's a pity that not more horror directors haven't learned from this film (and what's even worse is that Carpenter himself seems to have forgotten too!).",

            "content": "Watching this film again recently, I couldn't help but think about the first memorable sci-fi films I had seen in my youth. \"The War of the Worlds\" of 1953 was a phenomenal picture for people of all ages. It was in full color and the most sophisticated sci-fi film ever made. What a story and what mystery and tension as one watched the huge alien disks hover over and fire destruction on the people, buildings and places below. What an incredible drama as the film neared its end and no salvation appeared in sight for the human race and earth. Then, to have the surprise ending appear so gradually, without any fanfare or warfare on the screen. I've seen most of the sci-if films about aliens and set in space since then, and none have outdone that film's drama, script and spectacle as takin place on earth. The 2005 remake resembled a CGI video game.Then, there was \"The Blob\" in 1958. It was later considered one of the best \"date\" pictures of all time. Girls would cuddle close to their dates as the screen showed the alien blob sneaking into an unsuspecting movie theater, oozing through the vents in the theater walls. I've watched both of these films in recent years and they still come across as among the best of sci-fi. What they had in common was an element of alien invasion as science-fiction and a fright factor.Now, watching \"The Thing\" of 1982 on DVD many years after first seeing it, I can see the added dimension of horror. Of course, there have always been horror films as well - almost since the beginning of movies. \"The Phantom of the Opera\" was first made into a silent film in 1925. And, there have been combination sci-fi and horror films since \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" of 1931. While outer space films such as the Star Trek and Star Wars series have more elaborate sci-fi plots, with different creatures, including some monsters at times, these films tend to stress the sci-fi and adventure aspects of space with the right factor. Most, but not all, don't really have horror elements. The great exception, of course, is \"Alien\" of 1979, with its sequels. Whereas, most sci-fi grounded on earth either replaces the fright factor outright or dwarfs it with horror.So, \"The Thing\" is a somewhat tamer version of the modern earth-bound sci-fi film, with horror. And, because it's also a psychological thriller, it builds mostly on the fright factor. It picks up on a 1951 film, \"The Thing from Another World.\" But this one puts the dread in first place. It remains a popular sci-fi film with audiences several decades after it first appeared. And, while it's okay, I much prefer and enjoy the great adventure sci-fi films of the Star Wars and similar type.",

            "content": "David Foster created one of, if not the most intriguing horror movies of the early 80's by giving light to one of the most genre defining films at the time, and shows how a simple idea, combined with talented people on its side, can give birth to not just a great horror movie, but can give birth to The Thing. The story unfolds as a Norwegian camp come into contact with extra-terrestrial creatures, called Things by the characters, and the things begin to terrorize the group until the base they lived in explodes, ending the Thing once and for all. Writer John W. Campbell Jr. uses his way of writing to display not just what it's like to live at an Antarctic base, but how people use to act during that period of time. Take for example, Nauls, who is first seen in the film sliding around the camp with his roller-skates, and blasting his music from his boombox. He uses perspectives of different to show how each person would react if they were put in a situation against these monsters, and the result is, quite frankly, the most ambitious movie released at the time. It's taken all these ideas that have been shunned from modern horror, like gore, aliens, and other clich\u00e9 topics, and, backed up with excellent special effects for the time overseen by Roy Arbogast, seamless sound direction from John K. Adams team, and created a movie more realistic than any other film that came before. The way critics pick on the film for being too outdated is a testament to how groundbreaking it was at the time.\nDuring the movie, a hidden message can be noticed throughout the film. During MacReadys chess match with the computer, when the computer A.I. was about to win, he used his beer to make the computer malfunction. This is foreshadowing how MacReady is willing to destroy absolutely anything, even the base, if \"The Thing\" is winning. A good horror film always leaves the viewer to interpret the events that take place, and for The Thing, it's when MacReady hands Childs a drink, which can be interpreted as he thinks Childs is infected, or he's doing this as a sign of trust to Childs. Another thing that can be interpreted is the ending itself, having the viewer decide whether or not MacReady and Childs survived in the end. The way John K. Adams uses sound in order to enhance scenes can heavily sell the atmosphere of the scenes. Back to the story, MacReady has been isolated from the crew, after he was last seen outside in the cold, cold weather. He's been isolated from the group and has almost gone mad under the circumstances they're in, and it almost culminates when Childs questions MacReadys morality, after he killed Clark (who was innocent). After killing Palmer, who was shown in his infected terror with excellent special effects that sell the scene as a whole, MacReady gathers up a small crew in order to blow up the base, ending the Thing once and for all. Once the smoke settles, there's no victory, no cheering, not even any horror, just the uncertainty whether or not MacReady will survive.",

            "content": "The Thing is a horror film based of who goes there (2938) but has come to overshadow its predecessor and almost every way. The Thing came to popularity with its revolutionary special effects techniques that outshines many modern-day films CGI. It is important to note that many of the effects that happen on screen people could find disturbing and I would suggest not seeing the film and not reading further if you're easily bothered by graphic bodily horror. The creature referred to as the thing that is seen throughout the film is a constant amorphous form that shifts from appearing as normal people and creatures to horrific Lovecraftian monstrosities. The camera almost never pans away as the creature shifts from these forms with skin peeling away and tentacles emerging from every cranny. Often to achieve these effects the team would use wires, stop motion, and reverse footage. Interestingly the scream of the ting is based off the calls of a peacock.The weather is not the key feature of the film but I feel that the setting is essential for the thematic tones and the originality of the film. The cold Arctic climate leads to a heavy sense of isolation and being shut off from the rest of the world. In the later part of the film the harsh weather outside leads to everyone being on a timer, for the humans it is to kill the thing before they all freeze to death and for the thing it's outlive all the people so that it can be found once again and continue its spread of violence. Of course, there is very little precipitation at any point due to the dryness of the Arctic.While I'm not going to go over the entire film, I'll go through the first act to see if this movie is for you. If you do not want spoilers, please skip this paragraph. The film opens with to Norwegians in a helicopter chasing down a dog from a helicopter in the Antarctic waste. There's very little cloud cover and very little to stop the helicopter from keeping up. Using both a rifle and explosives the two men tried to kill the dog but are unsuccessful. Eventually the dog reaches American research base and tries to find safety amongst the people there. The Norwegians continue their pursuit and end up both dying in the process. The research team tends to one of their wounded members and brings the dog into the kennel for his safety. Realizing that the dead man came from a close-by Norwegian facility, a small team led by Kurt Russell's character Mac leave to explore it. Upon their arrival they find the facility half burned with all of its occupants dead and in the courtyard a charge remains of a grotesque monstrosity. They decide to leave and bring the thing with them. Later back at their base the autopsy reveals but this thing has many organs like a human's, but its anatomy matches that of two humans fused together. That night at the kennel the other dogs are uneasy of their new arrival. Knowing that it is cover is blown based off of smell the rescue dog ceases to action normal standing motionless in the middle of the pen. The dog's form contorts it releases tendrils and assimilates the other dogs in the pen. Hearing the sound Mac and several other scientists rush to the kennels and torch the beast with a flamethrower meant for de-icing, and the beast becomes a cindering husk. Upon debriefing the other members of the team it is revealed that the dogs spent quite a bit of time wandering the base before it was put in the kennel and that it could have assimilated any member of the science team without anyone else's knowledge. From here on out it is every man for himself as any member of the team could have been turned against their will as now hunting the humans aboard the station.It is important to note that there was a sequel to this film in 2011 that focuses on the events of the Norwegian station, I would not advise watching it. It hits many of the similar beats but due to a lack of personality in the cast and replacing all the fantastic practical effects with dubious CGI it is a hard pass in my book. Interestingly enough the film was originally meant to have extensive practical effects in the spirit of the original but last minute they all got covered up with CGI due to higher-ups feeling practical effects wouldn't sell. the practical effect team did not actually know this had been done until opening night when none of their effects were on display. The practical effect team went on to make Harbinger Down, a film very much in the spirit of the thing with all the practical effects but lacking a good story. All this aside I personally cannot suggest watching the Thing movie enough. It is both my favorite horror and sci-fi movie of all time.",

Its precisely because these disturbing images are not used as crutches for the taut, tense and ominous narrative that 'The Thing (1982)' holds up to scrutiny and remains such a foreboding and thrilling watch all these years later. The flick keeps you on your toes because its underlying premise means that anyone could be the eponymous 'Thing' from another world. Carpenter wisely never reveals exactly who the creature is until its too late. It really is a piece with brains as well as brawn, one that doesn't mind taking its time and earning its eventual shocks.

No one liked this movie in '82. But the special effects/ make-up are so disgustingly real, you will feel sick. The creatures are so vile and spectacular it's unsettling. They are real: unlike today's CG monsters, these actors were in the same room with those monsters. It adds to the effect. The Thing was way ahead of it's time; people could be scared of the 30-year-old movie today if they saw it in theatres. (If you like Dead Space, you'll like this.) None of the acting is particularly special, but it doesn't need to be. In fact, a little fleshing out could've helped, maybe during the first half hour.

            "content": "Sci-fi horror isn't really my thing but I did enjoy John Carpenter's stylish and exciting re-make of a 1950's Howard Hawks production (which I haven't seen). Sure the plot looks very familiar, Alien gone south, but the freezing climate and remote location of the Antarctic fit the \"nowhere to run\" scenario just as well as the moon.After the arresting opening, which introduces the vastness of the frozen wasteland of the region as a helicopter for some reason chases a husky dog over miles and miles until it reaches the American scientific exploration base, the film settles into the again familiar \"and then there were none\" plot line as the alien entity starts to prey on every living thing in the camp.The film benefits, in my opinion from its lack of major star-power, thus providing a more communal feel among the menaced men and making it harder to guess who, if anyone will still be standing at the end. The special make-up effects are absolutely terrific, making for many \"don't look now\" moments. Carpenter keeps us in the dark, literally, as almost all the attack sequences take place to gloomy backdrops, aided in this by Ennio Morricone's brooding and atmospheric soundtrack. The acting is good, strong ensemble stuff, although some of the characters fir me lacked individuality. I'd also slightly criticise the ending as being inordinately stretched out and lacking the climactic finish I think the previous tension merited.Nevertheless this was at least as gripping and exciting as any of the \"Alien\" movies I've seen, plus the similarly themed \"The Abyss\". In fact, make my aliens bloodthirsty rather than cuddly any day of the week.",

Carpenter's version is slow, talky, dull, and punctuated only by over-the-top silliness that shows his puerile obsession with gore-puppets. The 'paranoia' of people who may not be who they seem plays much better in 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or 'Planet of the Vampires,' or even in Campbell's own story.

I've been a huge fan of the flick since the mid 80s (I had a mad teenage crush on Kurt Russell at the time, thanks to \"Escape from New York\"), and I considered the John Carpenter / Kurt Russell association to be a winning one.I'm not shocked or horrified by the gore anymore, but that's only because I've seen it so many times. The gore is totally believable, and slightly understated (considering the subject matter), and there is no end to my amazement that it's just as good - if not better - than the cookie-cutter CGI horror flicks that have been released more recently. This movie holds up to anything recent in the genre, and will probably continue to do so for quite some time.Russell does a great job (as he always does, regardless of the Grizzly Adams impression in this one), Keith David (I'm a big fan of his voice work) is outstanding...Wilford Brimley was a bit of an odd choice for this flick, even though he does do a good job. You think of the Quaker Oats / Diabetes Test Equipment guy playing that sort of role...it's a bit of a head-scratcher.My point, I guess, is this: I've seen this movie many, many times, and it still holds my attention. No sexual tension, no political intrigue...just a bunch of guys playing with flame throwers and bad-tempered aliens. And the ending is phenomenal!!!!!! The only reason I didn't give it a higher score is because there are obviously many movies out there that ARE perfect 10s, such as: Hitchcock's Rebecca, the LOTR trilogy, American History X and the Shawshank Redemption. But John Carpenter's the Thing is definitely high on my horror list! Though it isn't my perfect 10, I still give it 2 thumbs up from my thumb and my other thumb. There you have it. Enjoy.",

There's a reason why The Thing is praised by many critics and considered to be one of the best Horror movies ever. It's visually repulsive, in a good way, thanks to the isolated setting in Antarctica, fantastic make-up and practical effects. In fact, this may be my favourite Horror movie ever based on practical effects. Personally, I prefer practical effects over CGI. A good combination of both works as well. The Thing remains complete as both a Horror and Sci-Fi movie.Besides being eye candy, the paranoia caused between the researchers is something well executed. It's by no means deeply layered or complex. In fact, it's rather straightforward but just like the researchers you try to focus and pay attention to all the little details as you're trying to figure things out for yourself. Each scene made me wonder: \"What would I do in this situation\", which is something I happen to like. It's safe to say that there were no holds barred when it came to imagination. To top it all off, you have Kurt Russell, which takes a sip of his bottle of J&B every couple of minutes, and some cheesy but acceptable dialogue.

This isn't one the scariest movie I have seen but the tension and especially the paranoia between the characters is really high.

This movie even stands out even now, but I can really see why this movie left a big impact in the the movie industry for it's time. I mean if I seen this movie back than I would have been blown away. Also there is little to no CGI in this which is a plus since it makes the situation a bit more creepy and it also has authentic feel to it in other areas.

But he broke the mold when he made The Thing, and the result is probably the greatest monster movie in history. Sure Jaws was great, and so was Alien, but The Thing blows them all away. It's about a twelve-man research team that unwittingly takes in an alien organism that has been frozen in the ice for over 100,000 years. As if things couldn't be worse, this alien can shape-shift and \"absorbs\" its victims, so no one in the camp quite knows who is real and who is \"the thing.\" Rob Bottin's special effects for the film are probably its ground-breaking achievement, for it was the first movie with a really gross-looking monster, and the monster effects still look great even today. Ennio Morricone's chilling score, Dean Cundey's beautiful photography, and John Llyod's incredible sets all help contribute to the eerie mood of the picture. Not only that, but the cast does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned, Carpenter was at the peak of his skills when he made this film. It was rather disappointing to find out that it didn't do that well at the box office, but at least it can have a nice long afterlife on DVD market now.

I'm not a fan of ultra scifi cuz most of scifi tends to be creepy, gross and depressing with always a question to things. i don't like that, reminds me too much of real life. but there are some \"alien\" movies i really do enjoy, like Independence Day, Star Wars movies, Predator (which although it has SOME blood, its certainly not over the top gross like some of these others). but overall, not a big scifi fan, and the thing is just too gross for anyone IMO. only the most depraved of people would actually enjoy this kind of movie, along with the evil dead and other films of that ilk.",

We left right after the dog kennel scene. 25 years later I saw and boy, that was one hell of a movie. Seriously speaking, it was pretty scary and gory for younger kids. The outline of this story is an arctic research team stumbles onto a 100+ year old space ship buried in the snow and a frozen alien life-form. The problem is, the alien is loose and it takes the form of its host, so now you don't know who's who. What a twisted storyline. The writers finding clever ways to play tricks with us, and it works.The acting was there, though at times wooden, but still nonetheless there. What I really like about it was the weirdness and the excessive alien gore. It reminisced of such films like \"Alien\" (1979) and \"The Exorcist\" (1973). The way that the alien presents itself throughout the film is both disturbing and very clever like, a huge mass of skin and teeth, a human head with spider legs coming out of it, a huge \"face mouth\" and so many more. The general sound that this creature makes is frightening.The only problems that this movie has are, it drags on too long with some pointless scenes and chitchat. It tried to add character development, but it seemed as though the characters were like that before the alien even came.However, thanks to ET, this movie didn't receive the populatiry that it should have had.But aside from those, this movie is pure frightening, gory and scary fun. I do not recommend little kids to see this movie. If it doesn't affect them right away, it will later on. I do recommend this film to those who like great remakes and general horror genre.",

And I'm glad I did. It may be a little dated by today's standards, but it's still a solid exercise in paranoia-fueled monster movies.An isolated Antarctic research station on the cusp of polar winter becomes a battleground for a handful of people and a terrifying alien. One that has a unique ability that quickly causes the humans to not be able to trust one another. They have to remain on the lookout for danger from their fellow humans, as well as the creature.\u00a0The two aspects of The Thing that are most worthy of mention are the gory and impressive special effects, and the believable tension between the actors as they realize that there is no one they can trust but themselves. The creature design for the Thing truly is memorable, and if you have an aversion to copious amount of blood or tentacles, this will be a nightmare for you. The dynamics between the characters is what most of the story focuses on, and without that, this would just be a mindless movie about people being killed. But instead, it almost becomes a race between the viewer and the characters to figure out who is a threat and who (if anyone) might survive this whole thing. Pretty cool.I think if you're a fan of movies like Alien, you'll like this. It doesn't quite have the timelessness of that movie, and it's not quite as frightening, but there's a similar vibe that the two share.

Everything is technically perfect, and the direction and music by Morricone couldn't be better, but the flaws are all in the script. After all, these researchers in the Antarctic are all scientists and should act accordingly and not constantly lose their self control. When doctor Blair loses control it's the starting point for the whole adventure to run off the rails, and then it constantly gets worse. They resort to violence, which is the last thing a scientist should do, he is educated to have no capacity for that, and then the film goes constantly from bad to worse and becomes nothing else than a monument to paranoia. Of course, these poor fellows without a woman or even any picture of such a healthy creature are all fenced in by the Antarctic winter in hopeless isolation in the dark of winter, so naturally they could develop psychic problems, especially in the encounter with such a thing as \"The Thing\", but they should at least TRY to keep cool and maintain some scientific self control. They all fail in this, and the signal for everyone's going off the rails occurs perhaps already in the beginning, when Kurt Russell accuses his computer, with which he plays chess, of cheating and pours whiskey into him. That's perhaps the starting point of the following accumulating monumental mess.",

That's all you need to know. However, instead of listing all its many plus points (of which there are probably too many to mention), I will simply point out that, as it was popular, it probably wasn't long before some Hollywood money-man decided to cash in on its success and remake it.It never happened (well, it sort of did, but it didn't). Even Hollywood was at a loss as to whether they could attempt to 'better' such a work of horror genius. So they didn't. They left it as it is and it's all the better for it. They did make a 'prequel' which you can take or leave, depending on your taste. The original is obviously far better, so, if you choose to only watch one, definitely go for John Carpenter's 1982 original.Bottom line: if you like horror, if you like sci-fi, if you love bizarre and monstrous creatures and spine-tingling tension, then this is for you. It may have been made over thirty years ago, but it's still as fresh and chilling as when it first came out. For the few people who haven't seen it, I won't mention its best parts, but the special effects - for their time - were truly breath-taking (and hideous).",

            "content": "Dumb-Dumb\u0085 Dumb-Dumb\u0085 Dumb-Dumb...so goes the now chilling theme (which was originally nominated for a Razzie, you know) which, though it sounds like classic Carpenter, was actually composed by the legendary Ennio MorrIone. It perfectly captures the sense of dread and foreboding that The Thing emits. I remember when I first watched this on TV years ago. I didn't know who John Carpenter was or Kurt Russell or Ennio Morricone. All I saw was the title, and it was intriguing enough for me to go in blind. And what an experience it was. Paranoiac, gut- wrenching and filled with outstanding special effects, The Thing left me with my mouth open long after the credits started rolling. Set in the isolated Antarctica and filled to the brim with a memorable supporting cast, each of whom threaten to steal the scene they're in, The Thing is far more than an \"Ooh. Ahh!\" splatter fest. Though the creature effects (completely practical \u2013 take that, CGI!) have gone down in history as some of the most inventive and disgusting in cinema, the paranoia and mistrust between the characters is just as nail-biting to watch. The all-male group of actors are constantly at each other's throats, prioritising their own survival, and anyone could be 'the thing.' The creature is t it's most powerful when the humans are doing the killing and fighting for it. There is a constant sense of dread, as previously stated, of what is to come, of who to trust, that when one of 'the things' is revealed an orgasmic amount of colours hit the screen - there is blood and body parts flying in all directions. It's an excellent film that is essentially a collection of memorable scenes. Take the blood test scene \u2013 the protagonist, played by Russell, ties up the rest of the cast and takes a sample of their blood in a petri dish to burn and, hopefully, reveal who is not human in the group. There is arguing as Russell moves from one dish to the next, and Carpenter cleverly distracts us with the dialogue \u2013 we become do engrossed into what the characters are accusing each other of that when the alien blood 'jumps' out of the dish it feels as though someone has stamped on your heart. Then the character who was the thing transforms, and our nail-biting is rudely interrupted by a terrifically tense showdown between Kurt Russell and the thing (the others are, of course tied up). After the hullabaloo is over, tensions rise again, but not quite as much, as Russell's continues with his tests, untying those who have been had their blood tested. It ends with the final character, exasperated after having been finally cleared, bellowing a hilarious line at the rest of the cast, after which we fade to black and are given the chance to breath. It's masterful direction. The Thing is, quite simply, one of the all-time great horror/sci-fi films and undoubtedly John Carpenter's best work. Best Scene: There are so many to choose from, from the nail-biting blood test scene to the cringe-worthy deliberator scene. But like with most of Carpenter's work, I'm going to go with the ending. It's a cliff-hanger that is just so brilliant on so many levels that you really have to watch the film to appreciate. So if you haven't seen The Thing, be sure to add it to your watch list.",

You are given plenty of time to let the situation settle, ponder the mysteries with the characters, and question everything that comes across the screen. You're further isolated by the cold, inhospitable environment of Antarctica. Nothing feels right, so you're always on the edge of your seat.Character is much better than in most horror films. None of them are useless, annoying cannon fodder. They act how you and I would act to the situation. Each has their own traits, occupation, and moments in the film. You don't want to see any of them die. MacReady is a good action lead - cocky, but takes things seriously. He also has a cool beard. The characters aren't fleshed-out, but its impressive for a horror film with a large cast.The effects are considered among the best in practicals ever made. You'll need to see that for yourself.The Thing is the perfect horror film that deserves its resurgence. It doesn't treat the audience like teenage idiots, and few can match its constant tone.

Campbell Jr., and is the first (and most accomplished) part in Carpenter's so-called 'Apocalypse Trilogy' - a loose collection of films whose only connection is a brooding atmosphere of impending doom (the other parts being the slightly disappointing 'Prince of Darkness' (1987) and the satisfying meta-fiction romp 'In the Mouth of Madness (1995)). In 'The Thing' the impending doom engendered by the presence of the parasitic alien is heightened by the setting of the remote icy wilderness and the piercing sense of growing isolation born from suspicion as it dawns on the members of the team what they are up against and that no-one can be trusted as any one of them may be the Thing. Oh, and not forgetting the brilliantly ominous score courtesy of Ennio Morricone! All this being said, the real stand out quality of 'The Thing' are the special effects: gloriously breaking the oft-repeated \"leave-it-to-the-audience's-imagination\" dictum 'The Thing' serves as an exemplary example that sometimes the audience's imagination ISN'T scarier than what's on screen. In fact, the sheer visceral body-horror of the effects in 'The Thing' would make David Cronenberg proud, and indeed one scene in particular makes the famed John Hurt chest-explosion sequence in 'Alien' (that other Horror Sci-fi masterpiece) look amusing and woefully amateur! High praise indeed, and the fact that all this is done without a jot of CGI makes it both a testament to the sheer ingenuity of the special effects department and a reprimanding finger-shake to all films that have lazily relied on such computer generated effects for their thrills.Bizarrely this film was a flop upon its initial release, but time generally stands as a good judge in these matters and 'The Thing' has rightly assumed a position as one of Carpenter's best films as well as one of the finest hybrids of horror and science fiction you are likely to find outside of the Nostromo.",

Poor judgment here could be fatal. His methodology to determine who is human and who is not is simple, but we soon learn that the answer always changing. An ally now may try to kill you an hour later. A great theme given today's political struggle to accept refugees while faced with an attitude of xenophobia. Considering the \"aliens-as-us\" premise, Carpenter sketches out the characters well, and they are convincing, given the extreme circumstances of the story.

Before you get a chance to ponder too long the fit hits the shan. I love this movie. It is so nightmarish, grotesque, and at times hideous. The special effects are stomach churning every time - and fascinating - almost beautiful. And yet it isn't necessarily a 'gross-out'. There's plenty of blood and ooze to last a couple of sequels - it's just the nature of this beast - whatever it is. The movie keeps you tensed and eventually resolves to a logical ending. Then I wonder why a sequel was never made? Now I understand this didn't exactly pack them in at the box-office. It's just as well. It would have been hard to equal this in a sequel.\nThe acting is exact and convincing. Russell is, well, as you've seen him before and since. But he does it well. No-one really stands out, but everyone is competent and the character development works so well you don't even notice it happening. The background music is taut. Perfect.The real show stopper is the special effects. For maximum effect - beware. Many cable channels will show this movie but they always cut it. When they do this they take away some of the more interesting effects. Yes, they are intense and disturbing - but that is the whole point - innit? That is why this one is a 'keeper' in my library. Great Halloween night flick! Just maybe not for the feeble or green, if you know what I mean?I have viewed this multiple times and still find it worthy. I find myself even trying to determine who 'caught it' when by nuances in the acting. You never know. I kind of identify with Brimley's character. I would get real confused and paranoid too.

            "content": "An austere fantasy about a U.S. government research team stationed in the desolate Antarctic tundra, visited by an indestructible shape-shifting alien, John Carpenter's remake of Howard Hawks's The Thing from Another World methodically deconstruct the human psyche under stress while emphasizing the ineffectuality of solidarity when faced with a tactile existential crisis.The protean form of the eponymous 10,000 year-old extraterrestrial provides a strong ideological thrust as it assimilates the bodies of the crew at random, facilitating a convincingly febrile cocoon of paranoia, quarantine, and primitive self-preservation. Ostensibly an homage to '50s creature features, The Thing owes more to the social allegory of Romero's Dead Trilogy and the abstract techno/corporeal concerns of Cronenbergian cinema, which was coming into its own around the same time (1982). This would mark the third in a handful of starring roles for Kurt Russell in Carpenter-directed films. His portrayal of the vulnerable lone hero (the hero only inasmuch as he commands the subjective space) acting decidedly un-heroically\u2014a staple for Carpenter, who seems to endeavor a refashioning of the Western in withered, technologically compromised dystopias\u2014is effective and relatable.Carpenter makes masterful use of the Panavision format\u2014often compressing the dozen or so supporting characters into the same frame\u2014filling the space with ominous peripheral details, mounting the tension almost subliminally. Which is not to say that it is wholly reliant on silence and intimation for its impact. Rob Bottin's makeup work on the tirelessly regenerating alien has been The Thing's most enduring virtue, and not without reason: whether adding strange appendages to The Thing (the head of a victim emerging from a shoulder, attached to a long, spiraling neck) or having it suddenly burst through a carrier's tremulous visage, Bottin capitalizes on the concept of a mysterious, replicating evil in the most terrifyingly innovative ways.Not to be outdone, Ennio Morricone provides a repetitive, quietly harrowing score that sounds like the end of the world. And it is thus with The Thing, a vision of humanity scorned, burning itself bare at both ends, but in conception a work of paradoxical solidarity, craftsmen at the top of their game working toward a uniform purpose. Sometimes it's good to be at odds with the screenplay.",

Carpenter blends comedy with horror and gore to a glorious conclusion, the acting is top notch and the characters are believable through out. The scenes are paced so that you truly are on the edge of your seat and when the horror starts, it throws you out of your seat.

Carpenter makes the film his own, however, and rather than a remake we really have a completely different film with like elements. Whereas the first film focusses its main attentions to the division between science and military, Carpenter's film is more of a gory mystery to see who is the alien being inside.  There are plenty of reviews here going into great detail about the story, etc...  All I will add is that Carpenter's film is stylish, scary, well-acted by a veritable who's who of character actors like Richard Dysart, Wilfred Brimley, and many others, aided by a nice performance by Kurt Russell, and has state of the art special effects. I was mesmerized from beginning to end, and found watching the film a thoroughly entertaining time.

            "content": "John Carpenter's The Thing is without question one of the greatest films ever made and has rightfully earned its place among other horror classics like The Shining, Alien, Halloween and the Evil Dead trilogy. The plot is simple: an alien creature that can take the form of basically anything invests an Arctic research facility and the men who work at this facility work on trying to survive. And if one of them or the arctic dogs is the creature.I think I should state the obvious first: the practical effects are probably the best ever put on film. The way the creature prosthetics move feels almost like a living thing and feels more natural and organic than 99% of CGI ever done. It also helps that the film is shot really well and is brimming with a very noticeable atmosphere that adds to the paranoia the characters are in. For me, a horror film isn't scary when it features jump scares and creaking doors and other generic horror tropes. What's scary is if the film creates a strong atmosphere that immerses the viewer into the story and makes it seem like they're right there with the characters and that they can't escape it either. That's terrifying to me.The performances are stellar from everyone involved. Kurt Russell, Keith David, the late great Wilford Brimley, everyone. It's especially cool how behind the scenes, the actors didn't know who the actual creature was and how they changed the temperature to 40 degrees to give off the illusion that they were actually in the arctic and that really shows in the acting. The film is also shot really well and that one scene where the dog slowly comes through the door and approach's the guy and you see his shadow always unnerved me.Overall, The Thing is one of the best horror films ever made, if not the absolute best. If I had to give a flaw, they do use a stock sound effect for a punch but that's just a very minor nitpick. John Carpenter's best film, one of the best movies of the 1980s, one of the best science fiction films ever made and one of the greatest movies of all time without question. Timeless masterpiece.",

It doesn't really have any sci-fi ideas in it, but it's such a good horror movie that even sci-fi fans won't complain.Kurt Russell plays a self-assured misfit in the company of other misfits, including a doctor played by Wilford Brimley. An extremely unfortunate encounter with a shape-shifting alien breaks down the bonds of human society and kindness and replaces them with the animal will to survive.Ennio Morricone provides a stripped-down score that could easily be mistaken for one of director Carpenter's own. Carpenter's directing is easily what makes the movie memorable. I mean, let's face it this movie has the same plot as \"Horror Express\" and any number of horrible movies. In many ways it's obviously just an imitation of Ridley Scott's \"Alien.\" But the Russell/Carpenter magic, this time for once played straight, redeems it as does Carpenter's effective suspenseful direction.There's not a lot to say about this movie in my opinion. It's just a good gory suspense/horror flick. It doesn't insult your intelligence but it also doesn't challenge it. The monochromatic color scheme was a good idea because it distinguishes it from other films from this period. Rob Bottin's effects are so gory and extreme that they make me laugh, yet this movie still has the strength to shock and terrify the impressionable. A worthy re-make that put the lie to all the nonsense about remakes being inherently bad, this film will probably outlive even the Hawks/Nyby original.",

It is also often considered John Carpenter's best film.In the Antarctic a Norwegian helicopter team try to shoot a Husky dog where it runs into an American scientific outpost. The Norwegian seems mad so the Americans kill him. But when the Americans explore the Norwegian's base they discovery they had discovered something and everyone has died. Back at the American base they discover that the dog is really an alien who's cells can copy any other creatures. The Americans do not only have to battle a big monster but each other, as the alien is able to pretend it is human and a spirit of paranoia and distrust is fostered.As a horror it works for a number of reasons. The characters are simply men living in close quarters, playing games, watching videos, discussing what to do, getting annoyed with each other, typical people who have something extraordinary happen to them. They are not your typical horror film jerks, at least not at the beginning. The film also has a very simple but scary idea, who do you trust and when trust breaks down what people are willing to do. It is a scary idea that people you know well could end up attacking you and that a monster can take any living form. But it is not just suspect, there is plenty of gore and the special effects of the monster taking many different forms were both very well done and wonderfully gross. It is so good to practical effects, nowadays it would just be some CGI effect which lacks physicality and threat. The Thing has a very minimalistic style, there are only seven characters, the whole film is mostly set within the base and the freezing outside, it makes for a claustrophobic atmosphere knowing that there is no escape. Even the music is kept to a simple, using only a few notes or chores and only one instrument is used at a time: added to that Carpenter allowed no music at all some key scenes, having more impact and surprise then a musical cue telling the audience how to feel.Acting wise only really Kurt Russell and Keith David (who has an awesome voice) notable members of the cast, doing a decent enough job. Everyone else seems to blend into the background. But overall no one was terrible and overall The Thing was a very well made horror film.",

One of the best opening credits for a horror film ever.The cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their Station in Antartica is visually impressive on DVD widescreen. It must have been great in the cinema. I regret not seeing this on the big screen.Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. All the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. My favourite scene in the whole film has to be when Macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. I love it because its funny as well.Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. If he didn't get an Oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have.

But like any good score, it complements the film fantastically, adding to its tension and eerieness.This was the first time I've rewatched this in years, and I still found a lot to love. Special effects are fantastic, and I can understand if they were too much for audiences back in the 80s (maybe contributing to it not earning much money). Kurt Russell's good (especially near the end), and the rest of the cast are mostly solid. I like the look of the film, the ending, and a few really memorable sequences that do stick with you.I don't think it's perfect. I think the editing is a little clunky, with some strange transitions between scenes and time jumps, and it leads to some imperfect pacing. During the blood testing scene, something dramatic happens, it's all crazy, and then it cuts back to them doing blood tests like nothing happened. Keeping it vague for the purpose of spoilers, but it creates a weird rhythm to what's otherwise a great scene.Some imperfect structure and a few choppy edits don't hurt the experience much though. This still stands as one of John Carpenter's best films, and it shows what he could do with a budget (and it's a shame studios didn't really want to trust him with that much money very often).

In other words, the first 1/3 or so of the film is spent in characterization, setting, and building up the conflict. From the first second of \"The Thing,\" however, the suspense and the mystery are immediately evident, with the excellent score to the film (the Carpenter-esque, bass-pounding \"bum-bum......bum-bum\") reinforcing the drama unfolding.This is a very, very smart film.

An accident ensures the inhabitants cannot interrogate the pursuing Norwegians and a quick visit to their nearby camp shows that disaster has struck. A large block of hollowed out ice suggests, though, that they may well have made an unique discovery - especially when they find some smouldering skeletal remains. Back at their own camp - along with their new charcoaled find - things get back to normal until the mysterious dog is put into the cage with the others and all hell breaks loose. It is soon clear to \"Mac\" (Kurt Russell) that they are dealing with something extremely strong, adaptable and ruthless. Can they survive? The visual effects here go a long way to compensating for the rather lacklustre acting - Russell isn't really very good - and the claustrophobic antarctic settings and howling winds add a richness and sense of peril to this superior horror story. The fact that the creature has a sort of Azazel-like ability to transfer from any life-form to another, and to more than one simultaneously adds some decent jeopardy to the plot, too, as neither they nor us know who is to be trusted right until the ending.

His performance hit the right tone of the last guy you would ever expect to take up the mantel of leadership in a situation like this. Actually, I have to commend the entire cast in this movie. They all are individuals with strengths and weaknesses that come off as genuine. The big temptation in a movie like this is for everybody to ultimately rise to the challenge and work together to fight this alien menace. Here everybody is an individual that cant trust anybody else because the enemy is hidden and could be anybody. The setting of the barren ice Continent of Anarctica was so apt to convey the isolation of these men. This and the tight almost claustrophobic way the camera shoots tends to send shivers right up my spine. The soundtrack was truly scary with its primitive methodical tempo of impending doom. The special effects in this movie, for 1982 or even for today, were jaw dropping! I had nightmares for weeks at some of those transformation scenes.

The effects while aged by today's standards hold up well and in some cases remind us all that sometimes good oldfashioned conventional effects, plus good editing and directing can surpass all the computer generated effects in the world, but the real meat and potatoes here is the story telling and the suspense. John Carpenter superbly crafts a story that keeps the audience as off balance as the characters are, by not laying all cards on the table at once and dropping the trump cards in an unassuming timely manner.The setup is well calculated and executed, the all male cast(another point of contention upon many critics at the time of its release used to condemn the film despite the fact that: 1. given the setting it makes perfect sense and 2. It serves a storytelling purpose as it helps to set the mood of the piece), their stark characterizations (we are really only introduced to the characters within the confines of their daily grind and the increasing dire circumstances they find themselves in),and the Antarctic setting all serve to establish a very bleak tone from the get go and as the insidious, amorphous Thing, rears its fearsome shifting forms(quite unexpectedly at times)its gets all the bleaker.

It's got the conflict, it's got that tension and not to mention, the prosthetics alone make this hundred times scarier; some of the best prosthetics & makeup I have ever seen.Not only that, the makers made sure they spare no expense; as there are a ton of big explosions and plenty of scenes involving the element of 'Fire', not the most \"cost-effective\", is it? Do keep in mind, this film is four decades old; Just imagine, back in the day, to perform such dangerous stunts, while maintaining a bunch of safety procedures; all the Stuntmen, as well as the Stunt coordinators, had to be extremely cautious and careful about their techniques, they had no choice but to be on top of their game, and as it seems, they haven't failed us.If only the characters had better writing, things could have been perfect. A word of advice though, the first half an hour drags for quite a bit, don't flinch, sit tight and wait for it to get into gear. Once it does, have my word, you will hardly get any time to take a breather!",

Waites, Richard Masur, Charles Hallahan, Richard A. Dysart, Joel Polis and Peter Maloney) are living together in a research scientific encampment. An creature from Outer Space has been awakening from more than 10,000 years from another camp. Now the creature is killing one by one... killing off its inhabitants.Directed by John Carpenter (Big Trouble in Little China, Ghosts of Mars, Village of the Damned-1995) made an strong terrific horror/suspenseful/sci-fi/thriller. When this film was released in 1982, it was an box office disappointment. But this film went on to be an cult favorite on video and television.The original 1998 DVD has an strong non-anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an excellent digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also has an amusing commentary track by the director and actor:Russell. DVD also has an entertaining documentary with the cast & crew, outtakes, original theatrical trailer and more.The new DVD from 2004 does have an anamorphic widescreen transfer and the same DVD extras expect the isolated film score by Ennio Morricone (Which it was oddly placed in the documentary instead of the film in the original DVD). One of the highlights of the film is the horrific and excellent make-up creature effects by Oscar-Winner:Rob Bottin (The Howling, Legend, Total Recall). The Thing is the first Apocalypse film by Carpenter. Which his two another apocalyptic films are \"Prince of Darkness\" and \"In the Mouth of Madness\". Certainly one of the director's best work.

Carpenter allows it to seep into our psyches and fill us with dread before he pulls some jaw-dropping rabbits from his hat.The film flopped upon its theatrical release while the friendly alien (ET: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL) in the theatre next door took box office line honors.

The special effects in this movie are amazing, and possibly the best looking animatronics ever in a movie. The scares are plentiful, with lots of effective jump scenes. This movie may be slow moving, but it has enough content to please any horror or science fiction fan.An Antartic research station of twelve men is alarmed when a strange body is found near an abandoned Norwegian research station. It looks like nothing ever before seen. Soon after the find, the team realizes that there is a shape shifting alien amongst them, and it can take any form. The Thing (as it is called) can take over anybody and change them into bizarre monsters. RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) takes charge when no one else will and tries to find who the monster is. Lots of scares and violently amazing effects ensue.If nothing else, this movie should be remembered for it's animatronic effects. These are some amazing animatronic creatures, and the most realistic looking one's of any of these 80s movies. One of the best looking scenes features a husky dog being eaten by a Thing husky imitator, with it's bloody tentacles wrapped around the dog.The direction is good. Lots of establishing shots are used, and where in most movies this would be annoying, it's fine here. The characters are a bit generic, but they have enough likability to them to make them stand out. The story can be very tense, and many scenes should have your heart racing. The musical score is...OK. It's a bit scarce, with the main theme being a bass pluck. It worked for Jaws, but it's not quite as effective here.This is a slow paced movie, and the action scenes are few and far between, but if you can keep your attention focused on more than just violence, this will be an enjoyable horror film filled with some spectacular special effects.My rating: *** out of ****. 105 mins.

He's not afraid to let his imagination run wild, and he's one of the few directors out there capable to put together a movie that is interesting, exciting, scary, and even, as it's the case here, adapt material that a few people consider untouchable and turn it into a populist work of art. \"The Thing\" is the ultimate scary hybrid, a film that takes the best of so many genres and delivers a superb package that few will ever disagree with the fact that it is almost a perfect film.Based on the old classic, Carpenter has made a grungier and more graphic film, with the exception of a couple of gory scenes, the movie works very well, giving us a closer and more intimidating portrayal of the dangers of facing this monster or space alien. Much, like the feral alien, an evil we dare not face or ever encounter, this \"thing\" is a formidable creation.As I mentioned before, he borrows a bit from a few directors, to give us style, majestic vistas, exciting and horrific thrills, intense drama, a ton of suspense, and plenty of uncertainty, and that is the soul of the film. First, the science fiction elements which quickly mutate to a cat and mouse chase that evolves into an experiment in paranoia, as the crew finds itself under attack by an enemy that is difficult to conquer, understand, gauge or even locate. Soon, one by one the crew falls prey to their own fears as they don't know who is real and who is a perfect and lethal copy.\"The Thing\" takes us into a wild ride that will give us what we expect in the movies: great acting, great direction, fantastic special effects manufactured by a crew that didn't rely on the sophisticated technology directors can avail themselves of nowadays. The editing hits all the marks as we follow the creature in its indiscriminate chase of the crew.A lot of people were upset with the ending because it doesn't resolve much, but in truth, it allows us to become participants in the adventure because if the creature is still around, we might have to question ourselves about what the next move might be. It might make you resourceful or just another victim.",

The film professionally features suspense, horror, and even bits of humor (Russell's macho attitude features humor in it all-around) in it, showing us all that the filmmakers and actors were indeed all well-trained. Rob Bottin deserves a special award for his breathtaking effects and Ennio Morricone's score is absolutely eerie (overtones of Carpenter's scores are heard here, or i believe Carpenter uses overtones of Morricone).

I liked the story-line, because this is probably what would actually happen if we did discover some sort of new alien life form (in my opinion). It won't be any of the walking homo-sapiens like so many other films and shows suggest (I'm guessing). It will most likely be a bacterial life form, as far as the facts would go currently anyway. So, this movie was very believable for me. I also liked how the bacteria could hide behind the infected individual's persona. This made it incredibly hard for the others to deter who was infected and who wasn't. Being survival of the fittest, the researchers went to extreme measures to find out who was infected or not, by heat (fire). This is a story about survival and science. What if this were to actually happen? It is very possible. Anyway, this movie is a classic horror. I totally love this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi horror.

It's tension builds nicely and the acting well above standard.

Set in the arctic, it tells the story of a bunch of scientists (including a young Kurt Russell) who are conducting experiments.

            "content": "There are some movies that qualify for the definition 'classic' and this is surely one.Carpenter has made a number of interesting horror/suspense movies, but it is THE THING that truly ranks as his masterpiece.The plot is almost as old as the creature. A group of people go somewhere isolated, stumble upon something very nasty, and seem powerless to deal with it. But it is also a bit of a who-done-it, leaving the viewer to second-guess which amongst a group of suspects might be the real villain. A nice little job for Poirot.The story unfolds with some Norwegians in a helicopter chasing a runaway dog into an American Antarctic research station. After a brief skirmish both are killed. Two of the American team then fly-off to investigate the Norwegian base a few miles away, unaware that the enemy - in the form of the dog - is now already within. What they find at the Norwegian base is chaos and death, and a grotesque artifact burned and frozen in the snow. They bring it back.The artifact must be seen rather than described, and gives rise to one of those truly classic moments. It is placed on an examination table in the medical facility and unwrapped to the bald explanation 'we found this'. 'This' is not clearly seen. The camera shifts at about waist-level between the tightly clustered men, switching between tantalising glimpses of bizarre anatomy and expressions of shock and disgust amongst those assembled. One feels like a child struggling to see beyond a crowd of grown-ups, which heightens the sense of vulnerability. What can be seen is slowly thawing-out; it glistens and drips, as chilled vapour rises.The undoubted star of the show is Rob Bottin, for this and many other frightfully disturbing effects. They are all the more remarkable for a movie that predates computer-generated imaging. What you see is pretty-well what you get: shocks and gore a-plenty. During my first viewing in 1982; when the infected dog's head split open, someone actually ran out of the cinema.The movie unfolds with sustained periods of slowly-building tension inter-spaced by moments of almost hallucinogenic monstrosity. As it gradually becomes evident that this thing could be anyone, members of the group no longer trust each other. That, and the stifling intimacy of small rooms and narrow corridors add to a sense of paranoia.Carpenter employed Ennio Morriconi to provide the music score. This was a wise choice because Mr Morriconi is able to dilate upon the simple themes of horror and suspense in the way that only a professional musician can, evaluating the impact that events may have upon the broader spectrum of human feelings. There is a particularly well-rendered piece during the flight to the Norwegian base, in which the helicopter is seen in long-shot against the huge expanse of frozen wilderness. The music is weighted with string instruments and imparts a sense not so much of horror as one of tragedy and despair - which is what this organism truly represents beyond our own simple fears: the utter destruction of all life on earth.And where there is no music, there is the endlessly moaning wind.The set pieces are simple and entirely believable, from the cheesy common-room where you can almost smell tobacco and stale socks, to the dank frost-bound storage areas. The wrecked Norwegian base is sublimely executed. Notice the pink tinge around the block of ice from which the original fossil was apparently cut, hinting of organic tissue and unpleasant circumstances.This is, strictly speaking, a 'B' movie. It contains no 'stars' except perhaps Kurt Russell. But because of their unfamiliarity on screen, the other actors are all the more plausible as ordinary people. They are aptly chosen and play their parts with understated conviction. Radically, it is an all-male cast, so there is non of the 'romantic' digression expected in most other movies. You are given nothing else to consider but the creature and how to deal with it, just like the actors themselves. This focuses thought and draws you into their dilemma.Horror aside, if you're into thought-provoking science fiction, this is the stuff. The most disturbing element for me was the realisation that such an organism could exist. An anti-virus: this is one that instead of changing host cells into copies of itself, rather assumes a similitude of the organism instead, thereby also inheriting its intelligence. Such a thing could leap 4 billion years of evolution with just one single infection. Imagine HIV with a 3-figure IQ; truly, the stuff of nightmares. I've docked a point because I am fed-up with Hollywood helicopters that apparently can't hover. The Norwegians could have done this and simply shot and bombed the dog to hell. I also think that someone on the American team would have considered putting the animal into quarantine, at least until more was known. After all, the Norwegians would hardly be chasing it for fun. It might perhaps have had rabies. And all animals - including humans - have fleas, lice, or just skin mites. These would likewise be infected and infectious. Then, being nosey, I wanted to see inside the spaceship. Finally, check-out the scene where the monster has absorbed the other dogs and throws-up two big arms to punch a hole in the roof. As it hauls itself up, you hear the sound of a squeaky winch or block-and-tackle, which one suspects is what they used to lift it; but whoever forgot to oil the wheels also forgot to edit-out the noise.The quirky ending suggested a sequel, but - for whatever reason - it never happened (good job Sigourney Weaver wasn't in it).Don't dwell on my nit-picking though; this is definitely a collector's item. In half a century, movie buffs will still be talking about THE THING.",

I also find it very strange that there are zero women in this film considering women of been a part of Antarctica expeditions for very long time. Kurt Russell must've been very popular at the time but he really didn't add anything to this movie and what was the dorky hat he was always wearing that would provide zero warmth in those conditions..

Not so, \"The Thing.\" Quite possibly John Carpenter's greatest film, I have watched this fantastic movie at least 50 times to date, largely because most of my friends have never seen it! While working on \"Big Trouble in Little China\" with the same director, I was prompted to ask him, straight out, why this film seemed to simply fall off the radar, and his answer was short and sweet: \"Timing. I had the bad fortune of deciding to release 'Thing' at the same time that Steven Spielberg released \"ET.\" The movie was simply buried under the onslaught of media attention that made ET a worldwide hit. But that fact doesn't undercut the sheer brilliance of this nail biting masterpiece of horror. Starting from the truly inspired casting, to the script, to the incredible monster making, to the cinematography, to even the stark, atmospheric soundtrack by the great Ennio Morricone, 'The Thing' has become the modern benchmark of sci fi/horror films to come, and John Carpenter deserves all the credit. First, the setting. Using an already claustrophobic location of a completely enclosed, totally isolated Arctic science lab outpost, inhabited by all that testosterone, was as an effective a place for a modern day horror flick as the spooky Gothic castle was in the classic of the genre, \"Frankenstein,\" imparting as much of the feeling of dread as the story itself. But quite possibly the greatest plot choice in was in simply leaving the ending open, \"and just wait and see what happens.\" Brilliant.",

Tack on one of the biggest loose ends in film history, and you've got a plethora of annoying unanswered questions. And of course this is better than the original.

The cinematography of Dean Curry is also great. Performance by the actors (especially Kurt Russel), the practical effects, pacing, everything is just great.\nAccording to FilmRadar, a YouTube Channel, there is a lot of ways that The Thing use to exploit the fears of the audience. The use of setting is one of those ways the film uses. The film is set in Antartica, a place that is so cold and very remote. The setting gives the characters a sense of isolation, the feeling of being unable to call for help.The setting also gives a sense of \"claustrophobia\". The feeling of being trapped in a confined place. Also one of the thing that this film uses is \"paranoia\". Since the organism can perfectly imitate the host after it fully assimilates it, the characters (and also us) don't know who to trust. Another thing that is uses is \"the fear of the unknown\". Since we don't fully understand on what even this organism is, we don't know what is will do or what it truly is. Another way is the use of \"phobias\". The creature can look like a dog (cynophobia), it can have spider legs (arachnophobia), it can have a serpent-like tail (ophiodiophobia), the creature even looks bloody (hemophobia), etc. It's this that why The Thing works in a lot of ways.",

            "content": "Total remake of an old horror/sci-fi film using an age old idea/fear of an alien creature infiltrating a human base and then humans themselves...its suppose to make your skin crawl.A bit of a failure at the box office upon release but this was mainly down to the tough competition of 'Blade Runner' and the friendly alien 'E.T.'. Despite that the film came into its own once hitting the video market and became something of a cult.Personally I think its a good solid film but its never appealed greatly due to its shape shifting alien that is simply surreal to the extreme. Of course the effects are the main showcase of the film and back in 82 they were pretty special, by today's standards on a recent viewing they have aged badly and do look (of course) rather plastic and fake BUT they do still hold up as, unlike CGI, they are actually real.The imagination of Bottin is clearly let loose big time for the alien as he goes way off the wall coming up with all manner of combinations aimed at making you feel uneasy, and it does work. Utilizing spider forms, snake/eel forms, things growing or under the skin, being violated and having something germinate within you etc...all good stuff to make you squirm. The suspense and bleakness is handled well by a young Carpenter (much like 'The Fog') and examines how quickly people break down and turn on each other. All the set work is cruel and cold looking, good location work and with nice elements of 'Alien' used throughout including the isolated oddball crew at the base which does remind you of the Nostromo crew.Its definitely a thriller of a ride with some stand out moments which leave you wanting to know more about the creature and its background. The film just loses its wallop near the end as the creature doesn't look quite as cool as previous incarnations, edging down the B-movie route a touch but the one thing I do like about the film is the way Carpenter bookended it. Its pretty much open at both the start and finish leaving you to think about what came before and what happens after, the final sequence with Russell and David is quite original and unique as the heroes/main leads pretty much fail.Best moment in the film for me has to be the Norris chest bursting sequence revealing a large razor toothed maw where his torso once was, highly original and, at the time, quite surprising.7/10",

            "content": "John Carpenter's The Thing is what a remake should be. It takes only the most basic thematic elements of the original, and then takes them in an almost completely different direction. Carpenter gives us a film that is not as taut or suspenseful as the 1951 version, but it is light years ahead of that film in terms of f/x. This film is a lot more moody and ambiguous, as well. This time, we aren't dealing with an actual \"man from mars\". We are dealing with an organism that can take the form of any living creature. The dozen or so cast members seldom have any idea which of them is human or a reproduction until it's too late.The film begins with a couple of Norwegians in a helicopter shooting at a snow dog from the air. Had the guy with the rifle been an even half-way decent shot, maybe the events of this film would have never even happened. Anyway, the dog makes it to an American compound nearby on the frozen tundra of Antarctica. The Norwegians are unable to explain the dangers associated with allowing this dog inside the camp, and the two are soon dead. Within a few hours, the organism from another world spreads through the dog population in the American camp on to the human crew. The cast starts dropping like flies in some incredibly gory ways as their bodies are taken over by this hostile life form that seems bent on conquering all life on earth. The brutal cold and isolation of this Antarctica outpost don't make survival any easier for the crew, and time is quickly running out on them. Do any of them survive? Watch and see. You may have to draw your own conclusions, however.Is the film frightening? Absolutely. The original film relied more on suspense. The scares in Carpenter's film come mostly from gore-related shocks. Rob Bottin's wonderful creature work has to be seen to be believed. These were the days when you couldn't just sit back and rely on CGI. You had to actually construct these monsters and find a way to make them move convincingly. The gore f/x here are incredible. The cast and acting are uniformly excellent. We get to know enough about virtually everyone who lasts long enough to care about. Kurt Russell is top-billed and gives a typically great performance. He looks to be hiding under about three year's worth of facial hair. Wilford Brimley stands out in an early role for him. T.K. Carter found a lot of work back in those days, and I had not realized that Keith David got any good parts like this so far back in his career.Is this a great film? Not quite. There are some glaring flaws. The film is allowed to cheat by never really explaining just how the creature can morph so easily from one person to the next. Also there are typically dumb moments where the characters split up when they should obviously stick together considering what they know about the enemy organism. The film looks wonderful, and it has some nice homage scenes to the original here and there. Be warned, though. You will need a strong stomach for some of the gory scenes. The R rating is very well justified. In sum I'd recommend watching this film. It never seems to get shown on television anymore, so you may have to turn to Netflix or something similar to find it. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

I had the same problem with Alien, nothing very interesting happens in between the monster scenes. I didn't care about the potty-mouthed characters in either movies. None of them are likable.***Warning, spoilers for the original Thing!***The original The Thing didn't need any gory effects to frighten people. It is one of those meaningful sci-fi/horror movies you rarely see these days. It has a message. Scientists shouldn't mess around with dangerous things (heh). Unlike the remake, the old version had a more optimistic ending. I miss stuff like that in modern horror movies. That a movie can be scary and still have a happy ending. Carpenter's movie is just meaningless and depressing. The Thing shows up, slaughters a lot of dogs and people, and in the end everyone (eventually) dies. Hooray! Just like in real life, right? Except for the part with the scary alien monster, of course.I don't think nihilistic crap like that is necessary in movies like this. I'm not saying that the movie should have ended with the monster turning out to be old man this or that, and with Kurt Russell winking and saying \"Rooby Rooby Roo\".

            "content": "In 1982, following the success of cult classics such as Halloween and Escape from New York, John Carpenter had come out with a brand new sci fi horror film adapted from the horror novella, Who Goes There? By John W. Campbell jr. Despite showing a lot of promise, the film was initially loathed by critics upon its release and audiences were appalled to watch it during the sci-fi summer movie season of E. T. and Blade Runner. However, it has since garnished a massive cult following and is often revered as one of the greatest sci fi/horror films ever made. Now that's nearly been 40 years since its release, how does it hold up?Similar to both the book and the 1951 film adaptation, The Thing from Another World, the film focuses on a group of American researchers in Antarctica who end up encountering a parasitic extraterrestrial life-form that takes the forms of other organisms. The group quickly becomes paranoid under the conditions that they no longer trust each other, since any one of them could be the Thing. Fairly simple premise in its own right, and there have definitely been similar movies featuring a normal group being trapped by a psychological fear that turns them against each other. However, considering that the threat is an invisible parasite that can plague you at any point, the concern for one another is heightened to eleven. In today's time of hopelessness and paranoia based on the COVID 19 pandemic and the Delta variant, this film is a surprisingly bigger reminder as to how dangerous certain diseases and creatures can be if we're not too careful. Even in otherwise boring jobs like being stuck inside a quarantined Antarctic facility, these things can make even the most level headed person go bezerk with madness.That all said and done, the film has often been hated for being far too depressing and realistic by science fiction horror standards. Especially given that the film was released during a horrible recession, the gruesome tone shown throughout the movie does play a key role in one's tolerance for the type of thrills set in stone. Unlike some horror films where the threat is built up slowly across the runtime until the climactic third act, The Thing sets the stakes as early as the end of the first act, and it does not hold back in showing how not even your own pets can be trusted. Because the parasite can assemble and imitate anyone and anything it can, the first twenty to thirty minutes pretty much plays as a separate short story on its own showcasing how even a loyal Alaskan husky can't even be accounted for. The major theme of trust is still quite relevant in our current social climate, let alone in a film released during the HIV pandemic of the early 80s. In many ways, it's a reminder that even your otherwise mundane cohorts on a job can be unintentional threats to you and others if you're not careful enough.As for other solid qualities, the creature effects work by Rob Bottin is astonishingly well crafted. The main ingredients used to concoct the alien that can take on any form were chemicals, food products, rubber, and mechanical parts, and although the monster looks appropriately revolting once it pops up, Dean Cundey's gloomy cinematography has the beast stand out between the already shadowy perimeters, allowing the audience to fill in the blanks for claustrophobic purposes. In addition, the cast themselves really sell the paranoia within a team that almost cannot trust one another, especially Kurt Russell being the most cautious yet controlling member. While they are a bit light on traits and development, the dangerous circumstances they become stuck in make one hope they make it out ok. Lastly, famed composer Ennio Morricone does so much with so little in creating a simple synthesized score that creates the right intense flow without giving too much away. It is only used sparingly in certain points, and all of them deliver the needed fear for whenever the danger rises.It is easy to understand why John Carpenter's The Thing was poorly received upon its original release, but upon looking back at it, there's a lot to admire for how much guts it had to go where it needed to anyway. Not everyone can handle its admittedly nihilistic tone that takes on a more depressing direction than most sci-fi/horror flicks out there, yet the influence it has since spawned for other filmmakers and horror buffs is worth at least recognition. It's hard to say where Carpenter's career would have gone had the film been a hit upon release, but it sure is a fascinating mirror into what might've been.",

The movie is exceptionally well done.  John Carpenter has topped the rather dull 1950's version and created a horror masterpiece.The secret to the film's success is not only the special effects (which are very impressive) or the performances (Kurt Russell and Keith David are standouts), but the general air of paranoia throughout the film.  The men don't know who the Thing is, and neither do we.  The scene where Russell ties his \"friends\" to chairs and tests their blood against a hot needle is absolutely terrifying.  Understand, when this movie was made the Cold War was technically over, but everyone was still a bit on edge.  I feel this scene perfectly represents the rather militant tactics Americans had used to route out communists.Of course, the main intention of the film is not to make commentary on the state of the worlds politics.  Its intention is to frighten, and that's what it does.  The effects are wonderfully gory and very well done, some of the best produced in the eighties.Overall, I highly reccommend this to anyone who wants to have a good scare.",

The ending is the perfect mix of knowing exactly how it ends and still not having any idea at all. You know - but do you really?There are a lot of questions and inconsistencies that pop up throughout the movie and the basic premise of \"stick together\" seems lost on this group... I guess there wouldn't be a movie otherwise. I shrug it off as none of them are geniuses in any way. The \"test\" is questionable since the basic idea of a life form transmitting through blood always made me wonder. - why are they using the same knife...? Now they are all Things! But honestly, for most of those, it took me decades - and my adult daughter pointing them out - to notice. They are all forgivable.We have a \"winter horror\" movie marathon and this is always the kick off. Love it.",

            "content": "This is simply the most underrated horror movie ever. It is also the best.When I think horror movie, The Thing is the first movie that comes to mind.Horror movies in my mind are partly special effects. This movie is partly special effects, which is what all the critics couldn't get past. Horror movies to me are also mostly psychological. If the movie can hit and maintain that one disturbing note than it has worked. The Thing keeps that note vibrating through the whole movie. The intrigue and tone is set in the first five minutes.(Not the unnecessary opening titles) What a great way to start a movie and make the viewer think.Yes this movie has incredible effects but they are all secondary to the story. This movie works on so many different levels you can't pigeon hole it because of it's special effects. The special effects are just what's on the surface. The movie works because of the story.The Thing actually makes you think. It's kind of a twist on the who done it mystery. Everything works perfectly. The simplistic heartbeat like score from Ennio Morricone. The isolated setting. The acting. The editing. The great cinematography.Although each character isn't overtly developed, there is a lot of subtlety (something all too rare today) in each performance.This is probably Kurt Russell's best performance. Not that he has a lot of dialogue. It's all in the facial expressions and what he doesn't say but rather communicates with body language. Like when he removes his hood in the climax.Another key performance is Keith David's. Watch his fearful face when he is tied up. His performance in this has made me a fan of his work ever since.Everyone is good in this movie. Other than the effects nothing is thoroughly spelled out for you. It's up to you to figure out just what happened off screen. Something they also don't do anymore. Everything is now hammered into your head.The scariest things are what your own mind comes up with when posed with a few facts and images. Sometimes it's scarier when you don't see the monster. This film really couldn't of done this with respect to the monster but it did make use of that concept elsewhere. Even though it's kinda like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It works better this time knowing what the monster's ghastly intentions and forms are. Instead of the \"don't get caught \"(sleeping or awake) mentality of Body Snatchers, The Thing's mentality is best summed up by the original story's title \"Who goes there\", which I recommend reading.Great line from the movie.\"You gotta be **cking kidding.\"Note: Buy this on DVD, it has got to be one of the most comprehensive and feature packed DVDS out there.",

Still one of the best in the thriller/horror/SCI-FI genre, not quite as good as it's predecessor ALIEN but very close.The paranoia of the hapless research station staff is palpable. Enhanced by the claustrophobic surroundings of the station buildings and inclement polar weather outside. And in 1982 if the director wanted a special effect they actually had to BUILD it. No CGI here. To my mind the effects hold up well considering it was 2 decades ago. Thankfully a second-rate sequel was never made, preserving the impact of the thought provoking ending.THE THING is a classic. I recommend the DVD - wide screen being the only way to view John Carpenter's vision. An updated \"making of\" documentary with cast/crew recollections is also quite interesting.",

            "content": "The Thing is a very good film, achieving much of what it sets out to do. At its core, the story is intriguing because of the creative premise. Every viewer should be completely entranced, as any character could be a clone of the titular shape-shifting creature. This idea builds an unrelenting tension, making for countless entertaining moments showcasing the growing fear that molds the group's dynamics. Adding to this environment full of distrust is a phenomenal score, in addition to the menacingly cold, dark, and remote Antarctica setting. The characters in of themselves are mostly solid additions to the story, too, helped by perfectly convincing performances. Highlighting the cast is Russell's lead, who proves to be a great protagonist. His actions seem mostly logical and certainly those of a leader, emphasized by the conviction Russell gives to the role. Another standout is David, who provides a good amount of personality to his performance. The interactions among the group are truly what makes the film scary, though, as everyone is forced into doubting one another. There are many unnerving twists and turns that capture the audience's imagination. Another amazing part to the movie is its more blatant horror elements. The creature visuals in this film are extremely fear-inducing and at the same time, quite real looking. The visual effects even impressively hold up to today. Unfortunately, the screenplay is not without its flaws. The beginning sequence is questionable on many fronts, as what happens feels unrealistic as to how it would have actually played out. This is unfortunate because the scene is still good for the interest it builds and what it sets up. Despite spending a decent amount of time with each role, none except Russell's MacReady get all too much character development expanding further than the stereotypical person in distress. This is undoubtedly due to a slight excess in characters. With one too many roles to handle, a few certainly got lost in the background as a one note character. This being said, the characters are well-balanced for how many are present. Most egregious, though, is the inconsistency of The Thing's powers. This permits many idiotic choices the characters make to go unpunished, while at the same time allowing the plot to happen because of their other slight idiocies. Nevertheless, The Thing is an entertaining horror picture that proves more than worthwhile for both its suspense and horror qualities.",

There were some flaws, however. As in \"Alien\", we have an African American character who has a highly qualified position,no doubt having had to be screened for intelligence,and technical know-how. As in \"Alien\", he is a jive turkey; a fool who speaks like an uneducated ghetto stereotype. Some scenes called for an emotional response, but the characters took it in stride. When Russel's character and the other guy look at a huge spaceship stuck in he ice, they seem too relaxed. Nobody said, \"Wow! a flying saucer!\" They didn't even elaborate on it when they got back o the other guys. When the horrific Thing kept warping itself into demonic images of horror, nobody really panicked...they just dealt with it as if it were a rat in the kitchen...

Most of them are unnecessary (e.g. Alfie), or unwarranted (e.g. Dawn of the Dead), and damned near every single one is crap. But there is always the exception to the rule: John Carpenter's The Thing is the exception to the Iron Law of Remakes. It goes off in a different direction than Howard Hawks' Thing (which is trite \"Doctor, look at the geiger counter!\" 1950s rubbish), but stays more faithful to the original source material. This film is a horror masterpiece, without flaws, false notes, or counterfeit nonsense that makes the viewer say to himself \"Oh yeah, I'm watchin' a movie.\" The script is taut, the acting superb, the credibility factor unassailable, and the special effects tremendous. I don't think Hollywood realizes just how artificial and awful CGI is. The effects in The Thing are gross, gory, and organic, and they never made me shake my head once. Let's put it this way: the 1982 special effects for The Thing do the job they're supposed to do--tell the story--better than anything George Lucas and his oodles of nerd-loot managed twenty years later. This is a film to own, and I can't sing its praises enough. Last point: I've seen the movie numerous times, and know how the plot works out...but the film is so well-made, such a classic, that I'll stick with it if I chance upon it on cable because it's that good (cf. \"The Godfather).",

That's not really unusual as opinions on so many films change with time. There is not a slack moment in a film that is intensely absorbing from start to finish. One would expect the special effects to be really weak compared to what can be done today, but they are surprisingly still strong, gross and creepy. A couple will still cause a hoot or two! The acting by all is still solid, the primal music, so similar to the original Halloween, still is effective and it is John Carpenter's best film.

It was also the first film of J.C. which he did for a big studio and on a rather large budget. Contrary to other films Carpenter was given much more time to complete this masterpiece. What he achieved has since become a true classic in the horror genre even if it is quite different from most of the other films that were made in the 80s.The Thing is not just a normal horror film trying to scare the audience with cheap thrills but is also some kind of a psychological drama. Throughout the whole movie you can never be sure who to trust. The thing moves from body to body imitating the victims perfectly and that's why anybody among the men could be possessed. The theme of paranoia and mistrust is very strong in this film and cleverly done.The Thing is set in the Antarctic (in fact it was shot in British Columbia). It is made clear to the viewer that there is no possibility of escape for any of the members of the research crew. The location also creates a feeling of loneliness and isolation where each one of the dozen men is basically on his own and therefore contributes to the paranoid undertone.And of course the film has state-of-the-art special effects and lighting. Rob Bottin simply did a great job. There is lots of gore and some very inventive scenes were the thing changes its shape. Some of the effects had to be done several times and others were deleted because Carpenter and Bottin didn't want the effects to be laughable or cheesy. The effects are outstanding and astonishing even for today's standards. They are much more interesting to look at than modern computer-animated special effects.But the most important thing that made this film believable are the actors (it is a male-only film by the way). Each and everyone of the cast was convincing which is a rare thing. Although there are twelve or so men in this film who are almost equally important (with Kurt Russell becoming some kind of a leader) Carpenter managed to give each one of them an own character in a very short time. He didn't even need to include much dialogue to make the persons seem real.I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in Carpenter's work and/or horror films and doesn't have a weak stomach.My rating: 10/10",

Tame by today's standards, The Thing will only get to the weak of stomach and the unsuspecting.  The Thing has many moments where the viewer can literally not move, it will have you in such suspense and awe that your eyes will be locked onto the screen until the scene is done.The Thing takes place in Antarctica mainly in a U.S. Research Base, what they are researching in the middle of nowhere on a block of ice in 1982 is a complete mystery. We know this movie is about an alien when we see a spaceship crashland on Earth. Soon after this a helicopter from Norway is opening fire on an Alaskan husky, it doesn't take much thinking to know this is the alien. The chopper doesn't shoot it and lands in front of the research base, unfortunately the gunman can't speak English and accidentally shots one of the workers in the arm, thinking that he is hostile the leader of the base shoots him in the eye, and this is where the mystery begins. The men travel to the Norweigan base which is completely destroyed and contains odd looking corpses which have been warped and mangled, lucky for them they bring them over their base. The Thing can be based up on a few things ; flamethrowers, tentacles, the ice, and the blood test scene.The ultimate ending is rather anti-climatic. Everyone thinks something will happen at the very end of the movie, then the credits roll. The one is missable, if your weak of stomach watch it, it might desenseitize you, if you are totally unable to see horror and laugh at mutilation scenes like me, don't watch this one, you can miss it. If you have ever played Resident Evil 2 for PSX, you'll know exactly what this movie is, and won't feel a thing towards the monsters. This movie is very overrated by tons of people today, The Thing by no means works on the 2000 level, but sure did scare people 20 years ago.

            "content": "The Thing has become a cult classic over the years, but in case you've been living under a rock, it follows an American research team stationed in Antarctica as they're infiltrated by an alien lifeforce that imitates anything biological, including humans. It doesn't take long before the team realise the creature is around and could be anyone, and what follows is an hour and a half of paranoia and claustrophobia as the team splinters off in distrust of one another and are secretly and unknowingly picked off one-by-one.Perhaps what The Thing is most well-known for are the special effects. In the age before CGI, everything had to be done practically, and The Thing's practical effects are nigh unmatched even today. The creature and its mutated remains are horrifying to look at, but so full of detail. Some moments maybe don't look quite as good, such as someone's head turned into a spider scuttling away, but others like a chest cavity suddenly opening up mid defibrillating and cutting a man's arms off are terrifyingly effective. The sheer breadth of these special effects are amazing as well, from a creature borne of a dog with flailing, whipping tentacles, to a face-eating humanoid, to a giant cave-filling monstrosity. It's a technical marvel and some of the goriest effects around, and compared to the prequel's CGI it shows how superior practical effects can be despite their limitations (case in point, the Xenomorph from Alien is scarier than the one from Covenant precisely because the limitations made it next to impossible to show the full creature in broad daylight).But the gore and visual effects wizardry is only part of what makes The Thing such a landmark horror movie. What actually makes The Thing a true horror movie worthy of watching on Halloween is the isolation it portrays from the team's distrust of one another. Anyone could be the Thing. And often it's revealed to be the guy you didn't even suspect in the first place. The Thing is incredibly good at hiding and blending in with the group. And with everyone insisting they're human, does the imitation even realise they're an imitation? Would you know if you were an imitation and not yourself? The fact the movie never shows anyone actually being assimilated by the creature just amplifies it, and makes you wonder how the process actually takes place. Fear of the unknown is rampant in this movie.My only real complaint would be some of the cuts can feel a bit janky. In order to keep the mystery intact and its cards close to the chest until the right moments, the passage of time never really feels well-defined. The best example of this would be when Fuchs talks to MacReady in the lab and seconds later is startled by a silhouette, follows it outside, finds tattered remains, and then we cut to MacReady mentioning how long Fuchs has been missing. There's no transition between these scenes to help the movie's flow of time. One minute he's there uncovering a potentially big piece of evidence, the next he's been missing for hours and no-one's bothered to look for him or check up on him. There isn't even any implication that he's been attacked, or even at risk of it, until we find his half-frozen, half-charred remains outside.But I mean, there isn't really much more to say about it. It's claustrophobic and mysterious, with gory and disturbing special effects equal to none. Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is subdued and suitably creepy at all times, the use of muted colours to make the practical effects stand out is a subtle stroke of genius, and the ambiguity throughout goes a long way to build up the tension and the ultimate surprises. I give The Thing a solid 8/10. Would definitely recommend.",

More than 20 years later it's not as shocking, but it's still pretty gross. It's certainly not tame like James Arness' original Thing in the 1951 original.This movie has little relation to the original The Thing (1951.) Instead, Bill Lancaster's script follows the idea of the original short story, John Campbell's \"Who Goes There?\" John Carpenter follows in the traditional of Howard Hawks who produced the original Thing and is one of Carpenter's idols. Once again Carpenter shows that he can put all of his budget on the screen. He makes a movie that looks many times more than its real budget. This film has high production values. Ennio Morricone's score is perfectly creepy. The sets are claustrophobic.As in the original, the acting is top notch. For a horror film, where characters are usually nothing more than fodder for the monster, each character in this film has a distinct personality. Kurt Russell is perfect as the hero RJ MacReady. Wilford Brimley is great as Dr. Blair. Richard Masur is the scruffy, antisocial dog handler. The rest of the cast is also excellent.The star of the movie is Rob Bottin's Thing. The Thing is flat-out nasty. Maybe this Thing is a modern metaphor for cancer as it infects the crew. It changes shapes every time it appears so you never know what to expect.One of Carpenter's best films and one of the best horror movies ever.",

I blame the excessive amount of splatter movies that i've seen as it has de-sensatised me from that particular genre but has increased my fear at the less noticable horror, namely psychological. The Thing is a splatter movie but it is also more than that. The splatter elements themselves only happen infrequently which leaves the rest of the film to build on the relentless tension and shear terror that the group of men feel as they don't know who the thing has infected. Setting the film in the Antarctic was a masterstroke as it creates a sense that there is no escape. I mean where are the men supposed to run to? This film also shows how computer animation has taken over from the great puppet work that used to be the norm. The effects in this are absolutely fantastic as everything looks so real. Also using the old rubber and latex technique makes the splatter look that more grotesque and gut wrenching (as opposed the CG gore that you find in films like Starship Troopers). This is also one of those films where you feel the terror that the characters feel also. As the decapitated head grows legs and runs across the floor you hear the line \"You've gotta be f*****g kidding\" from the character and the audience as a whole. John Capenter is a bizzare man as he has lost touch with his audience over recent years. Some of my favourite movies are his earlier works (this and Assult On Presinct 13 being nearer the top) but his newer stuff really is the lowest of the low (just look at Ghosts Of Mars). When watching his movies you either pitty him or remember that he used to be one of the greatest directors of all time. The latter thought is enough for me to still give him respect and repsect is what the man deserves as without him we wouldn't have Halloween or this masterpiece of cinematic horror.

Well, you don't watch this for great characterization or acting - though the old blokes here (the doctor and the ageing gun maniac do very well). It's the slow ominous pace leading to one gory climax after another, the shadows, the ice and steam, the slithering red entrails,that make this unforgettable.

The pilot emerges with a gun and begins firing at the creature as it runs towards a base of American scientists.Soon, this doesn't sound as strange as it seems. Kurt Russell stars as the American scientist who learns the secret of the creature: it's over 100,000 years old, frozen beneath the ice, and ticked off. We also learn that if it reaches civilization, within 27,000 hours the entire planet would be run by this creature - an alien lifeform that imitates whatever it kills. Dogs, spiders, grandma - this thing can do it. It's up to old Russell to save the day and destroy everything in sight in a blind rage.When first released in 1982, The Thing met with mixed critical acclaim - most of it bad. It was either \"not scary\" or \"relies on special effects\", but rarely would you find a positive review. Now, in the new millennium, the film is finally getting the recognition it deserves. The Thing has deservedly joined the ranks of the most famous horror films of all-time. It is even arguably more popular than it's basis, the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing from Another World.I felt the acting was excellent, especially Russell as the determined chosen leader of the team. The acting actually gives this film a documentary feeling ...Carpenter is probably the movie's second most important aspect. His direction is eerie and suspenseful - this movie helped elevate him to his current position of horror/thriller wonder. If you truly look at this film, you can tell Carpenter wasn't trying to make it scary - he wanted to make it suspenseful, although there are a few jumpy moments in the film.There's also a fitting and chilling score by Ennio Morricone. It definitely doesn't rank among the master composer's greatest scores, but it works well on the mood of the film.The most important, and no doubt the greatest, aspect of the film is Rob Bottin's special effects. They are extraordinary. Every scene involving the alien parasite is completely convincing. Whether it's a gruesome alien bursting from a dog's body, or a severed head sprouting spider-like legs and walking around the room, the effects are outstanding. Bottin proves himself to be a make-up genius.It's no wonder The Thing is a classic. It's documentary-like feel and it's creepy atmosphere are perfect. Carpenter has succeeded in making a thrilling wonder that may even surpass it's aforementioned story source. No horror, sci-fi or thriller fan should go without at least taking a look at this masterpiece chiller.",

Since it's release in 1982, viewers are still amazed at the special effects, which still hold up pretty good.In the Antarctic, a group of researchers are thrown into a horrific nightmare when a dog shows up, being shot at by a group of Noreigians, that REALLY want the dog dead. Later, the group of researchers, lead by MacReady (Kurt Russell), stumble upon a spaceship at the Noreigians camp, with other information: a creature that can become anything or anyone it chooses. This really becomes evident when the dog, which is in a kennel with the other dogs, shows what it REALLY is, in one of the most disturbing scenes in movie history (And still creeps me out!).Soon the researchers begin to suspect each other, knowing that the creature can assume ANYONE'S identity. Paranoia and distrust runs rampant, as one by one the creature begins to take over each of the group members. In one memorable scene, a blood test is used to reveal which of the members is the creature. You get so caught up in who you THINK is the creature, that when you find out the truth, you really are shocked. The film has you on edge from start to finish, although there are some unanswered questions (What exactly happened to Nauls?)that I wished were explained.The Thing itself is a nasty piece of work: This creature can inhabit every square inch of a victim's body (even the blood). Each incarnation of the creature is as graphic and as disturbing as the last. And the atmosphere in the film makes the situation even more unsettling: The group is in the middle of nowhere, with temperatures below freezing and dropping each and every second. Their modes of transportation are destroyed and no one can trust each other. They are trapped with not just the creature, but with their own understandable paranoia.2 of my favorite lines: Wilford Brimley,as Dr. Blair, going insane and screaming \"I'll kill you!\" and David Clennon, as Palmer, when he sees his friend's head turn into a spider creature and walks away, says \"You gotta be f***ing kidding!\" Great movie to be included for Halloween, or when you just want to have a good scare.",

Accompanying the 29 year old actors is a majestic and graceful score by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, who created one of the most iconic sounds in a new generation of Westerns. Around this time, a bright eyed and passionate director began piecing together one of the most memorable scores for a film that would become one of the most iconic slashers of our time. Four years later, both masters of iconicism would join hands melding Morricone's strings with Carpenter's terror, creating one of the greatest pieces of science fiction horror cinema has ever seen.Taking place at United States National Science Institute Station 4 in Antarctica, a helicopter manned by a Norwegian sniper attempts to shoot a wild dog making its way to the research station. After a brief shootout, the Alaskan Malamute is taken in by gruff sled-dog handler Clark (Richard Masur), while fellow researcher Dr. Copper (Richard Dysart) and helicopter pilot R. J. MacReady (Kurt Russel) investigate a nearby Norwegian research facility. Finding the entire camp in ruin, and a mysterious, twisted corpse containing two faces lying amidst the charred facility, they fly it back for Dr. Blair (Wilfrud Brimley) to look at. Soon afterwards the dog, now caged with the others and containing the creature, mutates into a biomass of flesh and bone that is quickly contained by a flamethrower wielding Childs (Keith David). The creatures autopsy reveals that the thing inside of the animal can mimic other life forms, putting the rest of the crew on edge as they quickly try and figure out who the creature has infected.Originally a short story entitled Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell Jr., The Thing is a remake of a 1951 science fiction film The Thing From Another Planet by Howard Hawkes and Christian Nyby. Playing more closely to the story Hawkes and Nyby adapted, John Carpenter weaves a beautiful tapestry of twisted design between a veil of claustrophobia as each member of the research team becomes more and more paranoid over who is who. As the creature makes itself apparent, showing us one beautiful transformation after the other, the room we are given to move around is slowly cut off, adding to the creeping feeling of isolation and hopelessness.With the tension John Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster creates as things unfold is all too palpable, causing each scene to build on top of each other in Jenga like fashion. What stirs each paranoid glance, each unsure movement, and what ultimately goes bump in the night is Ennio Morricone's magnificent post-Western score, raising hairs with each sound. Whether it's a wide shot of the frozen Arctic tundra or a close-up of the thing ripping out of a fellow teammate, the music behind each scene raises it to new heights that only a master composer could.Just as The Thing is a film that you can watch, it is also one you can listen to and feel, with each contribution working with equal and powerful forces. Ranging from suffocating tension to grotesque and sudden outbursts, every frame is one for your senses. While Todd C. Ramsay's editing comes off as a bit too ill-guided, forcing multiple scenes transitioning to pick up too many pieces, it doesn't cause us to deviate from the story. Whether it's John Carpenters patient build up, Rob Bottin's and Stan Winston's horrifying and undeniably ahead of its times special effects, or Ennio Morricone's hair raising score, The Thing is a film that cannot be forgotten.",

This is something which continues to inspire my own work, wherein I always aim to present my audience with a monster worth looking at and imagining.

And I've seen quite a few, as I'm 38 years of age when writing this.\nAnd the most important thing about this film is, that it's made long before the CGI graphics of today, and yet is even better than what they make today. Doesn't that say a lot about today's average horror-movie quality?\n11 out of 10.Dracopticon out.",

            "content": "I watched this movie for the first time on New Years Eve, 2003 and it made an impact on me. It introduced me to John Carpenter. At that time, I hadn't seen any of Carpenter's movies, except for Halloween, but even then I was about eight. After watch The Thing, I now own every mainstream John Carpenter movie and love the guy's work. It showcased some spectacular gore, creepy score, excellent performances, and a great story, illustrated with genuine paranoia and fear.First and foremost, the astonishing special effects in this movie are one reason to watch this movie, even if you don't like horror movies. Rob Bottin and his crew created, in my opinion, the most realistic gore effects second only to Day of the Dead. My favorite is either in the dog kennel or the scene with the defibrillator. WOW! I won't say anymore.The score, though not composed by Carpenter, is unsettling and creepy. It fits the movie perfectly and doesn't overpower it at all. To this day when I watch it, I am still creeped out by it.Even though there are 12 guys in this movie, they are so different and well developed that I can name all of them right off the top of my head. Even the minor characters like Bennings, Fuchs, & Nauls are memorable and enjoyable. Kurt Russell gives a fantastic performance here as R.J. MacReady, even rivaling his role of Snake Plissken. This man means business and I would want him to be one my side if push came to shove. Keith David as Childs is wonderfully sarcastic as usual, I mean the man is an expert at playing this role. A. Wilford Brimley plays Blair perfectly. The man can act. The other supporting characters are great too, especially Norris and Clark.The story, based on the short story \"Who Goes There?\" is adapted perfectly. The fact that it's set in Antarctica already ups the isolation factor. Add in 12 uneasy, unstable and panicky men with a shape-shifting alien that can imitate anything perfectly, and the paranoia level is cranked up to 11.This movie is one of the few movies that actually scares me. The movie itself is creepy, but after you watch it, I guarantee that it will stick with you and creep you out. Go out and either rent or buy it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",

Well, it turned out that I was wrong.Even though the plot of an isolated research station in Antarctica provide a very nice basis for a horror movie, Carpenter didn't make much of it. At times, it became just too obvious that he simply tried to mix some ingredients of other (real) classics of that time, namely Scott's \"Alien\" and Kubrick's \"2001\", and then expecting to get a great movie. Which did not work.On top of failing to provide any real new ideas (or even just special effects), the movie's storyline is very foreseeable. Plus, the characters do not act authentically - I don't buy that researchers shoot each other that easily or that they take the death of one of their colleagues that lightly (\"well, he's been massacred by an alien monster, fine, let's burn and bury him and hope things will be fine\").Conclusion: 4/10 - only for die-hard Carpenter fans. Better watch \"Alien\" one more time.",

I have seen this movie about 40 times, and it still holds me every time.  The monologue given by MacReady (Kurt Russell) halfway through the film, into the tape recorder, is one of those scenes that you always remember.  John Carpenter has made some magnificent films in his career (Halloween, They Live, Escape From New York, etc), but this one stands above them all.

            "content": "A delightful and charming story about a visitor from another world who lands on Earth and comes in contact with several humans whilst trying to find a way home....And this, is another film where an alien being, comes down and takes the form of several humans (and dogs) trying to disguise itself and avoid being found to then return home. How similar are ET and The Thing? Both are made in 1982, both are about alien visitors and both films show the obstacles faced in their plight to return home. Well, I suppose one film is more sickening than the other (I mean how much mush, sentimentality and sweetly sick story can one person take?) But enough about E.T, The Thing has become something of an underground classic during the heydays of VCR rentals, where it's outstanding scenes can be paused and rewound to be watched over and over again. Some of the scenes within the film are jaw-dropping and it's all done pre-CGI. It's amazing what could be done in those early days of creature animatronics.The Thing is directed by John Carpenter and is probably one of his best, but unfortunately it was not a hit. A remake of sorts (John Carpenter was hugely influenced by Howard Hawks) however this is an altogether different beast. Set in Antartica, an American expedition group are interrupted one day by gunshots from a far. A couple of Norwegians are firing at a husky from a helicopter. With sporadic gunfire, one of the American scientists takes a shot in the leg. Shots are fired in response and as a result the Norwegians are killed. The dog is taken in and held with the other dogs in the camp. Unbeknown to the American group, the Husky is not what he seems. Eventually the team set out to discover why the pair of Norwegian were shooting at the dog and what they find out is beyond their darkest nightmares.The plot isn't anything original as the group is picked off one by one until there is one man standing (or in this case two), with it's remote location it's very similar to another classic sci-fi horror that is Alien....but where Alien only really has one complete genuine gross out moment, The Thing has so many that it's a wonder when you see the first gruesome transformation how they can top it... but they do. The whizkid at the time (Rob Bottin) deserves so much praise as his effects beat anything that modern special effects can bring to our screens. He was also only 21! The central themes on what makes us human and the loss of identity is dealt with in vivid detail. As men in joining the tribe we gain a sense of belonging but as a result we lose personal identity. Paranoia and trust are tested to the limit. Characters start turning on each other, they begin shooting and eventually resort to tying up one another. In one of the films more lighter moments, they devise a test to see who is human and who is not, from this comes one of the most memorable and perfectly delivered lines. There is relief amongst all the bodily gore.The technical achievements in this film is what makes it so watchable. The score by Ennio Morricone is a haunting yet deliberate heartbeat which is minimalistic yet menacing. One of the only films where Carpenter hasn't had an input on the scoring, but nevertheless Morricone's approach is very suited and matches and enhances the films eerie atmosphere.There is a lack of character development within the film (that is the only flaw I can say), and it seems that Kurt Russell's character (MacReady) is the only one who is given enough personality for us to root for. The majority are unfortunately given the basic stock character traits, though the acting by all is well above average, there isn't enough depth to them.With a tight a script, direction and amazing effects work by Rob Bottin's crew (never has intestinal and flesh mesh been so beautifully realised), it has still stood the test of time and is always a joy to watch.

Even tough elements of horror run throughout the movie, \"The thing\" can only fall under the sci-fi genre. And not only is this sci-fi, it is sci-fi as you will have trouble finding- the purest of its siblings. There is not one unreal symbolic character development like you find in so many other movies; the characters evolve with the movie and there is absolutely no moment where the action stops in preparation of the next THRILLING moment- it is always thrilling, endlessly running the beautiful images and sounds and effortlessly building the story without flaw in your mind.The acting and directing, as well as all the other technical areas, work so well they're not even noticed. Kurt Russel delivers a terrific performance worthy of mention.When watching \"The thing\" it is hard to try outguessing it, not just because it will surprise you in every corner, but more importantly because you will be sucked into that world and be too impressed by it's wonders to think about anything else.I give it a 9/10 and a top 5 in my all time favorites list.",

Extremely atmospheric, excellent effects which to this day have not been beaten, scary, thought provoking and ambiguous, good characters, great story all make The Thing one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.Out in the arctic are a crew of men, working for months at their outpost. With little contact with the outside world, little entertainment and the same 10 or so faces every day, life can become monotonous. One day a helicopter appears, shooting at a dog on the ground. The 'copter lands, and the pilot shots one of the outpost crew, who is in turn shot and killed. The other pilot accidentally blows himself and the Helicopter apart. The dog is taken inside the camp, and the men decide to investigate. They realise that an alien spaceship was uncovered, and that a being which can reproduce itself many times by killing its host and making an exact copy has invaded their base. it could be anyone of them, or two, or 3...and soon the men are falling to pieces, not trusting anyone. A test is worked out to decide who is real, and who isn't, leading to a final confrontation.A brilliant idea, flawlessly executed, The Thing is one of those films which can be repeatedly watched without becoming boring, and we can find new things each time we watch. Some brilliant dialogue in the typical vein of Carpenter, spoken by typical Carpenter characters, and a haunting score all add to the atmosphere. We do not know who is what or what is who, but it never becomes complicated. Our paranoia grows, the isolation soon affects us as it does the characters, and we do not know what to expect next. The effects are, quite simply amazing- the arms being bitten off, the digs changing, heads turning into spiders, they are insanely innovative and work wonderfully. Russell as Mac is a strong leader, but only because he wants to get out alive, and if that isn't a possibility, then he won't let the thing get out either. The whole world would be screwed if that happened. As the rest of the cast are good actors, but hardly established names, this adds to the mystery. Palmer is funny, Childs is volatile, Blair loses it quickly, each man has their own traits, but the thing knows this.The ending has gone down as a classic cliffhanger, another classic Carpenter trademark- we must imagine what will happen to any surviving character, the story is over but we will always want to know more. We wonder if the thing is dead or not, if it is how will anyone get out, if it isn't, what does the future hold. Carpenter was at his prime here, and when he is, no-one is better.10 out of 10",

            "content": "When it comes to horror movies, I'm all about mood, atmosphere, a creepy soundtrack or an anonymous killer lurking in the background ready to strike which is why I was intrigued to watch John Carpenter's The Thing and I loved it thanks to it's usage of atmosphere and music, it's creature effects and it's likable characters. Upon watching this, I wish more horror movies like this were still being made rather then the CGI-heavy, jump-scare garbage we keep getting.The movie starts with a spacecraft crash-landing in Antarctica then cuts to 1982 where a Norwegian helicopter chases a dog to an American research base only to have one of the crew members drop a explosive device which destroys the chopper while the lone surviving member be shot by the base commander who then sends two other men over to the Norwegian base for answers only to find a burnt husk of buildings with human remains. Upon returning to their own base, their naturalist does an analysis on the body, discovering a normal set of human body parts. Meanwhile, another crew member cages one of the dogs when it suddenly morphs and starts attacking the other dogs. The men manage to flame broil the creature, but now they begin to grow suspicious of each other as the thing begins killing them one by one.With so many abysmal remakes of classic horror movies being released, John Carpenter's The Thing is a perfect example of a remake done right as it takes all the best features of the 1952 Howard Hawks' movie and from the original book and puts it's own spin on things and yet maintains the frozen landscapes of Antarctica as its backdrop which works perfectly for installing a profound sense of loneliness as well getting into the heads of the characters and deepening the feelings of anxiety and dread that encircle them. Throughout the entirely of the film, the viewer is always on high alert as the treason and danger never seem to let up even in the quiet scenes which makes it even more creepy and unsettling. Given how simple the story is, I feel that a lot of modern Hollywood writers could learn a thing or two from the Thing and through the plot is especially frightening, specifically when the viewer contemplates what might happen if the alien is able to find its way into our culture and other small details that make the movie so great. When one of the characters demolishes every mean that the group can use for communication or escape, leaving them entirely cut off from the outside world adds a lot more uneasiness and dread to the film and while the others don't resort to anything quite as drastic, the sense of distrust they have towards each other helps make scenes could have been mind-numbingly boring into moments of nail-biting and terrifying horror.In comparison to the original movie, the conflict comes from the basis that killing the alien becomes unimportant to finding out what it really is and in one of the twists of fate, the moment where the main hero is able to detect the alien doesn't mean the paranoia and fear are gone and the scene where Macready conducts a blood test to analyze who is really this creature is unrivaled in any other horror movie when it comes to nail-biting suspense. As for the creature itself, it comes across as a mystery as the viewer is never told or shown it's motives or even if it has any nor does it have a main form as it is able to clone itself which makes the tension even more unbearable and scary to watch.The Thing shows John Carpenter at the height of his directing prowess by creating a true feeling of uneasiness on such an agonizing level and so far, only Alien and Halloween have been able to generate the kind of tension that The Thing has been able to deliver. Right from the moment the alien appears, Carpenter turns the anxiety meter up to 11 and never lets up on the tension and fear and when the results are delivered, it is handed to you with a painful kick. John's directing and camera-work is nothing short of perfection here with rapid camera work and forceful shots which is aided by Dean Cundey's superb cinematography not to mention Ennio Morricone's haunting musical score. While some may argue that the movie's characters are flat and uninteresting and while I would say that this area of the movie isn't Carpenter's area of expertise, it still works to the film's benefit as we are given barely any details on the characters, it only makes the circumstances a lot more baffling as you are never sure who is really who they say they are.When a film tends to depend on visual effects, the movie usually suffers, however The Thing doesn't thanks to the talents of Rob Bottlin and while some see makeup effects as a branch of visual effects, there's no denying that Bottlin knocked it out of the park here by giving us some of the most impressive transmogrification effects in a horror movie with its vague designs, half-created human appearances glaringly balanced with wide sets of teeth, spider legs and durable tentacles. The creature effects here are absolutely fantastic and gut-churning, but aren't too gory or over-the-top unlike some other horror movies.As for the actors in The Thing, they all do a fine job and play their roles well but it's Kurt Russell and Keith David are the two actors who matter most. Kurt's low-key character of Macready is boundlessly watchable and more critically, realistic and Russell plays the boozy, courageous yet hesitant leader with zero difficulty while Keith David is wonderful as Childs. The final scene of the two sharing a bottle of whiskey is one of the most enduring endings in any movie.Definitely a movie worth seeking out.",

Its effects though seemingly aged are still terrifying for those who have not seen or do not know what to expect with this film. The feeling of isolation and suffocation grow with each passing min. of the film. The score of this film compliments that very real feeling of dread and suspense. Kurt Russell one of John Carpenters favorite cast-able actors does a terrific job as R.J. McReady, who seems to be the only one prepared for the terror that is The Thing. The fellow cast mates do a terrific job as well. Though some may argue that the effects have aged and what was once frightening now cheesy, but with a bit of suspended belief one can truly feel and see the films intention, to scare the hell out of you. Graphic and grotesque in its nature, and all done with physical effects which to me resonate a lot of charm and make the film a bit more real than just the standard CGI of today's film making techniques.

I still don't like Halloween though, I find it an ordeal to sit through.This on the other hand is pure brilliance. The story revolves around a group of American researchers on an Antartic research station. After rescuing a dog from a seemingly crazy bunch of Norwegians (or were they swedes? ;)) they start falling host to an alien being that can imitate anything it assimilates. Cue plenty of suspense, paranoia and gore.This film wouldn't have worked anywhere else. The sense of isolation and hopelessness adds to the claustrophobic horror of the film. The characters, especially Carpenter veteran Kurt Russell are fantastic. It may seem on the surface a simple horror film but its so open at the same time that you can read anything into a particular scene or conversation. You feel just as paranoid as the characters on screen. Its wonderfully done. Its a testament to the film that it is being so hotly debated 23 years after it was released. I'm still not quite sure who was who, even right at the end. Whether this was intentional on the filmmakers part or arose simply because of the nature of the story I really cant say but its a major part of the films appeal.The film is also well known for its gore and creature effects which are still fantastic even today. In fact in the wake of CGI snoozefests they can be appreciated even more. Some scenes such as the defibrillator scene are simply shocking upon first viewing.A lot of films seem to focus on one aspect of horror, whether it be gore, suspense or psychological.

Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well. The images, and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen.

The CAST for gosh sake! Okay, first of all Kurt Russell is a TOTAL bad ass as the leader vs. the creature among a bunch of guys encamped at a research outpost in Antarctica. But then here are only a handful of the veteran actor upper echelon who go to battle alongside Russell: Wilford Brimley (sans beard), Richard Dysart, David Clennon and Richard Masur. Hey, when you've got true pros like this workin' for ya the credibility quotient of any horror flick, hell, ANY flick at ALL, clicks on up the quality pole a couple of full notches at least.And there simply aren't enough superlatives to commend the absolutely astonishing job contributed by the special effects, visual effects and makeup crews here. Their cumulative brilliance had me constantly aghast at the abhorrently repulsive and terrifyingly petrifying shape-shifting monsters these folks so ingeniously conjured up for the exclusive purpose of completely grossing us the F--- out! Toss in the unsettlingly creepish music scored by Ennio Morricone and Carpenter has constructed one of the most near-perfect dread fests of all-time.I am not one to beg. However, PLEASE, if you've put off experiencing \"The Thing\" like yours truly had for so long, I PLEAD with you to watch it. And even if you like the film only half as much as me, that still means that you got a pretty stout kick in the butt out of the whole deal. And if you don't like it...well...then...perhaps that's \"the thing\" I just can't explain!",

Although I don't find The Thing to be as scary as many who have provided their reviews here, the film is an excellent sci-fi thriller.  If you want scary, rent the original Psycho by Hitchcock. \nCarpenter made his masterpiece with this movie.  All the other films he has done have disappointed me on some level, but not this one.  The Thing has just the right amount of humour mixed with intensity that I prefer and enjoy.  Carpenter's other films usually have a campy quality that is hard to sit through.  The Thing has a few holes in the idea that could have been clarified a little more.  **Possible Spoilers** For instance, when the Thing imitates a human does the person's memory and personality become altered or obliterated.  None of the characters ever brought this up which kind of boggled my mind.  Also the proliferation of dynamite and flame throwers at the camp was a bit much.  It looks like they were geared up for some kind of alien invasion (maybe Saddam of the South).  All in all though, this is a great film which I give a rating of 10 to because of the great direction, music and special effects.",

Both movies are triumphs of atmosphere, pacing and suspense, but the limitations set on filmmakers in the fifties forced Hawks' production to require much more of a reliance on suggestion and clever use of editing to bring its rarely seen monster to life.  Carpenter, known even then for his ability to scare without resorting to the graphic violence and gore most horror movies offered up, finally gave in to Hollywood's embracement of gore and filled his movie to vomiting with some of the most disgusting imagery ever seen in a major studio release.  However, unlike FRIDAY THE 13TH and other exploitation quickies, THE THING's effects were at least as frightening and nightmarish as they were gross, fit the intensity of the movie perfectly, and worked thematically to physically represent the decay and mutation that occurs within people when trust, friendship and security is destroyed.  Both movies are rich in substance and style, and would make a killer double feature.",

            "content": "The story is based on the novella 'Who Goes There' that was beautifully written by John W. Campbell. (This movie has nothing to do with the 'The Thing from Another world', 1951 which was just cheap 1950's scifi movie-mill pulp fiction fair.) Although the story in Campbell's book took place around 1920, John Carpenters 'The Thing', 1982 is an updated version with modern settings. The characters in this movie are well thought out. They come across as very believable, unlike most of the Hollywood flicks these days. They don't say stupid things or have witty comebacks every three seconds. Nobody is cracking jokes in this film. Humor is just a cheap dialog trick by writers who aren't intelligent enough to say anything important.  The characters in this film are much more true to life. This is the story about people at their best and worst, brought about by the most terrifying creature to grace the silver screen.The action sequences can be pretty graphic. Heck, lets not mince words. This film, uncut, probably has the most horrific scenes I have ever seen in a movie. Some people may not like it because of that. But it really does add to the story and is needed to show what the characters are going through. I probably wouldn't show this film to anyone under 15 or to my Grandma though. It's not for the timid. (Don't watch this film on public TV, they cut way too much out. Rent/buy the DVD.)I think those that complain of the slow spots in this film are just too used to the brainless action films of modern times (Chronicles of Riddick, T3, Matrix, ad infinitum). I like how the film slowly builds to a crescendo. It does have a few slow spots as it builds the storyline and expands the characters. But the slow spots are just setting you up for a triple whammy that will have you on the edge of your seat. It is just good suspense! It is the perfect mixture of talk and action that is rare in todays films.Whenever I see a horror/scifi film today this is the movie I compare it to. This film is the quintessential horror/scifi. This movie has it all: a monster that is really scary, good character development, great dialog, fantastic special effects that actually add to the story, and a plot that not only builds with time but is believable.

Set in 1982, a group of American scientists are chilling in the Antarctic and we have no idea what their mission is. What happens next is a pair of seemingly insane Norwegians appears at their base camp on a helicopter chasing a dog...yep a dog, weird ha? The Norwegians are killed and the dog is welcomed into the base of the Americans and this is where the fun starts. Some of the members fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or missing and find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians burned and of course take it back to their base. We found out that the Swedes...I mean Norwegians were chasing that dog as it is actually a shape-shifting alien organism that likes to assimilate with different organisms and manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims. In short it eats humans and imitates them as a perfect copy. This means that anyone could be the Thing and soon tensions and paranoia escalate.Now this flick is based on the story \"Who Goes There?\" by John W. Campbell Jr this movie is wow!! John Carpenter's deliver a timeless entertaining horror classic. The film is fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. Yes, the special graphics may seem outdated but common it's the 80s, the thing creature effects packs the punch and the old school effects are mind blowing even after over 30 plus years.As the crew get the hint that the Thing morphs in different forms, this delivers an uneasy vibe among the crew and you can feel the authentic chill and the sense of desperate isolation is massive. It's a brilliant paranoia piece where everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing and literally no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme and soon they ask themselves \"who is the Thing?\"The survivors are led by MacReady played by the awesome badass Kurt Russell who is outstanding in this film. He is a chess-playing, whisky drinking, cowboy-hatted helicopter pilot and is far too cool even for the cool winter. He is forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature which drives each man insane from paranoia. Russell delivers on all front and doesn't play your typical main hero - he is a just like the other men in his camp, paranoid and knows that he cannot leave the Thing run amuck on planet Earth.Carpenter masterfully orchestrates this horror flick by using the Antarctic nights, the self destructing mind and the claustrophobic confines along with the Thing enhances fear, tension and paranoia throughout the film along with nice twists and turns. A great timeless movie and the just like the ending very unpredictable overall 9/10.",

I have already watched it three times by now, in only two years (what is an unusual ratio for me personally) and it still is a great, horrifying experience. It is probably among my personal top three films of the master of horror, and there is almost nothing for me to hate about it, quite the contrary, with each watch I cherish it even more. You got a charismatic Kurt Russell, gradually losing his mind and like every other member of the team, being paranoid towards each and everyone. The best thing about it is that you cannot really tell who is an imitation and who is still human, because the film displays so many paradoxical hints that lead you into a totally wrong direction. To be honest, despite having watched it three times and paying close attention to it, I still don't know if the two survivors are in fact human or just alien imitation, and that makes this movie so utterly enjoyable. It is the perfect mix of gross gore and practical effects, distrust and terror and somehow even snow western, a formula that is currently making the game \"Among Us\" so popular. And the bone-chilling score of the late Ennio Morricone makes it perfect. I love this film so much and I think every horror fan should have seen at least once in a lifetime.",

The haunting music and ominous sound design are cherries on top.Nevertheless, the special effects are the main event of The Thing. The grotesque alien transformations are both horrifying and incredible to witness. They are stunning specifically because they are done practically. In an era before CGI could do anything and everything, physical craftsmanship constructed these mesmerizing effects. Each shot presents a new contraption that highlights a step in the metamorphosis.

The two movies have an entirely different setting and atmosphere, but share the same simple structure: a group of humans ends up being stuck in a confined space as they are chased by an unknown alien entity. However, the \"Thing\" manages to become something more than a beautifully designed hungry monster: it's a threat with no discernible appearance, as it has the ability to imitate the organisms it consumes and blend in with its prey. This allows Carpenter to convey his trademark cynical, nihilistic view of humanity, focusing on how easily a team of highly unlikeable characters can fall apart as they slowly get consumed by their distrust and paranoia. The \"Thing\" has no evil intentions and is just trying to survive, but it won't take much to the humans to end up turning against each other.It must be said that the film takes a damn long time to get to the point, but Carpenter's \"chilly\" cinematography and slow camerawork manage to build the story's tension and keep us craving for more flamethrower bursts to warm up the atmosphere. As mentioned, the \"Thing\" never shows its true self, but in return offers a lot of grotesque \"transformation\" sequences that managed to turn a mild psychological horror into a true cult film. The practical effects surely aged a bit, but the art direction and design are so over the top and visionary that the final result still holds incredibly well.On a side note, the film is supposed to be a remake of Christian Nyby's \"The Thing from Another World\", but is actually based on the science fiction short story \"Who Goes There?\" (which also inspired Nyby's film). Other than the title font, the two movies are very little in common. Just think that \"The Thing from Another World\" cannot change appearance, is always recognizable, and gets its ass kicked by a cohesive team of heroes.",

Twelve men living in the Antarctic are confronted by a mysterious and terrifying \"Thing\" from outer space. The Thing it is revealed, crash-landed 100,000 years ago and frozen, was dug up by a team of Norwegians who allow it to thaw with disastrous consequences. After arriving in the American camp in the guise of a dog, the Thing goes after Kurt Russell and his comrades, killing and replacing them, one by one. Who is human? Who is the Thing? The air of paranoia and suspense are practically palpable in a movie that if it does not scare you, then you are already dead. I love this movie. I watch it about once a month. Based on the short story,\"Who goes There?\" by John W. Campbell Jr., John Carpenter's picture has a group of regular guys thrust into highly irregular circumstances, threatened by a creature that can imitate exactly any living thing it touches. An all male cast and claustrophobic sets are a few of the unique aspects of the production. I see something new every time I watch it. Wilford Brimley is cast as Blair, the scientist who discovers the true nature of the Thing and decides to save the world,isolating the research station by destroying their transportation and radio equipment. Beautifully shot in Canada and Alaska and using then (1982) state of the art special effects, The Thing is the perfect movie to curl up with on a cold Winter's night. The characters are entirely believable and their sense of isolation and panic are easily felt by the viewer. Beware, there are some squeam inducing scenes with plenty of alien goo and guts. I highly recommend this movie for all those who love suspense and horror. I think it is also some of Kurt Russell's best work.",

As if he would casually destroy property like that when he's got so little to pass the time with. Ah, but little did we know.....It's hard to believe this notorious el floppo is nearly twenty years old now but it I remember it was rather fascinating at the time. And there was a memorably silly hat, too. The science is dumb. How can an organism imitate a life form exactly and still retain it's own original identity and intelligence? If the thing's cells have changed into a dog's, how can it suddenly change into one of a million different life forms from a million planets at a moments notice? Where are those cells stored after a perfect simulation? And if it is a perfect simulation it should die if it has a heart attack in human form, not keep going and changing. Blair trashes the radio room in a fit of pique shouting, \"no dog makes it a hundred miles in this terrain. No, that thing wanted to be US!\" But why couldn't the thing turn into a more weather resistant monster out of it's million life forms rather than trying to be a warm blooded mammal that freezes to death easily?Carpenter was once a master of suspense, but this film marked the turning point and is curiously flat at exploiting the possible tensions between the men. It looks like it had been a difficult and troubled shoot and the script does not help. My favourite cringe-making line: \"Do you buy any of this Voodoo bulls**t, Blair?\" For an intelligent creature, the thing's behaviour is baffling. If that shadow early on in the film when the dog is stalking the rooms was Norris and by his hair shape it looked like him, why didn't he take over McCready and Doc when they went off together on the second trip to the Norwegian camp? It was a perfect opportunity. Likewise, he is left alone with Chiles and Gary who are tied to a sofa and at his mercy. He could have taken them over through their faces without damaging their clothes like he did to Gary in the final scene in the boiler room. The others were outside in the snow so they wouldn't have heard the screams. Also, Norris was given the early opportunity to be the leader but inexplicably turned it down. It would have given the thing a perfect chance to divide and conquer. Other daft moments include Blair building a mini saucer out of chopper spare parts. As if. Also the stupid moment when a blood sample suddenly acquires a mouth and shrieks. The blood on the floor runs away squeaking like mice as if blood has 'brains' as well as vocal cords. The average Bugs Bunny cartoon has more credibility. And did you notice that at the climax in the boiler room, the thing shoots up through the floor and instead of instantly attacking McCready it just sits their showing off a few heads, allowing McCready time to blow it up? And they wonder why films bomb. Having an ending that makes the audience feel cheated doesn't help, they like to think all that effort wasn't in vain but I rather liked not knowing if one of them was the thing.Despite all that it's still goofy fun and Carpenter has that ability to tap into that unnerving satanic atmosphere of his. Anyway, if you hate this review you can always console yourself with these words:\"Are you going to listen to Gary? I mean, he could be one of those things!\"",

            "content": "John Carpenter can be regarded as an enigma in American cinema. Admired as one of the leading horror practitioners of the post-Star Wars era, his subsequent output since the mid-80s far from reflect the brilliant filmmaking skills he once wielded. Carpenter regards The Thing as the first of his 'Apocalypse Trilogy' together with Prince Of Darkness (1987) and They Live (1988). In a morbid way, it is perhaps an apt description for a filmmaker whose incredible slide from being lauded as an influential horror master to a run-of-the-mill director of forgettable junk is nothing short of, well, apocalyptic.It is best to look at The Thing as the last of Carpenter's 'Great Horror Trilogy' which includes Halloween (1978) and The Fog (1980). The sudden, inexplicable loss of ability thereafter to even create averagely decent genre pictures is mysterious, and I shall leave it at that. The Thing is science-fiction horror in the mould of Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) but it is set on Earth in the Antarctic continent. Written by Bill Lancaster who loosely based his screenplay on John W. Campbell's story Who Goes There?, The Thing is also an (even better) remake of Howard Hawks' The Thing From Another World (1951).Several men working at a remote research station discovers an alien buried in the snow, or what is left of the alien's imprint in the snow. Now unfrozen, the alien enters their facility in the most unlikeliest (but later quite obvious) of means, especially after the realization that it can change its identity by taking over the bodies of living organisms begins to send shockwaves down the twelve-men team. Right from the start, Carpenter builds a sense of isolation and gloom with wide, sweeping shots of the vast, barren, icy landscape as a chopper flies above it.Slowly, paranoia takes over when the alien starts to attack and imitate some of the men. Guessing games are played and mutual trust becomes a rare commodity. While Alien employs the 'less is more' technique to frighten audiences, The Thing is the direct opposite. Carpenter and his crew of visual and makeup effects artists bring the terror right-in-your-face via some of the most grotesque images ever conceived. Short of describing how nightmarish they are, these images could be imagined as a cross between David Cronenberg (The Fly, 1986; Dead Ringers, 1988) and Sam Raimi (Evil Dead, 1982; Evil Dead II, 1987), a fusion of surrealistic violence, and bodily invasion gore which are hallmarks of '80s horror.If there is a flaw to the film, it is the lack of character development of the supporting roles. This comes as a result of having too many characters (twelve!), more so than from a weak screenplay. It seems like who lives or dies is unimportant because first, the film does not intend to work (other than that of fear) on our pathos, and second, the deaths of these characters (oxymoronically ugly and beautiful) are excuses to raise the bar for cinematic horror to artistic heights. Carpenter could have tightened the film up with fewer supporting characters, so that each could be given the chance to match up (and play along) to Kurt Russell's excellent performance, giving the film an 'acting balance' akin to an ensemble cast rather than Russell and eleven extras.Carpenter, who usually scores his own films, pushes music composition duties to Ennio Morricone whose minimalist soundscape accompanied by a thumping beat successfully help to force an uneasy atmosphere of existential dread upon the viewer. The Thing is a milestone in horror cinema (that I will not argue against). However, I feel it is not the masterpiece that many have made it out to be. But then again, who could ever forget what Carpenter has achieved here? SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",

I'm not sure, but it seems that when the word \"something\" is used, for me it is always associated with this horror film directed by John Carpenter. Cold, ice, and burning bodies immediately pop up in the brain. I saw the film when I was still in elementary school. He is deeply embedded in my memory with vivid negative images, terrifying shots, violent fights. And to this day, the film is remembered with a kind of chill on my back.I recently found out that \"Something\" took John Campbell's story \"Who Goes\" as the primary source. A worthy source of inspiration, which was masterfully revealed in an independent work with the help of the brilliant play of the actors and the work of the screenwriters and director.The atmosphere of the film is quite gloomy: snow, night, the station, enclosed spaces and a killer among them. A great tie that makes you pay attention to the screen to find out what happens next. You can see from the first frames that the stakes are very high. Something from another world is able to imitate other beings, it is much stronger than humans, its goal is obviously to take over our world.And a handful of polar explorers are trying to take control of the situation. It's interesting to watch these people. How do they build relationships, who takes the initiative into their own hands, for whom decision-making is unbearable, and who is ready to take such responsibility for themselves. Carpenter perfectly shows the relationship of people caught in a deadly situation. Who will be able to show themselves as a leader? Kurt Russell's hero, of course. He is remembered better than the others. Especially with a flamethrower at the ready.The theme of the alien invasion of Earth seems to be always popular. This film perfectly reveals the negative-terrifying possibility of such colonization of the planet. No matter how much humanity would like new discoveries and contacts with unknown civilizations, it is worth remembering (this film is an example of that) that guests can be very dangerous. I think that this theme runs through the whole narrative like a red thread.The technical component looks pretty cool to this day. Even if computer technologies were not developed at that time, which abound in many films today. The monsters that appear in the frame turned out to be very convincing. They are creepy, nasty and disgusting. They frighten, make you nervous and worry. Isn't that the main purpose of a horror movie? I think it is.The film \"Something\" smartly conveys the oppressive atmosphere, the intensity between people who found themselves one-on-one with the horror of the unknown, questions of trust, if you don't already know whether a friend is in front of you or a monster. The film today will make you afraid, will be remembered, will cause emotions of fear, which it is designed to extract from the depths of the soul.9 out of 10.",

I am also quite impressed by the visual effects used smartly and only when required. Acting could have been a lot better though. Set in Antarctica, the movie starts with a Norwegian member of a different station chasing a dog on his helicopter and in the act ventures into the American station's territory and injures one of the members while fully absorbed in his mission. They put him down, take the dog and decides to investigate what is going on in their camp. When they realize that a shape shifting Alien is among them consuming and imitating one crew member at a time, they stop trusting each other and more so themselves. The starting sequence is eerie that pans out quite leisurely with simple yet terrific background score. The build-up to the Thing could have been a little more progressive like in 'Alien' than one guy listing down what all it is capable of just by examining it's blood sample. Where the drama triumphs is the tension between the characters to trust each other than the fear of the Thing itself. It does have innumerable logical loop holes but clever enough screenplay that puts them on the background. There isn't enough emotion captured be that of fear or disappointment of not be able to make it back home. Some terrific scenes to look out for - 1. The dogs scared to death when the Thing put in their cage transforms for the very first time. 2. The starting sequence. 3. Some fantastic visual effects for the time - a man's head parting from the body developing spider-like legs and crawling off. 4. When the Thing transforms while all the crew members are tied to a bench. It may not live up to your expectation if you believe in all the hype around it. But with smart visual effects and leveraging on the drama potential the plot had - it is a decent horror movie.",

Entirely different is this movie. The effects are ok (probably quite good for the time), however, the story is completely relying on the shock effects derived from the way \"the Thing\" kills the crew. Otherwise, there is no atmosphere, no tension, NOTHING. Even despite Ennio Morricone being the composer of this movie, I am wondering if there is any scene where music is properly used or even creates tension.

Going in completely blind is one of the most tense, uneasy experiences you will have watching a movie.I urge you to go into this film without knowing, well, anything so I'm keeping this review short in order to reveal as little as possible.What I will say though is that the best practical effects and creature design I have ever seen is in this movie, the thing is just... Awesome I don't know what else to say. They're gory, scary and impressive, they hold up better than movies released 10 years ago. Really they're that good. Let's just all agree now that if it wasn't for Rob Bottin the thing would not have been anywhere near as good. If it weren't for such phenomenal creatures none of the deaths and the ending wouldn't feel so satisfying and more importantly, important, these deaths mean something, something awful has happened.Some other things I liked were the characters who all feel like real people, this is down to fantastic writing, great performances and John Carpenter's direction. Set design is fantastic, you can choose being in the cramped station with the other people, not being able to trust them, or, being out in the infinite plains of Antarctica freezing to death no doubt, the set's really add to the feel of the film. Ennio Morricone's score, I don't even need to say anything else. The whole plot and character motivations actually make sense, a rare occurrence in horror films. The story is very compelling in the thing, the mystery is perfectly set up right away with a breathtaking cold open. The story isn't even necessary about the thing, it's about identity, how you can lose trust in people you once trusted, it's about how it feels to be completely isolated, it's about how different people act when facing life threatening dangers, knowing that they will most likely die.The thing is one of my favourite, one of the best horror films ever.

So after playing the game (which I enjoyed) I asked for the film on DVD for Christmas. So, two days ago, I received it. And last night I watched it.It was very good. I really enjoyed it, sadly, however, my knowledge of the game meant that I already knew what it was about and what happened in the end. But apart from that.Special note to the start. Very spooky, eerie opening. Just 4 sounds for about 4 minutes. The sounds of: the helicopter, the gun, the running dog and the \"Boom Boom Boom\" of the music, really sets the tone for the rest of the film. Up there with my favourite openings to films (including Apocalypse Now).A very nice, slow starting 30 minutes. Just showing the characters, and the quiet threat that the huskie represented. Then, from there, apart from a few short 5 min gaps. It's all gore, which is what we expect from the man who made Halloween.What else, the setting, good choice. The vast, snowy wastes of antarctica. I think that had this film been made today, it would have been set in a city, which would have been a mistake. As setting it in Antarctica meant two things. 1: The Thing had nowhere to hide. 2: The men had nowhere to run. Meaning it had to be destroyed. It also allowed for some very nice long shots of the buildings and vehicles contrasting against the nice, white snow.Some chillingly realistic FX in this. *SPOILER* When the things head comes off, watching the neck stretch and tear did make my stomach turn. *END SPOILER* This film is now among two (alongside 2001) that have made me realise that computer-generated monsters and props aren't always needed to make something believable.And finally, a horror film without a woman to hold it up. No offense to the ladies out there. But when a female is in a horror film, it's usually for a love interest, which means scenes that stop the pace of the whole picture, removing your interest and making you impatient. Nice then, that this was a welcome relief from the old clich\u00e9.The ending was good, *SPOILER* A nice little exchange of dialogue showing that (in my opinion anyway) how they could be things and not know it, that the thing was maybe biding it's time, remaining dormant inside of them.*END SPOILER* Disagree if you want.

I was excited to see this movie- that was for sure The premise to 'The Thing' sounds very interesting with a shape shifting alien who duplicates and shape shifts into humans picking off members of an expedition at Antarctica. I'll tell you why I was interested. Monster horror movies such as Alien are just amazing and so I was excited for this. Being trapped in Antarctica is perhaps the best place to be trapped and John Carpenter's suspense added in Halloween and absolute minimal level of gore made his original Halloween a frightening movie. So, it was hard for me not to have high expectations The acting by the entire cast is very good mainly Kurt Russel who shines as MacReady. The music was great but to me, not as frightening or anywhere near as iconic as the Halloween theme. The story was as I said...just an awesome premise for a horror. The writing and directing were great. The movie falls a bit in terms of suspense as I found the movie very suspense-less and very \"not so scary\" The effects have certainly been outdated but that isn't a flaw considering the movie came out 30 years ago. I felt that during many circumstances that the suspense level could've easily been risen and would've had me far more interested in the story. There were lots of good stuff such as the ending which like 'Halloween' is an amazing ending.The movie never really frightened me. Some times, I found the characters and the story falling away from me. My expectations should've been too high as I constantly found myself wondering if any real suspense would be built into the movie. Most of the suspense was held back to the last ten minutes or so which was a disappointment I however believe, that this review will not be one that most agree with and it is far more likely that you enjoy it a whole heap more than I did.",

I'm thinking of Assault on Precinct 13 (drama); The Fog (Ghost/thriller); Halloween (slasher/terror); Escape from New York (Sci Fi/thriller) and of course The Thing (Pure Horror);although ever since then he seems to have lost his magical touch. For a start, the original Thing from the 50s is a better movie because it relies on tension rather than out & out gore. In addition The Thing has been compared to Alien, but again the latter film has the edge because the gore is limited to our imagination while focusing on what's-around-the-corner scenario.Having said that, the story & characterisation are both very good. Russell seems to be enjoying himself as the anti-hero, more so than he did in the Escape films.Rob Bottin's special effects are truly amazing pre-CGI, and all the better for it. Although on the down side, I felt Ennio Morricone was the wrong choice to write the score - far too understated & amateurish. Morricone works better with orchestral scores and not messing around on synthesizers and samplers.The ending too was poor. Too many loose ends and disappearing characters. Bit of an anti-climax for a Carpenter film  then, but is still recommended especially in DVD with widescreen pro-logic.***/*****",

They trouble is they don't know who is the alien, and who is still human...\"The Thing\" is done very well. There's a great desolate feeling to the Antarctic wastes - ably captured by John Carpenter's wide opening shots of the glacial landscape. The actual bases is given a nice claustrophobic feel too - no room is very large, and when there's a crowd of people there the screen reflects the intense pressure. The plot isn't really there, but that's okay next to the creepy on-edge factor you're given as you wonder who is the alien currently (I certainly jumped a fair few times in the movie). Indeed the plot centres around one person-being-revealed, and then the team of men shrinking and wondering who is next. The moments of terror are helped by lashings of gore but gore that actually disturbs, being so visceral and alien, as opposed to being laughable. The Thing is a great little creature and some neat effects are used in its creation.The acting is perfunctory, as you'd expect. Kurt Russell's character, the pilot who is the star, is played with a little edge so that he isn't the all round nice guy but someone willing to kill off anyone to ensure he survives. This leads up to a great little ending which leaves with a question mark that - thankfully - wasn't cashed in upon with a tepid sequel.\"The Thing\" is great gory sci-fi horror. It's deliciously paranoid and can genuinely make you jump, as well let your stomach churn.

Since the alien can look like anyone, the rapidly dwindling group comes to realize that no one can trust anyone else.  Kurt Russell gives a strong performance as the station's helicopter pilot. He is ably supported by Wilford Brimley, T.K.  Carter, and Donald Moffatt, who stand out among the supporting cast.  Carpenter returns to the kind of ambiguity at the end of the film which made the last scene of \"Halloween\" so powerful.This movie was made in a different era than the Howard Hawks version;  it's not surprising that it carries different baggage, and aims to transmit a completely different message.  While both versions are worth watching, this one is far scarier, both on the \"gross-out\" and the psychological level.",

            "content": "John Carpenter takes horror to a new level by thrusting the viewer into the bleak, frigid expanse of the Antarctic, where an American expeditionary research team encounters the unexpected.... a rescue of a sled dog pursued by a pair of Norwegian paramilitary types from their camp miles away. In so doing, the Americans unwittingly provide a safe harbor for what turns out to be a hideous alien creature capable of assuming any life form in close proximity to it- in this case, the Husky.Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley and Richard Dysart head a cast of scientists, and support personnel who are yanked out of their sheer daily boredom and cabin fever to confront the Thing.Problem is,WHO is the Thing, and WHO is the genuine human? A bitter battle for survival ensues,complete with the dark paranoia and exhaustion caused by each of the men not trusting each other.Carpenter follows John Campbell Jr.'s short story, \"Who Goes There?\" far more closely than Howard Hawks did in the original 1951 release. By doing so, Carpenter was allowed to capitalize on 1982 special effects  in order to portray the alien at its goriest splendor. Rob Bottin's latex and mechanical effects are superb, and will still evoke a sense of disgust from even the more seasoned horror movie buff.The sense of distrust, vulnerability and anxiety mounts among the research staff as they try to figure out how to bring this perfect imitator out into the open... before they are all consumed by It.Definitely graphic. Definitely claustrophobic. Definitely one of Carpenter's best films. It will leave you trembling in your bed at night, whispering, \"who goes there?\"",

            "content": "John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" is my second favorite movie by him with the original \"Halloween\" being my favorite. The movie is filled with paranoia and isolation. The pace is a little slow sometime, but for the most part it moves effectively, starting at the beginning with a scene of nothing but white snow and mountains. After a moment you hear a helicopter and shooting, and suddenly a Husky comes into view, running from the people in the helicopter who are trying to kill it. I watched this movie when I was young, and seeing any kind of dog being shot at made me dislike the people in the helicopter. The dog runs to another base where he is immediately saved and the Norwegians in the helicopter meet there demise with the helicopter blowing up and one of them being shot between the eyes. I almost cheered at seeing this. However, not long after, the dog is found creeping around the base as if stalking, and suddenly alarm bells went off in my head. Something was definitely not right with this innocent looking dog, and I began to understand why those Norwegians might have been trying to kill it. Soon after we find out why, and suddenly all heck breaks loose because that innocent looking dog was really an imitation of something much worse. A thing from outer space that could imitate any living creature. I really don't have to say more, but this movie, which scared the crap out of me as a child, has some of the most gut wrenching and horrifying special effects ever. They still hold up well today and out do much of the CGI which now dominates films. Carpenter has once again shown how good he is at directing horror films, and Rob Bottin shows us more horrifying make-up effects then what he gave us in \"The Howling.\" The sad thing though is I could never warm to any of the characters. MacCready, as played by Kurt Russel, was the only one I ever really cared about. The others were very cold, almost robotic. And the way they all seemed to go off so easily knowing that they could be imitated made them a little implausible as well. Other than that, I would put this movie in my top 15 horror films. It would be in top 5 easily if the characters had all been more interesting, but the 1982 version of \"The Thing\" is, in my opinion, still a better movie than the 1951 original.",

The nightmarish body props coupled with artfully selected sound effects put this film solidly in the \"hard R\" category -- and my younger brother and my cousin's squeamish reactions bore that out. Unfortunately, at the time, the critics couldn't see past this, and The Thing was panned and then forgotten.But 20+ years later, the violence scale has slipped enough that when you get past the ooze and the blood and the ripping teeth, you're left with a model of paranoia-packed, \"who-can-you-trust?\" invasion-type Sci-Fi. The cast's performances and the taut dialogue really string you out then leave you hanging -- in a great way. And Ennio Morricone's understated score perfectly seals the deal. Carpenter should have called him up when he started production of \"The Mouth of Madness.\"If you're looking for a good Cold War alien yarn, and you want something a little harder-edged than \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" but didn't enjoy the remake, give \"The Thing\" a spin.

By fear I mean the fear each of the characters is experiencing, not necessarily the audience's fear (although this *is* a scary movie).  As in a lot of Carpenter's movies, the premise and tone is very Lovecraftian, which involves a lot of hinting at horrors past, and horrors to come.The story is adapted from a short narrative called Who Goes There? that was made into a movie by Hawks in the fifties (I have not been able to find a copy of Who Goes There? but Carpenter's version is supposedly more faithful to the original concept).  The idea is that a creature has gotten into an arctic research station and is able to become any other organism there, whether dog, human, or something kinda between the two.  That's all you need to know.  We watch as the men at the station try to come to grips with their situation, controlling their fear while trying to decide which one of them is the creature, and most importantly, how to kill it so it doesn't reach civilization and conquer Earth.

The 'serious' parts were cheesy and the 'scary' parts were funny. The effects can be excused as it is an older film, but I was not scared once in this film.

Those who are suspected as being infected are not them and only realize who it is when the going gets tough.McReady is the only one that can keep the crew together, but they eventually turn on him, too.

Eventually, McReady ends up facing the \"Blair Thing\" and kills it with dynamite.While recovering from exhaustion outside the station as it burns, Childs appears and McReady is skeptical of him. When McReady asks where he's been; Childs says he went outside to go after Blair and got lost in the storm. McReady is thinking he is \"The Thing\" since no moisture breathing is seen in his breathe in the cold. McReady gives him a liquor bottle for Childs to drink. However, this bottle is suppose to be a \"Molotov Cocktail,\" which Blair drinks readily. McReady chuckled and realizes who he is. Both realize there is nothing they can do due to the cold weather.The issue I have with the ending is that if Childs is \"The Thing,\" he would not have an earring nor a gold tooth (recall the 2011 movie where it was shown The Thing cannot replicate metal).

The scientists spending their time at the houses in the Antarctic shoot the offender. But, why was he shooting at the dog? Well, apparently some creature was unearthed from the ice (or something like that) and came to terrorize the humans. This is no ordinary creature though. It can change its shape into the victims that it has killed. (Does that make sense?) If it kills somebody, it can look like them, and possibly speak like them! It sounds pretty similar to the villain in Terminator 2: Judgment Day! Well, if you have heard of the monster, than it becomes way too obvious about why the man was shooting at the dog. But, don't worry. To counter the predictability of the first scene, \"John Carpenter's The Thing\" brings many moments that are, well\u0085 not as predictable. These are the good moments. These are also the moments when the audience suspects that one of the people was infected by the creature, and therefore, the audience is subjected to guessing who it is.While the film is fairly un-predictable, these moments have their flaws. The audience is left guessing whether the person is Childs, Blaire, Clark or somebody else. This would be nice if we actually knew who they were! The characters hardly stand out from one another, and there are just way too many of them! How is the audience supposed to follow? This leads to confusion, which also makes the film less enjoyable to me. Plus, every moment of thrill is way too short for my enjoyment. This adds to the displeasure as confusion and boredom invade my enjoyment.But, the moments of thrill, while short, are fun. No, they're not so thrilling that you hold you're breath and refuse to stop watching, but they are pretty fun. After all, it is directed by John Carpenter, who made Halloween and The Fog. If you are a hardcore fan of thriller and horror films, or a hardcore fan of gore films, you should probably pick this one up.7/10 Good: Thrilling movie, with nice twists here and there.Bad: Confusion, boredom, short thrills and way too many characters",

Only for the members at the science research plant to investigate their camp finding the remains of that alien attack. The overall features of the alien creature's capabilities gradually emerging made the film that more gripping, only films like that of Alien were able to undertake. What was more appealing was the fact the alien can mimic its host turning the film also into a thriller as well, the blood test scene was legendary. The films ending was also great that it left the members in circumstances that you are unable to predict what happens.What deserves great appraisal is the special effects that were able to be performed, 25 years later and they still look realistic.

Campbell's story 'Who Goes There?' \u2013 'The Thing from Another World', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and 'Alien' - I sat on my couch to watch 'The Thing' with a bit of skepticism. However, as I knew that John Carpenter is a cult director in the horror sphere, I was definitely ready for a good scare, filled with a decent level of blood and gore, and maybe not too much of a genuine story.The first thing that the viewer sees is a spaceship traveling in the galaxy near Earth. Fast- forward a few hundred years: Antarctica, exactly in the middle of nowhere. In the enormous amount of pure-white snow, we observe a helicopter coming in the distance, trying to shoot a dog. But why do they want to catch an innocent creature so badly? That we actually won't find out (yet\u0085), as the dog runs towards an American station, and after a chaotic couple of minutes and a few gunshots (and dead Norwegians), it is finally safe in the arms of confused Americans.This is the moment when all the fun starts. It's like a game of cat and mice between the 'thing' (no one knows what it truly is, as it is able to morph and take shape of any organism that is nearby) and all the researches. This insatiable creature is able to thaw out at any moment, killing a person, absorbing him and then imitating in the most perfect manner. Nobody can be trusted anymore. The people become overly suspicious and paranoid. And up until the very last moments there aren't any special ways of finding out who is human and who isn't. Unfortunately, the main drawbacks of the movie are the superficial characterization and highly unreal behavior of all the frightened men. Even though they realize that they are in grave danger, they sometimes act as if their main purpose of being inside the base was to actually get attacked from behind and murdered. What's more, at times it's even hard to grasp how many people are actually dead and it somehow takes some of the fun away. Carpenter didn't put a huge emphasis on the portrayal of his characters; he much rather wanted to astound us with the very realistic special and visual effects, which are actually quite scary and gruesome. I mean, even though there are some terrifying scenes of gore and pure repulsion, they probably won't be too expressive for regular viewers (or will they?), and exciting enough to stimulate the blood lust of all the hardcore horror fans. Great music score by Ennio Morricone only increases the mood and the overwhelming suspense of the story.However, even though it has some minor flaws, it still is a great and thrilling picture, and it stand out from the huge crowd of many dull and muddling horrors that came out in the 1980's. Dare to watch The Thing, and it will certainly satisfy all your bloodiest desires.",

So watching director John Carpenter take a glorified crap on it does not rank highly on my entertainment scale, but alas that is exactly what he does. Amazingly this fetid remake has some sort of cult following that has developed over the years, but I am at a loss at to why, unless they are gore-seekers salivating over the next slimy effect to splash across the screen.I gather that this film version adheres more closely to the source novel \"Who Goes There?\", but that only serves to show that original filmmakers Howard Hawks, Christian Nyby and company knew what they were doing when they abandoned it. Other than the bleak snowbound setting, there is nothing especially notable or compelling about this film. Fans seem to be reading much more depth into it than ever appears on screen or in the writing. The \"are you human or a monster\" bit had already been done to death long before this film hit the screen and was fully realized in far better films, primarily Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which had also received an effective and chilling modernization just a few years previously.A big part of the problem with focusing on this paranoia approach is that in the Invasion films, the characters were developed capably and were sufficiently sympathetic enough to warrant concern when they succumbed to the Body Snatchers. Here, the characters are humorless, dull and unsympathetic. We cannot tell who is human or alien because none of them seemed particularly human from the start. Whereas the Hawks original populated the base with a believable, appealing and often amusing gallery of people to be terrorized, Carpenter provides us with paper-thin monuments to testosterone that test patience. None of them are likable or worth investing much concern in. Perfectly solid actors like Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat, etc., have little to do but glare at each other and pose in manly fashion.Lead Kurt Russell can be a solid actor as well, but director Carpenter never seemed able to bring out his best, eliciting performances that either seem to be tiresomely buffoonish (Big Trouble in Little China) or a catatonic rendition of a low-wattage Clint Eastwood (here and Escape from New York).With the story and characters completely underwhelming, Carpenter tries to make up the difference with a repellent cabinet of curiosity gore effects that do nothing but demonstrate that energy that should have been directed to more meaningful areas was squandered in trying to make the viewer puke. The budget for blood, pus, ooze, slime and innards must have been astronomical.Even worse, Carpenter's direction itself is inert. The film has virtually no suspense or forward momentum - it lurches like a drunk from one set piece to the next, scored by yet another one of Carpenter's overly synthesized dirges. I cannot recall one extended suspense sequence in the entire film that raises the pulse even minimally. And anyone waiting for a blow-out climax will be surprised by the vague, low-key final moments in which Carpenter caps the film. A more unsatisfying climax is hard to imagine.The film also provides evidence of why it is a blessing that Carpenter has refrained from directing for a number of years. After first-rate work on the deservedly legendary Halloween and the underrated The Fog, Carpenter repeatedly provided ambitious concepts done in by almost spectacularly lackluster execution, to the point where it seemed as though a rank amateur was responsible. The Thing and Escape from New York certainly marked the beginning of this decline.Misguided fans like to say that this film was overlooked in 1982 (like the similar Blade Runner) because it was lost in the success of E.T. Sad to tell them, but Blade Runner had a following as early as 1982. The Thing, at the time, was a box office dud and critically dismissed as a botched remake that functioned as little more than a effects freak show. That description still holds true several decades later. Genre fans can keep this stinkbomb, I will head back to the company of original and its much-deserved classic status.",

John Carpenter has managed to make a perfect film: the suspense is beautifully created, ramped up sharply and yet not ridiculously, the blood doesn't run ahead of the plot, but doesn't fall behind either, and the effects are great! This is the type of film that proves that CGI is nothing compared to good old models and sets.The acting deserves special mention. Kurt Russel was terrific in this film as a grim, rather solitary man with the quite apt name MacReady (kudos to Carpenter if he put that in on purpose). Hallahan, Brimley, and Carter are perfect as rather worn and rugged researchers and essential people on a small, isolated Antarctic station.As for the Thing... well, it's beyond description. Robert Frost and Shakespeare himself would fall short of a satisfactory description of the Thing. You have to see it to believe it.A definite 10/10.

Kurt Russell as Macready is incredibly believable and excellent in his role as the boozing helicopter pilot. Macready isn't so keen on taking the lead but reluctantly assumes control of the group. Mac has accepted what's happened while the other guys are going nuts although he is terrified he is courageous as well. Mac is a realist when he thinks something has to be done he just does it and his prepared.Mac is someone we all want in situations like this.I also want to give credit to the actors Keith David,Richard Masur,Donald Moffat,Wilford Brimley,David Clennon,Thomas Waites,Chris Hallahan,and Richard Dysart etc were all excellent and believable as the men facing the terrifying situation.I liked the way the film developed  seeing the 12 men portraying their fear and paranoia of each other and suspecting Mac could be \"The Thing.\" Even though the film failed at the box office it's now gained recognition and a huge cult following among fans and it's well deservedI was only 2 years old when this film came out but I've seen it now and I've really grown to like this film with every viewing. I guess this film is shocking for the very first time you see it but its a great film and worth watching.The Thing is a serious film with very little comedy but there are some really great scenes, which made me laugh.The horror films now have changed so much that a look so unrealistic.The Thing is a classic and a sheer masterpiece and 20 years later it's still one of the best horror films ever made.",

The acting is also fantastic, along with a setting and surroundings that contribute massively to making the plot seem more real. This is a real treat for the senses! Just back to Kurt, I hold my hands up as by far the best movie he has ever done- portrays an absolute hero as hero's should be- drinking whiskey and having a no-nonsense approach to dealing out blows to the aliens.The other excellent thing about this movie is the special effects- some of the effects in this 80s film STILL blow modern day computer generated graphics out of the water. True, some are less convincing but overall I feel the blood, gore and detail is much truer using these old methods.Don't bother going to watch the modern-day sequel, it will only disappoint, just be glad if you have seen this movie that you were lucky enough to watch an absolute game-changer and make sure you show it to your kids......I must have seen it when I was about 9 and didn't trust our dog again for years!!! 10 out of 10.",

I am very glad I did because it is a tremendously entertaining horror movie from the master of the genre John Carpenter. The movie concerns a bunch of research scientists who investigate an isolated place and find some kind of deformed creature and take it for research hoping to gain recognition for their discovery. What they don't know however is that the creature is very much alive and it's not long before it starts taking over their bodies. It is then upto the crew to decide which one of them has been taken over by the creature by taking a series of tests cue bags of tension. This could have been simply awesome but it ends up being just great. The problem is not the script or the climax but the fact that it bears quite a bit of resemblance to Alien(my favourite horror movie). For example in The Thing the scene where The Thing comes out of one the scientists body is similar to that famous John Hurt scene in Alien. One interesting point is that in John Carpenter's Halloween the original version of The Thing is playing in the background. Despite it's minor flaws The Thing is a pretty great monster movie and one of the best horror movies of the 80's.",

In 1976 Stuart Cohen decided to remake the film. It is believed that it inspired the making of the 1956 and 1978 \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers \" and 1979 \"The Alien\" as well as the 1981 \"The thing\" . Since that time a whole plethora of Science Fiction horror films have been spawned using the same theme. Al;though initially a box office failure it became a cult classic and subsequently evergreen profit maker.Since many great reviews have already be made of this classic film I merely endorsing all reviews and fans of this great classic Science fiction film.The film begins with a Helicopter chase of a lone dog in the Arctic winter near a scientific research station \"No 31\". The crew at \"31\" witness the crash of the Helicopter and adopt the dog. They investigate and find a strangely mutilated body and another base nearby.Gradually the \"31\" crew lead by R' J. McReady played by Kurt Russel discover the dog is infected with some strange alien virus that attacks its host and then transforms itself into a copy of the victim. This film effects were almost unique for the time as there was no CGI both Albert Whitlock with special photography effects Rob Bottin ( The Howling) creates the make up a plausible and terrifying Alien creature. Even the the alien form is revealed early on the suspense of the film is maintained as the \"31\" crew become confused as to is infected amongst them.I strongly recommend this classic sci fi horror flick to all fans of the genre.",

I'm about half of it and think it's pretty good but my guess is that it's not gonna be better than the original. Plus, I find the character that Kurt Russell plays very interesting.

The acting feels real, even with the (now dated) mechanical props. The all-male ensemble cast (with some classic B-role actors acting perhaps their life's roles), the claustrophobic set, the palpable personal tensions between diametrically disparate characters... then add to all that a near-perfect alien entity that melds with whatever it touches. Human or otherwise. One word: Atmosphere! The biggest tribute this film has ever had is that NOBODY has ever had the brains or courage to try a remake or a sequel.You think of some of the top-rated films here on IMDb - or anywhere really, films that stand by and for themselves, such as Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption, 12 Angry Men, The Usual Suspects.. and you will know that they were great and remain so purely on their own merits.Well, The Thing is the same. There may be many Star Wars, many Aliens, many Predators... but there is only ONE The Thing.Why? Because apart from its seamless plot, it has possibly the best ending of any Sci-Fi flick ever made.

Ironic, isn't it?  Also Carpenter did not use one of the best musical cues that is included on the CD: BEASTIALTY.  This sinisterly comic cue was to be used over the dog kennel scenes where the Thing is taking over the dogs.*****SPOILER*****My one complaint is when MacReady blows up The thing.  Hunh?

But for those who know carpenters work, he directed at least 3 other gems, one of those being the 1982 movie, the thing. ostensibly a remake of the 1951 movie the 'thing from another world', the movie begins with a helicopter chasing a dog, whom the occupants are trying to shoot, for which we have no idea why at this point. Carpenter is an expert when it comes to tension and suspense in his movies, right up there with Hitchcock in my opinion. the use of such tension in this movie is where carpenter excels,the master directors vision of a dark cold world perfectly instills the sense of dread and(later) paranoia all of the scientists at this research station feel. So they let this dog into the facility...and then the real terror begins. all the tension and great directing you like wouldn't work though if it were not for the absolutely astounding effects that to be honest are probably the best I've ever seen in cinema, horrifyingly gut wrenching spine ripping head tearingly real and convincing of an alien force that will absorb its host... all credit must go to rob bottin for these effects which with carpenter knowing exactly what to do (and when to do it) added together and we have an absolute corker of a movie which should be in the top 30 movies if all time and top 10 horrors. and yet it has never received the credit it deserves. why? no pun intended but perhaps the violence alienated some people? it is fantastically gory and anyone easily offended and under 16 should avoid at all costs, for the rest well, turn the lights off, get rid of any yakkers and ENJOY. 10/10 David Ford",

The inside has so many holes in the walls its basically an ice cube tray, and the place looks like WW3 on the inside and out! They walk in calmly and \"don't notice?!\" the burnt corpse they walk right by. What an unrealistic scene. Then when they are reviewing the footage they retrieve from that lab, they are looking at a big shot of the middle of the arctic, with some snow cleared a large area of ice.. One character says, \"looks like there is something buried under the ice\"...Wow he has superman vision! The space ship, is buried about 100+ feet under the arctic ice(can any human see 100+ feet into ice, ever been ice fishing? well it's impossible.)and he some how manages to see it, it's ridiculous. Now for you people that actually raked this movie a 10! This is a question for you! They decide, to test the doctor's blood that is locked in the shed. They approach the door and: #1) The door is unlocked and no valid reason was ever given how the doctor opened the door, since it was pad locked from the outside. #2) they find that within 2 days he dug a huge tunnel under his shed, complete with a large area, and on the inside a 3/4 complete space ship... I mean seriously. How can a person/alien move that much snow in 2 days(watch The great escape(1962) this will explain how long it takes to move dirt), then escape your padlocked shed and have time to steal helicopter parts and build a 3/4 complete space ship? Not like those aliens moved extremely fast, it was completely unfeasible. Then the lights go out, (and I HATED this part) they realize the generator was down. Kurt russel says, \"We are not going to make it out of here alive\" ...um why? Can't fix the generator? Can't fly the helicopter(you are a pilot, if you forgot)? Cant get in one of the many snow machines and warm yourselfs up? ....BAD line! Just give up hope the second the generators down? No, you try to live,if anyway possible...so stupid. Last but not least this was made in 1982 so i realize, the special effects were kinda weak, but there are so many other problems with this film, it's amazing that people would rank this so high. There are A lot of other issues within this film as well, too many for me to list really. This movie is HIGHLY overrated (currently) ranked higher than Terminator, I mean come on, if your going to rate this make it your own opinion and don't follow what others think.

One of my all-time favorite performances from him, as well as one of the best horror-movie heroes.-The music is very eerie and haunting, but it's not that great to be honest. It feels old, but it's not really about the music.-I guess I should go ahead and talk about the visuals. They are pretty visually terrifying. It is 100% practical effects with no CG, which makes it even more gross, but it is also old now, so it's not really that scary at a few moments. Still, best practical effects I have ever seen.

I fell in love with Escape From New York, and practically worship Big Trouble in Little China. I love the energy that Carpenter directs his movies with, I always feel they're special and unlike anything else out there. It's no different with The Thing. My question is, how does Carpenter do it? The Thing is a horror masterpiece. The movie is based on a book called \"Who Goes There?\", which is rather fitting considering the plot. In 1980's Antartica, a research team accidentally stumble upon an alien that can change it's appearance to look like anyone through cell-transformation. As it begins to wreak havoc and mayhem upon the research facility, it becomes clear that nobody can trust anybody else. Paranoia sets in, and a perfect horror mood forms. It's all very clever.Leading the campaign is MacReady, a brave and cool helicopter pilot played perfectly by the awesome Kurt Russell. Again, Russell and Carpenter craft and amazing character together, just like their previous legend; Snake Plissken. MacReady rounds the men together and attempts to destroy \"The Thing\", but things do not go as planned.For a film made in 1982, the special effects are top-notch. They look realistic, which makes a change (the 80's was a big special effects testing zone, which wasn't necessarily a good thing). It's gory and violent too, and never did I find myself thinking, \"Oh God, why?\" Ennio Morricone composed the music, influenced by Carpenter's classic synthesised tunes. I was impressed by the main theme, a sort of basic tense number; it succeeded in keeping me at the edge of my seat. This score however, was totally different from anything I'd heard Ennio do before, which made a refreshing change.Overall, The Thing is one of my favourite horror films (and one of my favourite films, to be frank). It kept me interested and tense, whilst thrilling me for the full running time. The acting is superb, as is the direction by one John Carpenter. Ennio Morricone's score was simple but effective, and the special effects just finish off this piece of perfection film-making. In one word, spectacular.(5/5)",

They soon realize that there's an alien that can infest they're bodies and slowly grow inside them, and any one of the the team that has been in contact with the dog, could be the Thing.Im not going to spoil anymore, and i advise you to see this movie, but I warn you this is not for the weak of heart.The effects were excellent, and prove that you don't need CGI to make a good movie monster. The Thing looked so real, and I tell you, CGI would just have made it look fake. And I'll give the man behind the special effects, Rob Bottin ten points just for the Thing. The acting in the movie must not be forgotten either, Kurt Russel as McReady was excellent and couldn't been done better. The fear he and the rest of the crew projected just helped make the film even more horrifying. And lets not forget, this movie proves John Carpenters great skills as a movie maker.So two thumbs up, and I recommend this film for everyone that is a Horror, Sci-fi, or simply a John Carpenter or Kurt Russel fan. This is a must the See film for everyone with the heart for it.",

This was so underrated because of that little 'peaceful' alien E.T. came out at about the same time, and most people saw E.T. first and were than disgusted by 'The Thing' (No complaints about E.T. though, who doesn't like him?). There are some really neat monster effects in this movie, most of them rather bizarre, but if you have seen John Carpenter movies before than you know what kind of bizarre to expect.Kurt Russell is very cool in this movie as he and the other men at the Antarctic facility try and fight off this nearly invincible foe. The monster and Kurt Russell are the whole reason to watch this movie, so if you plan on watching a conspiracy sci-fi movies, don't bother with The Thing, because this is just monsters, flame throwers, and snow, very simple stuff.This is probably my favorite sci-fi movie next to Alien and Aliens, and I think any fan of Kurt Russell, John Carpenter, or big, slimy, human killing, body transforming, mutant space creatures will love this movie. To me, Escape From New York and The Thing are John Carpenter's two best movies, so check out one or the other if your a fan of cult sci-fi classics. 9/10",

(Later Carpenter would direct In The Mouth Of Madness)The claustrophobic and paranoid atmosphere evoked in The Thing is nothing short of masterful. The special effects were awesome for the time and still stand up to the CGI effects of today. The film manages to transcend its genre because although the original story is hardcore science fiction the movie counter-balances with the right amount of action, horror, and drama. Ostensibly The Thing is a metaphor for the cold war but below the surface it is about human relationships. Who can you trust? The tag-line asks. There is a hallucinatory intensity to the movie that really kicks in when the paranoia of the characters starts (when Blair is asking Clark how long he was alone with the dog). It makes you feel like you're right in that camp with them.  In sci-fi terms The Thing presents us with a monster that is truly alien (a formless thing that devours and replicates tissue, and NOT a critter of some description). It also shows us a monster that can give a presentation of normalcy, much like a smiling airline passenger who turns out to be a terrorist.This is John Carpenter's masterpiece and it is a classic movie. The understated score by Ennio Morricone is clinical and perfect, adding to the cold ambience of the picture. The ending is ambiguous but leaves room open for a sequel. It's a well-crafted movie that is entertaining and engaging from beginning to end.10 out of 10.",

It was lucky it finally got interesting at the half way hour mark because I was starting to wonder exactly what all these guys were doing in the Antarctic.The Thing is a horror movie that relies on sudden shocks and visual effects that take a shape shifter into some bloody but sometimes amusing territories. The title is correct as you don't really know what this Thing is - at first it looks like some really warped spider then the next thing its something else.The characters in this film - to be honest I really couldn't care less about any of them and who died because that is the whole point of the film - to get down to the 'who dunnit' or in this case 'who is it' mystery. And it sometimes gets confusing because you never know who could be it - and it doesn't really explain itself well enough to give you enough clues and hence comes off randomly sometimes.But I will say that it is a fun sort of plot and this 'Thing' is given quite a casual treatment in its entrance. It isn't dramatic but it is a shocker - those poor dogs in particular - and hence builds up suspense quite well and you never know what is going to come around the next corner.It's not really Halloween, but it sure has a thing about it.",

Great acting, thick atmosphere, brilliant effects, and smart character decisions are just some of the things 'The Thing' offers. Speaking of the characters, this is one of the aspects where the movie stands apart from the rest, they make logical decisions for the greater good of the group. They aren't splitting up, going to into dark rooms alone, they are fighting back and using science to their advantage. Outside of strong characters, the movies special effects are unrivaled even by today's technological advancements and widening resources. The practical effects used in the movie look spectacular, over the top yes, but never too fake to the point where they become silly. The creatures many taking forms could not look any more impressive or scary! This is the standard that all horror movies should be judged, from its foreboding atmosphere, to special effects, and strong characters, this is the crown jewel in the horror department!Full Review at : http://www.simplefilmreviews.com/2014/05/the-thing-1982.html",

            "content": "Is the strangest thing I have ever seen! John Carpenter's sci-fi horror film about a mutant molecular cell that once it comes into contact of any living entity manifests itself, transforming and imitating the original DNA of that being. 'The Thing' as it becomes known is capable of assuming the physical and mental characteristics of anyone it chooses or to put it simply, an alien life form in disguise! Many top critics have missed the mark in their reviews of this film, although most being from when it originally came out. The public nonetheless knows a classic when they see one and that's why this film has developed such a long legacy and rightly so. The story is plausible if a little thin at times but the continuous 'guessing game' of who is infected keeps the viewer on edge, building up to a wonderfully tense moment in the film I like to call, 'the blood test'.This is the first time I have watched this film and what is great is that even by today's high standard of modern technology, the special effects are smashing and holds strong within today's market. The aliens are designed brilliantly, totally realistic (if that's possible with aliens?!) and gross out scary. I felt at times nauseated but that is the hallmark of this movie's intent. Everything from the opening credits to stage sets is very artistically designed so any remake of this remake would be very hard to beat in terms of creativity and visuals.Where the film slightly disappoints is emotionally, with little viewer-character sympathy. I didn't really feel any empathy towards any of the guys involved however I could definitely understand their feelings of paranoia in the 'who to trust' scenario. Also, as there are no females cast in the film, women viewers may find caring about the characters hard to come by. Having said this, the movie does achieve its main aim, which is to provide the horror and not character development. There is no bad acting only stereotypes which some people dislike but Kurt Russell as Mac does a fine job.When a solitary movie has an 'open' beginning and unclosed ending like this, the viewer is left with intrigue and wanting more which always is a good sign. Yet nowadays everybody wants to have trilogies and quadrilogies settling for quantity rather than quality. So it's not surprising that I have read there is a prequel & sequel in the pipeline, with the latter being undertaken by John Carpenter. Sometimes trilogies can be good, wrapping everything up nicely, filling the hunger, and as the possible sequel will contain the same team- I'm hoping they will look at this film as the stepping stone, correct the weaknesses and raise the bar. However the one thing that is for sure, no matter how many transformations The Thing takes on...this... is where it ultimately took hold!",

This could be a technically flawed movie; the pleasure has nothing to do with spit-and-polish (my personal top-ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" is one of very few films to fit this criterion.I've been a science fiction fan since I was a child in the Sixties, and I read the John W Campbell short story on which the film is based (\"Who Goes There\") before I saw the original, black-and-white Howard Hawks film (as with a lot of people, that viewing was illicit, on the TV, when I should have been in bed!). That movie, as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed near perfection: the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the alien, the photography; it all just seemed to work. I watched it many times in the years after (and still do, when it is shown on TV). Because of this, I avoided the Carpenter version for years - seeing remakes of one's favourite film is, I thought, always a mistake. When I did eventually watch it sometime in 1988/9, again on TV because there was nothing else on, I realised that I need to change \"always a mistake\" to \"usually a mistake\"! Carpenter had produced something different from the original film, closer to the original story, and truly wonderful. From the opening scene of the helicopter and husky, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog-pound, to that ending (sorry, no spoilers here!), I was hooked. The sound track alone lives with me - all I have to hear is a close similarity to that bass-over-snare drum beat, and I'm *in* the final scene again ...Until seeing \"The Thing\", I had Carpenter down as just another gore-monkey, based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press. Since seeing \"The Thing\", I think I have seen most of his movies - I haven't gone out of my to do so, but if one comes up, just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it. He is thoughtful, and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memory.If you haven't seen \"The Thing\", and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favour - sit down in a dark room, wrap up warm, and prepare to have your memory enhanced!",

It was the first and the last, so you can imagine how much a milestone this film is for me. :) But, of course, I ended up watching this film when I'd become an adult, and it become quickly one of my favorite films ever. In fact, it would be up there with \"Alien\", hadn't it been the Carpenter film wouldn't have existed without Ridley Scott's masterpiece.What takes us to the point: \"The Thing\" owes \"Alien\" so much I can't give this movie a higher rating without feeling \"dirty\". However, of all the films that lift ideas from others, this is the best, no doubt about it, and the one who stands on its own more remarkably. In the end, this is movie is so good you will forget about the slight ripoff.Which are the basements of this movie? They have to be: environment, acting and, of course, FX.I'll start with FX, because they are so incredibly wild they'll stick in your head for a long time. They are insane and brilliantly implemented. I can only worship Rob Bottin for them, because his work is miles ahead of CGI. This man made me adore rubber and latex like no one. He's a true artist. I forgive him for making me feel sick when I was just a little boy.The environment is the most appropriate. It enhances the feelings of paranoia and true danger we have to sit through. If you add a disturbing bass beat for music, you get it. An isolation feeling almost impossible to excel. There is a certain shot of pure genius: all survivors meet under the snowfall, each suspecting of the other, dressed up in their anoraks. It's bright, because they all look the same from a certain distance, all their heads hidden under hoods. Everyone could be the monster, so the smell of menace permeates the screen. Great scene.And what about the acting? Awesome, credible. This is one of the few movies I have liked Kurt Russell unreservedly. You may laugh at what I'm going to say, but even the dog gives a hell of a performance. God, how could he stare at the camera like that? Ahhh, the 80s... when remakes had a reason to be made and the results were exceptional...RATING: 9.2",

            "content": "I was lucky enough to see 'The Thing' on its first release in 1982. I saw it twice in 3 days at 'The Gaiety' cinema in Bristol. I recall it clearly. After 20 years, I can still vividly recall the opening shots, of a guy in a helicopter desperately trying to shoot a German Shepherd dog running through the snow in Antarctica. I still remember willing him to miss. It's a classic moment, because as the story unfolds, your hatred of the cruel, would-be pet killer completely disappears when you realise why he was trying to shoot him. Although there are many similarities to the Alien movies, 'The Thing' belongs on its own as a movie. The effects are great for 1982, and whereas most of today's horror movies carry a '15' certificate, you can still see why this is not suitable for young teenagers. I have my doubts about whether it would have attracted an '18' had it been released now, however. There's something of a 'cult status' about the feel of this movie, whatever that really means. I was lucky enough to buy it for \u00a310 on DVD. It's been nagging me to get it ever since I bought a DVD player. Kurt Russell has never been better; the rest of the cast are good; and the suspense from each character's mistrust of the other is something which is missing from most recent horror movies. John Carpenter, in those days, knew how to get an audience on the edge of their seats. This is not quite as good as 'Aliens' (in my view the ultimate in alien-horror movies) but it's a great movie to watch when you want a rush of adrenalin for sheer gut-churning visions.",

            "content": "The Thing is a remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks film \"The Thing From Another World,\" an adaptation of the short story \"Who Goes There?\" by John Campbell Jr. Hawks did not portray the Thing as it was in the book, that of an alien that could assimilate any other life form (human or animal) while retaining its memories and personality, almost like a more sophisticated kind of zombie. Perhaps due to technical limitations, or maybe to fit with the contemporary conventions of the horror genre, the 1951 adaptation portrayed the Thing as a Frankenstein monster from outer space. John Carpenter set out to change this with this adaptation, not only to make the story more loyal to the book, but to create the ultimate monster, one that was more than just a guy in a suit. Boy, did he succeed! The special effects for the Thing, created by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston, are incredible to this day; it is a much more realistic creature than many of the CGI monsters you see today. It's an amalgamation of all the creatures it has assimilated, including dogs, humans, and any other alien life forms it has encountered, giving it a familiar yet distinctly alien look.Notable cast members include Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, and Keith David. When the characters realize what they are up against, they quickly descend into a state of paranoia, as anyone around them could be the Thing. I would rather fight regular zombies myself. To make things worse, they are on a scientific research station in the middle of Antarctica, with no radio contact, and their only means of transportation is destroyed.The Thing was not successful upon its initial release, one of the great mysteries of the universe, but it garnered a large cult following, and it is now recognized as one of the best horror movies ever made. It is arguably John Carpenter's best film, although Halloween is very close. It definitely has my vote for best monster in a horror film.",

I admit it's a bit out of its league amongst movies like \"Braveheart\" and the original \"Star wars trilogy\", but nonetheless \"The Thing\" is a very, very, VERY good piece of horror. And easily one of John Carpenter's best ones. If you want to be nasty, you can say it's only a clone of \"Alien\", but there's more. What makes the difference for me are The setting - location adds to the common theme of isolation, and also to the nihilistic and dark mood; when the last survivors gather, you know they'll just freeze to death after fade out.Characterization is done well. Everyone on the station has a post, a job and responsibility. So, even though Kurt Russell is clearly the lead, the rest aren't just cardboard fodder. They are as potential clones, as potential next victims - and as potential survivors towards the end. Keeps you guessing. Well - written, just like in \"Alien\" or in \"Scream\".Benchmark in gory and eye-popping FX. What can I say?

            "content": "I remember when this came out and how it was pounced on as simply a superficial gore remake of the '51 version. The reviews at the time were silly and relied on memories of the previous version while ignoring the fact that this was not a remake. Not to mention how ET was the darling of all involved (I will never understand how ET made so much money, It was a minor bit of confection) This film is not a remake of \"The Thing From Another World\" though it does use elements of that version of the story as an homage. This is an adaptation of the story \"Who Goes There?\" which the other film also used as source.The '51 version is a great film worth watching, but it is a very different movie with an approach based on the time it was made and should not be used as a comparison to Carpenter's \"The Thing\". Well, now that I got that out of my system...This is a gory film in the sense that it shows all sorts of bizarre and gruesome events in astonishing FX sequences, however they are not there simply to be grossouts. The scenes are essential because they demonstrate the nature of the alien and are actually fascinating. Seeing how the creature is formless and just a mad collection of what it has infected can only be expressed through the scenes some find so repulsive.When the dogs are infected how they begin to morph makes me think about where the creature came from and what other previously absorbed creatures alien dna is influencing the process. Every time an infection/transformation takes place it is so bizarre and seems to meld different species and biology. When the humans get infected I wonder does the creature have intelligence? Does it retain knowledge or simply mimic? Where did the creature originate and how many others has it infected? What if it eventually infected everyone? The actions of the team are understandable and realistic to me, they have no clue what is going on most of the time and some of the complaints I have read tend to come from people who are looking at this as if the characters should have known what the viewer of the film does.The characters split up numerous times but each time it is obvious why they do. Either they don't know the things the viewer does or the situation demands it.I have read some comments about how the characters are not fleshed out and the FX take it over, the people who say this saw a different film than I did. I remember each character distinctly. They all have scenes where they become individuals we recognize and their characters nature are essential to the progress of the plot. Watch the movie once and each character is memorable. At no point are the characters interchangeable fodder like in so many other Horror/SF films. The actors are all distinct fully realized and the performances are memorable and unique.The film doesn't spell anything out, it is a great example of both SF and Horror. It is thought provoking and truly scary and it also has a perfect ending.Great Ennio Morricone score, great cinematography, the best performance by a dog ever, great mystery, and the list just goes on. This film, with precious few changes (some computer scenes date it), could be released today and would be hailed as a masterpiece and make a fortune.Was Childs infected? Was MacReady? What happens next? Great film.It also has my favorite line in history. Palmer's reaction to the spider-head... \"You Gotta be F**king kidding me!\"",

            "content": "I saw this film back in 1996 for the first time and have since never been without a copy in my library. I watch it at least 10 times a year and each time I see something new, make new assumptions, and get the same excitement from watching it.The original \"The Thing From Another World\" was typical grade-B sci-fi move that was actually quite well-made for its day: unfortunately, the monster was James Arness in a suit and essentially a vegetable. Even today Hawk's version seems to get more accolades than Carpenter, but in a strange and rare twist, the remake is actually phenomenally better.The Thing takes place in Antarctica 1982 and subjects a team of Americna scientists, mechanics, pilots and fuzzy radioman to an alien life form that can assimilate any organism it touches...anything. The team has to figure out who' human before spring allows it to escape. Because the thing is an imitator, it has no singular shape, so every time we see it, we see only a mass of blood and flesh from other lifeforms it's assimilated over its travels in space.The characterizations are admittedly weak because we don't have the time to get background, but in a way, this works because when the thing possesses someone, we're left to wonder what clues it gives away,if any. Nevertheless this has some superb acting by a wonderfully interactive ensemble cast that definitely puts Keith David into his \"always bad-ass\" character that he plays so well.Other than that I feel that this film is The Perfect Script. It's not too long, not too short, has a brisk and energetic pace, leaves plenty of clues hidden and obvious, great material presented in the right way, and is one hell of a mystery than can cause you to look back over and over again for any possible clues you may have missed. I've since noticed almost no continuity mistakes, but am always discovering new clues and hints. This film is THE blueprint for studying the structure and execution of a suspense film, much more so than many of Hitchcock's films.No other film by John Carpenter has ever managed to be as perfect or as outstanding or enjoyable as this (although They Live was fun), and I would recommend it to anyone who has not seen it. If I were stuck on a desert island and had to choose two or three movies I'd have to choose, this one would be #2, no question.",

            "content": "John Carpenter is probably the horror genre's single most famous export. I think the reason why, other than the fact that he built his career with a couple highly successful low budget horror films at the box office (Halloween and The Fog), is because those films had his name all over the advertisements. You knew it was a John Carpenter film when you went to see it. But any biography of John Carpenter reads a little funny when you consider how big a name he is in the genre, because shortly after those films were so successful, his 1982 epic The Thing absolutely tanked at the box office. Things didn't get much better for him following that. Neither 1983's Christine, 1984's wonderful Starman, nor 1986's Big Trouble in Little China did any better. I'll bet Universal was having greater luck when they acquired the rights to the sequels for Halloween. Though even there, Part III: Season of the Witch most likely didn't make too much more than John's remake of The Thing. Though some say it's not even a remake, but a more faithful adaptation of the original story, Who Goes There?Now, that's a scary concept. Not knowing who is around you, as well as whether or not they're human. I'll admit to the world (apparently full of fans of this movie), this is a scary enough idea. But almost all the actual scariness is drained right out of the film by Carpenter's love for old-movie clich\u00e9s. Literally, there are pieces from science fiction, western, and action films plastered all over The Thing. I like my horror a lot more pure than this. I don't get excited when I see scenes that are clearly being shot and added into the film for the purpose of watching someone sling-shoot a gun, or argue over who should be in charge, or smoke a joint, or drink a bottle of whiskey. I'm almost instantly reminded of Jaws, the big Hollywood adventure / drama that many people think is a horror film. The Thing is still a horror film, but my reason for bringing it up is there is an equal sense that much of Jaws is about \"good ol' boys\" and their dramatic situations and conflicts. But, this is horror. Why should I care just because that's the attitude of older military or western films? I sat down wanting a horror film.Okay, so The Thing isn't pure. And it's not that scary, either. I'm in my mid-20's, I'm probably not going to be too scared by 99% of all horror films anyway. The film has a few undeniable good qualities. John Carpenter is a visual master of the genre, so his films always look amazing. This one is no exception. 1980's The Shining and 1974's Black Christmas had already captured the creepiness and starkness of being somewhat isolated in winter conditions. But, The Thing is much colder. Credit to Carpenter for managing to get some real dread from the viewer about potentially being in the characters' position and possibly freezing to death in the incredibly cold Antarctic climate. The film is literally a harsh snowy desert, which Carpenter at times paints with red and blue light. Not as pretty as Argento's 1977 masterpiece Suspiria, but I'll take it. Ennio Morricone's score for the film has its' moments and sounds like Morricone trying to imitate Carpenter's previous scores somewhat, or the style of them. But overall, it's not nearly as effective as Carpenter's scores for Halloween or The Fog.And now, comes the part I always dread when talking about The Thing... Rob Bottin's special effects. The film's characters already do a good job of making this stylish film boring, but Rob's effects slam the book on why I dislike this film shut. They turn what is hopefully a restrained and tight paranoia piece into an out-and-out freakshow, like a circus of oddities. Which does not do much to add to any mood of suspense Carpenter was hoping to achieve. They stop the movie dead in its' tracks (though as I pointed out in another review, that's a Carpenter specialty), which I almost never care for. Bottin's work in Joe Dante's films previous, The Howling and Piranha, was flawed only because of the low budgets, but Bottin's and Dante's usage of them was remarkable and skilled. In The Thing, like I said, it's freaky and grotesque. Which I do think will knock your socks off if you're seeing the film for the first time. But will never scare you on repeat viewing. Rather, the sequences are just so disgusting, they make you want to turn the film off. Unless you're a budding special effects artist, who I'm sure will want to study every frame.However, I will admit that one sequence definitely still gets me and I am impressed (after seeing the film about six times to date), the spider-head sprouting legs. But for me, the quality of the special effects are never as important as how they are used. Too much is actually too much. John would go on to show much more restraint and skill in this area 5 years later with Prince of Darkness. A film that's nowhere near as good as The Thing, but used special effects to better overall effect. When the big effects scenes in The Thing are pretty much over, the film gets a lot more interesting. For example, the famous \"blood test\" scene is a total home run for Carpenter and company (shy of the stupid effects), but afterward, the film actually becomes beautifully eerie, dark, and very enjoyable. When MacReady and a few survivors are walking through the camp, discovering Blair's secret, and making final plans. This is what the entire film should have been like. No scene previous really made this film. But this ending is actually on par with Carpenter's earlier and excellent work in the horror genre.",

From Dean Cundey's stark lighting to Ennio Morricone's solid minimalist score, this film reeks of greatness.  A true compliment to pay the film though, is how John Carpenter is able to take the large cast and make each character unique and interesting.  It could have become confusing in the wrong hands, but John Carpenter is able to balance character development in with the plotting seamlessly.Although all the actors are excellent, the real star of the show is Rob Bottin's ground breaking special effects.  As I write this in 2003, his effects work in \"The Thing\" have yet to be beat.  Simply amazing gore work is featured throughout the film that is so gruesome and shocking it will have even the toughest of viewers turning their heads.With all the gore featured throughout the movie, it is amazing how Carpenter is still able to generate suspense by stressing the unseen.  He is not merely making a gore picture, he cares about scaring the audience.  Some scares come from the gore, but most of them come from the build up to that gory moment.  The long tracking shots inside the claustrophobic station are particularily effective.The icing on the cake with \"The Thing\" is Carpenter's perfect apocalyptic ending.  This is a dark film, and the ending does not cop out with some sappy rescue scene.  The ending is true to the themes and characters of the film, and is one of the best in history.  The last line of the film beats \"watch the skies\" from the original \"The Thing\".  In fact, everything about this film upstages the original.  This is a remake like only John Carpenter can make, and it is a rollercoaster ride from start to finish.  One of the best science fiction films ever made, bar none.",

There are no climaxes, no real surprises, the story is already known, the effects are just bad considering what earlier movies could deliver and the acting is okish at best. If you don't have high standards, don't expect much from a horror movie, this will fill a cold rainy sunday evening, but that's about it.Comparing this to Alien is like comparing Star Wars the original trilogy with \"Message from Space\".This is just plain and simple a mediocre monster horror B-movie from 82.

The rating pertaining to the fact that this is, without a doubt, one of the finest sci-fi horror films ever produced. Carpenter takes us on an intense psychological thrill ride that easily stands up to the test of time, as does all great film. Kurt Russell plays the lead role with such relaxed intensity, suffice to say, this has to be his finest performance EVER in a motion picture. Had Kurt over the span of his career procured more roles similar to this he would have easily been considered one of the finest character actors in the history of film, guaranteed.Unfortunately Russell chose such parts as that of 'Captain Ron' or the zaney jack of all trades in 'Overboard'. Sealing his fate as a mediocre comedy actor at best.'The Thing' proves otherwise and leaves us longing for a Kurt Russell RE-DO where Kurt would choose his roles far more carefully in turn leaving us with a legacy rather than a laugh. After viewing Russells stellar performance in this film to say its a crying shame or a case of unrecognized talent... would be an understatement. It must be understood that this film is far more than sci-fi horror it also covers the full gamut of human emotion that takes place when one is cast into a hopeless and desperate situation while being cruelly isolated by uncompromising conditions.John Carpenter, Kurt Russell and the supporting cast(who happen to be magnificent as well) more than achieve their goal of 'bringing us there' with an intensity only such classics as 'Alien' could possibly boast.This film was not given its due by critics upon release. However I would be willing to bet since that time many producers-directors of horror and psychological thriller alike have used it as a scale by which to measure their work.Considered a cult classic. Be sure to rent(or buy) the revised version. Don't expect modern day special FX to carry this one (oh no this film is far too good for that!). Its the stellar acting, isolated settings and interesting storyline that bring this one to life. By far some of the best acting in horror film history. Enjoy!",

Set in Antarctica it captures the atmosphere of isolation, eerie feeling of fear and terror of the unknown. Together with terrific special effects (the head sprouting legs and scuttling away must rank amongst the greatest scenes in the annals of Sci-Fi horror), and good acting by the principal actors, it is one the most memorable of films. I was somewhat shocked and disturbed by the film when I first saw it, and the feeling of unease lingered in the mind for some time.The final scene is also one of the most interesting in the film, it leaves the story perhaps unfinished and in the viewer a deep sense of unresolved tension and unsettled fear.I probably would have given it a 9 or 10 for its sheer brilliance, but viewing it again many years later the shock factor has somewhat diminished, perhaps lowering unfairly the appreciation of the film. Hence the slightly lower vote although it probably deserves more, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who haven't seen it before.(vote amended to give a 9, it does deserve it on second thought.)",

I just cant praise it enough!I John Carpenter is still one of my favorite directors (mainly because of his early works) and it`s shame that he isn`t making movies more often. Halloween,Dark Star,The Fog,The Thing,Big Trouble in Little China,Escape From New York are all no-budget wonders and cult favorites. But The Thing remains his greatest achievement! Direction is flawless,the script wellwritten,acting great from everyone involved (Kurt Russel just isn`t the same actor when he isn`t working with Carpenter),the score is amazing (this is,after all,a Carpenter movie) and creature effects are simply breathtaking! The movie captures the feeling of paranoia and isolation like none before or since. What other 20+ years old movie features stuff that you see here?I could write about this movie or its director for 5 hours but the fans already know-this is one of 50 greatest movies of all time (and all time top 10 when it comes to horror) and it is shame that The Thing isnt on IMDB Top 250! What kind of world is this when movies like Amelie,Memento,The Pianist and Requiem for a Dream are all top 50 while this movie didnt make Top 250 list????? It just shows what most of us already know-peoples taste in movies is getting worse for every minute. For those who didnt like the movie - stick to romantic comedies and \"based on a true story\" crap dramas. For the fans of this movie - it deserves to be on the list and we have to do something to get it there! Thanks God for giving us different tastes!",

After watching it, I kind of realize the reason why it could get so much praise, and I totally agree with that this film is a classic.First thing I noticed in the movie is the special effects which appeared so vivid that can absolutely beat most horrors of science fiction nowadays. Not like some horrors of science fiction, this movie demonstrated excellent qualities not only for its achievements in special effects but also in the outstanding acting and directing. In addition, the sound effects blew my mind as well. As we all know, sound effects play extremely important roles in horrors, and this movie did it in a simple way with straight and simple melody, yet remains in our head for a very long time after we saw this movie. With excellent special effects and sound effects accompanied by outstanding acting and directing, I can't find any reason that this movie shouldn't be a classic.As for the story, all that matters is to convince the audiences of things that happened to the characters. Thanks to the atmosphere establishing by the crew, I thought it was really convincing to me. The suspicions among the members reflect humanity, and most important of all, it offers pleasure for the audiences to speculate the real infected. After all, it's more interesting to guess than to know in advance, especially in such a horror of science fiction. Infection from outer space became a popular theme ever since, but no one will forget to mention this film when talking about horrors of science fiction.In short, this film is no doubt a milestone for horrors of science fiction, and I certainly won't forget the melody for years!",

For that remarkable comeback alone, you have to give \"The Thing\" and its resiliency some mad props. Myself, I ended up finally seeing this in the early 90s when I was in college. Definitely worth the wait. Its based on the old 1930s sci-fi novel \"Who Goes There?\" and is essentially a remake of the 1950s \"The Thing From Another Planet.\" Aside from being based on an old novel, it is derivative of many before it the sci-fi/monster movie genre. Think \"Alien\" but in the Antarctic instead of outer space. But this movie still works on so many levels. First of all, it was one of the few movies in the late '70s/early '80s sci-fi genre that actually had a decent cast (such as Kurt Russell, Richard Dysart and that old geezer -- forgot his name -- who used to do Quaker Oats commercials and always mispronounced \"diabetes\"). Secondly, the special effects are amazingly good for an '80s sci-fi movie; better than a lot of the crap that passes off as CGI special effects on SciFi Channel. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, this movie takes a somewhat complex plot (in addition to the \"monster runs amok\" theme, there's quite a bit of plot and character buildup and mistrust amongst the main characters, weaved in with the \"in addition to fighting an unknown monster, we're kind of stuck in Antarctica too\" claustrophobia) and does it without affecting the pace of the movie whatsoever. I guess that must be the John Carpenter influence. Whatever it is, this was a great movie to watch, giving you the sci-fi scares without any of the laugh-ability of bad, low-budget shockers. I'm shying away just a bit at giving it the highest possible rating because I wasn't 100% on board with the ending (leaves a little too much to interpretation of what happened to the final two survivors), but I give \"The Thing\" a very solid 9.",

The suspense is wonderful because of the enclosed area that the scientists inhabit and the feeling that no one can truly trust each other is unbelievably intense. Although i have said that the effects now maybe slightly outdated i also have to put that at the time they were stunning and the effects designer Rob Bottin should get an honourable mention for making the creature seem terrifying and at the same time with the weird shapes and forms that the 'Thing' had become in the past visually stunning and intriguing.",

It is however the opening part for his 'Apocalypse Trilogy' that continued with Prince of Darkness (1987)and concluded with In the Mouth of Madness (1995).The Thing is a retelling of the story 'Who Goes There?' (1938) written by John W Campbell Jr. and made previously in 1958 by Christian Nyby as The Thing From Another World. The story concerns a group of men isolated and forced to defend themselves against a shape shifting alien species. High tension, great performances, chilling score from Morricone and some dazzling camera work from Dean Cundey. The star of the show is undoubtedly special effects maestro Rob Bottin, with what is still considered today to be jaw-droppingly shocking make up effects.The DVD is worth purchasing.

However, sometimes...and I mean once in a lifetime kind of \"sometimes\"...everything will click and you got yourself one damned fine film. This is Carpenter's \"click\".Ingredients: A great premise story by the late John W. Campbell Jr., an absolutely spectacular ensemble cast who, even back then was somewhat unknowns but they all cut their teeth on the stage. I mean really, Richard Dysart, W. Brimley, Peter Maloney, D. Moffat, Richard Masur and Tom Waites, all damn fine stage actors. Sorry to name drop but the producers either were brilliant and/or extremely lucky to pull off this cast for an ensemble piece about paranoia. Great cast! And to really put the icing on the cake they have the edgy special effects guy, Rob Bottin, who was really just a kid at the time pulling off amazing special effects (yes, this is before CGI, kiddies) with a budget that I use to buy groceries with. He was years ahead of his time.The litmus test for me was to show this to my 15 yr. old son and a few of his buddies one Friday night. They were glued to the TV; from the opening scene where the Norwegians were shooting the wolf from the helicopter to the end scene where Mac and Childs make veiled paranoid small talk amidst the carnage that was once their camp. They loved it and were blown away when I told them how old it was, but I think the scene with Mac and that lame chess computer sort of dates it.

My parents let me watch \"Halloween\" and \"Escape From New York,\" which was one of my late father's favorites, maybe too young for some, but with a crowd that made them 'just a movie.' Yet, when I tried to watch \"The Thing\" at a young age, I was so disturbed I couldn't bare it. It didn't have the hero of Snake, or the novelty of Michael. Not that it was overtly realistic, but it started a little too slow, and then the whole things with the dogs happened... We had too many dogs at the time for me not to be disturbed... I quit, and hung it up until yesterday.Now, I'm in film school, last semester we had an assignment to match the lighting techniques in \"Halloween,\" and since I've revisited many of my old Carpenter favorites (and realize I still know \"Escape From New York\" by heart, and it's been years since I've seen it.) But, given the IMDB high ratings every time I went to his name, I decided to check it out.\"The Thing\" is bar-none one of the most brilliant films I've ever seen, and certainly the best John Carpenter movie out there. The F/X are one thing, a brilliant thing, but the film doesn't rely soley on them at all. The cinematographery and the narrative are the leads. (Take out \"The Thing,\" and you still have a story. The sub-plot alone could be the story-- guys cracking up under stressful conditions in the wilderness.)\nThe film looks pitched in low key light under extremely high key weather conditions. The interior scenes look like they were done at the same location, although they weren't. That pitch helps with the clausterphobic atmosphere, but also the dark mood of the story even before it happens.\nI won't go with any spoilers, I am against them. But, the film's narrative starts at a level of distant, unaware, and unsure charactors and ends in a dark level of distant, unaware, enlightenment. Nothing else matters to the lead. Kurt Russell in no way displays the heroics 'I don't give a damn' attitude he did as Snake. He's burned out and it doesn't matter any more. He's still the hero, and not an anti-hero, because in the end he did all he could do. His means, in the end, did not justify his end-- and he states that well before the film ends.The gore was harsh, but is well worth it, and amazingly real in and unrealistic circumstance of the main plot. I'm not a Sci-Fi fan, I rarely get scared by a movie (and there are some moments that honestly scare the hell out of me, even when they are predictable. It's the old Hitchcock 'bomb under the desk' trick.)Also, the DVD is highly recommended. The documentary is a little slow, but ends up very interesting, especially when talking about the F/X, done by one man who was about seven years younger than me at the time.\nLastly, I want to mention that like many brilliant achievements by previously known directors, the film has much the same feel as some of his previous works at first-- music, shots, and pacing especially. When you realize, however, that Carpenter didn't embark in the same direction as usual, realize that he didn't use tactics that had already worked before-- by himself or anyone else-- on probably the biggest budget he had had before that time. Instead, Carpenter went darker and more realistic than ever before. That's rare with independent directors of today.",

I don't say that's a bad thing but rather a good thing because it has those good elements from Alien, expands on them, and makes a pretty entertaining and fun horror sci-fi flick. Kurt Russel is good as our main character and also everyone else. It's cool to see how the crew have regonizable features and personality traits you maybe wouldn't see in an environment the movie has. However, what steals the show and terrifies me all the time would have to be the alien. Oh my god, this thing might be the scariest thing I have even seen as both a child and adult. So, this movie has action, that sci-fi feeling, horror, and a hint of suspense. This movie is fun. 8/10.",

            "content": "Putting \"The Thing\" into my DVD player, I knew that I was in for a great horror film. After all, it's John Carpenter, the man who brought us such classics as \"Halloween\" and \"The Fog.\" My expectations were correct, and this 1982 spook-fest wound up being one of the creepiest horror films of the 80s.Doing a special project in Antarctica, R.J. MacReady and his crew discover something hidden beneath the snow. It's what appears to be some kind of a ship, something believed to be dated more than 100,000 years old. MacReady and the others should have stayed away from the remains of that ship. Because now, there is an evil, alien force lurking around the base, taking form of the crew. The Thing could be anybody, and it's up to MacReady to find out who the next victim is.\"Halloween\" has always been John Carpenter's scariest movie. What sets his other movies apart from his masterpiece is that they focus more on creeping the audience out than officially scaring them. No doubt, \"The Thing\" is a very frightening film. But why is it so frightening? There's plenty of gore in it, but Carpenter also wants to make the viewer very uncomfortable. Instead of scaring them, he creates the most horrific sense of paranoia anybody could imagine. The Thing could be anybody, and I found myself guessing who would be the next to fall prey to the alien force. The movie is very unpredictable, and I was on the edge of my seat.The cast is very well-chosen, with great performances by Kurt Russell, Keith David, Richard Masur, and more. These are sympathetic characters, and I never wanted any of them to die.One word I can say for Rob Bottin's special effects and makeup is: amazing. The moments when The Thing attacked were strangely believable, and I could feel the effects. Points to Bottin for creating superior effects.An awesome cast, a great story, a terrifying sense of paranoia, and remarkable special effects make 1982's reimagining of \"The Thing\" another winner from the master of horror.",

Perhaps the owners felt the sound from Battlezone and Pac Man would drown out the profanity from young ears. At the time, I certainly found it frightening, but with time, and repeated viewings, I have to wonder about some of the director's choices.  Could someone *please* explain to me why a civilian research station is heavily armed with firearms, not to mention flamethrowers?  I mean, c'mon, I can understand maybe a shotgun, but flamethrowers?  Were penguins that much of a threat to their survival?Yes, the original \"Thing\" from 1951 may not have the gore and body count, but you can't beat the fact that they were lightly armed, even for military personnel, and had to use what was at hand to battle the creature.  Here, whatever they need is thrown their way.  It's hard to beat the orignal folks fighting off the creature with buckets of kerosene and flare guns in a confined space.  If Carpenter really wanted to impress me, he would have done away with the firepower and focused more on a group of lightly/unarmed scientists improvising their survival as in the earlier film.",

Suspense, the tension that comes across in this film is almost unrivaled, from the edginess all the actors give off in general interactions, to that fantastic blood test scene, this film upon first viewing will have your stomach tight. Everything in this one clicked, the script, the acting , the effects, one would be seriously hard pressed to find its equal in these areas not to mention its better.I must mention Russel in this. This movie set the benchmark for him. He was made for this role, and he was at the right age with the right experience under his belt to make Mac come out perfectly. Other than Kurts performance the other characters played their roles with brilliant acumen. I count all but two of those guys who have gone on to or came from already long and varied careers. Everything every one of those actors do, they do well.Finally the effects. Those do still hold up today as stomach churning and terrifying to witness, all without any CGI. Unbelievably well done. My only complaint is like someone earlier said, I have a hard time watching the dog kennel scene. But even that scene, if you parallel it to the blood test scene for tension and fear, is a standout I've seen very few films match, and all the actors in that scene were dogs! So bravo for 'The Thing' 1982. One of the best films ever made in many categories. I watch it gladly every single time I see it come on T.V.",

One of the best things is showing the passions of the characters under different situations and seeing the developing of the characters with time is good .. people who face a big danger & pressure like a war or something like that, show their real faces and such terrible situations shows the best of human beings according to scientists. And this is what's so good about the movie .. which I consider the best of the movie.The visual effects were good and the cinematography was good .. especially outdoors.It is a classic horror movie .. horror movies lovers would like this movie.I'm not sure it is a pleasant to watch .. but no harm in watching it.",

            "content": "Twelve men are trapped in an Antarctic camp when suddenly a Norwegian suddenly attacks their dog. They learn that a hostile alien is roaming around the area that could potentially kill everyone. When they learn that this alien can change in both human and alien form perfectly, paranoia sets in the camp. The Thing can infect anyone and as more people get infected, the crew realizes that the alien lives among them.This is the second time I have seen a classic movie in theaters for its anniversary rerelease with the first being Labyrinth with David Bowie. I love the feeling of watching an old film on a bigger screen. It feels so special. For this movie, I have always wanted to watch it, but never got around to it. What a way to experience it for the first time huh? How does this cult classic hold up 40 years later?I cannot remember the last time I was this frightened by a horror film. John Carpenter's The Thing had me spooked. Just the setting of the film. The men are stuck in a cold camp where they could potentially freeze to death and now there is a shapeshifting alien on the loose. The movie's atmosphere is what sticks out to me the most. Not the Thing itself, not the blood and gore, not even Kurt Russell's awesome performance, but the frightening and paranoia fueled feeling the movie gave me. Unlike Alien where the crew can work together, this crew needs to turn on each other and make each other do outrageous things just to prove that they are not the alien. With the pacing of the story, the buildup to the horror sequences makes them so nerve-racking so when the alien shows up, it will be much more frightening. The atmosphere and setup to this movie is damn-near perfect. Despite the amount of blood and gore, the movie is not about that. It is about the people trying to figure out who is human and who is the creature. It shows that Carpenter understood how to scare an audience with subtle events to lead up to frightening images.Speaking of which, good god... the creatures in this feature are frightening as all hell. Now some of the effects may not have aged that well, but that does not stop the aliens in this movie from being body horror personified. The amount of gore that the aliens bring as they transform into the crew members can be a bit much. However, the effects look great for the time and a lot of the practical effects hold up to this day. They are genuinely unnerving and the way they can kill is what scares me the most. To me, torture is scarier than death and Carpenter understood that as well. The scariest scene however has to be the reveal of who was the alien among the crew during the blood test. I jumped at that scene. No joke. Everything about this species is terrifying and I may have some nightmares about it tonight.Then there is the musical score by Ennio Morricone. This has to be one of the best musical scores in any film. Not only does it sound creepy and cool on its own, but it fits tone of the movie to a tee. There are not many jump scares or loud noises, but the camp is full of mistrust and paranoia. The mysterious alien is a pretty new discovery that peeks curiosity and tension. The music replicates that perfectly. Seriously, a great musical score can make the atmosphere and tone so much more effective and The Thing is a perfect example of that.As for the cast of characters, they are not the deepest, but they do not need to be. They are generally very likable despite the circumstances that they are in and root for their survival. Kurt Russell as MacReady is the most memorable. Russell gives a great performance as an alcoholic man who is slowly driven to insanity the longer they are stuck with monstrous creature. Despite that, he fights it off and tries to save his co-workers who are not infected even if he goes to extreme measures. Childs is another character I liked. He is a really cool guy who was not afraid of death. It takes guts to tell someone to shoot them out of suspicion. As for the other characters, I could not help but feel bad for Garry who seemed really polite, but he was treated kind of badly. He also gets the best line in the whole film. The actor who played as Blair did a great job as well showing how insane he became after learning about the potential fate of the crew. That scene is pretty unnerving. What made the characters in this film standout is how they all reacted to the alien's presence. If you pay attention certain characters actions, you can tell who is human and who is not at points. Still the one of the alien reveals did catch me off guard. Overall, this is a solid cast filled with characters you want to see survive.The Thing by John Carpenter is an impressive horror flick to this day. For a movie that was panned when it was originally released, it sure managed scare the crap out of me. I think watching this in theaters made my experience a little more special, but that does not change the fact that this is an awesome movie. I love inspiration that it draws from Alien as well as the scary atmosphere it brings. This movie shows that you do not need excessive jump scares to frighten the audience. If you are a fan of horror, than I highly recommend this cult classic. It stands the test of time. Just prepare for a lot of gore and body horror. Sure, not all of it looks real, but it is still not for the faint of heart.",

I was angry that John Carpenter made his own version and I refused to see it... until recently. \"The Thing\" has a very Lovecraftian feeling to it. Lovecraft is one of my favorite writers so it was inevitable that I would love this film. Let me clear the air about a few things. This is NOT a remake, both films are based on a story entitled \"Who Goes There?\" by an author I can't remember. I will try to find and read it as soon as possible. The level of paranoia in this film is thick. You have no clue who is The Thing until the transformation happens. The difference between this film and the black and white version is that the black and white monster was like a Frankenstein monster type of thing. This monster is like Alien from \"Alien\". It takes the form of living things (excluding plants, that's just my guess) and hides in them. Both monsters can be destroyed by the same means, see both films if you want to see what these means are. I'm eating my words, I will bow down to John Carpenter for doing this film. Both films are good, so I suggest if you see this one, see the black and white version. Just don't expect to see the same monster. Another thing that got me about this film is its level of controversy. Apparently, a bunch of sensitive people got offended because there's no females in this film. I don't see people for their race, gender, ethnicity, etc. I see them for who they really are. Some people are way too sensitive about stupid things like this.",

I saw Halloween many years ago and was far less impressed than most others; I guess it must have been impressive when it was released, but I'm just not into slasher films where some masked weirdo randomly knifes people; personally find that rather boring (not to detract from those who did like it).Anyway, I had a (spoiler) prediction of how the movie might end, toward the latter part, which turned out not be accurate, but it was not foreclosed by the actual ending and could be the basis for a sequel, so many years later.One thing I noticed toward the latter part of the movie (and I'm not all that perceptive in movies generally, but it struck me at the time) is that Kurt Russell's character conspicuously failed to take the blood test. I suspected a possible ending-- he continues to plausibly act like he's not infected, but turns out at the very end to have been, and is the sole survivor, letting himself get frozen so he can re-surface when some unwitting person(s) later digs him up.The actual ending doesn't resolve the issue, and either or both of the survivors could still be infected...However, director's commentary shows no indication at all that there was any notion, to either Carpenter or Russell, that the character might be infected, but rather the intent was that there would be two survivors at the end, with the only minor ambiguity being whether they survived long enough to be rescued (which was unlikely).Still, I thought it was an interesting idea (a rarity for me regarding movie ideas) that was not strictly foreclosed by the ending and could be the basis for a sequel, preferably by Carpenter himself, so many years later.",

I think it's the paranoia that intrigues me the most. The fact that we don't know let's us experience the character's hysteria. I think the reason I appreciate this film so much is that the characters do not find a solution.  This is what is so scary.  The language barrier between the Norwegians and the Americans isn't broken as a character reveals some hidden talent for languages.  (referring to the notes that they find) The chance to do the test the doctor suggests is sabotaged. The person then put in charge of finding a new way to test for infection disappears. We never get an answer as to what happened with him. The one that Macready comes up with is perfect. It's simple yet does the job.The effects in this are horrifying, even after all these years. This movie has really held up. At the end when Macready and Childs are looking at each other and know they are both going to die is truly moving.

Twenty years later, every time I watch this picture I feel like a seven year old again, and I don't scare easily.  In fact, of the hundreds of horror films I have spent my life watching and dissecting, there are only a handful of films that truly terrified me, and John Carpenter's The Thing is at the very top of that elite list.  But what is it that makes this movie so scary?  The first element is the score.  For some reason, JC's synth score really gets to me. I can't explain it but it really makes this movie seem extra creepy.  In fact, I have the score on CD and even if I pop it in during the day, I can't help but get chills as it reminds me of a number of suspenseful scenes. Next is the special effects.  Rob Bottin's work is absolutely amazing...hands down the best I have ever seen without the aid of computer generated graphics!  The amazing thing is that the effects still hold up today against the CGI films.  He really makes the monster come to life, a pure genius.  Now, even though the score is eerie and the effects are off the charts, the real magic of this movie is the feeling of isolation and helplessness that Carpenter creates.  Imagine, being trapped at an Antarctic research station with 11 other men, one or more of whom are \"infected\" with and alien monster and you can't contact the rest of the world.  You can't tell by looking at each other as the monster imitates its victims permanently...until it gets you alone...finally revealing its true gruesome identity.  But how do you know who are your friends...and who is \"the thing?\"  This premise is what sets the tone for an edge-of-your seat game of: who do you trust and who do you fear?

I have never left a movie feeling the same way that this movie does. My favorite one of the things this film does wonderfully would be the ambiguity. I engaged in many theory videos and did some thinking on my own as well, but people such as Bob Ager had much better theories than anything I could come up with. This uneasiness, distrust, and uncertain feeling the movie displays is truly what makes it scary, on top of those terrifying practical effects which I love so much. The threat of The Thing being larger than life was also a very engaging aspect, making it even more truly scary. After seeing many movies of the same type, The Thing always takes the cake.

The concept is so good and so well portayed. It is a lot different than other horror concept and it makes you feel a lot more emotions. The antarctica base is really well portrayed has an environement. And a lot of this is due to the fact that when they shot the movie, they actually changed the temperure of the site to 28 F degrees, which made it very accurate. Ennio Morricone's music in this movie is... Awsome! The way the movie begins is extremly suspenseful, but its a lot due to the opening title.

I love the fact that the morphing of the \"thing\" is so ingeniously done (I've not seen the original black and white version so can't compare).I liked the location it was shot (northern British Columbia) as it really was exactly like a polar landscape should be conveyed. The freezing cold of the setting made the film chilling and added to the despair and dread.Now 23 years later I own this on Blue Ray and still enjoy watching it.

This movie grabs you from the first scene and takes you far away from your warm cozy living room, and blankets you in cold isolation. I find myself curious about the people who find themselves stationed in that far corner of the world. Carpenter never tells us anything about them, which gives us a voyeuristic feel. Great special effects and a good plot move the story along. The tension builds unceasingly as you slowly realize that all of the people in this film are doomed. The DVD version is a must own, It has so many extras that it is like getting another film free. And the color and sound are vastly improved over the video version ( yes, I own both). I watch this movie at least once a month, and have since the mid 80's . If that makes me obsessive, so be it.",

But unlike other films which rely on cheap and clich\u00e9d scary tactics for all the frights \"The Thing\" is bloodcurdling in several different ways. First there's the gore which will surely put off many due to its explicitness and inventive grotesqueness. Second there's the scenery with its chilled and chilling feel of isolation and its \"no one's getting out alive\" vibe. Thirdly the most unsettling aspect is that it lays out a distrustful relationship among these men, they're all together but not once do they, or indeed can they, trust one another which is clearly made out by lines like \"Trust is a hard thing to come by these days\" or \"You'll have to sleep sometime\".Paranoia fills the air while the tension seethes inside each character threatening to boil over.So it's about the natural fear of the unknown but also about being alone in a world you can't by no means control.\"The Thing\" while also marking career highpoints for Carpenter, Kurt Russel and Keith David is one of the finest, most terrifying and intelligent horror movies you can get your hands on.",

Several years later, (now 19 years old) I have bought the DVD. I can tell you this DVD is amazing, down from the documentary to the cool comentary with J.C and Kurt Russell. I am not ashamed to admit that this film still manages to scare me, and ranks up on the list with Alien, Aliens and Halloween. I must mention that I am a huge fan of J.C. I do appreciate his recent films, but not as much as his earlier ones. I must also commend the amazing Rob Bottin. He is a true gem in the movie world and his special make up effects still stand up to today's standards. But J.C's direction is absolutely amazing. He truly manages to capture the horror in Antarctica, it's as if we are actually trapped in this desolate ice world with these twelve men. You are transfixed in a claustrophobic and untrustworthy situation, where the pace is relentless. The Blood testing scene still manages to get my heart pounding through my chest. Cudo's also to J.C for not giving us a \"Happy Ending\", because that is the format most Hollywood films go for. ****Spoiler*****I love the bravery of MacReady and Childs for preventing The Thing from escaping by sacrificing their own lives****End Spoiler***** - Truly remarkable! If MacReady walked off in the mist like a lone cowboy (As J.C puts it) and lives happily ever after, that would suck. The ending of Alien worked so much, because Ripley survived the Alien, but was nonetheless left alone in space (with her cat) to sleep.\nMake sure you buy this DVD and relish in the John Carpenters remarkable masterpiece, along with Halloween.",

            "content": "Maybe it was the timing. With AIDS rearing its head in eighties culture, the Cold War essentially having everyone fearing the end of the world but John Carpenter's The Thing just has that special something about it.Considering today's horror films are almost entirely remakes (something The Thing has had written about it for several years now) this feels original despite already being a remake in itself. There hasn't really been anything else like it before or since, unlike films such as The Exorcist or The Omen that have found their premise inferiorly mimicked countless times now.The premise is simple. Nine men are stranded in Antarctica - and something is taking over their bodies. Carpenter racks up the tension early on creating the sense within the first half hour that the entire cast could already be infected and never gives you any suggestion they are infected until the reveal. It's that sense of unknowing as an audience member that gives The Thing one of its finest strengths.Performance wise the cast are universally strong, never dissolving into horror clich\u00e9s to ensure that this isn't just Kurt Russell's show nor is it just another hackneyed remake. Ennio Morricone's minimalist score only helps to heighten the tension around every scene.The real hero of the film, and its strongest suit, is make-up guru Rob Bottin creating creatures that are undeniably taken from the audience subconscious. Every time the creature is revealed in its grotesque form there's a sense that the stuff of nightmares is really well and truly out to get these people and the audience. While many horror films (including many of Carpenter's own works) deal in the unseen The Thing itself is always seen and its terrifying.The fact that the ending ends on such a note of uncertainty is all the more chilling leaving the audience wanting a conclusion that they will never get. It's that sense of unease that never leaves you. The Thing is about a lot more than just scaring its audience. It leaves you thinking. It leaves you wanting more. It leaves you in a state of unease. But then again, The Thing never really leaves you.To put it simply, utter genius",

            "content": "The Thing is a classic horror film directed by John Carpenter and written by Bill\nLancaster. The 1982 film was filled with excitement, conflict, and terror from start to finish and\nthe film never failed to keep me on my feet. Taking place in Antarctica in 1982 with nothing\naround them but their camp, the American scientists were disrupted by gunfire. A Norwegian\nhelicopter was shooting at a dog. The helicopter decides to land on their camp and not revert\nto their station. The crazy passenger shooting at the dog comes out trying to alert them, but he\njust sounded crazy to the Americans because he was talking Norwegian. The helicopter\nexplodes and both Norwegians are killed one from the explosion and the other was killed by the\nAmericans. The crew takes in the stray dog, but little did they know it would cause them their\nlife. The \"dog\" that they took in was infected by the deadly horrific \"thing\". Its ability to shape\nshift into any organism they have absorbed made it hard for anyone to trust each other which\nsets fearfulness and dispute of who is really telling the truth in the group.\nJohn J. Lloyd (production designer) did an outstanding job in choosing the setting.\nAntarctica is never a first choice when you think about horror, but the setting ties well with the\nisolation and set of the film. The set Carpenter chose was a small campsite. To enhance the\nisolation, it was the only shelter nearby. It was frigid outside so if you wanted to survive the\nwinter you would have to be inside the toasty shelter. This made it harder for anyone to trusteach other which set a paranoia feeling in all of the characters and an unsettling feeling for the\nviewers. The anxious unsettling feeling is also followed by the music score by Ennio Morricone.\nIt created suspense when they went inspecting in the Norwegian campsite and found dead\nbodies and a large block of ice that looked like it belongs to a humungous creature. Roy\nArbogast also helped enhance the fear in the film with all of his special effects. Although it was\n1982, the special effects were out of this world. It looked so real and felt like you were really\nthere. When \"The thing\" was being autopsied by Dr.Blair (Wilford Brimley) the organism\nexploded everywhere and it was looked so genuine that it was so impressive.\nLancaster creates an incredible ending to the film. MacReady (Kurt Russell) and his\ncrewmates that are still alive collaborate to burndown the station to preclude \"the thing\" from\ngetting out into the world. In the middle of putting all of the explosives \"the thing\" comes out\nto attack. MacReady throws an explosive in \"the things\" mouth and bolts out of the exploding\nstructure. When he is in a safe spot he sits down exhaustedly and watches as the station burns\nto pieces. He is then startled by the approach of one of his crewmates Childs (Keith David).\nMacReady questions Childs of being \"the thing\" but ultimately, he is too drained to wrangle\nabout it. The viewer is left with no definite answer which creates suspense and uncertainty.",

The end of the movie also features another chilling narrative, warning that a being like the 'Thing' is not necessarily a far-fetched concept.  This alternate version is used to fill time and censor some dialog, most likely to make up for the time that has to be cut for cable viewing.This is a very chilling and frightening movie...the gore is a bit over the top, however.  If you see this movie for the first time, you'll probably end up getting sick to your stomach.  It usually takes the average person one or two sittings of the movie to become adjusted to level of gore.

            "content": "The Thing is not only the undisputed best sci-fi horror movie of all time, even topping Alien and Aliens, but probably one of the best movies ever made regardless the genre. Different genres make different movies and generate different emotions, of course, but this movie totally succeeds in evoking a lot of feelings, and doing everything right. It is truly a work of art \u2013 and I am not even talking about effects alone; they are still top notch today, simply incredible for 1982. The Casting is great; all characters are played well and they are all individuals, both fitting the profile of the person you would expect to work in remote areas, as well as making it convincing anyone could later be one of those Things also. Because the people in the movie are all so different, and yet all so human and convincing, it is as if you see the story unfold through your own eyes. This distance of observer to the subject is what great art can keep at bay, and this movie excels in it. All through the end the film stays utterly unpredictable, since almost never we get to know more than the guys in the movie. Therefore, again, it feels like we are there ourselves, cleverly creating a bond between us and the humans in the movie. We never know who is who, who will make it and who won't. But we all hope 'we' make it in the end. Just as in the people struggling for survival in the Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, we feel the sense of loss as the movie progresses and mankind is slowly but surely taken over; the powers and knowledge of the Alien power might be infinitely bigger than ours and its superiority is maybe meant to survive us, but what it lacks is of course emotion, feelings, all that makes humans to special and worth fighting for. The Thing also excels in storytelling. Take the beginning. Action and setting plus players straight away, the landscape of the Arctic, the eerie pulsating beat of the GREAT soundtrack (also 10/10, you just feel the gloomy future on mankind if the Thing gets into civilized areas), a helicopter chasing a dog, the crew just as us looking at it, thinking: what the Sam Hill? Just as them, we will soon find out. Great art, whether it is a story, a painting or a movie, plays cleverly with our unconscious desires, fears and fantasies. What is shown and not told, is in the Thing just as powerful as what is not shown, but only told, leaving it up to us to fantasize. Instead of showing the inside of the UFO, or how the alien looked like in the ice, we see a distant black and white video of the doomed crew in the snow, as if it was an old Arctic exploration team a hundred years ago. It would be tantalizing to see the UFO from the inside, and the Alien too, but to not do it is the perfect choice of the director, leaving it to our own fantasies to work it out, thus creating suspense. We know the alien is old, came from far away, imitated life on a million planets, is smart, powerful and now it wants us. Even the computer prognosis of 'doc' is creepy: if it reaches civilized areas, entire world copied in around three years. But do we really believe in 'this voodoo nonsense'? (Even the dialogues in the movie are 10 out of 10). We do when we see the character Bennings burnt down, howling, with hands half finished, half human, half the unimaginable monster that is underneath, we know the Thing might indeed truly be amongst us. Of course, in reality it probably taps the subject of humans themselves: we are all capable of love, but also of burning Jews in gas chambers. We have wonderful visions, we can be brave, but we also have nightmares and fears. Not all that is human we are proud of. Together with the big picture, also used in the Bodysnatchers, it is all about society getting violent and less human, no government after Nixon can be trusted, et cetera, further tapping in on paranoia. The Thing is maybe not so different from us, maybe it is already here, after all\u0085 What this movie DOES show,wow, how magnificent can special effects be? And how unpredictable? The shape shifting of one of them turning into a werewolf cum spider is unforgettable and still terrifying today when I see it. It was lucky CGI wasn't available then, making it all look more organic and realistic than any computer could have made it.The setting of the story, and the movie, is also great: a closed environment, violent weather outside, a violent unseen creature inside: suspense guaranteed. But to keep it from sagging, the story even succeeds changing in the end, when the Thing realizes it has no way out of there, and wants to freeze again, waiting for a possible rescue team to pick it up. It is then not anymore about who is who, but a race against the elements: who will be the last to die? If it is the Thing, mankind will be doomed in the future. In a grand finale we see the whole combined shapes into one monster creature, an idea taken over by James Cameron in the end of Terminator. So when the last remaining character suddenly appears and asks Kurt Russell 'did you kill it?', we know he did, or did he? Perfect dialogue again, indirect, since Kurt Russell replies: where were you? Well, he got lost in the storm and so it is the end, creepy and eerie to the last second: 'how do we make it?' 'Maybe we shouldn't?' Not only a 10 out of 10, but one in a million!",

I would hesitate to categorize it as horror, for there are no truly scary scenes in the film - the effect of the few \"jump shocks\", too, fade away too fast. Sfx-wise, true, the metamorphozing scenes from human to monster are well executed, but, beyond that, fail to terrify, or even, for that matter, to thrill. It's the usual man-versus-monster flick, with the majority falling prey, and a dismal few surviving ... if they do at all, that is.What succeeds for the film is the atmosphere ... set entirely against the blank snow and the claustrophobic environs of an Antarctic station, the blustering winds and flickering lights do build a sense of menace, which continues throughout its length. And to John Carpenter's credit, he does keep the audience guessing - who's man and who's monster? Performances are nothing to write home about ... it's one of Kurt Russell's earlier ventures, but, as is unavoidable in a film like this, he, like the other characters, has little do, except to try and set things right and restore some sort of equilibrium.But does he? You are still undecided about it at the end, and THAT's where 'The Thing' scores, and elevates itself above the routing creature flick which it otherwise, unquestionably, is.Otherwise passable, but worth a watch for the beginning, and the end.",

And that is was similar to Alien. That's all we knew and we didn't expect much. So the movie started and we giggled at the cheesy characters and bad haircuts (Kurt Russell, as always, is a gem), as you do. Then along came the scene where the dog mutated and we both fell silent in awe. Occasionally, one of us burst out saying \"WOW\". I could not have been more surprised or terrified.If you are a fan of over-the-top 80's gore effects, seen in e.g. Cronenberg movies or the Evil Dead trilogy, you are going to love The Thing. This movie went to such an extreme level of gory mutation and body horror that I can only really compare to the ending of The Fly. Yet, even if the extent to which the body horror is taken is some of the most extreme and in turn ridiculous I've seen in any movie of this kind so far, The Thing never loses its finesse. As horrific and disgusting as they are, you still always look forward to the next mutation scene, just to see what new thing they can think of next. The Thing is one of the absolutely most creative horror films I have ever seen.But The Thing was much more than just the gore. In this movie, John Carpenter once again proves he is the master of build-up. The tension, partially thanks to the skillful camera-work, never stop creeping under your skin throughout the story and never lets you stop keeping guessing. The characters themselves are unable to trust each other, and for the viewer, it never gets less obvious who you can trust or not. It manages to always keep you on the edge of your seat.The Thing only really falls short in the boring soundtrack and the flat characters with little to no personality, except for Kurt Russell, whose character is unnecessarily crass and hard to relate to as the hero of the story. But with that said, it's hard to believe the hatred the movie first got upon release (Roger Ebert, I'm looking at you!). The Thing is surprisingly enjoyable, especially for its genre, it really stands out.",

            "content": "Hidden gems are a beautiful thing. I'm writing this in hopes of exposing this amazing movie. I saw this on a list of the best horror movies of all time and it piqued my interest. I'm normally not a big horror fan because the acting and storyline are usually \"Horrible\" (ha ha). With this movie though, it's a much different story. This is the best role I've seen Kurt Russell do. He plays a leader of a group of people doing scientific expedition in the Antarctic. I think it's safe to say that there is some \"Thing\" on the loose. A monster that can imitate the form of any person or animal. This ability is reason why the film is so amazing. At any moment you don't know who is a thing or who is human. If you've ever played the party game Mafia you'll get a kick out of the situation.Throughout the movie the director builds suspense at a steady rate. By the end I was holding my breath to see what would happen to the main character. The gruesome deaths and the monster might be too much for some people. The Thing is essentially a giant pile of gore with tentacles. The special effects still hold up today. I was cringing in a couple of the scenes. This is one of the goriest films I've ever watched. You've been warned. The environment in the movie is a large research building in a remote snow filled area. It adds a lot of memorable atmosphere and ambiance. Near the end it gets dark outside the characters have to use flares to see and they can't go outside for a long time without risking freezing to death. The thing one the other hand only can survive in freezing temperatures, so the crew is at a big disadvantage. They try to burn him to death with flamethrowers, the keyword there is try. He is like a virus that you just can't get rid of. He is horrifying. I'd suggest watching this one after you've had plenty of life experience. Watch it too early and you're liable to be scared for life. Luckily I'm thoroughly desensitized by now.I'm telling you, if you have Netflix and don't mind some extreme gore watch this as soon as you can. You're in for an amazing experience. This is now my favorite horror movie of all time. I'd give this movie a 9/10.tkubas1.wordpress.com",

I have added The Thing to my best movies list after recently watching it. It is about a shapeshifting creature from space that terrorizes an outpost crew, both physically and psychologically. As the capabilities of the Thing's abilities are known to the crew, they all begin to suspect each other of being infected. The Thing does not just involve a monster that kills people. It also involves paranoia, and if you give it a second watch, you'll find that there's more depth to it than you could possibly imagine. A lot of scenes are left to you to decide what happened, mostly you will asking yourself when a crew member was infected and by which form of The Thing. There is a lot of gore in this movie, though some of the blood definetly looked like ketchup. Rob Bottin's fantastic work on the thing will make many cringe when they look at it. This movie is 90 minutes long, but the content could more than easily have been expanded to 110 minutes and that is my only complaint. Other than that, The Thing is an excellent science fiction thriller that is a must watch for any science fiction fan.",

            "content": "Easily John Carpenter's best film, \"The Thing\" is that rarest of movie rarities -- a remake of a classic film that is every bit as good as the original.  Backed by a pounding, heartbeat-like synthesizer score from the brilliant Ennio Morricone, \"The Thing\" opens (following a pre-titles UFO \"teaser\") with striking, beautifully choreographed images of a low flying helicopter chasing a dog through a desolate, frozen landscape.  The finale is just as stunningly filmed, the story bleakly and ambiguously ending in that same landscape awash in redhot flames.  In between, \"The Thing\" offers some of the most potently horrific sequences ever shot. John W. Campbell's original short story \"Who Goes There?\" is followed much more closely here than in Howard Hawks' version, resulting in some awesomely effective man-to-monster transformations.  Although these make-up effects have been much copied since 1982, the film has lost little of its power to shock even the most jaded of horror fans.  Carpenter's direction is stylish and assured, filling almost every sequence with the maximum amount of dread and suspense possible.  Add Morricone's thumping, eerie music to the mix and you end up with one of the most terrifying of all movie experiences.  (The DVD and laser disc versions are highly recommended, crammed as they are with wonderful additional goodies, including a shot-by-shot audio track discussion by Carpenter and star Kurt Russell, as well as an informative eighty minute documentary of the film's production.)",

Sure someone will look for them eventually, but carpenter does a great job of making us forget that, the characters could easily just wait it all out in a room but they are unable to trust each other and cooperate, their emotions get the better of them, sure we all in the comfort of our home would say \"if I was in this situation id think of a simple and safe solution, LIKE JUST WAITING FOR THE RESCUE TEAM\" but nobody would trust you. What if there's a thing loose that they missed? What if they think YOU are alien and you want to wait for the rescue team, not to mention almost nobody would believe you even if you got rescued. \"they all have cabin fear, they're all crazy\" your \"rescuers\" would say. Its so terrifying because the characters are all basically on their own, there is nobody they can trust except for themselves, and even then, would you know if you were an alien? Does the thing make a copy of you, or does the thing take over you? How would we know? Its so carefully crafted that yeah sure the special effects are scary, but even if you cut some of the gory parts out, or removed them entirely, this would still be my favourite horror movie, i dont like it because of the effects, i like it because of the psychological horror, almost any person placed in this situation would go crazy. 10/10.",

He had Halloween, a landmark film for horror, the very good \"The Fog\" and the cult classic \"Escape from New York\" under his belt, so he tried his hand on sci-fi/horror combination (two genres which he knew best).The thing succeeds because people like to see gore, and while that concept was sort of new to Carpenter (earlier movies were almost goreless), he succeeds in making one of the gorest films in history.While the movie sometimes moves at a glacial pace, the story is well developed (like an X-files episode), the characters are at least identifable (sometimes, movies with alot of people in situations, I sometimes forget whose who!).  Not really scary, there is a lot of suspense and tension built up, because1. The people don't know who the alien (thing) is and2. They don't seem to like each other and would have no problems blowing each other away.For a good movie (skip the popcorn on this one), with the right mood music, darkened lighting, plenty of gore and tense atmospherical cinematography, try out \"The Thing\"",

The Thing was initially a critical and commercial failure (many factors have been blamed, from the gory effects work, its release in the wake of the more happy E.T.), but it did not take long for critics and audiences to finally come round and see what a fantastic movie it really is.Closer to the short story Who Goes There? by John W Campbell Jr, than its previous cinematic incarnation, the 1951 classic The Thing From Another World, this presents a harrowing story of a group of isolated individuals who find themselves locked in a desperate struggle against a terrifying alien lifeform that has the ability to absorb and imitate its victims, and whose very existence threatens the human race. The protagonists, including a terrific Kurt Russell, find themselves battling the creature and its growing number of human impersonators, with the battle taking some interesting turns. Besides the personal battles, with flamethrowers at the ready when a human reveals his true nature, the creature often tries to throw a spanner in the works by playing off on their paranoia, making them mistrust each other, even setting up characters to make others think they're imitations.When the imitations reveal their alien nature, we are presented with some still-awe-inspiring special effects, both highly imaginative and bizarrely grotesque. The creature alters bone structure and ruptures skin during its transformations, providing some truly horrifying and iconic imagery. Ennio Morricone's creepy doom-laden score fits the film well (how it came to be nominated for a Razzie is bewildering). The cast are all excellent, direction is perfect, here's a film where everything fits perfectly. Bonus points for a brilliantly ambiguous ending (thankfully a planned \"happy ending\" was dropped).",

Not only is it able to absorb living creatures, it is able to morph into all of them, or mix them together to become as deadly as it possibly can.Now, remember that this monster doesn't just absorb the body, it also absorbs the mind of it's victim. By doing that, it is a growing mixture of different psychologies, with their instabilities, their fears, their hatred. So, it's not just a physical monster, but an insane one as well.John Carpenter's The Thing is a fantastic movie, where horror and insanity walk hand in hand in a tragic descent into hell. Twenty years after it's making, it still stands out of the crowd as one of the freakiest horror movies ever made. Surprisingly, the old fashioned visual effects benefit the film, by giving it a different kind of realism that we're just not used to see anymore.

John Carpenter and Kurt Russell manage to blow up a huge chunk of Antarctica in this brilliantly gory film, that portrays extra-terrestrials not as Reese's Pieces eating domiciles but graphic shape-shifters that slaughter dogs, not too mention, well, all of the cast. The mood of the movie is summed up by MacReady's speech halfway through briefly after the barbecuing of an alien replicate; \"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable out in the open.\" It goes without saying that out in the open is below 40 - a testament to 1980's science fiction fatalism that ranges from the apocalyptic future of The Terminator to the selfish corporatism of Aliens - as the base members either become devoured or go insane. Stepping up as the unlikely hero is the protesting helicopter pilot John MacReady, who takes to wearing a cheerful sombrero and gets steadily drunker as the other men drop like flies. 'Cabin fever' seem to be the key words when the survivors barricade themselves in; The Thing is the best fictional depiction of paranoia bar none. Even MacReady threatens to set off explosives when he is subjected to an inquiry. Following the routine thriller build-up of viewing a previous team's demise and Kurt Russell yelling \"Sweden!\", the movie does not offer an uplifting moral or ending - the team is seen as inevitably doomed and its a matter of taking the alien down with them. The movie supplies some eye-popping moments such as an unfortunate chap getting his arms bitten off by a stomach with fangs and a head detaching from a body and scurrying around on stalk legs (cue the token stoner to exclaim \"You gotta be f*cking kidding.\") John Carpenter delivers in this organic matter-spattering classic, the gruesome effects and the suffocating atmosphere still a good time almost a quarter-century on.

Admittedly, the FX are not the greatest by modern standards, 1982 predated common use of CGI to show us what an alien monster is \"supposed\" to look like, and the movie may overdo the visuals a little, but Carpenter IS a horror director after all and we pay to see the gore and slime, don't we?While the story of otherworldly threats to man, particularly those that hide inside people, like Alien, is always good for visceral creep, what really makes The Thing shine is its use and portrayal of psychological fear. Carpenter already has a solid grasp of the tools of the trade, with the creepy Ennio Morricone theme, the frozen, dark wasteland setting outside and the claustrophobic shacks inside, the questions and guesswork he leaves you with to guess at what happened that he didn't show, and has a solid cast including Kurt Russell, Keith David, Richard Masur, Richard Dysart, Donald Moffat, Wilford Brimley to work with.  But the real effect of this movie is in its portrayal of all too real human fears under such circumstances.  The isolation of being stuck on a continent that's a frozen wasteland with only a few people for months, 1000 miles away from aid, an inhospitable and deadly environment outside that forces people into close confines, the manifestations of anxiety, paranoia, cabin fever and how all the characters react differently to it make this movie very accessible and believable. Carpenter could have completely deleted the alien altogether and this would still be an effective scary story about people forced together in an isolated and inhospitable place who begin to turn on each other, something that can and does happen to people in such circumstances.Kurt Russell does excellently as the macho, practical, \"let's find this sucker and get it\" protagonist, as does Keith David, whose skeptical, and sees the other men, Russell in particular, as as much of a threat as the alien, Wilford Brimley as the scientist who recognizes the threat before anyone else and is intent on stopping it before it can get out, everyone else be damned.This is Carpenter's best work to date.",

Carpenter turns what would've been a lesser film in the hands of another(except possibly the great Quentin Tarantino)into a slam packed film in which the suspense is great and the various revelations pose more questions than answers. Kurt Russell oozes cool as helicoper pilot MacReady who only wants to get out of Anarctica and go home. The plot is one of my favorite aspects of the film: a remote Antarctic research station is infiltrated by a creature that is thousands of years old and can assimilate any body and become a carbon copy. Paranoia and fear run rampant as the residents try to discover which one of them isn't who they claim to be. The writing can get corny at times but the script hold tight enough. Carpenter's direction in the horror genre is untouchable and this film is a glaring example of why. Upon first viewing it instantly became a favorite of mine, and I hate horror.Should tell you something about the quality, kids.",

In this movie we are treated to some intense, for the time, special effects, and some of the best acting from Kurt Russell ever seen. This is a classic sci-fi/horror movie that takes the original, 1951 The Thing from Another World, to a totally new level.  The original is somewhat tame, but really cool B&W 50's monster movie stuff.  John Carpenter took this concept and put a few twists around it.  In the original a military outpost in the Arctic finds a spaceship complete with alien.  They thaw it out and find out that it eats human blood and is part plant and part animal. In the new version, the setting is Antarctica, the group is civilian and the alien is found by a group of 'crazy swedes'.  This alien is a little different as well, instead of eating human blood it 'eats' or replicates organic tissue.  This makes it a mimic, able to replicate and consume any organism that it has contact with.  This leads to suspicion, who is real and who is the thing?, and eventually to murder and complete destruction.  My favorite  line has to be when the group locks Kurt Russell's character McCready outside in the storm because they think he might be a thing and when he tries to get back in they say, \"What if we are wrong?  Well then we're wrong.\"  The suspicion between the characters is sometimes palatable and  I could feel the isolation and desperation from them.In the end, the whole camp is destroyed and only two characters are left alive, to slowly freeze to death.  And we as the audience are left with the question, are they real or are they the thing?  Well done, and one of my favorites.  9 out of 10 due to some poor intial dialog.  Also has a great soundtrack.",

ET stole the thunder from this film, but now it is a classic. There are some really crazy monster effects in this movie, most of them rather bizarre, but if you have seen John Carpenter movies before than you know what kind of bizarre to expect.Kurt Russell is very cool in this movie as he and the other men at the Antarctic facility try and fight off this nearly invincible foe. The monster and Kurt Russell are the whole reason to watch this movie, so if you plan on watching a conspiracy sci-fi movies, don't bother with The Thing, because this is just monsters, flame throwers, and snow, very simple stuff.This is probably my favorite sci-fi movie next to Alien and Aliens, and I think any fan of Kurt Russell, John Carpenter, or big, slimy, human killing, body transforming, mutant space creatures will love this movie. To me, Escape From New York and The Thing are John Carpenter's two best movies, so check out one or the other if your a fan of cult sci-fi classics. 9/10",

Staying true to the spirit of Joseph Campbell's short story WHO GOES THERE? (the basis for Howard Hawks' original b/w version) Carpenter's THE THING brought Rob Bottin's mechanical special effects into the realm of high art. The original story is an allegorical tale of the fear and paranoia created by the anti-communist sentiment pervading the 1950 / 60s USA. Communist paranoia was transposed into Sci-Fi / monster movie in Hawks' version but Carpenter, having no need for this in the 80s, brings a contemporary fear to his version - that of illness. Carpenter's version plays on our fear of what may be inside us or those close to us (a type of left wing horror - fear of ourselves as opposed to right wing horror - fear of them) whether it be disease such as aids or mental illness, it is this kind of atmosphere that saturates this film and is made manifest by Bottin's truly viscerally terrifying special effects. Every aspect of the film is top notch: the acting (with the ever excellent Kurt Russell and a magic ensemble cast), the cinematography from Australian DP Dean Cundy (long time JC collaborator), the effects (as mentioned), the amazing snow covered exteriors and Carpenter's effective, intelligent, economical directing.

The monsters seem to come out of some other movies like Alien but it wasn't the same thing.  The only thing that the movie could have done better was the performance of Russell, I don't think he is a bad actor, I just thought that the character that he portrait did have a resemblance to the character that he played on \u0091Escape From New York and L.A.' and so on, but that was the only fault that I found.

            "content": "What induces the most horror? Many different people will offer many different answers to this simple yet profound question. One of my strongest fears would stem from isolation. Not having any source of protection for myself would be a nightmare, but what I am trying to say is that I think the strongest stimuli of fear would be anything that triggers our vulnerability as human beings. I personally love to watch horror films not only for the thrill of the scare, but for its atmosphere for I feel it plays just as big of an influence on our senses just as much the plot.That isolated atmosphere plays a strong role in triggering a feeling of dread in obvious films being Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (my personal favorite horror film) and Ridley Scott's Alien. Both are able to utilize this idea, but in ways that are each unique to its own story, and that could very well be said about the remake of 'The Thing.' In comparison to 'Alien,' it has that element of science fiction, but it not only gives a feeling of doom in its environment, but it also manages to evoke feelings of paranoia through the characters. While 'Alien' and 'The Shining' feel isolated, you also feel a sense of possible danger from anyone of the characters featured in and that is where that feeling of vulnerability is triggered while watching 'The Thing.' While in other horror movies, we may know who or what we're running from, but it seems in 'The Thing,' we lack that awareness and there is no place to escape.This is a bleak film that will leave its mark on you that will get under your skin. There are grotesque moments, but the fascinating thing about it is that it uses no flashy CGI effects and the realism makes everything from the blood and gore really shock inducing. I would also like to add that the look of the alien monster is just as grotesque and manages to instill fear. While the alien in 'Alien' is horrifying, the creature in 'The Thing' is a much more rabid beast that will brutally kill anything to adapt. The scary thing about the 'thing' as compared to the alien from 'Alien' is it possesses no emotion and that is what gives these creatures the edge over humans.I cannot recommend this film enough to fans or the horror genre. It is definitely a must see, not only for it being scary, but also utilizing the feeling of fear in its own unique way with its acting performances, set pieces, choreography, designs, and especially its story. If you are looking for a horror film that is memorable, then do yourself a favor and watch 'The Thing.'",

Rob Bottin should have got a knighthood for the SFX. Carpenter has captured the Antarctic landscape and it really makes you feel cold. This movie has so much going for it.

This is (eschatological/end of time)philosophy at its best, the thoughts of losing your identity and not knowing it is, difficult and existentialist at its base.Though the sheer terror in this movie, the shocking moments--the reviving scene, dog pens, worm-generator room well as the pernicious mood that soaks into the audience via the confined spaces, single-gender cast, and severe isolation of Antarctica in the northern hemisphere Summer. Probably John Carpenter's best film, technically and emotionally.If you cannot stomach gore, tingling fear-suspense, sparse set design, acting, direction, lighting, music and love happy endings: you should turn the channel--you will be sick as a dog--pun intended.If only my college philosophy professor at Hofstra had showed this instead of reading Heidegger I might have gotten his point.

They have tried big budget movies with big explosions (Demolition Man), and incredibly horrific special effects (Braindead). Did those make great films? No. But John Carpenter just turns round and hands us `The Thing'. This film is very disturbing in it's gruesome special effects, but also supplies us with a fantastic cast, top-class dialogue, engrossing plot, beautiful shots, and most of all, scares.With most people, this is without a doubt in their top 5 horror/sci-fi films. This may not be as scary as Carpenters closer movie to this, Prince Of Darkness, but the overall quality is so unbelievable, it is a film you will want to see again, next time with a bigger screen and better sound.\nFor once in a film like this, you will actually care about the cast. Here they are all referred to as their second name. The film constantly asks you questions; `Who is the thing?' and `Who is human?' Most films that ask you questions always make you keen to watch. And it works here. I refuse to spoil the film, but `the thing' itself is a shape-shifter, and can decide to take on human-like structures and their attributes. Let's cut to it, some of the cast are actually `the thing', and they remaining humans have to find out who isn't human. All this 1000 miles away in the Antarctic, with no contact with outsiders. The `things' themselves are pretty horrifying. They imitate human cells and morph into all sorts of shapes and sizes. The first example of this is where some huskies have been `digested', or `absorbed' by the thing, their severed heads appear all over a horrific meat-like structure with eyes. The special effects actually look real, which makes a change from all this modern-day CGI garbage. A horrible sight indeed. The `thing' appears even more terrifying later on in the film. Anyway, the acting is superb. Unlike 90% of horror movies, the cast aren't so stupid as to confront the entity. I don't care who you are, you don't confront a head which has just spawned spiders legs. Here, they run away. Nice to see a normal reaction like this. The way the whole thing is filmed is absolutely beautiful. We get atmospheric shots of the desolate station without time wasting like we saw in `The Shining'. The way the next shot can be presented as the present when in fact it's the future works tremendously well. Like for example in the blood test scene (for me, the tensest scene in movie history). I love the way Kurt Russell takes charge of the whole situation, it really brings his character out. Kurt Russell in good film shock! The lighting is absolutely spot on, it creates an awesome isolating atmosphere. Whilst the blood-and-gore factor in this film is rather high, at no point does it carry the film. The Thing has everything else just right to justify their presence. Even Clive Barkers Hellraiser or Braindead didn't create such warped sights as this, and this works when presented as serious!\nJohn Carpenters best piece of work. An absolute must-see film. A classic.5/5",

But The Thing made me feel truly scared after a long time.So why is it so good? Well I will try to say why without spoiling the movie. First of all the characters. The characters in this movie take most of the time (if not all the time) smart and good decisions in order to defeat or hide from the Thing. The movie doesn't spent time talking about their heritage or their family status and I think that's better from making us feel bad about them when they die. Also the performance of the actors is really good Second the story. The story develops really well but I am not going to say more about it in order not to spoil the experience. Third the atmosphere. The movie takes place in a research facility in Antarctica which make's the atmosphere more scary because you know that whatever the characters do they are truly alone and helpless while being miles away from civilization.And last let's talk about the main star of the movie The Thing. This creature is the most scary and the most disgusting thing(pun not intended) I have seen in my life and from what I said at the begging you can understand that this says a lot. I am not going to say what it's this creature main ability but I am going to say that: when it transforms it makes you disgusted and afraid. This movie has the guts to show you the transformation of The Thing in full screen and with every detail. What makes it even more scary it's the fact that the whole Thing is practical effect. I kid you not, the guys that did the effects made everything from the ground up without the use of CGI. Whatever you see, no matter how hard it is to believe, its indeed not cgi. Well, that's everything I have to say about this movie and I want to believe that I convinced you to watch it the movie without ruining the surprises. 10/10",

There is never any interaction between the cast and the alien (except for when the doctor looses his hands, that part doesn't make sense btw., why does the replicant suddenly collapse?) Sure, the ones infected/taken over/copied must have interacted with it, but every time the alien shows itself it never does anything. It's just there, as if its gross appearance and sounds would be enough. It almost is, but...

            "content": "The time-honed story of a small band of people trapped in the middle of nowhere facing an unknowable, unstoppable entity is one that never seems to get old. Far from being purely the realm of dumb slasher films, the best examples of this genre are brilliantly taut exercises in primal dread. Classics such as the original Alien are apex examples of this type of story.The Thing is one of the more influential entries into the genre, pitting a team of Antarctic surveyors against a shape-shifting alien capable of perfectly imitating other lifeforms. The premise here is simple but effective - if the eponymous thing can replicate anyone perfectly, then who can you trust? Who is human, and who is not? It's a brilliant idea with endless potential for suspense and paranoia.Sadly, despite the high praise The Thing has garnered, I found it to be a rather sub-par splatter film, sacrificing logic and tension for the sake of gory excess and contrived story turns. That isn't to say the film is without its merits, it's just that director John Carpenter seems to have little interest in exploiting them. For every scene of slow-creeping dread where the ambiguity of the characters' predicament threatens to unnerve the audience, there has to be a protracted sequence of comically over-the-top gore to suck out every ounce of tension that proceeded it.The special effects in this film are indeed technically impressive and creative, but the end result is absurd and indulgent. Nothing is left to the imagination once the thing reveals itself - every sickly gooey detail has to be shown plain-as-day without the slightest attempt at subtlety or hiding the unknown. I even burst at laughing at several moments from the absurdity of the gore, which I'm pretty sure isn't the intended effect in a film as bleak as this one.The story itself doesn't fare much better - characters are constantly wandering off or otherwise finding contrived reasons to be on their own, even after the true nature of the thing becomes fully apparent. This is repeated so frequently, especially during the finale, that I pretty much ceased to care about the fate of any of the characters - they act so unremittingly stupid that it becomes less about the slyness of the mysterious life-form and more about the laziness of the screenwriter to imagine a more believable excuse for characters to be separated for one another.The Thing has its moments of course. The infamous blood test scene brings the skill of the cast to heel in horrific vividness, the audience hanging on every beat as the inevitable payoff of the scene draws ever closer. But even this must end with a drawn-out sequence of nauseating splatter to deflate the suspense the past few minutes constructed so effectively. Every thriller/horror film is based around the peaks-and-troughs of tension and release, but The Thing makes these troughs more exhausting than chilling, inducing fatigue where there should be ever-present dread.In short, The Thing strands an excellent cast and an atmospheric setting in the middle of a contrived story punctuated by extended moments of putrid icky gore. There are flashes of brilliance where the promising premise of paranoia shines through, but for me this was mostly drowned out by a deeply-flawed plot built around dull stock characters acting with blithe stupidity. If I were more predisposed to gore, I might have enjoyed the film's macabre visual imagination, but in the absence of any meaningful substance, The Thing instead left me out in the cold.",

            "content": "old movies bring back memories, let's face it.  it's not the quality of the story line, acting, music score or cinema photography that necessarily draws us back in, it's instead what the film represents in terms of remembering where we were, who we were with and what we were doing in our life at the time of the films original release.I watched this movie again the other night, 20 years after I saw it in the theater.  In 1982 it scared the hell out of me and I felt it was one of the most suspenseful films I had ever seen (to that point).  Re-watching it, this time with my 16 year old, I found it somewhat hokey, and my daughter's laughter (at the gruesome parts) reconfirmed what I already knew: what scared people in '82 is not what keeps them on the edge of their seats in '02.  Our kids are used to a world of realism (a.k.a. terrorists) and mutating organisms just don't hold them spellbound.Still, I really like this movie, even after all this time has elapsed.  In an age where most special effects are 100% computer generated, I found this film's most gruesome scenes original and refreshing (for they were 'state of the art' back then).  At the risk of dating myself (I've already done that!) I have to say that I'm more drawn to this genre of film circa early 80's style, than I am to most of the content that comes from Hollywood today. I also love the character development on display here.  It's great stuff.I never saw the 1950's version of this flik.  I was plenty satisfied with this one.",

All of the actors (especially Wilford Brimley)execute their lines and actions very well, and they make it seem like the characters handle situations much like a real group of people would. another great aspect of the film is the atmosphere presented in each set and location. all of the suspense is well executed and the scares are not expected upon first viewing. the kills (or transformations rather)are inventive and truly frightening. This movie was ahead of it's time for 1982, and remains an essential classic for any horror fan.i just hope that it won't be remade like the fog, another Carpenter classic.",

The tautness of the film is astounding; the tone is constantly tense due to the story's inherently suspenseful nature.

There is absolutely no way to predict what will transpire - the possibilities are endless.  One of the most open-ended incredible plots ever, and beautifully filmed by Carpenter and realized by Rob Bottin (note the thank you to none other than Stan Winston at the end of the film.)  Yes thank you Stan.  The effects are amazing - especially for the time - but as another reviewer has aptly stated, they are always secondary to the story.  And of course Keith David rocks.

If you want to see the REAL \"Thing\", go watch the classic film from the 1950's. Now that one was scary and with a decent ending. John Carpenter may be great but, in my opinion, he totally missed it with this one and wasn't even close to the '50s version. In the original version, everyone in the theater, both kids and adults were on the edge of their seats and everyone was talking about the movie after they left the theater. This version started out much the same as the original one but deviated, dramatically, as it progressed. I saw the original as a kid and it scared the heck out of me. I even had nightmares about it that night. The only thing I might say about the original is that it was in black and white and it MAY have been better had it been in color, which was not that common back at that time. This one should have had a totally different title because it really was nothing compared to the 50's version. I've never understood why screen writers, producers,directors, etc. think they are better than the original. Boo-Hiss.",

Since very young John Carpenter has been a director which has produced movies that I still today consider one of my favorites namely: Escape from New York and Big Trouble in Little China. It was in my later years I started to appreciate more the horror genre and that is a lot thanks to Halloween, Prince of Darkness and of course this movie the Thing. John Carpenter has an extraordinary ability to build the story in all of his movies in such a way that you feel you are just drawn into the movie, slowly but surely. There are many ways to do a horror movie and how you as a director decides to scare the audience. Many movies relies heavily on gore or visual effects, however, Carpenter has never gone that route but instead he has focused on building a great story where the suspense develops gradually. The intro song to the movie is an excellent example of his art of making horror movies.\nIn my opinion that is a far better way to scare someone than blood splashing on the screen. When you watch this movie then it's not the gore (which it does have also) that scares you the most but that it's the feeling that you feel you are becoming paranoid about what's really happening and that is by far the best way to really scare someone.\nIf you like horror movies this is a must see, if you like good movies in general, then this is also a must see. Thank you John Carpenter for showing us that a great movies doesn't have to necessary cost a fortune.",

The cinematography and sound are dead-on, as are the performances turned in by a fine cast.  Kurt Russel is fantastic -- I can't imagine the movie having been made with any other lead. The story is as perfect as it is simplistic.  And the creature effects are astounding considering the film's age.  This is a movie that you can really lose yourself in -- that you can imagine the character's plight as your own. Such an internalizing aspect is difficult to achieve in the cinema, and credit goes to Mr. Carpenter for the astounding job he did modernizing a cheesy old B-move.  \"The Thing\" is a real treat for those who haven't yet seen it.",

Stuart- Who goes there? This movie centered around paranoia, which makes for a much better story than the 1951 version. And FX wiz Rob Bottin raised the bar for alien special effects in this 1982 classic, which was a dud a box office. The digital, anamorphic version is nearly perfect, with rich color reproductions. And plenty of extras that satisfy even the most hardcore fans. Lead star Kurt Russell joins John Carpenter for the commentary track. Their recollections reveal many interesting behind the scenes stories. Finally, Ennio Morricone's hauntingly beautiful, dissonant score is a perfect match for this very scary, very dark film.

            "content": "In Antarctica, date 1982, Outpost 31 for the US National Science Foundation, is called to arms by the rude invasion of a helicopter piloted by crazed Norwegians aboard armed to the teeth from a neighboring camp a hundred or so miles away. They are carrying out a mission to blow one of their own sled dogs to kingdom come that's currently due inbound. Cue Wagner's Flight Of The Valkyries.Well, these Norwegians are wussies. First it is revealed they have lost their minds during the first week of winter only after two months spent at their base camp but they can't shoot worth their water either.It is obvious they pursued their dog for miles from base camp over level, expansive snow and clear skies never managing to inflict a single scratch upon the animal. (Recall the words of Bennings \"an hour there, an hour back\" before Copper and Mac left to investigate the Norwegian camp.) Scoped semi-automatic assault rifles firing supersonic bullets, box of grenades, and a hovering helicopter capable of airspeeds upwards of 130-150 mph all fails to stop this dog. The Nords had game and should have enjoyed the proverbial kerosene bonfire and been back before dinner. No matter, relating to a future incident in the movie.But these, Norwegians are scientists, we learn, so what do they know? The terrifying secret about the dog, desperately they do.That is just the beginning of the flaws inherent to The Thing.The movie is the second and more faithful adaptation of \"Who Goes There?\" a 1938 John W Campbell Jr novella about scientists stationed in the Antarctica that uncover a buried spacecraft and a virtually frozen live hostile alien that can assume any identity of any victim it digests.In JC's version, Outpost 31 is run by a loose crew of 12 men, namely scientists, doctors, pilots, mechanics, a radio operator, a dog handler, and a cook. The story takes places over three days and three nights. Once the members of Outpost 31 learn their new canine guest that very same evening is not what it appears to be, a tidal wave of fear and distrust amongst themselves soon engulfs the whole camp for the same reason after their scientists learn the true nature of this alien menace and the frightening implications it presents to the whole population of Earth abroad.They've been out of radio contact two weeks and good old natural paranoia builds in this barren isolated microcosm where no one trusts anyone anymore. Their situation motions from grim to even worse when they lose their radio and the copter to one of their doctors whom went over the bend and they're forced to lock him up in the tool shed outside under heavy sedation. Meanwhile, the alien goes to work either assimilating or killing the crew members off one-by-one or vice versa. The coffee pot is on the burner, a bloody sleepless attrition has begun. A hypothetical solution how to identify their alien perpetrator is finally agreed upon by blood test which leads into the movie's best moments during the long third climatic night.Where The Thing consistently misfires is the fact, the suspense is poorly executed, too reliant upon a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of gross-out special effect wizardry provided by Rob Bottin for shock rather than playing more upon the audience's imaginations for scares. A limp cast provides lackluster underdeveloped alien fodder without an ounce of sympathetic qualities. It would benefit if I actually cared about these characters thereby partook in their helpless terror. But sadly I don't. Every scene and nearly every line of dialogue is suffused with acid resentment, sarcasm, or condescension. Outpost 31 spares viewers of any warmth, any camaraderie amongst courageous human endeavor, and any heroes... Carpenter proceeds to fill every slot in the cylinders with mean getting nastier cyphers then mechanically pulls both triggers. No, the real hero is the alien itself the remaining real actors are an inevitable foaming mad beast, hamstrung and bleeding to death. The constant tension and grudging social pockets amongst these Americans at Outpost 31 is evident they were already on the verge a Chernobyl meltdown, thing or no thing. Their unexpected visitor only triggered it. Then I clap and cheer when the credits finally roll.Some reasons instrumental to my sentiments is 1) no emotional investment in any of the characters 2) it telegraphs all it's terror moments. Viewers know when something is going to happen because the movie takes the audience by the hands... walking them through it.Final notes, the amazing score of Ennio Morricone provides the proper downbeat atmosphere. The Thing proved capable of superhuman feats and genius throughout the movie chiefly displayed during the insurmountable task of engineering an underground workshop and one incomplete spacecraft furnished from the remains of Mac's helicopter and other flotsam jetsam lying about in less than two or three days. Survivor of unknown worlds. The Thing survived beneath the Antarctic ice for 100s of thousands of years. A creature with a nature so ingenious and alien, it can perfectly assimilate any other lifeforms in matter of mere moments right down to every quirk and eccentricity and minute detail in brilliant natural mimicry to be entirely unidentifiable from the original. How difficult can 12 grizzled, snowbound, isolated, and grumpy lonely men be, eh?PS In reality international law forbids flamethrowers and weapons caches such as found in Outpost 31.",

This review is for the Collector's Edition DVD.To me, how a DVD is constructed is as important as the content itself. Unlike most DVDs that force you to sit through warnings that noone reads and studio logos that nobody cares about, this DVD gets it right.  You drop the DVD in your player and it plays the movie just like you would see it in the theater.  Studio logo followed by opening credits.I absolutely love the opening sequence of music and credits followed by the helicopter chasing the dog.  You are instantly thrust into the madness caused by the alien intruder and the ride continues until the movie ends. It is never boring, yet doesn't rush the storyline and dialog like so much of Hollywood drek these days.I recently saw Alien and thought about the similarities to The Thing.  In the end, I have to say The Thing may be a better movie for one reason - it is closer to home - i.e. planet Earth.  Each movie rates in my top ten, but I have to put The Thing one notch higher than Alien.The extras on the CD are a mixed bag.  The interviews with cast and crew are quite good, with a fully produced sequence, including clever variances of the title sequence.

This was the first DVD I bought, and recently, TNT showed this on TV. Curious to see how this was edited for TV, I tivo'd it and was quite surprised to see additional narration and scenes, lines of dialogue were added here and there, and there was an additional ending of maybe 20-30 seconds that showed the smoke from the ruined compound and a dog once again running across the snow. The characters were all introduced at the beginning by a narrator, which while interesting to me, seemed distracting.Why do I love this movie so much? For one thing, modern moviemakers could learn a thing or three from this, as the movie posits a number of questions that are open-ended. What happens in the end? Well, if you watch Contact, everything is explained to you, which ruins the movie really (why is there hours of static?) Why did they do this? Are we as an audience so jaded that we have to have every nuance explained to us?I've seen this movie many many times, and here are some thoughts:1) I'm still not sure how Mac's clothes get found ripped up here and there, but my feeling is that this is Blair's doing.2) How the team decends into paranoia is enthralling. I've rivited to the screen everytime. When the corpse moves in the supply room with Bennings in the background...I get chills everytime.3) The soundtrack...gotta love it, a true classic. Maybe 3 notes and it speaks volumes.4) My feeling is that Childs was paranoid, but saw Blair towards the end and ran out into the snow after him. Childs never caught up to him and got disoriented in the storm.5) Still not 100% on how Fuchs dies (burned up in the snow, but how?), but my feeling is this is Blair again.Best scene? I have several candidates, such as when Norris' stomach implodes, when the Norwegian frantically digs in the snow and the grenade goes off, or when Blair appears behind Garry, but I really love when they find Mac holding the dynamite and the flare.haven't seen it? you're in for a real treat.",

It's the way the ending is left completely ambigious, something Hollywood seems to have forgotten how to do. Remember Contact? Why have \"we have 17 hours of footage\" comment at the end instead of leaving it ambigious, promoting eternal wonderment and use of your imagination to decide for yourself how it all turned out.

The story/plot action characters all gel so superbly I don't think a review can justify the end result. It can be labelled a horror sci-fi suspense thriller action movie all rolled into one. Nothing beats the old style special effects not a blue/green screen in sight! The performances churned out by an ordinary cast is brilliant and yes I'm saying it was an almost ordinary cast minus Kurt Russell Keith David (Childs)and possibly Donald Moffat (Garry)but you know what I mean. I remember watching this movie when I was 10 and then I definitely thought horror but as I've watched it progressively over the years each time I find myself classing it as something else sometimes even as a murder mystery! The setting works well and the film never seems to lack pace from a never ending twisting plot that keeps you guessing all the way to the end. If you've not seen it I don't know what you're waiting for. No really I don't know what are you waiting for go watch it now you won't be disappointed.",

Unlike that flick though, The Thing still manages to hold up in the horror department due largely in my opinion to three things: Its gruesomely creative effects, an eerie and scary setting, and possibly its tense and involving storyline. Hell, it even made Wilfred Brimley scary. Trust me if you like old school horror films, not the overly derivative and boring stalker killing dozens upon dozens of uninteresting teenagers who seem to think sex and booze are the national pass time, pick up the DVD( Like Halloween widescreen is the only way to go to get the true effect of Carpenters film ).

You could make the argument that this is just another alien rip-off placing the characters in an unescapable environment. But that is just the thing! The alternatives given to the characters are simple: Freezing your brains out or facing the monster. This is just the stuff to give you the creeps and this film truly does that.

            "content": "John Carpenter's remake of 'The Thing' was buried at the box office by another visitor from outer space that went by the name of 'E.T.' But the passage of time has seen this movie gain a serious following thanks to home video, and many people now view 'The Thing' as one of the all-time great horror/sci-fi films.A group of researchers at an Antarctic science facility are unwittingly exposed to an alien organism that has the ability to perfectly imitate any life form it comes in contact with. As the gravity of the situation becomes frighteningly obvious, and with no way of contacting the outside world, the men struggle to determine who's human and who isn't, as the alien life form slowly moves through their ranks, taking them over one by one.As an exercise in paranoia, 'The Thing' works very well. The characters don't know who to trust, and neither do we. With the exception of one scene early on, no one is shown being 'taken over' by the Thing, meaning anyone could not be all that they appear to be. In the original film, the monster was a visible, hostile menace. In the remake, the monster can look and act like your friend, much like in the original short story both movies were based on. Carpenter gets maximum mileage from this concept, milking the paranoia and dread for all it's worth.But still, this is a horror movie at heart, and horror fans won't be disappointed. While the Thing prefers to stay hidden and secretive, there are numerous scenes where it is drawn into the open and/or revealed, and the end results aren't pretty. These sequences are startling and gruesomely imaginative, thanks to the shocking make-up effects done by youthful special effects wizard Rob Bottin; some of the things he comes up are bizarre and frightening (check out that 'spider-head'), and these scenes still hold up, even by today's standards. On the basis of these sequences, lots of critics dismissed 'The Thing' as a snowbound 'Alien' clone, but that's not an accurate assessment, although there are some similarities.Still, there are other scenes where the movie is effective: the opening scene with the helicopter is mysterious and strange, and the exploration of an abandoned camp where unspeakable things happened is eerie and haunting. The 'blood test' scene is very suspenseful, and the payoff will make you leap from your chair. The ending of 'The Thing' is refreshingly downbeat and bleak, and is a nice change from all those 'happy' endings we've had to endure.'The Thing' has improved with age; what was once dismissed as a 'freak show' has evolved into a classic horror/science-fiction movie.",

It may gross you out but I didn't bother me much. This movie was made before you started seeing CGI in movies. This was made well before these type of horror movies became more popular. Now we have horror movies all the time where a group of people get trapped and something bad happens. There are movies like The Thing except they are not as good. For 1982 this a well made horror movie. I have seen other 80's movies where the special effects weren't as good. I don't know how high I would rate this movie but this was a good movie.

I finally found out recently.\nI LOOOOVE practical effects, 1 mil. times better and more convincing than CGI effects. That's why i loved The Nightmare On Elm Street movies, The Blob, The Fly and others. But The Thing is in a league of its own. This movie's special effects are the best i have ever seen in my long practical effects movie history :)And not only that, John Carpenter's masterpiece is very very original in it's story, the cast is all male (positive for me everytime, no stupid love story required), it has one of the most creepy and ambigious horror movie endings ever, it is super brutal, unrelenting, it has music score that perfectly fits the mood of the film, has one of the best opening scenes in horror movies, has amazing sound effects and it's special effects STILL hold up to this day - almost 40 YEARS !! after it's release. This is truly incredible.\nIf i reaaaaly have to say something negative about The Thing it is that the acting is not something special and we never get to know the characters as much as I wanted, but this is something minor for me in comparison to the amazing movie that it is.Some people say it's better than Alien. I don't know about that, Alien has a special place in my heart. But it comes very very close to Ridley Scott's masterpiece. What i don't agree with most reviewers is that it is one of the SCARIEST horror movies ever. One of the BEST - yes, but scariest - i don't think so. But it is very atmospeheric, very creepy and very intense. The new wave of horror movies is much more scarier than The Thing, but The Thing is 40 years old and everytime i watch it it gets better. Undoubtedly one of the best horror movies in history, not only sci-fi. The difibrilator scene is just pure classic and one of the scariest and jaw-dropping scenes in horror movie history...",

            "content": "An alien theme plays as a helicopter flies across the South Pole landscape. Below it is a wolf dog, running through the snow. Apparently, the helicopter is chasing the dog. The pilot emerges with a gun and begins firing at the creature as it runs towards a base of American scientists.Soon, this doesn't sound as strange as it seems. Kurt Russell stars as the American scientist who learns the secret of the creature: it's over 100,000 years old, frozen beneath the ice, and p***ed off. We also learn that if it reaches civilization, within 27,000 hours the entire planet would be run by this creature - an alien lifeform that imitates whatever it kills. Dogs, spiders, grandma - this thing can do it. It's up to old Russell to save the day and destroy everything in sight in a blind rage.When first released in 1982, The Thing met with mixed critical acclaim - most of it bad. It was either 'not scary' or 'relies on special effects', but rarely would you find a positive review. Now, in the new millennium, the film is finally getting the recognition it deserves. The Thing has deservedly joined the ranks of the most famous horror films of all-time. It is even arguably more popular than it's basis, the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing from Another World. First we'll cover the more commonly debated aspects of the film. One is the acting. I felt the acting was excellent, especially Russell as the determined chosen leader of the team. Moffat is the only other actor in the crew who is somewhat popular, but that has no affect whatsoever on the cast. The acting might actually give this film a documentary feeling to it...Carpenter is probably the movie's second most important aspect. His direction is eerie and suspenseful - this movie helped elevate him to his current position of horror/thriller wonder. If you truly look at this film, you can tell Carpenter wasn't trying to make it scary - he wanted to make it suspenseful, although there are a few jumpy moments in the film.There's also a fitting and chilling score by Ennio Morricone. It definitely doesn't rank among the master composer's greatest scores, but it works well on the mood of the film.The most important, and no doubt the greatest, aspect of the film is Rob Bottin's special effects. They are extraordinary. Every scene involving the alien parasite is completely convincing. Whether it's a gruesome alien bursting from a dog's body, or a severed head sprouting spider-like legs and walking around the room, the effects are outstanding. Bottin proves himself to be a make-up genius.It's no wonder The Thing is a classic. It's documentary-like feel and it's creepy atmosphere are perfect. Carpenter has succeeded in making a thrilling wonder that may even surpass it's aforementioned story source. No horror, sci-fi or thriller fan should go without at least taking a look at this masterpiece chiller.",

I never saw him in anything but commercials before this and I have to admit it was pretty weird to see him in a movie like this. The thing that makes this one great is the claustrophobic feeling and the special effects; they are just plain crazy. Carpenter must have had some help from Mary Jane on this one.It does have one of the stupidest moments in horror movie history in it though. The blood screams when he touches it with the hot copper wire? Umm how?!? My god that was brilliantly stupid.

I saw it on the first run and, like most, I cringed at the acting, except for Wilfred Bromley and Kurt Russell, thought the fire-engine-red blood looked like fire-engine-red fake blood. But immediately was scared out of my wits by the possibility of spending more than.an hour with these characters,.much less most of a year in that icy purgatory. Hell I wouldn't want to get into an elevator going from the second floor to the first with these dudes. Hawks' men, I soon realized after I spent too much time with the movie rental and.wondering why I kept watching it, had a huge advantage over these escapees from an outpatient sanitarium. Hawks' guys had the benefit of being WW2 and maybe Korea vets. They had chosen to remain in the military after going through combat together. They had taken the oath to protect and defend the Constitution and America. They'd been in actual war before so they couldn't exactly say they hadn't signed on for this. They had signed on for this very real situation but the scientists in both movies had NOT signed on for this.Yet Carpenter's guys didn't panic for the most part but went resignedly on with doing what they could to save humanity. The look on Kurt Russell's face when finally says aloud what the other two survivors (this was when Childs was missing) know inside,.that \"no one's going home\" is so resigned to his fate that eventually I wanted.to.find. Ridley Scott and kick him for not allowing Ripley to blow up the NOSTROMO.with her still on board.Hawks would never have put non-professionals in danger, though the airmen would never turn down help. Pat even kept Nikki in the big fire scene room after she pointed out what to do with vegetables (boil, fry, steam, bake). She became one of the guys.Carpenter had no women in danger of course, but since he and I worship Hawks I have no doubt that his women would be Hawksian.",

The plot is really driven by the impact on the characters of an alien that can perfectly disguise itself as any organism it's come into contact with. Carpenter ratchets the paranoia and tension almost to the breaking point as the creature slowly destroys the entire crew of an Antarctic research station.As faithful to the original short story, \"Who Goes There?\" by legendary sf editor (and usually mediocre writer) John Campbell as the original movie was not, Carpenter's adaptation is a masterful study of humans under the most unbearable tension imaginable.The special effects retain their punch, 23 years later whilst the intense criticism they brought at the time (the movie opened two weeks after \"E.T.; as Carpenter says, \"ET was the good movie and we were the bad.\") is no longer relevant in the post-9/11 world. We've all seen things far more horrible than anything ever conceived by Hollywood.The movie that got Carpenter labeled by one critic as a \"pornographer\" of violence\" has stood the test of time; the now criticism but a footnote.None-the-less, they remain spectacular. The kennel scene is particularly astonishing. A later scene in which Dr. Copper (Richard Dysart) is killed is also a special effects marvel.Carpenter also treats us to breathtaking scenery (Alaska and British Columbia served as \"Antarctica\") of vast ice fields and glaciers.Kurt Russell also turns in one of his best performances. Forced to become the leader of the dwindling band of humans, his character MacCready displays the tough-mindedness of \"Snake Pliskin\" combined with a humanity the latter lacked. To be fair, the movie also lacks the humor that helped alleviate \"Escape from New York's\" violence and degradation.The entire cast does stellar work. Even the dog \"actor\" playing the alien turns in a great performance, never once looking at camera or crew in the scene's he's in. Russell and Carpenter also offer a funny, incisive and illuminating commentary on the 1998 \"special edition.\" If you haven't seen this movie in years (it had been at least fifteen years for me) you'll be presently surprised how well everything holds up, from the special effects to the actor's performances, to Carpenter's directorial trademarks. Ennio Moricone's score fits Carpenter's style almost as well as one of Carpenter's scores. Low key and unobtrusive, it provides the perfect counterpoint and undertone to the intensity of the images and performance.Still not for the squeamish or the kiddies, if you like your sf, or horror, served up without the usual clich\u00e9s or half-naked females helplessly waiting for the killer, then I definitely suggest this movie.As Carpenter proved he could master comedy with \"Big Trouble in Little China\", so with \"The Thing\" he proves he can handle deadly serious drama. The denunciations have faded with the paper they were printed on. 23 years later what's left is an excellent movie and special effects landmark.DVD Ratings: Transfer: 8 5.1 remix: 8 \"Extras\": 9 (for Carpenter/Russell commentary track; the \"Special Edition\" also contains a nearly 90 min documentary about the movie; also highly recommended.)Trivia tidbit: associate producer Larry Franco--who also plays one of the Norwegians at the beginning of the movie--was also, at the time, Kurt Russell's brother-in-law.",

All I want to say is this movie has great effects, great acting and great actors Keith David being one of my favorite and Kurt Russell as well. I would and have always rated it a 10/10",

            "content": "There are so many comments here on this brilliant movie, yet I've been compelled to also write one for so long, so here we go at last.You can opt to answer if my comment is useful, well, I guess that depends on whether you've already seen The Thing or not :-)If you have, perhaps you're in a younger generation (IOW, you didn't see it in the cinema, I think ?). If so, this is an opportunity for you to take a ride back to 1982, as a teenager and the account of it on the big screen. What do you reckon ? If you haven't, no worries, this is not another user comment claiming to not spoil the movie when I think (IMO) it does.... at least to some extent - not plot-wise per se. For example, I read user comments claiming it's not about special effects... you kidding' me ? The Thing's special effects (in 1982) didn't just shock, they truly terrorised (more below on that, stay tuned)!So, let's go back to 1982. All the masses were flocking to the theater to phone home (ET). A bunch of teenagers about 15-17 - my friends and myself included -wanted to see 'The Thing'. (I personally had no desire to see ET at that time, I'd read the book and that sufficed - for now). In hindsight, I'm glad we did. Sorry - correction, a couple of mates back then didn't, I think. One \"friend-of-a-friend\" (amongst the bunch of us) came out of the theater looking pale, he felt sick (well, he looked it :-) because of the terror he just went through. Is that good ? Absolutely ! Now, let me digress briefly to the special effects. I've seen my share of horror movies. Some have great special effects, sure. But this is 2009. Terminator 2 presented a quantum leap in CGI. But James Cameron thought it through, as usual. He knew then that CGI is - or should be - the last resort, not the first. The team that ensured The Thing delivered its full impact beyond the nightmare story, using every resource available at that time (CGI wasn't one of them), succeeded too well it seemed. Rob Bottin's (yes, even Stan Winston) willingness to push the envelope - of course with the help and synergy of many other brilliant minds - did something I have/had never seen in a story on the screen : I spent years, stumped ... speculating how on earth the movie's visual juggernaut was conceived and punched into my face... And I couldn't figure it out. (not until the fine day I got my hands on the special edition DVD).Now, again, consider this is 1982 ! I can't muster another movie title where I've wondered how it looked \"fake\" in other words, how it was done. All others are fake ; some take little effort to conjure up or accept the story's reality, many need a willing mind and some effort. That's not necessarily bad of course.Now back to the future, today. It's 27 years on and this movie still manages to either make you think you're human (you hope) when it picks you up and immerses you into the story of this \"frozen dozen\" characters. They're isolated, exhausted and too terrified to even consider sleeping. But one or several are hoping they're human - I think - but are probably not. Why ? Because something has infiltrated them, or should I write, 'some THING'.So, if you're still reading and you didn't see the movie then I urge one of 2 things. Rent the movie or buy the DVD movie (I did the latter). OK, now proceed with your favorite ritual (you can get popcorn, I'm not sure if you'll actually remember you have it while viewing:-) and get ready to watch film making that is so brilliant that the audience wasn't fully ready for it in '82, sadly underscored by lack of \"box office success\". I'm not even sure about 2009. I have flagged this Chef D'Oeuvre to a few younger friends asking to see a \"scary movie\" when thirsty for more of today's gore entertainment.... most have afterwards admitted they got too scared and didn't see it through :-)So, are you game ? Ennio Moriconi will give you a taste with his introductory sound score, that this story will finally thrill you as you were promised. If you're anything like me, it'll do so much more. Every line of dialogue is great. The actors' performances are outstanding and utterly convincing. (perhaps save for a single line \"What do we do now\" by Donald Moffat). But Moffat and all other 11 are discerningly cast near perfection and clearly spilled their blood, sweat and tears, it seems, to bring these outstanding performances.To close, it's quite hard to fault The Thing when put in its context. The lighting is perfect, the sound and dialogue is, the score is. And a handful of dark humour will make you laugh, but I did it afterward - when I was able to - back in 1982 when I got every cent of my pocket money's worth paying my cinema ticket.I'm sure you will treasure The Thing's special DVD edition after you've added it to your collection... I did and still do. Finally, in my opinion John Carpenter brings you his best direction and breathtaking camera work in this movie.(DVD purchased in 2004, watched every 3-4 months or so since, the last viewing earlier tonight).",

You gotta watch it. It is without a doubt Special effects master Rob Bottin's greatest work. It's amazing what people came up with before computers replaced almost everything with CGI. All the monsters are real, in the sense that everything you see on screen is really there. So real in fact that even though it was made in 81-82, they still look better than everything today, even 30+ years later. this is my favorite horror movie of all time. The cast is great, the direction is fantastic, the score is absolutely creepy and memorable. I watched The Hateful 8 recently and recognized some of the music from this movie straight away.

The monster's makeup was awful, as was typical for a 1950's horror film, and the characterizations were stereotypical. The John Carpenter version fixes all of these problems. With the exception of the ending, it is very close to the original story. The special effects are excellent, and the characterizations (or at least the fear they exhibit) seemed realistic to me.

One of many strong points foe the movie's presentation is how simple but effective the soindtrack really is. The movie starts with a wide shot of a vast snowy mountains and plainviews in the anarctic, and that synth beat just gives off a atmosphere that most horror movies fail to give. After a scene of a helicopter chasing a dog the film cuts to a group of American researchers in a base camp, it truley shows how these characters are far from help and society and close they are to danger. (It's like the characters in Alien being in space, letting the audience know that these characters are alone. Another horror sci-ci masterpiece)\nAfter the Americans save the dog and themselves from being shot by a Norwegian researcher. They go out to investigate in the Norwegian campsite and find out that chaos caused the deaths of the other Norwegian reasearchers, but know what. The scene makes the viewer feel like they're there with characters by making the chaos of the campsite look believable. It makes viewer keep guessing and wondering if what happened and the mystery is excuted perfectly.\nAfter the two researchers come back with two gruesome bodies that seemed to be intertwined with each other, they have the biologist disect it to find out if it give any details on what happened. The practical effects by Rob Bottin stay strong throughout the film and haven't age one bit. The visuals is masterful on every level, the gorgeous cinematography, the effective use of colors, to the realistic effects makes the movie even more impressive, being the fact that it was made more than 3 decades ago.\nBefore all the characters decide to go to sleep we see the dog enter one of the character's room. You the character petting the dog but it's only shown through shadow on the wall. This scene clearly shows someone was affected by \"the thing\" ( witch can imitate someone)but it doesn't reveal who exactly it was. John carpenter has even said that he used someone else that wasn't include in the cast to be the silhouette so it would be more mysterious on who was affected first.\nBecause of this it keeps the viewer guessing who is and who isn't by \"the thing\".\nThe film does an amazing job presenting paranoia between the characters abd their conflicts.\nThe Thing one the most intense and smartest horror films I ever watched. It needs to be seen by every horror fan.",

Graphics were simply amazing considering the technology they had in 1982. The film's special effects were simultaneously lauded and lambasted for being technically brilliant but visually repulsive. Even Film critic Roger Ebert called the special effects \"among the most elaborate, nauseating, and horrifying sights yet achieved by Hollywood's new generation of visual magicians\", and called the film itself \"a great barf-bag movie\" Sadly The Thing fared poorly at the box office. It was released on June 25, 1982 in 840 theaters and was issued a \"R\" rating by the MPAA. The film grossed $3.1 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $13.7 million in North America. Carpenter and several writers who have covered him, such as Michelle Le Blanc and Colin Odell, have speculated that this was due to the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial two weeks later, with its more optimistic scenario of alien visitation.Technically brilliant as said before, this movie contains some of the grossest scenes in cinematic history! Such as the dog ripping is own face open and then off to reveal a hybrid 'Thing' Dog. Attacking and swallowing the other dogs. and Wilford Brimley disgusting transformation into the 'Blairmonster' (called so by the Crew). In which the man's head is detached (by itself) and dropped to the floor, where it then grows spider legs and tries to crawl away but not fast enough before McReady (Kurt Russell) blasts it with a flamethrower.This movie was nauseating and yet, overall unbelievably entertaining! I would gladly recommend this movie to any horror buff's who have not yet seen this cinematic Masterpiece! 8 out of 10 stars!",

Yes, H. R.

I like that movie because he have good aspects of chill, suspect and gore, great cast of actors, and in this move we don't have any female (only voice of computer (voice of cute Adrienne Barbeau)in cast...The idea of 12 men living in worst and coldest place in Earth, isolated for 3-4 months from any contacts with civilization and then they battle with unknown alien organism.. Thanks for idea that John W. Campbell Jr. and his short SF novel \"Who goes there\"(one of best SF novels ever)...The cast was good choice for every character (Kurt Rusell and Keith David are Carpenters house actors, and rest of actors are fine in their work of acting.. Carpenter's movie has second best visual effect I ever seen in my life (Copper try to save Norris when he have cardiac arrest, second best in whole move is 'Dog Canel' scene where Bottin have help from 'dad' of Predator, Terminator & Alien, master of visual effects Stan Winston)..Kurt Rusell is great as helicopter pilot McReady and this is his best performance ever (sorry Snake Plisken but you are on second place) with his blue eyes, beard and ironic \"MIster No\" type of thinking), Rob Bottin have his best work thru the whole movie (he was 22 then, and already have fine job in best werewolf move ever \"American werewolf in London\" by John Landis (1981) and do best visual effect ever \"Jack transformation in werewolf\" - Oscar winning).This first Carpenter movie from Apocalypse Trilogy is truly master piece, and have best soundtrack score in SF movie (Razzie Award for Worst Musical Score I don't care) by legend Ennio Morricone (se Sergio Leone movies and you will know what I mean). I like that brooding, menacing bass chords that say to spectator that movie is depressive, paranoia type. Claustofobia elements is very intensive in the movie (like in \"Alien\" or in \"Evil Dead\" first two parts) and you have very good aspects of \"who is who\" and \"who is next and who I will trust\".So if you didn't yet see that movie you go on and see it right away (if you like gore scenes you have it plenty)..but if you already watch this peace see then :The Hidden - look like and very good SF movie with Kyle MacLachlan (he as FBI agent again but still goodlike in Twin Peaks)The Faculty - ripe off of alien design like \"The Thing\" but still good SF movie with young excellent actors and good director Robert Rodrigez The Thing: Terror Takes Shape - documentary movie about the movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers - both versions from 1956 and 1958, great actors and depressive, paranoia type (great ends of both movies is one best in SF and Horror genre).Play the video game caled \"The Thing\" and see comics with the same theme.",

Sure I think Halloween and Escape From New York are classics but he's always been a director that has as many misses as he's had hits in his career.The Thing is as close to perfection as any movie I've even seen. Start right at the end, I love the fact that it has a apocalyptic ending where we assume the two survivors are going to die. It is also very open ended and open to interpretation. Did The Thing really get destroyed? Is Childs really still human or is he part of The Thing? The way this ends is in stark contrast to most Hollywood movies that feel the need to have a happy ending and tie up all the loose ends. I had the benefit of watching the Special Edition DVD which includes an approximately 90 minute documentary with tons of great facts about the production and interviews with everyone that was anyone on this production. The documentary revealed that they actually shot an alternate ending that shows that Kurt Russell's character MacReady made it out of Antarctica and survived the whole ordeal. Luckily that ending has never seen the light of day.More then a monster movie, this is a movie about isolation and paranoia. This is about a group of men, living in close quarters without any female elements. That group dynamic adds a lot of interesting elements to the emotional side of the story.If for some reason you've never seen this movie....go see it now!

For me, it's a movie that gets better with each viewing and still stands up today over 30 years later as a marvel of atmosphere, special effects and existential dread. Whether intentional or through sheer luck, or perhaps an unlikely combination of both, the filmmakers who made this incredible opus have made one of the few greatest monster movies of all time that not only delivers the grisly goods of gory kills and nightmarish creatures but even more importantly is so meticulously paced and plotted with such vivid characterization of seemingly ordinary men isolated and trapped in a nightmarish wasteland that it naturalistically questions, perhaps without even meaning to, the nature of trust, identity, and the extent of human relationships on a professional and personal level based purely on the instinct to preserve the idea of \"self\" as the truest form of survival. This is not just a survival movie where the characters will do anything to live, including compromising their own integrity at the expense of others like so many shallow modernistic survival horror movies have done lately in order to seemingly justify extreme and seemingly sociopathic behavior. No, \"The Thing\" questions at what point does a decent caring person have to act on their own, perhaps even against the group, for not only the sake of his/her own good but for the good of the group as well to avoid being destroyed by the very human collective paranoia and hysteria that may be even more insane and monstrous than the thing causing it. In a group where trust has broken down because anyone could be a monster the question becomes not who has the right to assume authority but who will be authoritative enough over themselves to take a leap of faith in trusting someone who might lead them to their destruction. Is the greatest feat of \"self\" deciding to resist the potentially compromised authority of another person or deciding to take a leap of faith by submitting one's trust and ultimately one's will to someone who may prevent you from destroying yourself and others in a fit of fear and paranoia? These are the kind of ideas and themes explored in John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" and add to that mind-blowing special effects that put current CGI to shame even today and you've got an unique unrivaled masterpiece that is as deep and terrifying as it is dazzling.I love this movie so much I own two copies of it on DVD just in case one of them bunks out all of a sudden.

Though Carpenter praised one of the orchestral cues on the audio narration of the Director's Cut of THE THING, little of Morricone's orchestral cues made it into the movie, including my favorite piece, which IS on the soundtrack, called BESTIALITY. Morricone has said the reason he produced THE THING soundtrack himself was to let people hear some of the orchestral music that never made it into the movie.There is talk of a THE THING II (I guess based on the comic book), and Carpenter and Russell are interested, but two people that are not expected back are Bottin (as he is off directing some movie or so the reports go) and Morricone, who was not happy with the way his music was treated.",

It was only a matter of time when a big studio was going to jump on the \"JC\" wagon. In comes John Carpenter's Thing. His most ambitious project possibly to date. The movie was amazing, although it was loosely...key word loosely, a remake, you wouldn't even notice. It's a completely different beast from the 1950's version. It plays more on the tension of atmosphere, betrayal, mistrust, oh and really remarkable special effects for it's time. Just one problem.... It came out a week after Steven Spielberg's E.T. The thing was unfortunately a flop at the box office. If only it were release at a different time, I think it would have really boosted up John Carpenter's career greater.",

Not only does this movie have truly disturbing gore scenes, it also has riveting action and a binding tension running throughout. The story is outstanding and definitely sequel worthy. Also, the musical score is minimal but provides just the right amount of backing in the film. It's too bad that some of the effects of the Blair Monster had to be scrapped for the final film so that the audience could see more details in it. Highly recommended.

You can watch it just for pure horror and shock value, or you can watch it for a rather interesting look at the human psyche. The paranoia running through the film makes it stand out from other horrors. Mac isn't your typical hero but that makes the film seem much more real and adds to the horror.

I saw Big Trouble in Little China when I was a little kid so I wasn't paying attention the way i do now that I'm older, so that doesn't really count. This is the first John Carpenter film I have seen with an attentive attitude.Before watching this I never knew who John Carpenter was. But he always intrigued me. I'd walk through the DVDs at Borders and see John Carpenter's The Thing or Escape From NY. I wanted horror one day and bought The Thing with no expectations... Perfect purchase.From the opening to the finish I was hooked. The way the film opens with little to no music, just some synth bass popping in every so often, really makes the film more mysterious right off the bat. Why Ennio Morricone's score would be nominated for a Razzie is beyond me since considering the film and genre it fits perfectly.The fact that the crew doesn't fight the alien by going all guns blazing is very reminiscent of Alien. These aren't soldiers, these are scientists and workers. No professional combat experience here. They have to rely on their wits and their peers to survive. Tensions begin to run higher and higher as the film progresses. It doesn't get any easier as the creature picks off and replaces each crew member one by one, making the one-by-one scenario a bit more terrifying because not only are people dying but the alien is mimicking them so nobody knows who's dead and who's an alien.The special effects are top notch for the time. In fact I thing it's better than some CG effects that appear today. With CG effects the first thing crossing my mind is noticing all the imperfections. Physical effects actually feel real and much more believable, which made the transformation sequences pretty disturbing.The acting is first rate as well. All the characters felt believable as did their relationships with each other during the rising fear and tension. And Kurt Russel is a joy as always.Again on the music. The lack of music actually helps define the lonely mood and sense of claustrophobic solitude in the arctic wasteland. It deserves an Emmy not a Razzie.Final Rating: 10/10 Right on par with Alien.",

            "content": "*Some Spoilers*After watching \"The Thing\" I realized that it was very, very similar to Alien... with the exception of not being another overrated, often plodding Ridley Scott movie. Don't get me wrong, he is a good enough director, but Carpenter runs rings around him, and this movie goes to show that he can beat him  with the same idea: a crew trapped in an area with a dangerous, shape-changing creature that is trying to kill them (the exception being that Carpenter adds more suspense and mystery by making his monster change into people, not just mutate into a hideous, alligator like creature on legs.) I like Alien a lot, but it is mostly due to the cast, which is excellent. The Thing has a cast that is also very good, but without as many familiar faces. The action sequences are better, and the violence/ gore is better as well. Obviously the focus of Alien was not gratuitous violence, but seeing people ripped apart by this ghastly creature was better than a little fake puppet jumping out of John Hurt's stomach and scurrying across a dinner table. The bleak atmosphere, lack of music (though there area few tunes here and there) and creepy noises make the ambiance better, for me anyway. Alien has a gross ship, but The Thing has desolate, arctic wasteland. It was more hopeless feeling to me. In terms of characters, The Thing is on par with Alien, even though the cast is less well known ( No big stars like Tom Skerrit, or Ian Holm). The only two actors I recognized were Kurt Russell and Keith David.... the rest of the cast is good though. The concept of paranoia also adds to this as well, with the crew killing each other... delightful. So, when its all said and done, I feel that The Thing is a stronger movie, and moreover Carpenter is (or was anyway) a better Director than Mr. Scott, whom I am growing less and less a fan of every day. My rating 5/5.",

John Carpenter did NOT do the music, Ennio Morricone did thank goodness and his score set the mood perfectly. John Carpenter should not score movies even though it's apparent he loves to dabble in music. Is he trying to save a buck or is it ego? Rob Bottin's special effects were phenomenal though they were considered gross and too gory when the film was released. The story is different from original version though the original was good also.

Wonderful, all-male ensemble cast. As for the music, the soundtrack is brilliant, but somewhat surprising is the amount of Morricone's music that didn't make it onto the screen (check out the precious CD instead which has no Carpenter on it) in favour of Carpenter's own additions.One of the all-time best, and one to keep fans loyal through thick and thin.",

The pacing of the movie is absolutely perfect and really causes the viewer to question who is who. This is one of the most suspenseful, claustrophobic and thrilling movies of all time.

Carpenter's bleak meditation on paranoia and suspicion in a claustrophobic and isolated environment was simply way ahead of it's time and ill suited to the times. On the heels of Close Encounters and ET, audiences were perhaps enamored with the idea that aliens would be friendly cuddly creatures hoping to be our friends.When you compare The Thing to quality contemporary horror such as Let The Right One In, it's easy to draw comparisons with the building suspense and isolation of The Thing - it's probably the most powerful reinvention of a horror story/film ever made.Horror movies are a thrill ride in uncomfortable emotions..thats what they're for..people who complain about this film, simply don't like horror as a genre but are too stupid to realise it themselves. They want all their experiences watered down or handed on a platter.From the pitch perfect acting, superb design, mindblowing and inventive physical effects by Bottin (where are you dude?, WE NEED YOU) and Winston, incredible throbbing drone of Morricone's theme...The Thing is the gift that keeps giving.' I must have watched it a good 20 times and never tire of the deft craft in play. The film delivers on two major fronts...both psychologically (who is the Thing?!!) and visually (some of the most boggling and crazy icky stuff committed to screen).The Thing continues to deserve it's place toward the very top of ANY ultimate horror or sci-fi film list...26 years later, this film deserves to be honored by cinephiles, not derided by small uneducated minds whose tastes are more suited to the middle of the road in happy hopeful endings..",

The film stars five or six of the best character actors in Hollywood (Richard Masur, Donald Moffat and Keith David) on top of a slightly generic Kurt Russell performance. All in all, no viewer could ever forget the kind of fun this alien creature has with its human hosts.  It literally tries to become the organism it \"absorbs\".  And some characters get it BAD.  These scenes of terror are truly disturbing, especially for a younger viewer - which I was when I first saw it.

The Thing is possibly his greatest achievement and has all the ingredients you don't see in the horror genre today.For a start the casting is superb, the Kurt Russell/Carpenter marriage is on top form here again as Russell gives gruff coolness to the anti-hero Macready. The rest of the cast members also excel in their roles as they are faced with a terrifying and insurmountable foe from outer space. Ennio Morricone's score adds to the tension and becomes kind of an extra character creating a feeling of isolation for the central protagonists. A vital ingredient for any horror flick.The effects are quite simply years ahead of its time, and I would say the creature still stands as being possibly the most highly original of all time. The idea of having an alien being an infection is a landmark in the genre if compared to such modern bores like monsters in caves or hillbilly cannibals. when the creature reveals its form it is truly heinous and revolting. The death scenes are amongst the most inventive I've seen on celluloid and it will be a long hard stretch to be beaten even by todays technological standards.All in all The Thing is a prime example of how the genre should be projected to the audience and still sets the benchmark for suspense horror today.

It comes down to what they have to say. Cult films are brilliant in a subtle or not so subtle way, as Rocky Horror Picture Show was an amazingly unpleasant film. When The Thing was released it was panned for over-the-top gore and special effects. Even the director of the original, Christian Nyby, denounced this film. Yet this near masterpiece followed the coarse of other classic cult films. One of the main problems was the gore. Yes it was excessive. Yes it is brutal. I really, really love this for it. Robin R. Bottin, also known for Robocop and The Fog, masterfully crafted severed body parts, warped dogs, and a blob of nightmarish skin and blood, without any computer generated images or visual assist. The creature is so grotesque, you find yourself queasy as he takes every form of tentacle-severed head to 5-dog morphing. John Carpenter excellently builds suspense with a feeling of claustrophobia and unease. As the Thing can take any form necessary, The crew of a desolate Antarctic facility know nothing of who the monster has shape over... and neither do the audience. The viewer is kept in the dark for 95% of the movie. Certain victims are hinted towards, but there is no canon answer. As for flaws, the characters will seem underdeveloped and feel like a segway for gore. This doesn't affect the movie, as they are given enough personality for you to figure out the creature's form. The ending is so ambiguous that countless fan theories have appeared trying to explain it. The showdown between the hero and villain is gory, funny, and satisfying for a fight like this. 1982 was an impactful year for sci-fi and horror film with others such as Poltergeist, Blade Runner, and the Wrath of Khan. Yet no other film will gross you out as much as THE THING will! I suggest you give it a watch.",

Further investigation reveals that something really spooky has taken place in the Norwegian base. No survivors again, only burnt remains, in indistinguishable shapes. Meanwhile, the husky has found a new home in the U.S. base.We see about a dozen guys working there, scientists mostly, among them heli-pilot MacReady, played by Kurt Russell. The dog in the meantime is walking around, sniffing, doing the stuff that dogs basically do before it's put in the kennel with the others. Although it's difficult to see through the darkness it turns out that we're not dealing with a dog at all. No, it's some bizarre creature that shoots tentacles to try and grab the other dogs.....and emulate them!Turns out a spacecraft of some sort has landed in Antarctica thousands of years ago and the Norwegians have accidentally dug it up, waking an occupant who was probably not in the best of moods. Stealth is its weapon, taking over any creature when it sees the chance and then getting rid of the original. Question now, has the dog infected any of the humans? Who is real, and who is a copy? Further bummer: you're in the most inhospitable environment on Earth and a storm is closing in. Escape is impossible.Paranoia ensues, protagonist MacReady doesn't know who to trust and tries to come up with a way of discovering who's who, getting sleepier and sleepier in the process. No one to trust. Is it Blair who destroyed the generators and radio so the creature cannot escape to the civilized world, thus isolating the group completely. Or is it short-fused Childs, who wants to shoot and ask questions later. What about the guy responsible for the pack of huskies? He was near that kennel for an awful long time, just by himself. And who's that guy running around outside in the dead of night? No creature from this Earth can survive in those temperatures...So the story unfolds, accompanied by an eerie Ennio Morricone soundtrack in the background. Special mention must go to effects, that set a new standard for 'gore' in 1982. The performances are all fine, the direction never slips and those that haven't seen it are lucky, for they can guess and guess. Especially when MacReady finally figures out how to smoke out 'The Thing', in one of the most suspenseful scenes of all time.Critically axed at its release, now critically acclaimed and rightly so. Carpenter mused: 'no one is ever going to see something like this again', and he was correct. This is a one-of-a-kind, the best horror/sci-fi ever made.

The special effects in this movie have to be seen to be believed, all the more remarkable when you consider they were all made from model work. No computer generated rubbish here, just real craftsmanship. Current movie makers please take note.All the acting is very credible and conveys the paranoia and genuine fear these men feel, as no one can tell who is infected.Great musical score by Ennio Morricone adds to the tension. This movie is a must see, though definitely not for the squeamish as the effects are quite gruesome. If you are after realistic alien terror you can't beat this movie. It still packs a punch today and will exceed any current horror movie on the screen. 10 out of 10. Unforgettable!",

It is probably the scariest when the alien is taking shape into the other people. It is also very suspenseful when they have to figure out who is an alien by testing their blood. I think it is a very good movie, that deserved to be watched. It is up there with Halloween and the Escape movies as John Carpenters best movies.",

            "content": "John Carpenter's remake is yet another example of a remake outshining the original. While every critic in the world thinks \"The Thing From Another World\" is a better film, it doesn't come close to the claustrophobic atmosphere and the sheer horrific gross out factor of f Carpenter's film. Of the two, \"The Thing\" is more pure horror.So a group of scientists in the Antarctic are just kind of doing their everyday thing, which is nothing, until a helicopter shows up and starts shooting at a dog. One of the scientists is hit, and the guy in the helicopter is killed. Confused, some of the scientists visit the camp the pilot came from, while the dog is put with the others.In the camp they find a burned body of something that doesn't appear human, but turns out to be. They also find a video of the camp digging a ship out of the ice. So on a return trip, they find a rectangular hole in the ice which appears to be where there was once a body.The dog then tries to latch onto other dogs, and its face explodes apart. Well, what we have here is a shape-shifting alien who can't quite stay stable for some reason. And this is a cause for concern, as anything it touches, it can replicate. So whoever had contact with the dog could be an alien.This makes Wilford Brimley's diabetes reach uncontrollable levels, and he starts smashing things in a paranoid rage. Luckily, Kurt Russell is on break from the Roadhouse bar and punches Brimley's character Blair in the face, then locks him outside.Slowly, the situation deteriorates even more. One character's stomach turns into a human arm venus fly trap, then his head detaches and grows legs and antennas. Which had me laughing on the floor. The effects in this movie are outstanding. In fact, they're the highlight of the film. But the nice thing is, they don't overshadow the plot. Everything is tight, and you honestly are left guessing who the alien is at any moment.Kurt Russell is incredible in this movie as well. So, yes, I recommend it. Just as an aside, if you're going to watch the new \"The Thing\" from 2011, watch it first. It's a prequel to this movie, and isn't too bad. As far as this and the original \"Thing From Another World\" , those are two very different movies. But both are worth watching._____________________________ For all of the Horror Banana's reviews, visit http://morozov924.hubpages.com/",

I was at the time (I still am!) a huge fan of Carpenters work and had seen films like \"Halloween\" or \"In The Mouth Of Madness\" and many more, but unfortunately \"The Thing\" wasn't available on DVD in Germany. So I bought it via the Internet. When I watched for the first time I had many friends around me, we used to watch movies at least once a week, mainly horror. When the film started it got dead silent and everybody was fully concentrated to figure out who was the one creating all that havoc (of course no one did with succes!)The film itself is highly tense and manages to make you sweat! The superb directing of John Carpenter, the great performances of Kurt Russel and his co-stars, the eye-catching special effects (all hand made, no CGI!), the music (Carpenter himself) and the new approach to an old topic makes this film most definetly to one of the best horror films. Who could ever forget scenes like the \"blood test scene\"? Or the beginning with the dog? These scenes can be remembered forever, just like the shower scene from \"Psycho\"! But I must warn you: Don't ever watch this film alone! It'll make you turn into something different! 10 out of 10!",

The music helps to add to the atmosphere, as does the horrible isolation of the Antarctic (although not shot there) landscape.

            "content": "Very good........ I think after 23years I may be close to fully understanding the film. The first to be infected/ imitated is Palmer..... When Nauls is told to turn the music down by Bennings, the suspect dog is looking for a host to hide within. We only see a shadow as he turns to the doorway to see the dog but I'll explain why it has to be Palmer. Until the \"blood testing\" scene Palmer shows no sign of infection, then just as he's blood is about to be tested, he shows the look of \"my game is up\"..... he transforms to take Windows and both are destroyed by flame throwers. So how does the Thing remain living? After it takes Palmer it can rely now completely on the diversions of the others' to remain anonymous, no-one suspects that someone else could be imitation (except Blair but not for very long) for he is quickly overtaken... as he analyzes the dogs' remains he unwittingly uses his pencil to point out that \"That's not dog. It looks like dog. But it ain't dog. It's imitation.\" Then touches his lips with the same pencil- he has started to transform from that very moment. No- one realises at that time. Blair begins to destroy the camp and shoot up the place to limit the chances of outside contact or escape for anyone, but it doesn't like the Antarctic either and has to leave to survive, and so dismantles the chopper to construct his own means of escape. That is another story how Blair can orchestrate his imprisonment so he can remain alone to engineer plans for departure out of that hostile land in which survival comes from residing in the humans or dogs which are offer no protection at all to the Arctic conditions. Both Man and Thing are equal here. Both have to fight to survive here. Not only the environment but each other to live on........anyway, We see Blair running from the helicopter, then again prior to taking Garry thats it he is part of the 75% he computes at the beginning. The computers..... we know The Chess computer is a cheat? It makes mistakes....can Blairs computer be as unreliable? Think about that one. His ploy is to remain totally unsuspecting to all, whilst destroying the camp, the transport, the blood stocks. He also sets up his only threat, Macready, by placing his torn clothing around the camp, Blair left Macready's cabin light on as well. I have more to discuss about The Thing. The fact it wasn't a hit was because it wasn't a fairytale, where everyone lived happily ever after. It looks like no-one lives even the Thing. No-one won the battle to survive. Or did they/ it? I like to think Macready remains human, he has to be when no-one is left to fight, he still continues to finish off The Thing.... with \"...k you too!\" and some dynamite. But if Childs had seen Blair in the final scenes there is a real chance that when he goes outside to investigate that Blair deals with him there. So Macready is a doomed human destined to be frozen with or as a monster. Regards Marty. P.S John Carpenter offers us a chance to look outside the box and think about what we see. I'll love to write a sequel one day.",

John Carpenter, who just so happens to have the same birthday as me, is my most favourite director and this film really shows that he is the master of screen horror although his latest work has'nt really been his best.

There were no marks on the lock and the aforementioned men were the only ones with access to the freezer unit's key. Hence both men are treated with considerable suspicion. Yet it turns out that neither man was actually a thing, which leaves a loose end that is never tied up.3)It appears that Palmer and Norris had been replaced by things before it is realised that a thing can absorb someone and take their form.  If this is the case why does Norris turn down the chance to replace Garry as the leader when Garry nominates him?  Surely from the things' point of view that was an opportunity missed.  It also means that when Palmer speaks the classic \"You have got to be f***ing kidding me\" line, after Norris's head has disatatched itself and sprouted spider legs, it is actually a thing in disguise giving that very human reaction, and speaking for a generation of eighties horror fans.4)Garry does not come across as being an overly liberal base commander.

It's a scary movie of the first order, one that understands the difference between what is really scary and what is simply there for it's own sake. This remake of \"The Thing From Another World\" (which actually more closely resembles the novella \"Who Goes There?\") isn't a favorite of critics. There are reasons for this, although the artistry or effectiveness of \"The Thing\" have little to do with them. This movie has several strikes against it. Strike one: it is a remake, and one that dares (God forbid) to be a different film than it's predecessor. Strike two: graphic gore typically strikes professional critics as gratuitous regardless of the context it holds in the film. Already, this film is on shaky ground.

Usually, I don't approve of remake but John Carpenter did fantastic job on this one. From what I heard, The Thing is more faithful to the original story than the predecessor The Thing From Another World. But The Thing is perhaps one of the best horror films if I ever seen one, although I confessed that I'm not expert in horror genre like some folks are.What makes The Thing different from its predecessor is that it creates its own universe, along with its own set of characters. That's why The Thing, along with handful of remake, is one of the successful remake films at where millions and millions of remake had failed. Kurt Russell, in one of his best roles, is fantastic as MacReady whose took charge of the base when bad stuff occurred. The set up in The Thing is very different from original film, which set the tone for whole film. I find it very hard to explain what the set up is like so check this one out.The Thing is fantastic because it doesn't rely on CGI, which is astonishing. The special effects are top notch and have held up very well to this day. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made and it's just very exciting from beginning to the ending. If the studios want their remake to be very successful, they should take notes from The Thing. It's very solid film of its genre.The actors are fantastic and didn't try to outperforming each other but they're perfectly content with their roles, which is good. Carpenter's direction is top notch and his handling of the material is just fantastic. It's great. Like its predecessor, The Thing has held up very well, which isn't something that happens to every film.Carpenter was very smart to place The Thing on South Pole instead of the North Pole, where The Thing From Another World had been placed. We can see that Carpenter isn't being pressured by the original film; instead he just focuses on constructing original screenplay that is based on short story, which is very smart thing.The DVD of The Thing is one of the handful best DVDs I've ever seen. Solid presentation of the film and very nice special features, which is very seldom seen in this day where studios like to put lot of fluff and talking heads on their special features. I think I'm going to get DVD of The Thing once I get my hands on DVD of The Thing From Another World.One thing I have problem with The Thing is the music Ennio Morricone had produced. It just sounds bit out of place and very electronic. But when used properly, it's great. It's only thing I have complaints about this one.Very solid stuff. Highly recommend.",

What these people have failed to realize is that, unlike the vastly overrated and campy Howard Hawks version, The Things' scripters actually read their source material, John W. Campbell's classic sci-fi tale, \"Who Goes There\".  You will be hard pressed to find a film that remains so faithful to the text off which it is based. Everything is meticulously captured, from the utter desolation of the Antarctic to the grotesque, Kafka-esque imagery of the monster itself. The cast offers genuinely solid performances, making for a horror movie that does what a horror movie should: frighten the audience while having them sympathize with the plight of the cast.  Despite its gore, the film keeps strength in characterization, making death scenes and creature attacks more tragic.  Those who write this film off as an overly gory remake should learn what makes a good HORROR film and read the original story off which the film is based.  This isn't a remake.  It's Hollywood finally doing the story justice after its butchering in the 1950's.",

            "review_title": "Real classic from the king of atmosphere",
            "content": "The Thing is real classic from king of atmosphere, John Carpenter, and one of the most famous horrors which is, nowadays, a lot more easier to classify as a psychological thriller than a horror movie. The film is based on a novel by John W. Campbell, Jr., Who Goes There? and is often mentioned as a remake of The Thing from Another World from 1951. It is also a part of the Apocalypse trilogy which also includes Prince of Darkness (1987) and In the Mouth of Madness (1994). The film begins with a scene of Norwegian scientist chasing a dog in Antarctica. The hunt ends at the U.S. scientific station where Americans, of course, shot fissured Norwegian and saved the dog. They weren't concerned about why someone so badly wanted to kill the dog so they let him stay in the station. Soon we learn the reason of Norwegian pursuit. Norwegian scientists have found unknown being frozen in the ice and being convinced that it's dead they unfrozed it. The thing was alive and just like every other life-form it wanted to survive. Only ability the thing had is to imitate any life-form with which it makes contact. In imitating process original life-form dies. And that is the core of the story. Who's real and who's not? As a psychological thriller film works wonderfully. Horror elements fits perfectly and the atmosphere is brilliantly polished with scenery and music and special effects are pretty impressive for 80's. Many scenes in the film are still striking and recognizable. That's what makes the film special, but pretty much everything else falls under mediocrity. The cast led by Kurt Russell did a solid job, and for many people Russell is most recognizable as MacReady. Here we come to the big problem of characterization. It is not strange for Carpenter that the main characters are superficial and purpose of many of them is only to die. Almost every his story is successful despite this, but that does not diminish the fact that this is still a big problem because the easiest way for audience to connect with film is through the characters. Also, some characters must behave totally illogical for story to be successful, what especially in the modern era, is very annoying. But in total The Thing deserves a high mark. Especially because of the brilliant atmosphere and interest that it creates.",

The film's intensity and suspense will keep the viewer hooked on the film. The practical effects for the time were great as over time CGI took over but before CGI John Carpenter proved that practical effects can work for a budget of 10 million dollars. From the success from 1978's Halloween John Carpenter was able to make 1980s The Fog, 1981;s Escape from New York, and of course The Thing. You know what all these movies have in common they're all movie classics. John Carpenter's careful direction and patience led to a masterpiece, as so did as six years later another John Carpenter classic was released, 1988's They Live. But none the less The Thing's lead actor Kurt Russell is a classic boss and not a clich\u00e9. The film's ending will keep you guessing what just happened but you'll understand the ending after you watch it. Nonetheless this movie is an all time classic and I urge anyone to watch it if they have not seen it.",

In much the same way that he created the slasher film with Halloween, he has created a truly powerful science fiction film with elements of horror that have since become commonplace in films and even on television (see any episode of the X-Files).  John Carpenter's attention to character is unwavering in this story, making the impending doom that much more horrifying.  The unique ending must be credited to both the writer and to John Carpenter's knack for endings that don't really end.

It builds an eerie mood of isolation from society, creates believable characters with plausible relationships, and generates just enough gore to keep you near sickness, but not pushing the envelope.  The gore is really a subtle fraction of the disturbance factor of the film. The real suspense/fear comes from not knowing who is human and who is an alien \"Thing.\"  This paranoid feeling added to the remoteness keeps this film terrifying even twenty years later.  Although the graphics are somewhat dated, I find them more frightening then some of the available computer let downs of the late 90s and early new century (pitch black).  When did Toy story become scary? I really like Kurt Russell in this film also.  He creates this kind of \"bad-boy\" hero persona into his character that really makes you like him.  The ending is also one of my favorite moving endings. Does it matter if the other guy is a \"Thing\" or not?

            "content": "Last night I watched John Carpenter's version of \"The Thing\" for the first time. It was very good. Gore and scenes of suffering repel me, so I was reluctant to watch it. But I wanted to compare Carpenter's work to the 1951 movie, which I had seen earlier this year (and found much less satisfying).The main themes of the 1982 movie were isolation, fear, distrust, hopelessness, and bafflement, and how these emotions affect otherwise stable human beings. People change from being \"scientific\" to being undisciplined from fear. A feeling of doom steadily grows. As for the gory scenes, they are much less frequent than some reviews would have you believe. However, they are horrific (I had to look away once, and I'm 57). The special effects were a tribute to the human imagination: what causes a person to conceive of a head's stretching from its torso, falling off of an examination table (to avoid being burned up by a flame-thrower), and sending out tentacles that lash onto objects and pull itself across the floor? Other effects were equally creative. Some aspects of the \"Thing\" reminded me of the creature in \"Alien.\" The opening scene, involving the hunting of a dog by men in a helicopter, was troubling for me because I hate to see animals suffer. To me a dog that is being hunted is suffering (from fear). Once I overcame my bad feelings about the scene, I gave some thought to its details, and I became puzzled. It should have been fairly easy for the men in the helicopter to kill the dog, so why were they unable to do so? They had a machine that could fly much faster than any dog could run, and flew a zigzag path to repeatedly take aim at the fleeing animal. But no bullet from the rifle hit the dog. Later it became clear: shortly before the hunt, the men in the chopper had seen their comrades---at another scientific outpost---perish in a most gruesome manner. Those scenes of death, and the experiences that led up to them, undoubtedly made these men almost insane with fear and desperation. No wonder the pilot flew erratically and the gunner never hit the dog! I have two complaints: staffing and armaments. The staffing of the research station was implausible. Some characters seemed to be too casual or unprofessional to have been stationed at a scientific outpost, where---I assume---only the cream of the crop are sent in order to get the \"biggest bang from the buck.\" Yeah, scientists are people too, and the outposts in Antarctica surely have social problems. I just think that people at remote science stations are more serious, more mature, and have more to do than some characters depicted here. And so few people at a station? Survival in the extreme winter conditions would seem to require a bigger outpost and many more people: cooks, medical team, maintenance people, etc.The other weakness was the presence of the armaments and flame-throwers. Since the station's mission was never explained, I was forced to assume that these things were necessary. But I don't like that type of story-telling. If there are devices present that would seem out of place to the average person, the story-tellers have an obligation to explain the situation. Was an \"explaining\" scene deleted during the editing process, or was this a case of lazy writing? Some commenters have theorized that flame-throwers are used to melt snow, but that's unlikely. As I understand it, flame-throwers are not merely super hair dryers with flames, but squirt guns that propel a napalm-like substance onto things. That burning medium would be all over anything that had been sprayed---not a nice residue to leave in the snow. Aside from the staffing and armaments themes, I could believe the movie. Maybe I need to go back to school and take a remedial course in \"Management of Small Scientific Stations in Ice-bound Environments.\" On the plus side, as others have mentioned, there were not any extraneous elements such as romance or earthquakes to keep viewers interested. (Aside from the fact that there were no women in the movie, romance would have been laughably out of place here---when people experience an increasing state of terror, they aren't likely to linger in the lab to kiss.) The development of suspense, based on the disintegration of trust among the characters, kept me spellbound. The soundtrack helped sustain a creepy, foreboding atmosphere; I don't care who created or manipulated it. Partially filmed in or near Stewart, British Columbia---get out the atlas! For a guy who hates scenes depicting horror or bad things happening to animals, I liked this movie. It was much, much better than the 1951 version, not because of the special effects, which were excellent, but because of the development of suspense and the style of acting. After reading so much praise for the DVD version of this movie, I just might rent it.Forty-four pages of comments!---impressive.",

The film opens with the crew of an American Arctic research centre rescuing a dog from some deranged members of a European party who die, before it can be established why they are trying to kill the canine. Upon investigation it appears the remaining members of the European crew are dead, some of them horribly mutilated. The research centre has also been burnt down.The Americans take the dog in. This is where the trouble starts. Slowly the centre is been taken over, equipment is being sabotaged and people are being killed but by who? The `who' is the `Thing' in question a being that can assume the forms of others. Kurt Russell stars as Macreedy a helicopter pilot determined to find out. The film also has an array of character actors all destined for gory deaths including Richard Dysart (guy for LA Law), Donald Moffat, Keith David and most menacing of all Wilford Brimley. Whilst the film is primarily remembered for its excellent special effects, In my opinion these are actually the weakest part of the film. The strongest part being the claustrophobia heightened by the conditions (they are in the middle of an arctic storm) and the paranoia of not knowing who can be trusted. The scene where a test is being administered to determine who is the `Thing' is incredible. Kurt Russell is excellent as Macreedy demonstrating an understandable edginess, paranoia and vulnerability. The rest of the cast too is excellent in their portrayals of suspicion, fear and terror.The music is suitably creepy, although it seems to me a bit strange in hiring Ennio Morricone to effectively imitate a John Carpenter score. What's the point when you have Carpenter at the helm of the film anyway?The film itself was dismissed when it was released at around about the same time as ET. I suppose people weren't ready to see a film about a nasty alien. In retrospect the film is getting the recognition it deservesJohn Carpenter's finest hour, no I'd say it was Assault on precinct 13.

John Carpenter's expert cinematography ensured a realism and suspense that has created a lasting impression even by today's standards.THE THING is set over a six day period where a group of isolated US scientists are attacked by an alien life form at an Artic research station called OutPost #31.From the husky's entrance at the beginning, right up until it's climatic ending, THE THING's screenplay fabulously depicts a traumatic realism which has been signature to the films lasting reputation. The story unfolds when the characters suspect that any one of them could be infected by the alien. Their fears are realised when one by one each of the team members falls victim to THE THING leaving the last remaining members to fend for themselves. Besides the outstanding acting and special effects, John Carpenters build of mystery, anxiety and panic uniquely portrays a psychological confrontation rather it does as a typical horror.\nEssentially however, it is a survival film. Arguably, it was the first film of its kind to incorporate horror and a  'who dunnit' theme reminiscent of genres found in murder/mystery films. Critics have therefore failed to give appraisal to THE THING for unwillingly appreciate the intricate detail that was involved in the story line. Who was the shadow on the wall? Who was first infected? What happened to the whiskey bottle? Who stole the keys? What went on in the Norwegian camp? Forget who shot JFK, who survived THE THING?This film deserves a 10 out of 10 in every respect.

I now own this on DVD and have watched it many times. My wife recently watched it with me having never before seen it. She absolutely will not watch it again and refuses to let me play it while she is in the oom.  --------------POSSIBLE SPOILERS------------  This movie is a masterpiece for its genre. I especially appreciate several of it's \"rarities\". First, it's seriousness.No lame jokes and sarcasm that is so prevalent today. No super macho junk. Nobody fighting the monster with martial arts. Nobody telling their life's story. Nobody saying \"fire in the hole\", \"he's mine\", or any other too cool cliches of today. No woman \"dressed to kill\" hefting a shotgun or the latest bazooka. No distracting romance or flirting with the opposite sex. Example ,the movie \"Speed\". Sandra Bullock flirting with, laughing with, being coy with Keanu Reeves while driving a bus with a bomb underneath it. Give me a break!!! \" The Thing\" is a serious movie. It is believable.  It is about 12 men facing a monstrous problem and nothing else. That is enough.  Jokes , sarcasm, cliches, and any romance would have ruined it's hard edge. They would have made it infinitely less scary. It is a simple movie without distracting side storylines. This is really a one of a kind movie the likes which will probably never be seen again. I think ole John C. and Rob Bottin really were hell bent to top \"Alien\" and they did. To me they topped everything else too. Too bad JC did'nt wait a while for ET to go away to release it. Many people do not agree with me about the movie's merits and it does have it's faults but I hope I can one day see a more perfect horror movie than this. This is the movie that every SIFI and horror movie promised to be but this and only this delivered all the goods.And without a rubber suit, computers, and very little stop motion.(One scene with stop motion at the end got deleted before release--it is included on the dvd) Side note- I don't fully agree that it is all that bloody. Most of the red stuff comes from the alien when it \"melts\".Most of the gore is the alien creature when it changes shapes.Except for the \"chest with teeth\" scene there really are almost no scenes where humans are shown much bloodshed(Watch it again and you will see what I'm talking about). Even the guy who gets his head roped into the creatures \"jawhead\" only has creature red stuff on him and his head is melting when he gets lose. The people who have a problem with the dog's head splitting should realize that it is the alien dog, not a regular dog. Get real, people.This alien is SERIOUS and is an equal opportunity advocate. My favorite scene?? The begining, the end, and everything in between. As for the guy who said he did not see any actors he knew except Kirk Russel. How many TV shows and movies has he seen?? Buy the DVD and watch it every 2 years. It gets better with age.By the way, they needed the flame throwers to melt the snow, right?",

I also enjoyed how there were no women in the feature mainly because it meant no love story would be included.  This is one of those few movies where you wouldn't want a thing like love to slow a character down.  Also I doubt they wouldn't be trusted just like any other person, which means there couldn't be a love story.  One of my favorite parts is in the beginning where the Swedish guy throws the grenade and goes after it.  Childs would have to be my favorite character just because of his attitude.

There were way too many implications and plot glitches. So anyway, let's weigh up the pro's and cons.Special effects: good for the time. Kurt Russell's best role. Palmer is f--kin rad. Always something happening. (seldom boring) Excellent tension build up. the token black guys are also cool. The music is very fitting. (and chilling)On the bad side there are a number of plot problems.let's look at who is and isn't the thing over the movie: (spoiler bit) Is: palmer, windows, norris, Bennings, Blair? isn't: fuchs, nauls, garry, childs,clarke,doc,macready.They didn't have to kill everyone, and why did they just end up with the hero and one random guy? how did clarke not become the thing too? how do we know who was the thing first out of norris and palmer? who infected them? was it blair? what's the deal with blair? or was it the corpse of that dog or Bennings? The Norwegian guys and Clarke were unfairly killed and no one really seemed to give s--t.Ultimately I probably sound pretty stupid and have missed a number of things - I was watching this very late at night.I also wonder about some of the metaphorical aspects of the film. Maybe the ending is more realistic, but the supernatural premise of the film is unrealistic so they may as well just have had the token \"sentimental\" ending. The arctic setting is barren and agoraphobic, it reminds me of movies like Batman, where it seems the city or place they live in is the whole world and it doesn't matter what is happening everywhere else.Ultimately it's quite the interesting film and fun to speculate over too.

Yes, alien did this well too, but that movies protagonists had that huge spaceship to run and hide in as well as those escape vessels, for the men at the research station in this movie however, escape is not an option.

In addition to being a great sci-fi/horror/action flick, John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" also has a great element of suspense as well: who is really human and who isn't? Only \"The Thing\" knows for sure as it goes about killing off the motley crew of losers and misfits forced to deal with it and replacing its' victims with perfect look-alikes! Needless to add, this doesn't make things any easier for our ragtag and mostly gutless heroes, who are at each other's throats every time someone gets killed since they all suspect each other of being the extra-terrestrial murderer.

It had been a number of years since I had last seen it, but I recalled being impressed with the special effects and location so I decided to check it out again. What an excellent film !The basic outline of the story is that a group of American scientists are alerted to strange goings-on in a nearby Norwegian outpost. After investigating, they discover the charred remains of a hideously deformed 'thing' outside the burnt out Norwegian compound. As you do, they take it back to base, only to discover it isn't dead and whatever it is that they have found has the ability to transform itself into other living organisms, including the scientists. Without giving too much away, the scientists must try and identify who is human and who is alien before it's too late. Excellent special effects and a great supporting cast lead by Kurt Russell, breathtaking cinematography and exceptional direction by John Carpenter make this a timeless film which will have you on the edge of your seat. Does anyone survive ? You'll have to watch and see ! The DVD features a wealth of extra features including a documentary and commentary, which further add to the enjoyment of the film itself.",

It follows and reproduces the whole \"Who Goes There\" story as seen in films such as Alien and to a lesser extent Aliens, but because the Thing has no shape it becomes a psychological issue instead of diluting into a monster movie.  Not to say that \"The Thing\" doesn't rely on gore or cheap scares to entertain - it does.  But that isn't central to the story.  It also walks the very fine line of being pretentious, but doesn't fall over the edge.

With everything else being a 'Jaws' retread, 'The Thing' is a bit refreshing, using a plot line that isn't done much anymore, even with its over the top effects--an isolated, spooky bump-in-the-night story.  Carpenter does a delicious job of presenting enough shadows, questions, and uncertainty to capture the effect.  The acting is top-notch, with every character a level deeper then caricature.  But clearly, what everyone remembers is the best special effects scenes ever made, and stand-up incredibly well today.  The Thing also is a credible point in the war against CGI effects: imagine those gooey episodes today, with fake-o looking CGI, for example, as in 'The Faculty,' and you can see how the animatronics and latex still are the most credible looking effects that can be used in a film.'The Thing' wouldn't be even close to successful with CGI.",

            "content": "Just to have mentioned it, I'm up to double digit numbers when counting the number of times I've let myself become a part of this movie. To me it's a classic, maybe not due to the story, maybe not because it isn't the best movie ever made (maybe Lost Highway is?) but because of the embodying atmosphere Carpenter creates, the way he tells this simple story, the way it doesn't fully scare you, but the way it makes you feel... alive.Carpenter's The Thing is a true masterpiece in a way you are left to appreciate yourself, you may like to delve and criticise such things as the plot and characters, or you can simply not say anything about it. I love the atmosphere in this movie, the slow pace of the movie, from the start... the music, the ice, the snow, the cold yet comfortable air, the atmosphere that so surrounds you, the whole from the start to the limit of infinity, to the end. The still dense music that puts you in a mood (if you allow yourself) that makes the whole movie so perfect. Just feel relaxed.Carpenter might not be true to Campbells novel, but then again isn't the novel a story of an immense yet subtle threat to humanity, and isn't Carpenters movie that too? While the heart of the novel lies in the conversations between the scientists at a polar research station, their suspicions, their fear, fear of each other, fear of the entity... the alien... their dwellings on what it is, it's nature, why it acts like it does... and while Campbells novel is a storywise and storytellingwise original masterpiece (out of which infinitely many clones have come, storywise as well as storytellingwise, Campbell - as we all know - started the Golden Era in the 30's of science fiction novel's, the era during which Asimov, Simak, Heinleinen, Clark and the others released either some of their first or some of their best novel's, all of which somehow went over to Campbells premise of not writing science fiction stories of galaxy sized fights with heroes throwing planets at each other, but stories with a content, a premise, an atmosphere...). Carpenter's movie has a story based up on the novel by Campbell, but Carpenter doesn't place the heart of the movie on the conversations between the scientists at the research station, the scientists do fear and focus their thoughts on what it is among them that is killing and why it does so, but Carpenter has cut up and reassembled the story and tells it his own way, and he does this by simple means... that so talks to you.Set on a research station (unclear what research is actually conducted there) surrounded by cold ice, cold snow... all through the movie one sits still, sometimes jumping up or trying to control ones eyes as an unexpected gross effect takes place (no computer animated effects, real - somewhat - cronenberg styled effects, heads falling, dripping of the bodies). Still all the time, at no time control over the movie is lost, the slow, the still.. lovely paced way of bringing forth the movie is never lost, things go quiet, brings you back, small things happen, all the time the fear returns as one does not know from where the entity, the thing, will attack next, you don't necessarily get truly scared (though some things might actually accomplish that, depends on who you are), but one does feel the tension, and as such lets the movie continue, all the while... the music plays... who goes there is truly what one wonders. It's still, it's cold, the music comes in and with the visuals builds up an atmosphere I've never found in any other movie. With atmosphere I simply mean atmosphere, what is the atmosphere like in your room, still, dark, quiet..? That's atmosphere, not so fascinating being a part of the atmosphere in your room (unless one can manage to find some deep philosophical meaning with ones empty room, then it can become fascinating, but that's to noone but yourself), but being there, being a part of the air, the cold air, the icy snow covered lands, the loneliness.. the isolation and the threat... it's a thought that grows on you... scares you..I wish to avoid saying anything about the story, it's a science fiction movie, both horror/thriller suspense, but in the ground it is a movie with a story and an atmosphere that somehow talks greatly to me, not that I love the cold winter, but the stillness of the antarctic, the knowledge of the icy atmosphere, the mood, the dense - melting into - music, just helps bring this atmosphere, this movie alive...The story isn't simple, the threat is just such a well known threat, but never have the whole concept of an single entity, one single aliens threat to the whole of humanity, been filmed better...The Thing is, we don't know Who Goes There...",

The main thing that keeps the horror in this movie so good is the tension that builds between all of the characters (like the characters, we as the audience are not shown who is the creature until it's suddenly revealed to us and the guys in the movie and it's keeps us on the same level of tension and anxiety as the characters and it's so well handled with great scenes of dialogue and other tense scenes like the blood testing scene right up to the last scene which leaves you wondering g if one of them is the monster or not because this movie keeps you in a sense of dread and terror until the very end. This movie also contains some of the best practical effects ever put to screen (each unique look that the monster has whether it's the dog or on of the guys in the movie stills looks incredible almost 40 years later and it sucks that critics and audiences at the time hated it and it thankfully praised now) and all the acting is great (Kurt Russell is great, Keith David is awesome, all of the actors brought the right level of tension and dread to this film) and this movie is masterfully directed by John Carpenter (not just with the amazing cinematography, but in the way he keeps us as isolated in this facility as the characters because you honestly feel cold watching it and the level of atmosphere that this movie has is amazing.

I still am not sure as to weather or not Kurt Russel (who amazes here) was a thing or not. the film is abigous; it ends on that same note; and along the way it's a roller coaster so terrifying it makes Carpenter's other best work - Halloween - look tame by comparison.Rob Bottin's surreallistic creature effects are shown very little; they probably only dominate less than a quater of the screen time and are used very effectivley. all of the effects are the old-fashioned, mechanical-puppet variety, and yet each and every one is so convincing and realistic that they, themselves become fearsome. add that to a deeply, profoundly effecting excercise in what I can only define as psychological tourture and you have a modern science fiction classic. I cannot find a single thing wrong with this film, and trust me, I've tried. just a warning beforehand:if you should choose to see this movie, know as little about it beforehand as possible and be perpared: this film hits you, and it hits you HARD, and it doesn't stop. this is as effective, smart, errie, and terrifying a film as you'll find anywhere in any genre.and they say horror isn't an art. it is, ladies and gentlemen, and this film is proof of it. regarded by critcs and fans alike to be a modern classic of every kind, don't miss John Carpenter's Science-Fiction-Horror masterpeice.man is the warmest place to hide....",

The unspectacular, minimal eerie score was just right for adding to the feeling of cold and isolation in the film.But I'm quite puzzled at the cult status this film has achieved over the years.  The effects were supposedly quite revolutionary for their time, though I didn't think they were anything more than 50's schlock horror effects with a bigger budget. By today's standards, the effects are downright cheesy and I found myself chuckling rather than chucking at them. Indeed, the sense of suspense was well built up, and the plot mostly consisted of \"who will die next, and what disgusting way will it happen?\". This is sufficient motivation for the characters in the film, and though there wasn't much character development, I suppose it wouldn't have been worth it as they would just die by the time you got to know them.But overall, the film was reasonably average.  What's all the fuss about?Finally - I could go into this at some length if I had the energy, but I couldn't help notice the film being a metaphor for repressed homosexuality, or men's attitudes towards homosexuality among their own ranks.\"The Thing\" is fear, repression;  \"Does he have the thing? What if _I_ get the thing?  Everyone will want to KILL me if I get The Thing!  Maybe if I try to KILL the Thing, they'll think I don't have it!\"I thought maybe I was reading too far into this, you could apply any primal fears to the thing, but what did it for me was three things (!).  Firstly, there are NO women in the film!!! Why? It was totally possible, in fact likely that there would be women on the base, but they are noticeably absent. Secondly,the ending, where only Kurt Russell's and one other character are left alive, around a fireplace (burning debris).  Perhaps it was poor acting, but there was warmth in their characters, and the final words uttered were to the effect of \"What do we do now?\", to which Russell answers \"Well let's just see what happens.\". And finally.  The tagline for the film : \"Man is the warmest place to hide\".Hmmmmmmm. Eh?  No doubt hundreds of angry fans will send me evil hate mail, it's just an opinion. I did think it was an entertaining film. Honest. :)",

This is actually one of the very best horror films that I have ever seen. John Carpenter did well.I also remember that even before that I had seen the original old 1950s version on T.V., and that one even holds up pretty good today. Overall - it seems that the basic, original story plot and premise is so good that it works almost completely on it's own merit - so far - every time it's made (or more accurately \"remade\"). The original story that both films are based upon - entitled \"Who Goes There?\" - by John Campbell, seems to have been a literal magic formula for the perfect model of horror. It seems to press just the right buttons in our brains to reliably work.The core premise to the 1980s version is terrifying to contemplate. Imagine a compound creature that can infect you with tiny, microbial versions of itself like a virus just by physically touching you even briefly - and then slowly eat you from the inside out while it replicates and grows, and perfectly copies every cell, every organ, every tissue it consumes ruthlessly - until all that is left of you is an imitation. A creature that can just \"absorb\" you by touching you - or infect you with itself by spraying you with it's bodily fluids. The absolute definition of a \"monster\". A trail blazing - red letter concept, and a ground breaker for the Sci Fi and Horror genres.I have seen this film about a hundred times, and it's still creepy and blood curdling every time I see it. If you can get a Blue Ray, DVD, or digital downloaded copy of this movie - then I strongly recommend establishing viewing it as an annual Halloween night ritual. It goes great with dim or no lights, popcorn or T.V. dinners, soda pop, a comfy sofa, and a friend or family member - especially if they are easily spooked!",

After investigating what appeared to be a frozen-alien tomb, the team get more than they bargained for when the stray dog starts to show its true colors, and identity.

I understand this movie was made back in the day but the monster, alien thingys did not scare me at all. They were gooey and I guess gross in a way but not frightening. So I quickly gave up on actually expected to be scared by this movie and just carried out for the suspense which it also lacked. It just felt entirely too predictable. You could tell who was who and even how the characters would act just by looking at them. The movie gave the characters no real backstories, motives, fears, families, favorite foods anything. I feel like each character was given 2 personality traits and thrown into the movie. I won't call out the characters for acting stupid at times, cause it's a scary movie, but what bugged me was that they seemed completely unafraid of dying (at least how I would expect). I understand being hysteric in their situation but the only 2 emotions these characters showed were hysteria and anger, If I had been in this movie I would have thrown up, peed my pants and balled my eyes out within like 10 minutes. I did not care if any of them survived or not. It was kinda boring and I wouldn't watch it again. I did like the soundtrack, the scenery of the movie, and it had a plot that made sense, I think it really just lacked good characters.",

I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys those computer generated special effects that we see all of the time. This movie makes great use of the old methods of puppetry and rubber molding that should still be used today. What you see on the screen seems real and gory and in some cases messy. In other words, it is there for you to see. Not added later by a computer. The true horror about this film is the fact that it was a box office flop. This movie deserved much better when originally released. It should have made it's money back ten times over. There is the lighter side of alien films.(like E.T.)

Inspired by \"The Thing From Another Planet,\" and that film's basis on the short story \"Who Goes There?\", John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" is a masterpiece in horror and sci-fi cinema-- not to mention Carpenter's single greatest film to date (sorry \"Halloween\" fans!).Due to incredibly bad timing at the box office (E.T. anyone?) \"The Thing\" was a commercial failure-- but found a \"cult\" following on video, and for good reason. Carpenter exploits his ensemble cast (with the like of Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, T.K. Carter, and best of all Keith David) and claustrophobic Antartic setting to provide the viewer with true feelings of paranoia and fear.The story itself centers around a mysterious alien creature that crash landed into the Antartic thousands of years ago. After a scientific team digs up the creature's spacecraft, it thaws out, and the terror begins. Able to manipulate its body to imitate any other living being, the members of the scientific team soon turn on each other-- no one knowing who to trust when anyone could be... \"The Thing.\"Movie fans in general will get a kick out of \"The Thing,\" which is required viewing for any true horror or sci-fi fan. If you can, get a hold of the DVD or watch the film during a run on the Sci-Fi channel-- Carpenter's films, especially this one, are not worth seeing if you cannot see them in the widescreen aspect ratio.Highly recommended.

            "content": "------------- MY RATING: 68/100 -------------*CONTAINS SPOILERS!*\"The Thing\" is another classic horror film from the 80s. Unfortunately, it seems I am the only one who struggles with the 80s sci-fi movies...The plot is indeed an innovative one, an alien life form crashed on Earth 100.000 years ago is being discovered and revived by a Nordic research team in Antarctic. The alien functions on the cellular level with unknown original appearance and infects any life form and absorbs it to create a mutated combination of anything it absorbed so far and all that on multiple hosts. Being smart and adaptive, it can take one form at a time to imitate an ordinary organism and it seems it can even absorb memories and habits to adapt even further when it has taken a intelligent life form (ex. a human). The American research team will soon find out that the crazy Norwegian who chased for miles a dog wasn't that crazy and will have to come up with their own plan to survive when the discovery of the mutated form hits the plot.\"The Thing\" does a great job scaring you under a confusing and unpredicted predicament. It's visual effects are great and horrifying and the disturbing \"fade to black\" scenes of the movie are hiding you what you need to know to keep yourself relaxed and \"in control\" of the plot.However, the movie is seriously hurt by multiple problems. While the plot is great, cinematography is mediocre and writing is clunky, convenient and unrealistic. Some examples:1) When the dog is led to the room with the other dogs we have great lighting. When the dog transforms and while the other dogs are screaming, one of the characters, in almost zero visibility and complete darkness, calmly opens the door only to realize that there is something horrible inside. As they burn the creature for 2 seconds with a flamethrower, the alien dies immediately and without any second thoughts they distinguish the fire and carry it without quarantine measures to examine it. Then, the doctor has a perfect super computer which can run cellular simulations and calculate the probabilities of infection.2) Throughout the movie and until the last minute, while it is more than clear to the dumbest that the creature strikes those who are separated, our characters are conveniently and stupidly separated all the time, making it extra easy for the creature to devour them. After the 7th time, it really gets annoying, massively downgrading the movie and making you build great frustration.3) Initially, the characters are not really surprised with the discovery, making you look more surprised, despite you are located in your safe sofa in the real world.4) While the characters are trying to save themselves individually and seem so selfish for the 3/4 of the movie, they unrealistically offer to burn down the entire complex and freeze to death in the end.5) The scene with the shark-stomach is voted as one of the most hilarious death scenes of all time and the spider head nearly makes its escape without any of the characters realize it, despite that thing was making noise and it was too big to leave unnoticed. And let's forget that it didn't simply run but waited to be killed by the flamethrower (again)!6) While the creature makes a full reveal in the end and was always devouring its victims immediately, it just stares at our protagonist growling, giving him enough time to use a dynamite to blow it up!All and all, the movie is classic with a great, original plot and truly disgusting horror scenes to shake your spine but the film itself will probably leave you more frustrated than scared.",

I was secretly thinking \"I'll bet he can't rise to the level of inducing the real symptoms of a myocardial infarction.\" I had friends over to help me critique that night. I don't think anyone said a word or even got up to go the bathroom for the duration. Just this side of the emergency room, I had to take 2 NTGs during the movie and an extra Verapamil afterward. Who knew that such a flick could sicken and mesmerize at the same time?Who knew it would age so well? Twenty-four years later, I'm still awed by The Thing and Carpenter's ability to exude 100% confidence and skill in obtaining just the right results. I'm glad he didn't use the alternate ending with MacCready's survival. Then there were Rob Bottin's amazing special effects. No CGIs. He deserved more than The Saturn. I thrilled at the wonderfully creepy claustrophobic effect.Who knew...that the delicious feature in this movie were the characters' paranoia...Who knew who was who? Who knew if he had the infection?I haven't seen a better sci-fi horror to date.",

            "content": "As well as being one of Carpenter's finest films, this truly gruesome creature feature is an object lesson in how to pace a 'haunted house' movie. Morricone's eerie score sets the tone for the movie, and the opening sequence alone creates a more palpable sense of dread than any overblown CGI effect.\n*MINOR SPOILER*In this sequence, a lone husky dog is pursued by a helicopter across a lonely arctic waste.  A man perched over the side of the helicopter is shooting at the husky, lobbing grenades at it, infact anything to kill it, and his increasing desperation tips us off that there's something not quite right with this scenario.  Infact, the husky is a 'Thing'.\n*END OF SPOILER*Since the 'Thing' in question is an alien being that can mimic any creature it touches, this creates a problem for the motley collection of scientists marooned in the Arctic base (which provides the film's setting).  First of all, since any single part of the 'Thing' is sentient in itself, it's very difficult to kill it.  Secondly, the 'Thing' could be one of them.In the main role, Kurt Russell creates the same type of cool-as-ice persona as Snake Plisskin in 'Escape From New York,' but the supporting cast are equally effective.  Infact, since the 'Thing' isn't actually seen for much of the movie, the film builds up tension through the increasing sense of paranoia and distrust between the characters.  This Hitchcockian element, often overlooked, is a key ingredient to the film's effectiveness.When the 'Thing' does appear, however, it's certainly memorable.  In one scene, a dog's head opens up like a banana, in another, a human head peels off at the neck, grows legs and stalk-eyes, and scuttles along the floor like a crab.  The response of one character, appropriately, is \"you gotta be f***ing kidding!\" But it's the moments between these gruesome episodes that truly justify the film's greatness, and the unusually downbeat ending is a worthy payoff.  A great flick, which chills as much as shocks.4 out of 5",

Then a couple of weeks ago I saw it in a video shop and had to buy it. 5 years on and its still as scary, as usual the music is dark and atmospheric. Some of the scenery too helps add to the atmosphere and sense of isolation. The opening scene is ingenious, again it helps add to the mysterious atmosphere,then something goes wrong and they realize what the opening scene was about. Its a similar Alien style of letting the alien on board and now The Thing is in the base, thats when it gets exciting (excitinger). The Thing can mimic people and so follows a mixture of paranoia and incredible special effects.The effects are gory, some of them just really make you think \"Whats going on in John Carpenters head?\" They really are that weird, but then that only adds to the credibility of this alien in that it is so weird and well...Alien. As I have mentioned quite a few times this is a very atmospheric film, the music, the way its directed, the cold, dark, desolate feeling. The Characters too are very good, though MacReady(Russell) and possibly Gary and Blair stand out as some of the more interesting characters. If there is a flaw its possibly in the actual physics of the creature. The Assimilation process seems unclear, there is a vague explanation which having seen several times now still seems unclear. But this is a minor fault and really does no harm overall to the film. The effects at the ending are a real extravaganza, Russell in full Snake mode(escape from L.A./New York) delivers a crisp one liner before finishing off the Thing. I really liked this film, its very atmospheric and dark, the clever twists and turns are real edge of your seat stuff and the effects are incredible.If you want to be scared out of your wits this is definitely for you. The whole alien body snatching theme isn't that original and possibly the actual technical side of the Thing could do with some refining. Overall though a damn good film, a must for any horror fan.

However, an early memory of mine is sitting with my father watching \"The Thing From Outer Space.\"  Oddly enough, nearly twenty years later, watching it on TCM, it still scares the daylights out of me.However, John Carpenter, who admits to an influence of the original film also takes great care in preserving the original story set forth by \"Who Goes There?\" takes a much different route in the creation of his film. The result is a vision of harrowing emotional impact not seen in contemporary horror films of the past twenty years.The greatest factor in speaking of \"John Carpenter's The Thing\" is the claustrophobic feel of its environment.  Being trapped in Antarctica is likely enough to drive anyone to madness, but introducing the idea of an elusive intruder furthers this concept.  We the audience find ourselves freely engaging and interacting with the characters who are equally terrified of this new and frightening otherworldy force of nature.  To see these people (not heroes or villains by any stretch of the imagination) deteriorate throughout the slow pace of the film, we experience a fear unlike that of any film that was released during this period.  Instead of being affected by great special effects (to which this film can boast for its time), we are instead trapped inside the same research station as the characters, trapped and victim to our own machinations and fears of lonliness and desperation.This truly is John Carpenter's gift to film lovers and horror afficianados alike.

The subject for this episode is the Ultimate In Alien Terror: John Carpenter's The Thing.This film is without a doubt an all time classic, but it was certainly a struggle for it to achieve that status. Released in the summer of 1982, it was considered a disappointment with critics and audiences alike. Many people, including John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, attribute this to the popularity of E.T., a film that stands in sharp contrast to the nihilistic tone of the Thing. However, the film found its audience when it was later released on home video. It soon achieved cult status. And slowly, but surely, over the course of the 28 years since it's theatrical release, The Thing has risen to the ranks of being one of the greatest horror films of all time. It's of general consensus that John Carpenter's two greatest films are Halloween and the Thing. And even though I personally am a HUGE mark for anything involving John Carpenter, I would agree with this assessment. Both films have had a substantial impact on the genre, the difference being that Halloween had an immediate impact upon it's release, whereas the influence of The Thing was more of a gradual process, fittingly enough. And neither film, in my opinion, is necessarily better than the other. What makes The Thing so special, and is more than likely one of the major reasons why people have embraced this film, is that it is a culmination of every great aspect of John Carpenter's filmography. In other words, it's the ULTIMATE John Carpenter movie.FOR MORE, CLICK ON THE LINKhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC4HArjL4bg",

Kurt Russell (R.J. MacReady) and Keith David (Childs) are extremely noteworthy during the film. Special Effects: The special effects are impressive, and in my opinion would hold up in movies today.

            "content": "In the summer of 1982, audiences were presented with 2 very different types of alien movie. Whilst millions of moviegoers were won over by the warm, fuzzy antics of Steven Spielberg's E.T. on the other side of the fence was John Carpenter's The Thing, an altogether more vile and repulsive prospect. Needless to say, warm and fuzzy won out at the box office.22 years on and vile and repulsive have given way to revered and respected. Quite simply put, Carpenter's magnificent movie has stood the test of time well and is, in the opinion of many, (myself included), his finest film and considering the work of genius that is Halloween, which he directed 4 years earlier, is no mean feat. Sure, there are gorier films that have come out in the past 20 years, but few of them carry the same clout as seeing The Thing for the first time. When it first burst onto the scene, it was groundbreaking stuff. The effects were second to none. A dog's face splitting open; a human chest opening to reveal vicious, razor sharp teeth; a head sprouting legs and scurrying across the floor - just some of the surreal treats in store. If it had been made in the last decade, most of the effects would have been created with CGI, but the fact that everything you see is 'in the flesh' only adds to the jaw dropping astonishment of seeing these weird and wonderful creations.Bucket loads of gore alone, do not a great film make and fortunately The Thing has a number of great performances along with a great story to add to the mix of mayhem. Critics often complain that films lack any real characters and that there is no one to care about. Not so with The Thing. It may not seem obvious at first, but repeated viewings highlight the individual characteristics of the main players and in spite of the situation they are in, they behave in a credible manner throughout. There is a real sense that these men have been stationed at the base for a long time and that they have learned to tolerate each other even if they do not necessarily like each other.The underlying theme of the film is trust, or lack of. As the story progresses, it becomes uncertain as to who may, or may not be The Thing. It could be any of them, or it could be none of them. Tension rises and tempers fray as one by one, they each fall under suspicion. It's surely, no coincidence that Quentin Tarantino, who cites this as one of his favourite films, took the theme of trust and used it to great effect in his own film, Reservoir Dogs.There are so many great scenes in this film, it's difficult to pick one, but highlights must surely include: the defibrillator scene; the blood test scene and of course the infamous head stretching until it falls off the table and sprouts legs and runs away. Everyone has their favourite!The ending is satisfyingly ambiguous and has provided fans of the movie with plenty to debate. Spin off comics and even a hugely enjoyable console / PC game have helped to sustain interest in the film over the years.Rumours have persisted that a remake of The Thing will appear as a TV mini-series. Please, for the love of whichever deity you believe in, don't do it!!! If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Too many times a remake / re-imagining (whatever you want to call them) has tarnished the good name of a classic film.The DVD edition of The Thing is a true gem. Crammed with extras, the highlight is the commentary track with John Carpenter and Kurt Russell. It's informative and entertaining (as Carpenter's commentaries always are) and just listen to Russell roar with laughter during the aforementioned defibrillator scene. Priceless!As a side note, it has to be said that, generally speaking, people with beards in films, are not cool. In The Thing, Kurt Russell makes wearing a beard seem effortlessly cool!If you've never seen John Carpenter's The Thing, do yourself a favour and buy it / rent it, turn the lights off, take the phone off the hook and sit back and enjoy. I envy you, I wish I could watch it again for the first time.",

That's exactly what the dog-thing was also trying to do. As long as it was frozen, it could basically experience immortality. This is an obvious variation from the novel.However, I especially like the comment about the Norwegians. No disrespect to anyone who's Norwegian, but I would be pretty scared too if someone came up to me and started speaking Norwegian and carrying a pretty big gun, obviously being ticked off about something.I was wondering: when both the dog(I'm sorry, I forget his real-life name!) and Palmer are transforming, it seems like they were in a lot of pain. As Jeff Goldblum's character in Jurassic Park established, evolution can be a very painful process, and I can't think of anything more painful than going through it in a few minutes.

What sounds like a fairly average monster confrontation, it achieved so much better due to its way of thinking:\"Less is more.... but when you want more, you go over the top!\"It may not be expected but there are actually few monster scenes during 'The Thing'. Suspense is drawn and a huge amount of time is given for the characters to develop, particularly the way they interact with one another. As well as each member being very believable, you can imagine that such a team actually exists. As with the more well known 'Alien', seeing the characters goof around by eating, playing pool and the like draws you into the experience far deeper than just letting an actor play a stereotype. Some of the script is also hilarious, such as the captains suggestion on the couch.Once the scene has been set, the fairly sedated start wakes up with one hell of snarl. You have never seen any monsters before like this, not ones which look so realistic. Todays audience is constantly bombarded with CGI effects, to the point where we can instantly tell when they are being used. 'The Thing' is 'Old School' with its effects, displaying some truly unbelievable anamatronics. For todays audience, we are able to spot the flaws in these effects, but at the time I imagine that the audience would of been absolutely stiff in their cinema seats. To put it straight, these are some of the best effects ever to grace a film. Its worth bearing in mind that 'The Thing' was beaten to the Oscar for special effects by 'E.T, the Exrta-Terrerestral'. Hmm.Saying this, we all know effects don't make a film. But they certainly add to the atmosphere. If the film was remade with CGI effects, it just wouldn't have the same effect. The film also stands head and shoulders over other horror films due to the 'Who did it?' element that is maintained throughout. You will be constantly guessing who 'The Thing' really is, adding another physiological element to the film. However, there are some aspects which stops 'The Thing' from being truly great. The music throughout is fairly dire, and laughable when you give it attention. The ending to the film is also quite a disappointment, snatching a satisfying conclusion just from the viewer at the last minutes. When viewing the film as a whole however these points are particularly minor, especially considering what this film has going for it.'The Thing' is a film that will not leave the viewers memory for a long time, and is one you will certainly be telling your friends you watched last night. There isn't anything else out there quite like it, which is a crying shame. If all horror films were more like 'The Thing', the world would be a better place...",

As you watch the film, you begin to feel the loneliness, hopelessness, and terror that the characters feel. Being isolated on a polar icecap with a team of colleagues, one or more of whom might be a killer alien, with no means of escape would certainly invoke terror in me. The special effects are not highly technical, and I like that. They are realistic. The main thing (excuse the pun) that makes this film great is the acting. The actors convince you that what you are seeing is real, and that they are really in danger, not a group of actors pretending in front of a camera. Kurt Russell is great, but he is just one of the fine actors in the film. Many of them are character actors.I especially enjoyed the performances of Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Richard Dysart, and Donald Moffatt. If the film were cast with lesser-quality actors, I don't think the film would be as good. One other item: this film is reminiscent of \"Alien,\" but that's certainly not a bad thing. Both films are excellent, and although they have many things in common, they are two separate, distinct films, each worthy of viewing and enjoying on their own. Highly recommended!",

At that time, I had not scene any of Carpenter's movie, except for Halloween, but even then I was about eight. After watch The Thing, I now own every mainstream John Carpenter movie and love the guy's work. It showcased some spectacular gore, creepy score, excellent performances, and a great story, illustrated with genuine paranoia and fear. First and foremost, the astonishing special effects in this movie are one reason to watch this movie, even if you don't like horror movies. Rob Bottin and his crew created, in my opinion, the most realistic gore effects second only to Day of the Dead. My favorite is either in the dog kennel or the scene with the defibrillator. WOW! I won't say anymore. Do yourself a favor and just watch this movie.The score, though not composed by Carpenter, is unsettling and creepy. It fits the movie perfectly and doesn't overpower it at all. To this day when I watch it, I am still creeped out by it.Even though there are 12 guys in this movie, they are so different and well developed that I can name all of them right off the top of my head. Even the minor characters like Bennings, Fuchs, Nauls, and even the Norwegians are memorable and enjoyable. Kurt Russell gives a fantastic performance here as R.J. MacReady, even rivaling his role of Snake Plissken. This man means business and I would want him to be one my side if push came to shove.Keith David as Childs is wonderfully sarcastic as usual, I mean the man is an expert at playing this role. A. Wilford Brimley plays Blair perfectly. The man can act. The other supporting characters are great too, especially Norris and Clark.The story, based on the short story \"Who Goes There?\" is adapted perfectly. The fact that it's set in Antarctica already ups the isolation factor. Add in 12 uneasy, unstable and panicky men with a shape-shifting alien that can imitate anything perfectly, and the paranoia level is cranked up to 11.This movie is one of the few movies that actually scares me. The movie itself is creepy, but after you watch it, I guarantee that it will stick with you and creep you out. Go out and either rent or buy it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",

I am an aspiring film maker, and I only wish that I could of come up with the brillant work that is this movie.Originally, when I first saw it. I wasn't impressed, I was younger, stupid, and used to the original version of the \"The Thing\" A couple years later, I had gotten a dvd player, and when I had some money on me, I was looking to buy some dvds. Then John Carpenter's The Thing caught my eye. If you asked me why I bought this movie, i couldn't tell you why to this day, cause even though, it was the most expensive dvd, and if I had not bought it, I could have gotten 2 dvds for the same price. I went ahead and bought this movie. From then on watching it again, I realised things about it. Things I probably didnt understand when I was younger. Which is what makes this movie brillant, cause you have to think.Sure, this movie has gore and everything like that, but that doesnt mean anything! Some people view that as a bad thing, but it's not. Not everything in life is sugar coated, and if there was a thing like that from outer space, Im sure it would be alot like that way from the movie. The gore isnt what I love about it though. One thing that makes John Carpenter great, is that I think alot like him. He uses alot of cheap thrills, and to me cheap thrills are the best thrills. I love the fact that the movie is built on paranoia. The scene where Fukes, is walking with a candle, and the dark figure runs by him, and he says \"who's that!?\" is just scary. It leaves alot open for the imagination from that point. You ask yourself \"who was that?\" and since it's dark, it makes you wonder what it looked like too. That's why to me, showing the thing is not as effective as when you dont. Carpenter did have alot of gore and showed alot in the movie, but when you think about it, there was alot he didn't show. That he left open for the imagination. And you weren't sure who was who. The dvd is great too, cause you get to hear the commentary by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell. Little suttle things that Carpenter did as a director is what makes this movie great. Just one shot in the movie, of Kurt Russell from behind is really effective...because it makes you wonder \"is he being watched, or is he a thing?\" In my eyes, it always seemed like he was being watched, and that to me is scary.",

This leaves all the characters questioning who is the \"Thing\".As the film progresses tensions increase between everyone. Paranoia, suspense, and desperation, becomes the prominent feeling and mood among the members of the expedition as each one slowly falls victim to the alien.The soundtrack by Ennio Morricone purveys the dread and despair that the characters feel throughout the film. It does a great deal to add to the suspense. Along with the setting which takes place in Antartica, the viewer is left to wonder if there is any escape from not only the alien, but from the most unforgiving climate in the world. The word \"cold\" is an appropriate and applicable explanation of this film.The Thing is perhaps the most suspenseful horror movie ever made.

The thing may be one of the bloodiest movies i have seen but i think its one of the best horror movies.What i like about it is when The Thing gets on people you have to think who it is.I think The Thing isn't just a horror movie its also makes you think.If you like really good horror movies you need to see this!",

I immediately purchased the 20th anniversary DVD Edition a couple of years ago and enjoyed that as well. However, I watched it recently and I realized that this film does not stand well over the test of time. The reason could be that we, as science fiction fans have seen the best special effects money can buy in the past 20 years. When I watch this movie, even though the effects were great at the time, now they seem quite tame.Also, even though the film had it's tense moments, I feel that there was too much talking. Also, one scene in particular, when the men first see \"The Thing\", they have a meeting afterwards to discuss what to do. They begin speaking to the \"Helicopter Pilot\" on what to do! They have a couple of scientists standing there, but, instead put their trust in this guy. I could never understand that scene.However, even with these minor flaws, the film is still one of my favorite science fiction movies of all time. I am a big John Carpenter fan but I have noticed that many of his films have missed the mark and did poorly at the box office. Having said that, this does not mean that his films haven't been good entertainment.I have been waiting for a sequel for over 20 years but that will never happen. Usually films that die at the box office do not warrant a sequel. Still, I think it would have been a good story.Ringo",

The Tjing is one of my favourite films, along with Brazil, Star Wars and Shinen No Samurai. The tension Carpenter builds up, and up, and up, until something terrifying happens, like someones head falling off, or a guy getting his hands eaten by a mouth in someones stomach. From beginning to end, it is a gripping film, starting with a strange chase in a helicopter, with Norwegiens attempting to kill a dog, to the end when MacReady and Childs sitting in the snow talking. The graphics are sick and twisted at the most pleasant moments, and that is the kind of thing I like. The only thing I disagree with is the dogs face splitting open. I am an animal lover, so I think that it should be them chasing a man instead of a dog, and that guy kills a load of scientists instead of slaughtering the huskies. Apart from that, it is a perfect movie, mixing horror, action, and gruesome graphics to make a film for any age (over 18, that is).",

The build up of suspense and character developments are well balanced. This is actually one of the last sci-fi horror movies that has true cinematic class without having to dwell on block-buster one-liners or cliches (at least not apparently).The casting for the movie is excellent. The different personalities truly mimic a small society (in despair) with the 'rationals' battling the 'emotionals'.The special effects are very realistic. The use of classical effects (as opposed to computer animations) give the movie a very natural 'dirty' look which blend in very well with the surroundings.The only Thing that can be hard to grasp is the  plausibility of the mechanics of the Thing. I saw the movie back in 1985 for the first time. At this time the way the Thing worked was imaginable but lacked a frame-of-reference.Since this time the concept of nano-technology has become more and more common. So if you watch this movie nowadays and have previously read something about nano-technology then the concept of the Thing has true merits.And the state-of-mind of the Thing, with more or less the same determination whether it's in a state of individual blood-cells or in a state of one of it's victims is excellent.Better than the original.

The special effects hold up as some of the most disturbing that have ever been filmed. They aren't quite perfect, but given the subject matter you will have a tough time thinking of how they could have been done better in 1982 (or now, in today's impressive but hokey looking CGI). The sound of the Thing when it screams in pain is otherworldly and memorable. The movie gets you to think about how you would react in this situation, about the ramifications of such a creature existing, and about what actually happened since so many burning questions were left unanswered. It also hits the all-time height of paranoia, where your best friend could have been taken over by an alien with no regard for your or anyone else's life, and has the ability to kill you and take you over with a simple and easy touch. And the only way you will know whether the guy next to you is the thing is by harming it, and therefore, releasing it where it will destroy what it can in self defense. The only way to kill it is to burn it. You can't wound it because it can quickly repair itself by reforming itself. You can't freeze it. It survived 100,000 years of being frozen in the ice of Antarctica. You can't dismember it, since every cell is a being unto itself, capable of killing and imitating its victims.If you are into horror and sci-fi, this movie will impress you and keep you guessing, thinking, and hypothesizing. Whether you are squeamish or hard-stomached this one will stick in your memory. If you like happy endings, this will upset you.

A thawed out creature that can \"assimilate\" and turn into whatever it touches hacks its way through an all-male cast. This actually works well with lots of angry posturing when nobody knows who is who they say they are. Class acting from Kurt Russell (in another anti-hero role) supported by a great ensemble cast, who work well together, and opposite the very good special effects (by maestro Rob Bottin) that convey the oddness if the creature itself.

T., The Exorcist. Is it a better horror film than The Exorcist? Not even close. Simple minded young viewers , BEWARE.Review:\nNow The Thing in and of itself is a very well done film from John Carpenter. I quite enjoyed the opening and Kurt Russell's character as the aggressive leader against the unknown throughout, ( particularly enjoyed his whisky throwing moment when losing to the computer at chess).The Thing holds some of the best special effects you can witness from a film made prior to the advent of computer animation. Its not only dazzling, but so realistic and is what I believe makes this movie worth watching. It is solely in this that makes this film stand out.The story however, can only be so great, as the plot is narrowed on finding who and what is the Thing and asking: who to trust? Who is next? There are brief moments where worry for the characters well being lessens as The Thing tends to be easily killed early on.However, Its ability to constantly act as a parasite that never fully dies with ability to mask itself among the humans makes it a most difficult conundrum among the humans. The film has one of those 'discuss and debate' endings.Overall spectacular, in terms of alien movies i put it slightly inferior to 'Alien' but in the horror genre this is easily top 10, just not 1--and i mean that objectively.-J.",

The Thing is also an absolute bench mark for incredible creature effects by Rob Bottin. No CGI back in '82, which makes the Thing all the more impressive as it's withstood the test of time magnificently. The design and execution of the monster effects are hideous.mind boggling and darkly humorous. Carpenters typically creeping camera work (in beautiful anamorphic widescreen) sucks you in and tantalises you, as does Ennio Morricone's pulsing score.Kurt Russell is charismatic as ever and the rest of the cast do terrific work. Ironically when released in '82, The Thing tanked mightily, got critically crucified for gross out effects and it's gallows atmoshpere. But it's important to remember that this was the summer of E.T and audiences weren't in the mood for this horrific paranoia thriller. In 82 the Thing was seen as gratuitous. In reality 'The Thing' was way ahead of it's time.Now it can be admired for the terrific movie it is, showing the kind of suspense and creativity which seems to have deserted most big budget sci-fi and horror films these days.The Universal Collectors DVD is the only way to discover this woefully under-appreciated movie.

In short, it's everything a monster movie ought to be.Having grown up in the 50s and 60s and thoroughly enjoying the 1951 \"Thing From Another World\" and all the renowned monster pix of that time, I'll say now that this movie, for me, tops them all. I agree most heartily with many co-commentators that the atmosphere (right from the opening titles), special effects, characters and musical score are near matchless among sci fi-horror efforts. I've seen the movie easily over a dozen times, and to this very day I still tense up when anticipating certain scenes. Ennio Morricone's potent, steel-cold score, distributed through the picture with a master's perfection, compounds every gripping situation in the story-but then, what else should we expect from the man who gave us the famous \"Clint Eastwood Theme Song\" in \"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\" (yeah, it was him!)? Also, the film is not ruined by stupid \"politically corrected\" character stereotyping, such as is seen in \"Independence Day\"; you can actually relate to these poor, besieged stiffs, which is really essential in achieving the suspense needed in any horror movie. I refuse to inject any spoilers- I'll only say that this John Carpenter thriller about Antarctic scientists thrown into a tense, deadly battle against a vicious alien intruder deserves a seat alongside \"King Kong\" (1933), \"7th Voyage of Sinbad\", \"Alien\" and very few others as one of the greatest monster movies of all time...that's my opinion, for what it's worth. My suggestion for viewing \"The Thing\" is: at night, alone, preferably in the wintertime, with a large screen and multiple speakers if available. If you're a connoisseur of chick-flicks or \"E. T.\"-type movies, forget it.10/10 on this one, folks. God bless one and all.",

The movie is not without faults though, one of them being the lack of character development, however I understand carpenters intentions to keep us guessing about the characters.This is a genuinely effective horror and an intriguing science fiction movie, well worth a place in any movie lovers DVD collection.",

There's nowhere that does blank ones anymore so I got some movies on tape at an old Mom and Pop on Oliver Plunkett St. I of course picked some movies I like, Cube, The Thing, and Solaris(not really suitable to watch on VHS more a DVD title but the other two are fine.) I wasn't crazy about watching the Thing again for some reason and just put it on for something to watch over breakfast. But I'm glad I did! I suppose it was being a bit older and wiser that made me appreciate it more. When I was young I probably only concentrated on those gross-out bodily effects(which are still awesome although they have more a look of artistic sculpture to them now then real body parts.) But now I could appreciate every other aspect of the film, and it's all superb! The script is brilliant, the film grabs you from the very first scene, it's very unusual and arresting, a helicopter chasing a dog through the tundra, right away you're hooked, and it doesn't let up all the way to a brave and uncompromising ending. There is no fat in the script, everything serves the stories. If you want to know who the characters are just observe how they behave in the situation, there's no need to take time off from the plot to listen to MacReady talk about his time in Vietnam, we can see what kind of man he is very easily. Kurt Russel's performance, and every line he speaks, informs us. He is a hero simply because he does what he has to do, he kills a man(probably as an example) and he doesn't apologise. It's kill or be killed. He's ready to sacrifice himself to protect humankind but he doesn't make a song and dance about it, he has really one speech, it's only a few lines but inspires and says it all. The setting is wonderful, it's something we hadn't seen much of before and it explains how they're not able to get help. Not to mention the lovely juxtaposition of fire and ice. Also how great is it to see a group of capable, intelligent men put their heads together to meet the threat, instead of just being victims waiting to happen. Despite the large cast and the lack of individual attention, all stand out, due to the acting and writing skill. And those great names! If I had one problem it would be what I see as a plot hole, why didn't they bring Childs with them at the end when they went to test Blair. I understand they mightn't have wanted the thing to take over the camp but it seems like they would have all four stuck together. But a small point. All in all a great flick, one worthy of study in film class. Can't believe they didn't make a sequel!",

Trapped in Antarctica far from the coast, it schemes to escape the polar stations where it is trapped. If it does so, every animal on Earth, including every human, faces extinction in a matter of a few years. Once it gets to a bird, a seal, a whale or a penguin, its escape is assured.We never see the true form of The Thing, though in WHO GOES THERE it was described as having three hate-filled red eyes.The Thing is totally and horribly hostile, and intelligent as well, which makes it a terrifying opponent.This movie gets my thumbs up as one of the best horror films ever made.MtLoweMan",

It`s not a dog! It imitates a dog! It`s not real! Get away, idiots!\" after chasing a mysterious dog around in a chopper with a rifle, meeting Kurt Russell & friends on the camp. Norbert speaks Norwegian indeed...and well, contrary to what \"all of you\" might think. \"The Thing\" is after \"Alien\", my favourite movie ever. It has a remarkable way of totally enwrapping you into it`s own kind of atmosphere..the soundtrack, the lighting, the acting, the camera-shots, the sounds and the setting is so perfectly matched, and takes you on an unforgettable ride... I`m not a big fan of John Carpenter. Don`t like anything else he has made, I think, but \"The Thing\"...is GOOD! As I wrote earlier, my favourite film is \"Alien\", and \"The Thing\" resembles \"Alien\" in many ways.  A bunch of guys trapped together, trying to kill a monster, before it kills them.

Carpenter hit his mark and the pinnacle of the art with this movie. It has been compared to Alien several times. But, while Alien is a work of art...its a different kind of style in which the movie was filmed. The Thing begins with a downward spiral into terror and never lets its foot off the gas.

One day a husky comes running into their station, being followed by two Norwegians who are hell bent on killing it. There is a reason for it- The dog carries an alien lifeform which slowly infiltrates the base and starts killing everyone. This is the basic gist but the film is nothing like this- trust me. A paranoia-choked atmosphere is the primary reason why The Thing works as well as it does. The realization there could be an alien among them, and any one of them might not be human, is what launches The Thing into a spiral of escalating tension. The claustrophobia and tension is palpable from the start till the end credits. Anyone who loves sci-fi or horror must watch John Carpentar's The Thing.",

This leads to the researchers to become very paranoid when they figure out what the creature is all about as they are left wondering if one of them is the said creature.All the actors have amazing roles and all play their characters amazingly well and despite this film being 37 years old it still works!The way everything was shot was pleasing i loved the transitions from scene to scene and it was good to see how they made use of all the angles they had.The special effects were very good particularly the fire and explosions, of course the thing (alien) looked very... 80's... It was still horror inducing and the imagery was very disturbing the thought of human heads warping like that so unnaturally and i especially loved when Macready had everyone tied up to test the blood and when palmers was tested he became a horrific mess of flesh. It was a shock to find out palmer was the thing as i never even thought twice about him i was thinking it had to be garry or windows.It was good to see the characters fight against each other and see how some were beginning to lose their sanity over the paranoia of being stranded and knowing somewhere is a shape shifting alien that wants to eat you with his weird, slimy tentacles.The movie really didn't do anything wrong for me, the pacing was good and steady it didnt overstay it's welcome and it was tense without relying solely on jumpscares like a lot of movies today, it was honestly so refreshing to see a horror movie not end in one final not scary jumpscare before the credits roll.Despite the film not doing anything wrong and me being deeply engrossed in the story there was something missing from it, but i don't quite know what.The film is very worth watching and will keep you very entertained.",

Kurt Russell and the rest of the cast are coarse in a way that really suits the characters. These  are NOT the Hollywood pretties of \"Scream\" and \"I know what you did\" et. al. It's believable. Carpenter never wallows in violence for violence sake. It's just plain creepy. I'm glad to see this movie getting a following. They should make more films like this.

            "content": "*Warning contains plot and last scene spoilers*John Carpenter's The Thing still sticks in my mind as one of the most frightening and disturbing films I've ever seen. I first saw this on video as a teenager, although I do remember the original trailer on TV and thinking 'I wish I could watch adult films!'. -It scared the cr*p out of me!The story itself (from a 1930s sci-fi novella) is a fantastic idea alone. An alien creature that can assume the identity of any organism it 'comes into contact with' (this is a very mild expression next to the slime-fest we're exposed to in the film!). Not only that, but it can assume the form of any, part of, or all the things it has *previously* come into contact with.. And this Thing has been around!  We know this as it arrives via Flying-saucer-in-trouble some time before the dawn of mankind.  This is shown right before the titles giving this film one of the most memorable intros I've seen (to match the memorable ending - see below).Thus we are given arguably the best monster to ever appear on celluloid.\nThis film will be compared to 'Alien' a lot simply because the premise is similar (close-knit group of vulnerable people in claustrophobic prison-like environment, locked in with unknown man-killer) and they were released at a similar time.  BUT the *big* difference you have to recognise between the two monsters is that The Thing can look like anything and therefore you don't know who the monster is, and Alien was ultimately, a bloke-in-a-suit which has been done since the dawn of cinema!Now we have established why the monster is so good in concept, you have to go on to talk about Rob Bottin's gruesome realisation of the monster. These have to be amongst the most violent and disturbing creature effects ever made, along with possibly the original Evil Dead, An American Werewolf In London and, of course, Aliens.This guy was 20 when he started his work on The Thing.  Yes *20 years old*. Obviously he's read a lot of sci fi and comic books, and the excellent DVD will tell you he worked on The Howling before this movie, so knew his stuff where latex and goo was concerned.  This guy helped to create one of the most memorable movie scenes ever made (the infamous resuscitation scene).  His effects are a work of genius and even the filmmakers had doubts he could pull some of it off.  To my mind this stuff is more difficult and gives better results than the modern CG equivalent.  One of his creations was described as 'beautiful' and 'a work of art' by cast and crew. Those images will stick in your minds forever once you have seen this movie, I guarantee it!  Even after watching the DVD extras you have to marvel at what they pulled off and how it was accomplished.Rob worked so hard on this movie he was sent to hospital for nervous exhaustion after working 18 hrs a day, 7-days a week for months.  That's when the second-unit effects team were called in to do some of the kennel scene - led by Mr Terminator himself, Stan Winston.Next mention goes to Kurt Russel.  Personally this is my favourite Kurt film and to be honest, one of a very few genuinely good films he's been in. His understated Macready character is immensely watchable, and more importantly believable, as the alcoholic ex-Nam copter pilot who is forced into becoming the reluctant leader. Whenever I hear the name Kurt Russel now I always think of this bearded character standing in the snow with a flamethrower and a squashed mexican sombrero!Next we have the rest of the cast who do a great job of getting across the potential flashpoint mix of all-male characters. Yes there are no women in this movie and in my mind it's better for it.  So we have this initially confined group (who never seem to do any work!) tolerating but knowing very well each other's habits, becoming an intensely paranoid and potentially murderous bunch of frightened men looking to their leader to deal with this Thing. This changeover from friends to enemies happens over the course of one maybe two scenes and so becomes great cinema, without the monster.Next the sound and music.  For some reason Carpenter mentions Ennio Morricone's music once in the DVD extras, and does not mention the sound effects at all!  Russel actually asks him in the Director's Commentary how they got a certain sound and Carpenter laughs the question off with 'who knows'. Shame on you John Carpenter!  For the sound effects are some of the most disturbing I've heard in a movie, especially when the dogs are suffering, and also at the conclusion of the blood test scene.  The violence that comes across in this scene is carried 50% in the screaming of the men, the smashing furniture, the coughing of the broken flamethrower ('Windows, blast him!!') and the horrible gurgling of the Thing itself.I am still confused as to how much of the main musical score in the film is John Carpenter and how much is Mr Morricone.  It certainly sounds more Carpenter than Morricone, with that trademark simple sinister baseline and dread-inspiring chords.  Whoever it is the soundtrack is also extremely fitting and memorable, right from the first credits.Mention has to go also to the set designers and builders who create this incredibly realistic environment, perfect for the story, in snow-covered British Columbia.  They built it in summer when there was no snow so that by the time it came to filming it would look as real as possible.  Much of the internal shots were done in refrigerated sets in a very hot LA summer. I still wonder how much research was done into, er, research posts - especially with regard to the amount of firepower they store in the film! - racks of shotguns and 2 flamethrowers!!  Maybe those copters take a little more defrosting in the mornings than most ;)  Anyway we worry about the details after the film because the flamethrowers are such an integral part of the action and fire is the only method our victims know of killing this Thing.Last mention to Carpenter himself who does a great job of realising the vision of the original story, bringing some great performances out of the actors who didn't have a lot to work with, and giving us one of the most memorable endings to a movie: the last 2 survivors sit in the burning wreckage of the base, exchange a bottle of whisky, knowing they eventually will either freeze or be eaten by their colleague and Macready says 'lets just see what happens..' Fade to black. Fantastic stuff!So, 20 years on, a lot of sci-fi, monsters and computer graphics have passed us by but The Thing still lives on as a very disturbing but believable take on the alien takes you over nightmare. I had very real nightmares for years which were a cross between this version of The Thing and the 70s version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Perhaps Kurt Russel, Rob Bottin and John Carpenter's finest hours. Buy the Collector's DVD!!",

I mean, the alien in Alien was so crappily made, it seemed to float, and you never saw it actually walking, and the suit the guy wore was obviously too obstuse and mechanically mediocre, hence the alien moving along sluggishly at the speed of life. At least with the Thing, you had something original, which was something that could be just about anything. Whether it was a spider, a crab, a walking head with snail eyes growing out of it, the Thing was virtuous and worked things out in an incognito manner. Whereas Alien seemed terribly drab and bleak, the Thing was explosively original. Now I'm not too big of a fan of Rob Bottin's work, but this movie really showcased his ability to make some freaky stuff. I always saw Rob Bottin as the poor man's Rick Baker, but with this movie, he's right up there with him without a doubt, no lower.Other great aspects of this movie are the lighting and music. I loved the dark and light shades of blue that illuminated the set, especially the lights outside and color of the windows at nighttime. The music was cool too, but I really only liked the John Carpenter music, because a classical Ennio Morricone score just doesn't fit a Carpenter movie, considering he has been credited as scoring all of his films, with the exception of this, Starman, and Memoirs Of An Invisible Man. Only Carpenter's electronic realization of the score brings the oddity and isolation of the film.The Thing is a movie that any true horror fan will appreciate. If you see anything wrong with this movie, then I feel sorry for you, because you probably pertain to the crappy demented slasher movies, by the way which all spawned from Halloween, another Carpenter classic. I'm sorry, I just couldn't ask for anymore, and the several thousand people out there that see this underrated movie as a classic, I have to admire you all, I really do, you all have my gratitude and accompanying salute as people who truly know what a great cinematic piece of work is.",

            "content": "John Carpenter's \"remake\" of the 1951 \"The Thing From Another World\" is much closer to Campbell's original short story \"Who Goes There?\" and a world apart in its special effects (courtesy of the great Rob Botin).  Ennio Morricone's score adds to the dread atmosphere of the film.  Upon its release, this film was unfairly maligned by most critics, but it has certainly gained in stature over the years and now is rated one of the top Horror/Sci-Fi movies of all time. The film is anchored by Kurt Russell's strong performance as MacCready, a member of an isolated scientific research party in the Antarctic.  After a group of Scandinavians enter their base unexpectedly (trying to kill an extraordinary alien life-form posing as an Alaskan Husky) and are killed themselves in the process, the film becomes an elaborate guessing game in which no one knows who has been transformed into the mysterious and deviously inventive creature.  One by one, each member of the base meets a terrifying end until the surprising conclusion (which leaves viewers hanging). \"The Thing\" is Carpenter's best work, although \"The Fog\" could be rated a close second.  The performances by Russell, Keith David, Richard Dysart and the rest of the cast are all first-rate.  Russell, in particular, stands out.  \"The Thing\" was one of his first superior adult roles after a long career as a child actor in Hollywood and it boded well for his future career.  If you missed \"The Thing\" when it came out over twenty years ago, rent the video.  You won't be disappointed.  You will be in for one scary night, however.",

            "content": "John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the greatest Horror movies ever made. This little seen masterpiece is often credited as being a brilliant grotesque piece of cinema, and their not wrong there. A remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks original The Thing from another World is often said to be a more closer adaptation of the short story Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell, Jr. The plot for those who do not know is: a parasitic extraterrestrial life-form that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them. It infiltrates an Antarctic research station, taking the appearance of the researchers that it kills, and paranoia occurs within the group. Sounds pretty interesting doesn't it? The Thing is classified as a science fiction horror film, I would consider it to be Slasher film also. To tell you the truth, I couldn't find a single thing wrong with The Thing, its pretty much flawless film. Let me start off by saying that the cast is amazing, the acting is brilliant. Kurt Russell was born to play the role of our assumed hero R.J MacReady. Wilford Brimley and Keith Davids are also great as Dr Blair and Childs. The mixture of paranoia and tension between the characters is brilliant. A fun fact about The Thing is that its an all male cast, presumably John Carpenter wanted it to be more realistic. Let me just say that the special effects and creature effects by Rob Bottin are just simply outstanding, probably the best use of grotesque effects ever put into film, there just simply jaw dropping its hard to believe. Originally released in 1982 The Thing did poorly at the box office and was panned by critics, much because of the release of E.T, a movie that focused on a more friendly theme of Alien life form on earth. I could go on for ages on how The Thing is such a great movie, but I want to keep this review short so, If you haven't seen The Thing before then rent or buy it, because if your a horror fan, this deserves to be on everyone's DVD/blu ray shelf.",

Kurt Russel is amazing, and the supporting cast does their job quite well. The character of Blair comes close to stealing the show. There have been many critics out there who have complained that the characters are underdeveloped, but who cares? This isn't a movie about characters, this is a movie about characters being eaten! 2. The special effects. This movie came out in 1982, a time period where CGI could have been a plot line in a futuristic sci-fi novel. Sometimes I sit and wonder how John Carpenter could possibly have made those effects. They are Unbelievable. A scene where The Thing rips its way out of a character's stomach and then grows spider legs on its head was revolting, but really well made.3. The scare factor. This movie didn't scare me (I'm used to horror films) but I sure can see why somebody else would be scared. There are some jump scenes that completely come out of nowhere (the dog scene) and some truly creepy shots of the creature. But the freakiest thing about it is the paranoia. Nobody has any idea who has been infected by the Thing, and some characters (Blair especially) are willing to resort to violence in order to settle things.The Thing is an amazing alien movie, one of the best I've ever seen.

Even though the Carpenter film did start out a little slow with showing the actual monster in action, I felt that the leading up to it was brilliant and I loved every slow second of it. The only thing I liked about the new version was the fact that they showed more of Norwegian side of things. It to me was more of a pre-sequel version of John Carpenter's version. I have to honestly say that I didn't like any of the actors at all. In the other version, the actors were absolutely brilliant and it appeared more realistic because the actors appeared extremely scared throughout the entire movie which made me feel like I was on the edge of my seat all the time. I personally think the newest THING movie is for the newcomers not the old-timers like me. Any event, the new movie was still entertainment but thats it.

Segments of considerable suspense, but with the suspense disappointingly released far too easily at the end. Great, convincing special effects but wildly over-used. Fine actors, acting well, but little characterization in the script. Large budget spent on creating a highly believable antarctic environment, but then glaring lapses allowed. For example, one character says something like \"Are you crazy? Go out in these 35 knot winds?\", and in the next shot, the helicopter is flying through a beautiful clear sunny sky with not a cloud moving. They get out of the chopper and MacReady keeps his hat on easily and not a lock of his flowing mane moves. Or to take another example, as some characters go from one part of the station to another, they cling to a guide rope as if their life depended on it, but there is plenty of light to see by and only signs of a light breeze. Why not just walk calmly to their destination? Very puzzling.It felt like a fine effort, but by a director who had a little difficulty shaking off some of his low budget background.",

            "content": "THE THING is one of the finest horror films ever made, and a shining example of the greatness of 1980s horror. It would be my favorite horror film if not for David Cronenberg's masterpiece THE FLY, another remake from later in the decade. THE THING had a lot to live up to, being a remake of the 1951 classic THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. But in my opinion it far surpasses the original, still a great film in its own right, with legendary special effects and iconic performances.THE THING is a much more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella \"Who Goes There?\" than the 1951 classic, featuring the same characters and the alien's shape-shifting ability. The story begins with two Norwegians pursuing a dog across Antarctica in a helicopter. The chopper lands near U. S. research Outpost 31 and is accidentally destroyed by a grenade. The surviving Norwegian tries to kill the dog and is willing to attack the Americans to do so, prompting one of them to shoot him dead. The Americans take the dog in and send a team to the Norwegians' camp to find out what happened. They find the camp in ruins, with signs of a struggle. Furthermore, they find a huge block of ice there that looks like something burst out of it. Most baffling are the burned remains of what appear to be hideously deformed humans. Back at Outpost 31, Dr. Blair can't make heads or tails of the burned remains, finding they contain normal sets of human organs. One night, when the dog is brought to the kennel, it transforms into a hideous monster and attacks the other dogs. The men are able to kill it with a flamethrower, but an analysis of its carcass reveals something terrifying: the creature is able to perfectly imitate any organism, meaning any one of the men could have been imitated. Terror and paranoia grip the camp as the men struggle to learn who is human and who is the Thing before they are all replaced.THE THING is iconic for the terrifying titular alien, a shape-shifting horror that can perfectly imitate the life it engulfs. The creature is brought to life through Rob Bottin's gruesome and awesome special effects. The Thing is truly one of the most frightening monsters in all of cinema, due to both its abilities and the mind-blowing forms it takes. The special effects bring terrifying life to the monster, but they are used sparingly and only to deliver a payoff for the incredible tension built up by the film. Most of the film's runtime is spent with the characters wondering who could be the Thing and trying to find a way of exposing it. As such the film maintains a tense atmosphere, with the ever-present fear that the Thing could be waiting to strike. This is especially prevalent during one famous scene near the end of the film, which relies on tension before finally delivering the terrifying effects the film is known for. In short, THE THING is scary not just because of the amazing special effects, but because of how they are used to supplement the expertly crafted tension that fills the majority of the film.THE THING contains a memorable cast of characters, all played capably by their respective actors. Kurt Russell, Keith David, and Wilford Brimley are the only real big-name actors, but the rest of the cast are portrayed by experienced supporting actors, many of whom have popped up in other movies I've watched, who do more than a suitable job playing their roles. Kurt Russell heads the cast as the tough and capable R. J. MacReady. Russell is perfectly suited for the role, the hero of the story who finds himself a bit out of his depth when confronted by the shape-shifting alien. MacReady is a memorable character, a bit rough around the edges but easily the most rational and capable of the cast. Russell delivers one of the best performances of his career, playing a man who is tough but relatable. Keith David, one of my favorite underrated actors of all time, is Childs, the supporting protagonist. David brings an air of coolness to the character as only he can, but can emote pretty intensely when needed. Childs doesn't get nearly as much focus as MacReady, but David does a great job bringing him to life and making him memorable. David has the onscreen presence to share the screen with Russell and not be completely overshadowed, making his tense verbal confrontations with Russell's character all the more entertaining. Wilford Brimley is Dr. Blair, the smartest man of the group and the first one to really figure out what's going on. Brimley convincingly portrays an experienced doctor, and in one scene famously goes berserk after he discovers the alien's capabilities. Brimley is truly frightening in this scene, and genuinely seems like a man who has snapped. Overall, he adds a great deal of class to a supporting character and makes Blair a memorable part of the cast. The remaining characters all serve a purpose in the narrative and have their own unique characteristics that help them stand out.The film's minimalist score perfectly fits its atmosphere and builds tension where it is used. Legendary composer Ennio Morricone was hired to compose the original score, and while the work he composed for the film is great, much of it went unused in favor of compositions by director John Carpenter. Carpenter's work on the score more than does the job, and despite the film's Razzie nomination for the worst musical score of 1982, it boasts an excellent score.All of the elements of THE THING - its effects, atmosphere, characters, and score - come together to create a very memorable and exceptional horror film. The film is famous for its groundbreaking practical effects, but everything else about it is executed to perfection to make it more than just an effects showcase.One of the most interesting things about this movie is that it was a disaster upon release. It failed at the box office, was lambasted by critics, and considered a disappointment by filmgoers. People involved with the 1951 original even criticized the remake. This of course must have been disappointing for Carpenter, a huge fan of THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, who clearly put all of his heart and soul into the project. Thankfully, the film has been redeemed by time and is now rightfully recognized as the horror masterpiece it is. THE THING is a gem of the stellar 1980s decade of horror, and one of the rare remakes that surpasses the original. I highly recommend anyone interested in science-fiction or horror, and even those skeptical of the genre, watch both this and David Cronenberg's THE FLY. Both of these films cemented my love for the genre, and demonstrate that horror films can be some of the best things cinema has to offer.",

I had only ever seen this film once since last night, and that must have been when i was around 6 or 7, and i barely remember it at all, but what i did remember was how great of a film it was, so i asked for it, and did happen to receive it as an Xmas present the other day, and decided to whip it into my player at 2.30 in the morning, all the signs of a john carpenter film were there, the slow beat and already chilling atmosphere (Literally!) A film set out in the south pole and something there with them, how could you resist! But what i love about this film is how its done so different, they find out about this \"thing\" and decide to research it a little, they even at one point fly out to a certain area, i won't give away what for, but its not till one of the characters destroys the mechanics of the chopper they get stranded, but what i love about the entire sequence of destroying is how you second guess if he is doing it to stop the thing getting out or whether he is doing it to stop the people getting out, thats the charm of this brilliantly enclosed movie. The paranoia is high, even with the viewer, you question everybody's actions and motives, are they infected? Or just totally scared by this entire situation, a masterful scene is when Kurt Russells Mac-Ready is talking to the entire crew, saying how one of us is the thing, but is hiding, and doesn't want to show itself, and you see a stunning smooth shot of each man, and its surreal trying to pick out which one, as it could be any of them! And what supports this entire idea is the idea of being stuck in this Arctic station, i love nothing more than a film about a group of people stuck in a place with something outside trying to get in, but the charm of this is you have the same structure, but the thing is inside trying to get out, john carpenter directed the original assault on precinct 13, you can see he does like his enclosure movies, and i love most enclosure movies, from dusk till dawn, Assault, most Romero dead movie, etc, but this has to be the best one by far, i saw it for the second time last night and was truly captivated by the mood and atmosphere, its done brilliantly, and you want to talk about Special FX, forget all this modern CG crap, this is the stuff here, some of it is truly sick, i won't spoil it, but as the guy that did the effects at the young age of 22, he truly is a master and this is a sickening but lovable film, some great performances also, Kurt Russell really shines, its obvious this and escape from new york made his career, i just wish he would return to these sorts of roles instead of trying to be funny, he plays much darker characters superbly, i urge you all to sit down late on at night, alone when the night is quiet, and watch this, it truly is a stroke of genius, and one of those films that has made my top 5 best films ever list, and that says a lot because some of the amazing films I've seen, this does enclosure a lot better than most, it is also one of the few films that has furthered my ideology of just what kind of film maker i want to be, i love these sorts of films, playing with the audiences minds, letting you second guess instead of going for the cheap special effect, if i do make it in film, you better well damn believe i won't be doing anything generic, you could say for my age I'm very old fashioned and psychological, and films like these just make me want to make it more so i can possibly bring some of this back to the movie business, but overall The Thing has it all, and one of the most chilling atmospheres in a film, the lack of a musical score all adds, i am already a fan of the slow beat that remains, and watching this last night, has made another impact on what i hope to achieve in life",

They will inspire you. a head sprouts legs and walks away, which should be all you need to know to want to watch this film. This film is the best suspense and the best carpenter film. This film creates a world that you can feel and believe. It is leagues above the crap cg that studios are obsessed with. I mean CG is good for what it does, but for building suspense and creating realistic monsters, you need the innovative style that comes with the creation of creatures. You need substance and puppetry to truly do that. The cast is also great, Keith Davis, Kurt Russel are just a few of the great actors of this film. You will really get an understanding of nearly every character. A truly great film.",

The effects in The Thing are imho great for its time, but that's just it.. I'd like to see an updated version. Before Kurt gets too old.. :DGenerally i don't care much for remakes.. they tend to be.. sucky. This, however, would be an experiment i'd like to see made.I ALMOST feel the same way about Escape from N.Y, but having seen Escape from L.A, i know how technology can muck things up and i guess it would be impossible to catch that same feeling nowadays..what with the excellent music-score and Ernest Borgnine and whatnot in the 'original'.

            "content": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** When I was a young lad still not of age to get into an R-rated movie, I used to look longingly at the lobby posters on my way into a PG film (this was in the days before PG-13, folks) and dream of better things.  One such poster I lingered over was for John Carpenter's re-make of the 1951 black and white sci-fi flick The Thing.For anyone who remembers said poster (or has even seen the cover art on the videocassette box, for that matter), the picture is dominated by a looming figure whose face is obscured by a burst of crystallized light.  The figure is clad in a bulky snowsuit and gloves, reaching out towards the viewer. Friends, that poster scared the holy beejezus out of me.  Come to think of it, that may be the only poster that ever gave me such a bad case of the creeps.As for the film itself, talk about whetting your whistle: On a brisk Antarctica morning at National Science Foundation Outpost #31, the 12-man resident staff are surprised to see a sled dog being chased into their camp by a helicopter-borne pack of frostbitten, raving Norwegians, one of whom is plonking away at it with a high-powered rifle.  The majority of this hunting expedition manage to blow themselves up (two lessons learned: one, short-timed explosives and deep, powdery snow don't mix; two: I don't know what word that Norwegian used just before the big boom, but I'm pretty sure it was a good bit stronger than \"drat\") and the one remaining gets shot through the eye by the camp commander Garry.  Garry, we will find, is always ready to go for the head shot.After a brief caucus, helicopter pilot MacReady and Doc Copper tool on out to the Norwegian base to scout for survivors of the presumed outbreak of cabin fever.  What they find instead is a camp full of holes, ice and snow, with everyone dead by suicide or smoldering on a burn heap out back. While sifting through the scattered scientific knickknacks, they also happen across a large block of ice with a likewise large hole in it (watch for the precariously swinging icicle - I didn't know they did that).The Norwegian's video logs lead the Americans to an excavation site near their own camp. The unfortunate Europeans apparently had uncovered a huge space ship buried for some hundred thousand years (I'm going to be charitable and only refer to it here as a \"flying saucer\", despite its perfect dinner plate shape) with the...er, top hatch open.  A few dozen yards away is a rectangular hole in the ground more or less corresponding with the size of the block of ice at the shattered camp.Back at home base, the dog that narrowly escaped becoming a bullet caddie at the hands of the Norwegians is put into the kennel with the other huskies. Once the nosy humans have departed, though, the newcomer begins to noisily and juicily (there really isn't any other way to put it) shed its skin and manhandle its more terrestrial counterparts.  Hearing the howls coming from the kennel, MacReady sounds the alarm (smashing the glass facing with a can of Budweiser, how cool is that?).  He and Garry pump a few dozen rounds into the mutating visitor before Childs flash-fries it with a flame thrower.On a side note here, I wonder how many Antarctic research stations come with flamethowers.  It's not exactly like you can de-ice your windshield with them.  I think Alan Dean Forester's book touches on this point, but it's been so long since I've read it, I can't be sure.With a heavy assist from MaCReady (pretty good, considering his penchant for the sauce), our boys put two and two together.  The Norwegians had found an alien frozen in the ice, carted it back to their camp and thawed it out. The Thing (as it is unofficially dubbed) thaws out and wreaks the expected amount of havoc before beating a hasty retreat across the frozen wasteland. Enter our heroes.The Thing, Blair hypothesizes, is able to absorb other life forms and reshape its own body to assume the appearance of anything it has ingested. The imitation is perfect and undetectable, at least on the basis of sight alone.  As usual, animals are hip to the deception (the other dogs went wild when the newcomer was put into their kennel), but humans aren't so lucky.Here the paranoia begins to take root.  The Thing masquerading as the dog had been wandering around the camp for hours and could have infected any one of the team, perhaps more than one.  The men eye each other with increasing suspicion as the disappearances begin.  The race begins to find a way of determining who is still human and who is The Thing.Security in my hometown theater was uncommonly vigorous back in 1982, so I never got the chance to see The Thing on the big screen.  Instead, I was inducted via videotape in a basement den at three in the morning with four of my friends glued to the screen.  Our nerves has already been raked over the hot coals by a back-to-back viewing of Evil Dead 2 and A Nightmare on Elm Street, somewhere between four and fourteen Cokes on top of no food (we'd spent all our food money on videos like responsible young people). By the time The Thing was over and our host was loading up another Carpenter opus, Prince of Darkness, we were looking at each other much in the same way that Jack Torrance looked at Grady in the washroom of the Overlook in The Shining.The Thing is a masterwork of suspicion and paranoia.  The problem is wilier than suspecting someone of being a pod person.  Pod people, we have learned, don't show emotion, while The Thing can imitate emphatic speech, anger, hostility and all the other passionate emotions so as to be undetectable from a human being.  The only person you don't suspect is MacReady, and that's only because most of us wouldn't think Kurt Russell would let an alien get the drop on him.  But you never know...The almost choking atmosphere is enriched by the idea of the location (an almost completely cut-off compound in the literal middle of nowhere) and the location itself.  Carpenter includes many pointedly lingering shots of empty, poorly-lit hallways, giving an impression of both the vulnerability of the camp's inhabitants and the million or so hiding places available to the camp's invader.As usual, Carpenter wrote the music for the film.  This is a hit-or-miss practice for him, and here it is dead on the mark.  The thudding, simplistic soundtrack is a perfect match for the increasing sense of dread as the story unfolds.The acting is so solid as to be almost flawless.  No one character is focused on as far as his background, motives, etc. are concerned.  The only importance they have is what they contribute to the unfolding events. Carpenter realizes the necessity of this collectively light handling of such a relatively large starring cast (no one can be considered \"supporting\" here) and he manipulates each man's screen time like a professional puppeteer.The Thing itself is a masterpiece of special effects.  I have to pluralize that because it assumes several different shapes, and it's impossible to say which one is its natural form.  These shapes vary from something resembling The Aliens Deadly Spawn to The Incredible Melting Man to a kind of demonically mutated Alaskan snow crab (think about that last one when Blair cracks the leg off).  There's none of that hokey matting or baldly obvious CGI to be found here; rather, The Thing is all traditional foam latex, animatronics and gallons and gallons of trusty old stage blood.It's rare to find a film, especially a horror film, that can stand the test of time to resist appearing dated after a number of years.  Eighteen years later, the special effects in The Thing still blow me away.  I seem to recall that when it premiered, said effects were so gruesome and over-the-top that Time magazine ran a pictorial with some of the choicer scenes.  If Time acknowledges a horror flick within its hallowed pages,you know Carpenter must have struck a chord.Have no illusions, The Thing is a bloody film.  It's not as graphic as some I've seen, but it can still carry its weight in the gore department. Definitely not the film to watch while eating room temperature raspberry pudding.  Yet it is one of those movies that buffs refer to as a \"must see.\" It has so much going for it on so many levels that I can overlook the minor stumbling blocks such as Blair's seven-shot revolver, MacReady's incredible disappearing snow hat and a few other inconsequential trivialities.  A close scrutiny of this phenomenal blend of science fiction and outright visceral horror is an absolute necessity for anyone interested in either genre.In way of an afterword, the following are some faces you might remember having seen elsewhere: MacReady: This, in my opinion, has been Kurt Russell's finest role ever, and stomps hell out of both his turns as Snake Plissken in Carpenter's \"Escape From...\" movies. Norris: Charles Hallahan here sports a slightly bushier head of hair than in Dante's Peak. Copper:  Richard Dysart is no stranger to horror films, having starred in the John Frankenheimer flick Prophecy (not The Prophecy, just Prophecy!) as the eeeeeeeeevil paper mill foreman. It must be noted that in 1984 he also contributed his voice to the TV cartoon Challenge of the GoBots. Blair: Wilford Brimley (sans mustache), the guy from the Quaker Oatmeal commercial!  Don't think the hot cereal jokes weren't being hooted fast and furious.  Oh, yeah, and he was also in The Firm. Childs: Keith David has also given his voice to Spawn on the HBO animated series of the same name, although my favorite role of his was as Louis, the psycho garbage collection supervisor in Men at Work. Clark: Donald Moffat is another one of those actors along the lines of Lance Henrikson who has been in nearly everything, including It, The Believers and Nightmares.",

            "content": "For me, this is unquestionably the best science fiction / horror flick of all time, and I can explain why. First of all, the story is fantastic, based on \"Who goes there\" by John W. Campbell and adapted by Bill Lancaster. Although made into a movie earlier in 1951, the first shot at making the movie simplified the story and had a creature that was much different than the one envisioned by Campbell.The latest version captures the claustrophobia and paranoia of the story it is based on, and in my view, improves upon it. The cast is magnificent. You just don't get top notch actors like this working together with such incredible chemistry in your average monster pick. There is always the actor you wind up going \"why in the world is HE/SHE in this movie?\" about, always a weak link.Not so here, where everyone gives stellar performances, the characters act like real people would in their situation and the photography by Dean R. Cundey and direction by John Carpenter are amazing.And let's not forget the jaw-dropping special effects by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston, which hold up as good or better than just about any computer effects I've seen. Below is the criteria for which I judge all horror and sci-fi movies now, and this movie gets a 10 in every category. Can you think of another one that can?1.Story / Adaptation: True to original, excellently written. the script begins eerily and escalates to a fantastic climax.2.Direction: Truly creepy and claustrophobic with scary hand held work and disturbing camera angles and movements.3.Acting: EVERYONE is good here, not one even halfway lame performance. The actors act like real people would, and work really well together to create a believable atmosphere.4.Photography: Beautifully shot by Dean Cundey, the film makes you feel cold it's so representative--which brings me to...5.Location: External shots were done on location in British Colombia, lending a believable arctic quality to the feel of the film. Internal shots were done on a refrigerated set to mix seamlessly with the feel of the outdoor stuff.6.Music: Score is haunting, fitting, and used well. Also, it's done by veteran film guy Ennio Morricone...what else could you ask for? Bernard Hermann wasn't around!7. Special effects: Innovative to say the least, this Thing really LOOKS scary. You don't want anything that looks like that coming near you! Realistic blood, believable wounds, it's...well...great.8. Ending: I would mention the ending here, but they wouldn't print the review. Just as well, though, as it is terrific. Let's just say it's very \"Non-Disney\".Well, that's my list of why it wins as the best sci-fi horror flick of all time for me. I've seen lots and lots of 'em and it STILL tops the list even after years and years. I'll keep looking for a better one, but it seems to me they just don't put the kind of bank into making them like they did with this one anymore, and even if they did, the chances of getting all eight of the above as good or better is going to be quite a feat.X.",

Who's real?  Who's the thing?  These disturbing questions together are the driving force of the film. Couple this with Carpenter's superb direction (I defy you to find any film-maker better than Carpenter at the wide-screen composition), great acting (Kurt Russell is severely under-rated) and the most original special effects in any film I can think of (think Dali, then add more goop), and you have one of the best films of the 80s.

On that note, how many other people were as disappointed by Hostel as I was? After Cabin Fever which is basically the bomb as new horror movies go, Hostel was basically crap. The violence was generally castrated, the direction uninspired and the screenplay had none of the fun of Cabin Fever. Yes, back to Carpenter, I remember recommending this movie to a friend who is a big horror buff and loves his violence bloody and nasty. He wasn't too keen on seeing The THing simply because he doesn't like 80s horror and the DVD cover did look distinctly 80s and shoddy. After tying him down and screening the movie despite his resistance all he could say was 'Jeez, that was pretty good.'",

Carpenter modifies that which requires modification because of the passage of time (a helicopter, stored blood, computers), but retains the essential qualities and paranoia which were the keys in Campbell's story.  Russell's anti-hero, McReady, is a survivor as is his extraterrestial opponent.  Wilfred Brimley isconvincing as the biologist, Blair.  The supporting cast is, for the most part, believable as a motley collection of men in an isolated scientific outpost.But it is the subtlety of Carpenter's hand which makes the film. The clues are laid in front of the viewer, and the viewer invariably misses them (the noose in Blair's isolation cabin as Blair pleads to come back inside; the beautifully simple test McReady gives Childs at the end of the film which shows, unbeknown to Childs -- and 99% of the viewers -- that Childs is still a human).A clever, simple film which succeeds not on special effects, prurient interest or budget -- it succeeds because it cleverly plays on our basic doubts about those around us and our fear the people we trust are not acting in our best interests.

The feelings of isolation and pure terror that are created by John Carpenter, Rob Bottin, and the rest of the cast and crew are uncompromisingly brutal and harsh.  With almost no comic relief, no feminine characters, and unrelenting suspense, Carpenter doesn't allow himself to get bogged down in formulaic plot twists or romance.  He keeps the characters clear-cut and simple, defining them by their actions alone.  The \"Thing\" itself is a gory wonder, and apparently Bottin, the special effects supervisor, had to check himself into a hospital at the end of the shoot because he was reeling from exhaustion.  The suspense scenes (like at the beginning of the movie when the dog is being chased by the Norwegian helicopter, for no apparent reason) work extremely well.  This is by far Carpenter's best effort as a director (apologies to those who think differently). Carpenter never relents in his suspense, and that is what separates this from most other horror movies.",

Even though this has a 4.3 on Letterboxd, I didn't have a ton of hype going into because I've never heard anyone say anything about it. I think to fully appreciate it you'd would have either had to have someone hype this movie up to you whole life or have been born when it came out, and I'm not in either of those boats. It's still a dope movie and I'm sure that I'll watch it again one day. Enough with the plot though, we are here to talk about the weather aspects of this movie since this is a science class. This whole movie in a Norwegian research facility that is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by miles of ice and snow. There were a few snow storms throughout, but no major weather events happened. I would say that the validity of the weather in this movie is pretty legit. They didn't try to do anything to special so it was pretty easy to get it right. The weather did have a pretty big impact on the movie though. Because of the all of the harsh snow storms they couldn't make contact with any outsiders and they couldn't just leave their base for most of it. At one point the thing turns off all of the heat so that they'll freeze to death. Overall, it was a really good movie and a it had some valid weather in it.",

I feel that putting them in the antarctic limits there sense of freedom which in turn, doesn't leave many places to hide. Another thing i really loved in this film were the creatures. For one, there a totally different style of animal with no stable shape or size. Another key aspect is, they are never the same. No 2 creatures in the entire film were alike in the least, they were each unique in form.I also liked the special effects in the film. I feel they are still as powerful in this time as they were in 1982. I feel Kurt Russel did a great job as well, showing a rugged look as though he were untouchable, and yet he shows fear when confronted by a thing unlike himself but does not back down when faced with the task of eliminating the threat of total takeover of the campsite.I recommend this film for any horror film lover, whether your of the new generation or a classic horror fanatic.

Finally, after so much effort with another member group who called \"Childs\", played by Keith David, all the way to the end of the movie, they try and succeed to destroy all gestures of the virus, pointing to rely on logics instead of emotions, team work and cooperation in hard times to achieve success!The conclusion, Macready face that points to Jesus shape apparently, and the obvious and hidden helps of \"black\" Childs, explain a religious-ethical narrative, which shows in the last scene: both with opposite colored skins but beside each other, tired of problem solving but satisfied of success - as expected by such a director like John Carpenters, familiar in the cult classic style. \"Inattention\" to apparent faces but \"attention\" to instincts which can mislead to enemies from friends, is hinted by Carpenters - where the face is still the same but inside is totally ruined. Enemy recognition mechanisms to realize the ones who has been friends before and aren't anymore, based on the different ideas by group members which can be right or wrong, presents the challenging times to recognize the true way, experienced by everyone in his life. One of the amazing paradoxes, presented by Carpenters smoothly, is the untrustable atmosphere among research team members during the need to team work to detect infected individuals, which he has been able to solve it nicely meanwhile. Another interesting paradox is, although human is human and there would be some mistakes in \"try and error\" efforts, but Man is the warmest place to hide!That would be nice to end it with a poem of Rumi, Persian poet of 13th century, which states:The faces of the world are the sea foam\nSkip the foam, if you wish clarity!",

For example, there are no lights in the house, my best friend just got sawed in half, so therefore we will all split up and look around with a pack of matches! (They deserve whatever fate awaits them!!) But this movie, \"the Thing\", absolutely impressed me in that the characters actually reacted as most REAL people would faced with an unknown terror. For me, no matter how far fetched and absurd the plot, as long as the characters remain as human as possible, then I become totally absorbed and fully entertained by the movie. \"The Thing\", to me, was the first movie of the \"evil-alien\" genre that showed me real people reacting as best as they could to an unknown terror.

When faced with physical and emotional trauma most people, in general, desire some sort of closure to relieve the tensions of a traumatic event, but these unfortunate characters can only slog through a desperate situation that gets worse with each scene. John Carpenter's exploitation of this vuneralbility forces such a burden on the viewer that a full understanding of the story's dialogue and action can not be grasped in a single viewing. Some of us have to experience \"The Thing\" a number of times in order to come to terms with the multitude of questions one is left with in the wake of such intense emotional stress. Personally, I have seen this film many times over the years, never tiring from the repetition. I just finished watching the DVD Collector's Edition and still come away with the same nagging question. SPOILER FROM HERE OUT How has MacReady and Childs managed to avoid infection? In the director's commentary John Carpenter leaves the question unanswered while suggesting that each of the viewers must decide for themselves the true meaning of the final scene. My brother says, and I agree, that it's because of MacReady's abuse of alcohol(which is made very apparent), and a possible link to Child's suffering from a blood disease (ie, sickle-sell anemia) that keeps the thing from infecting the two of them. I know, fanciful speculation, and that's my point; there can be no closure for the viewer. Like the characters in the the story, one could lose sleep trying to wrestle with the pressure related to the paronoia and fear generated by not knowing the answers they seek. In the future I will continue to revisit this movie and allow it to do for me what good art should.",

Alien, and last but not least is #3.Jaws. There are a few others but they cannot come close to any one of those. John Carpenter's THE THING.....what a masterpiece. Every element of the flick, was planned, shot, acted, and directed so well. When a scene opened it was shot with intent, direction, and a flow that gave perspective on the entire event at Outpost 31. I know when that one guy fell...looked like he had heart attack. But what I saw was another infected guy that didn't know it. He was just feeling the pains of THE THING taking over parts of his body. And the doctor guy that was locked in the small place, he was obviously infected when he was doing the autopsy. So obvious.And as for the guy who was burned. It is obvious by the way the scene was filmed that after he saw the clothing of MacCready (which meant to him that MacCready had been taken over by the thing), the one he thought for sure he could trust, he committed Suicide.You have to love the scenery, the Isolation, the fact that all these guys have IS each other. Slowly as time goes by, and trust seems overwhelmingly more important, and less available, they are trapped in that desolate location...without contact with the outside world, as a horrific Alien creature with the ability to hide itself seemingly inside any one of them given the chance, makes your skin crawl a bit. Well not so much as INSIDE one of them but AS one of them I should say. ;)And the \"gore\" Scenes, were awesome. The head walking away!!! The Chest bursting open, the finger of Blair going into the other guys face at the end, oh and when Windows was almost eaten alive, but then you can see he is being infected and transformed into one, and later flame thrower-ed. heheheLord I am asking that Universal Studios would give John Carpenter the total rights to make his Sequel of THE THING.

            "content": "Gore films are not for the weak of heart, or those with weak stomachs. After all, the amount of blood shown in these types of films can reach a pretty disturbing level. Then again, that's the objective of the gore film, to disturb and disgust its audience while frightening them at the same time. John Carpenter's The Thing certainly doesn't fail those objectives. According to Wikipedia, The Thing, directed by John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape From New York, Vampires), is a gory remake of Howard Hawks-Christian Nyby's 1951 film The Thing From Another World. Interestingly, both films are based on the science fiction novella Who Goes There?, by John W. Campbell, Jr. The movie's plot is pretty easy to understand. Research scientists unearth an alien ship that crashed into Antarctica, unleashing a dangerous organism that imitates other life forms. After wreaking havoc with one research base, said unearthed organism takes the form of a dog and infiltrates an American research base. The Americans must survive the alien organism's attempt to take over them, which causes mistrust amongst the members. Whose body has been taken over? Which members can be trusted and which members cannot? Starring Kurt Russel (Escape From New York, Escape from L.A.) and Wilford Brimly, the film is full of suspense and will leave you guessing all the way until the end. Although Russel is the star of the film, it is the life-imitating organism that steals the show here. In other words, the special effects trump the acting. Rob Bottin is the special makeup effects creator and designer, who will go on to lend his talents to such films as Robocop and Fight Club (IMDB). The attention to detail is convincing, to say the least. Such detail in color and texture that was put into this film will easily induce nauseating disgust in those with weak stomachs. For instance, there is an autopsy scene that shows a dead person that was in the midst of being transformed. The twisted face and the blood-soaked, mangled body takes a cut from a scalpel, revealing squishy, wet organs. It all looks pretty convincing, which is what makes this particular scene horrifying. During another scene, the alien creature is seen transforming from a dog into a grotesque monster with tentacles and spidery legs. At one point we see the dog's face split open, revealing a slimy, tentacled tongue that proceeds to digest another dog. The victim dog's slimy body can be seen partially digested, with some of its bones sticking out. No CGI was employed here; therefore, it looks all the more real.Besides special effects, the lighting and the music also do their part to create suspense and terror. Overhanging lamps light up the inside base, covering some sections and rooms with shadows at night. The dim place looks cramped and depressing, which is fitting for such a film as this. Low and ominous in some scenes and sharp and piercing in others, the musical score is implemented wisely during the film. That being said, I would only recommend The Thing to those that enjoy the gore/horror genre; especially those that like to pay attention to special effects. As for people that are squeamish and sensitive, I would advice them to ignore this film altogether, as seeing it will only induce nauseating disgust.",

The main characters are secluded from other humans, which stops them from being able to escape so easily. The movies starts out slow, but once the monster is introduced, it is one fright after the other. It can be rather gross, because of its great special effects, but that is not what makes it scary.
