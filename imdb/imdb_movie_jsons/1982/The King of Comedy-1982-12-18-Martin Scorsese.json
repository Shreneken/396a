            "review_title": "\"Taxi Driver\" with comedy? It works!",
            "content": "\"Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime.\"As Travis Bickle's universally known line of dialogue from \"Taxi Driver\" has a deep meaning (\"Are you talkin' to me? Well I'm the only one here\"), Rupert Pupkin's closing speech of his first-ever standup comedy routine in \"The King of Comedy\" finalizes the entire meaning of the film, wrapping it up in one short sentence. Is it better to have one great day versus nothing? Do the ends justify the means? Two questions all of us ask ourselves at one point of time in our life.The comparisons to Travis Bickle seem stronger on paper than they do in the film. The most striking resemblance between the two stories is that both contain the central theme of a man snapping and doing something apparently crazy. Both films star Robert De Niro, and both are directed by Martin Scorsese, which makes for an interesting discussion of relation. Some may even say that it's a sequel in sorts.Rupert Pupkin (De Niro) is a lonely man whose daily life and routines consist around one man: Jerry Langston, a talk show host and comedian who is followed by a horde of rabid fans, including Masha (Sandra Bernhard), a fan to rival Pupkin, who admits that he has waited nine hours at a time outside Jerry's recording studio to catch a glimpse of him as he is shoved into limos by fancy bodyguards.Rupert is given a rare opportunity to speak to Jerry one day as he saves him from Masha, who assaulted Jerry with kisses and hugs. It is as they drive away together and Rupert talks to Jerry that he proposes his long-time dream, which is to appear on Jerry's show as an aspiring standup comic. Of course, he's had no experience. But Rupert swears he would be great on stage -- he's studied Jerry for years and knows timing.Langston gets these psychos all the time, but he doesn't realize just how strong a fan Rupert is until he shows up at his private home with suitcases and a girl claiming to have been invited. \"I made a mistake,\" Rupert says. \"So did Hitler,\" Jerry barks.Jerry Lewis plays Jerry Langston in a self-referential (and very unflattering) role. It's his finest to date. The guy is a scumbag who barely tolerates fans and is cruel. Lewis has lost his manic, energetic, annoying comedy rituals seen in films such as \"The Nutty Professor\" and has moved on to real acting that demands true skill. Gone are the squeaky voice and the crossed eyes. Here is perhaps the wretched soul who really exists behind Jerry Lewis, as we know him.All of us exaggerate, but Rupert does so to an extreme. After being shoved out of Jerry's limo the night of their confrontation with an invitation to call Jerry's secretary to schedule a meeting, Rupert shows up at Jerry's office claiming to have an appointment. \"Is Jerry expecting you?\" he is asked by a clerk. \"Yes, I don't think so,\" Rupert says.Jerry and his workers, who deny his taped comedy routine that we never hear until the end, shun Rupert. \"Oh, I see, this is what happens to people like you from all of this!\" Rupert yells at Jerry. \"No,\" he replies. \"I've always been like this.\"So Rupert breaks down and kidnaps Jerry with the help of Masha, demanding a spot on his TV show as a ransom payment. He commands that he will be referenced to as \"The King of Comedy\" (hence the title), and to further demonstrate the innocence of Rupert's character, when he shows up, he fails to see the gravity of the offence he has just committed.\nRupert is twisted, as you may have guessed by now, but not in a Travis Bickle kind of way. He doesn't see the bad in the world -- he's oblivious to it. \"You're so naive!\" Masha tells him. I wouldn't be surprised if he took it as a compliment.Rupert lives in complete isolation, kept locked up with his mother and living his life by what he says on TV. His dialogue and mannerisms are all clich\u00e9d -- he says the kind of stuff one would expect a poorly written film to feature. When he tries to impress a female bartender, and when he tries to make small talk with Jerry, he frightens both individuals (similar to Travis Bickle frightening Senator Palantine and the Secret Service Agent).As Rupert takes the stage at the end of the film, his entire dreams have been laid forth in front of him and he takes them by the throat. It is in that truly startling moment we've all been waiting for when we learn that Rupert is not only funny, but pretty darn talented. If the movie had used Rupert's life-long dreams as the butt end of a joke, if he had turned out to be an absolutely horrid comedian (which is what I honestly thought would happen), the film would have little effect. But as a filmgoer and critic, it ranks as one of the most surprising scenes I have ever laid eyes on.\n5/5 stars.John Ulmer",

            "content": "'The King Of Comedy' is easily Martin Scorsese's most underrated and misunderstood movie. Scorsese and Robert De Niro's previous collaboration was the brilliant boxing biopic 'Raging Bull', generally regarded by most people as a masterpiece. Then the two made 'The King Of Comedy'... What a brave move! You couldn't find a more different movie, but one just as impressive and extraordinary. This movie is disliked by many, deliberately ignored by others. It's a very uncomfortable film. It's a (very) black comedy and is genuinely funny in places, but much of it is embarrassing to watch. Not because it is inept, but because of the believability of De Niro's obnoxious and irritating \"loser\" and wanna be comic Rupert Pupkin. De Niro has made a lot of disappointing movies in the last few years but 'The King Of Comedy' reminds you of just how brilliant he can be. I can't think of many actors who would be brave enough to play this part! Jerry Lewis is a performer I have always disliked, but he is excellent in this movie, probably because he is playing someone very close to himself in real life. The rest of the supporting cast aren't the most obvious choices, led by confrontational comedienne Sandra Bernhard and the \"forgotten\" Charlie's Angel Shelley Hack. Plus there are Tony Randall and a couple of other celebrities playing themselves, and a blink and you'll miss it cameo by The Clash (!). I really admire Scorsese for taking such a risk with this movie, which is one of the most original and provocative ever released by a major Hollywood studio. Bravo! This is must see viewing for not only all Scorsese or De Niro fans, but anyone who appreciates unusual or difficult movies.",

            "content": "I don't know about anyone else, but that catchphrase courtesy of Rupert Pupkin is immortal. As for this movie, it is a black comedy masterpiece. As far as Martin Scorsese's movies go, I would personally put Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Taxi Driver over this, but The King of Comedy is in the top 5 of his movies. When it comes to the direction, The King of Comedy is to me one of Scorsese's most strongly directed movies and he also creates a more cruel and bewitching New York here.The King of Comedy scores highly visually too. New York does look beautiful, while the costumes, locations, sets and cinematography are all very impressive, and the whole film is beautifully edited. The script is sharp, witty, funny yet it also has moments when it is restrained and poignant. The story is always compelling as well, and the soundtrack is wonderful.As is the acting. Robert DeNiro gives a very powerful performance, it's probably not his most iconic role(Travis from Taxi Driver), but it is his most complex. Jerry Lewis is also magnificent as the chilly old pro chat-show king Jerry Langford. All in all, a fine film, with the direction, writing and acting especially to be admired. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Robert DeNiro wants to be \"The King of Comedy\" in this 1982 film directed by Martin Scorcese and also starring Jerry Lewis and Sandra Bernhard.DeNiro plays Rupert Popkin, an aspiring, delusional comic whose idol is Jerry Langford, a Johnny Carson/Jay Leno comedian and host of a late-night talk show. DeNiro saves Jerry from a stalker, Masha (Bernhard) and gets into the car with him and tries to get on Jerry's talk show. Jerry tells him to call the office, talk to his secretary, and he will hear his material. Of course, a) Rupert doesn't do that - he continually goes to the office and insists on speaking with Jerry; and b) Jerry didn't mean it. Rupert is so delusional that he actually goes to Jerry's weekend home for a house party with no invitation and no house party.Rupert gets sick of the brush-off from Jerry's assistant (Shelley Hack) and being removed by security, so he and Masha kidnap Jerry and take him to Masha's place. Rupert then holds Jerry hostage until he can do his material before Jerry's audience on national television.There are many hilarious things about this film, not the least of which is that Rupert practices \"The Secret\" or the metaphysical \"as if\" - he has life-size cutouts of Jerry and Liza Minnelli sitting on Jerry's cut out talk show set, with a real chair in the middle where Rupert can sit and chat. He has a cardboard audience that he performs before. And, as one is promised in these metaphysical arts, Rupert's dreams come true.The other thing I love is how nothing has changed in nearly thirty years - in fact, the celebrity cult has gotten worse. Today Rupert would have a reality show featuring himself, Masha, and his mother, not to mention the product endorsements and a chance to win the disco ball on Dancing with the Stars.DeNiro is brilliant as Rupert, a loser who still lives with his mother but courts the big time at any cost; Jerry Lewis is sheer perfection as the serious-minded Jerry, a quiet man who likes to play golf and turns on the comedy for the cameras; and Bernhard is hilarious as Jerry's stalker, who, as he's duct-taped to a chair, sits across from him in a slinky gown and rhapsodizes about making love to him.Having been in show business myself, I know only too well the frustration of getting seen by the right person and circumventing all the people in the front office. \"The King of Comedy\" speaks to the anger and frustration in everyone -- salesmen, performers, inventors, artists, reporters, anyone who is looking for access to the great and powerful. Rupert took it a little too far. But hey, he did what he had to do.",

Then there's the media, always ready to create another celebrity, even if he's an autograph hound and hack comic turned kidnapper who believes he's earned a shot in the spotlight.  Cynical and melancholy, at times hilarious, it bombed when first released, but has been surprising video treasure hunters ever since.",

I hate the fact that just because a celebrity gets married or has a child, that's front page news. I hate reality TV. I hate shows like \"Pop Idol\" (or \"American Idol\"), where normal people seem to think they are destined for A-list status. The fact that this film (The King of Comedy) is as old as I am, is either an all too worrying statement on society, or proves that it was way ahead of its time. Maybe that's why I love it so much.De Niro has always amazed me, but the fact that he seems to understand this character so well is a little overwhelming. Whether he is delivering cringeworthy gags to a cardboard audience, or embarrassing himself, obliviously, in front of Jerry Lewis, his consistency is amazing. His motives are understandable to anyone who's ever had a dream. Perhaps it's De Niro's early ambition as an actor, that fuelled this shamefully overlooked performance.Jerry Lewis is perfect as the disgruntled TV host. A man who lives a double-life of hilarious TV personality, with a bitter persona off-screen. You can certainly relate to this man's motivations, his love for his work, but his resistance to allow it run his personal life.The only character I can't totally emphasize with is Sandra Bernhard's Masha (her actions aren't justified as well as De Niro's Rupert). But maybe that just goes with my aforementioned hatred for celebrity culture. The scary thing is, I know that people like this exist, and I didn't for a second, question the feasibility of her performance.As usual, Scorsese shows brilliant control, despite this being one of his most modest works.\"The King of Comedy\" should be looked upon, now more than ever, as a very important film, that has a lot to say about the world we live in and the obsessions that we consume. 9/10",

            "content": "For some reason, I rarely count any movie in the past 30 years \"a classic\" but I think of this one as such, and that's a compliment. It has stayed with me since the first time I saw it almost 20 years ago.In fact, I've never forgotten the name, \"Rupert Pupkin,\" a strange name made famous by Robert De Niro as the leading actor in this unique drama/comedy/ crime film. De Niro was just outstanding, one of his best efforts in an illustrious career. Jerry Lewis and Sandra Bernhard also were really good here, in supporting roles. Comedians sometimes make great dramatic actors as Lewis has demonstrated in several films. I don't know, frankly, if Bernard has ever done anything remotely as good as this.Biographies of eccentric people usually are interesting and this one more than fits the bill. This movie was not popular with audiences and a number of critics but I think it was superbly done with laugh-out-loud lines as well as subtle humor and great acting. It is a wonderful character study of obsessed fans of celebrities, a pitiful condition that exists even more today.I am not particularly a fan of director Martin Scorcese. Almost all of his films are ultra profane, but not here. There has very little profanity, and none, ironically, by De Niro. The only negative I found was making a hero out of his character, who executes a kidnapping and is richly rewarded for his efforts. Puh-leeze!! I wish Hollywood would stop making heroes out of criminals.If you have a warped sense humor, however, which I do, you'll love this film. I think it is perhaps the best-ever from Scorcese and De Niro.",

De Niro travels unknown territory with the panache of a seasoned explorer. His Rupert Pupkin is a sub Jay Leno without an agent. His hunger is as shallow as his talent. The arrival to Jerry Lewis's house without an invitation trying to impress his girl is one of the most painful studies in modern humiliation ever put on film.

The first time I saw it in 1983, my dad took me to see it with my older cousin, who laughed hysterically throughout the film, then said afterwards how much he hated it. That was a memorable moment, but the film itself also made a very large impression on me.  Despite the title, it is anything but a comedy, save for some amusing moments that could pass for dark comedy.The story involves a 34 year old nerd (Robert DeNiro) who wants badly to be a standup comedian, but his only method of trying to attain this goal is by essentially stalking a popular talk show host played by Jerry Lewis.  The performances are amazing, of course DeNiro can never fail at playing someone offbeat and deranged.  Jerry Lewis is very good as the talk show host, and Sandra Bernhard is also well cast as a fellow stalker.  The film is a tough watch as its tense and uncomfortable throughout, yet entertaining and intruiging enough so it never crosses the line into unbearable, which I imagine must have been exactly what filmmaker Scorcese was going for. Overall, the film is a combination of disturbing, entertaining, and unforgettable.  What's more, it holds up extremely well seventeen years later, although it initially did not do well at the box office. Score: 9/10",

We watch him throughout the whole film, wondering, Is he really just that sure of himself, or is he dangerously deranged?  That question will take you through right to the end. Between Rupert, whose basement (in his mother's house) is decorated like a comedy club, and his oddball chum (S.Bernhard), there's considerable pathos.  Jerry Lewis gives a lot of insight into the real person behind his easygoing public persona.  Part of what makes this movie so compelling is Scorsese's decision to keep the musical score to a minimum.  Music could force the viewer to a conclusion that isn't entirely accurate.  Listening to Rupert's endless exchanges Jerry, and everyone who stands in his way -- as is, without musical coloring -- enhances the \"squirm factor.\"Anyone who has been in the uncomfortable position of coming to regret being nice to someone will relate to this movie.  It's a must-see, and despite being more than 20 years old now, it is not a bit dated./r",

            "content": "Autograph hunter and wannabe celebrity Rupert Pupkin idolises the network television chat show host Jerry Langford.  When an incident leads to a chance encounter with Langford, Rupert tells him he is an aspiring comedian, as much to get rid of him as anything else, Langford tells him to call his secretary.  The reality of the situation is lost on Rupert who sees himself as a close friend of Langford and, when his attempts to get his material onto the Langford show fails, leads him and his similarly delusional friend Masha to go to desperate measures.The hidden and oft forgotten jewel in the Scorsese crown.  With all this fuss over him not winning an Oscar for Gangs of New York, I decided to revisit this film \u0096 one of the many reasons he has the reputation he now has.  This film deserves to be up there with the best of his work but is strangely not.  The plot (and the film) may have struggled simply because it was about 15-20 years ahead of it's time.  Nowadays we have Popstars etc, all giving celebrity to people who have done nothing but sung (even badly!) on a talent show.  Even the boy band survivor himself, Rowan Keating said this week `kids want to be famous, they don't want to be GOOD at anything anymore.'  At this point King of Comedy has never been more appropriate such as it is a look at the darker side of the American dream of fame.The film uses someone who is clearly delusional and reasonably talentless to show how fame is the desire, rather than a bye product of being talented and how everyone wants to be around the famous etc.  It makes it's point in a much more concise way than I can without giving spoilers!  The wonder of the film that this point is made without it being detrimental to the story \u0096 my wife saw this and said `all turned out OK then' at the end \u0096 oblivious of the wider point, but still enjoyed it.  The point can even be seen in the background \u0096 watch the scene where Rupert takes Rita for dinner, a man overhears Rupert talking about the celebs he is tight with, then watch what happens.  The man starts imitating Rupert like so many of us do with celebs in one way or another, then rushes off to make a call.  Little touches like this just add to the class.Only a few years after Raging Bull glory, De Niro comes back with an equally impressive but incredibly different role.  His oily, creepy Pupkin is perfect and he paints him a clear sad loser but without ever making him pathetic or unlikable.  Lewis gives what his still his best performance in a straight role, a cold man who turns on the comedy for the public.  Only when he runs does the wacky Lewis of the 60's pop back into your mind (it's a very distinctive run!).  Making her movie debut, Bernhard is better than I expected.  I personally can't stand her but she does well and is suitably unhinged \u0096 only occasionally crossing the line between real and forced. Abbott may have been give a bump into the role by being De Niro's partner but she is very good in the role.  I really believed she was a beauty queen type who had settled into a bar job and lost her spark \u0096 she brought it our in her eyes the best.Scorsese's direction is great and is best seen in his portrayal of the fantasy conversations Rupert has (helped by the editing of Schoonmaker). His use of music is great \u0096 especially the final shot which builds with sound to the credits and Van Morrison's `Wonderful Remark'.  It is a shame that he didn't get as much credit for this as he deserved, probably because it was his first film after the widely praised Raging Bull.Overall the film is a great piece of work.  I can rewatch it for years to come.  When first I saw it in the eighties it made sense.  Watching it yesterday with the world full of celebs who are famous for being on a talent show or for being on Big Brother, it just seems even sharper and more appropriate than it did 20 years ago.  I doubt it will happen but 2003 seem a perfect time for a cinematic re-release to celebrate 20 years of Scorsese's most undervalued work.",

            "review_title": "Scorsese's Unsung Masterpiece",
            "content": "When critics and film fans alike talk about Martin Scorsese/Robert De Niro collaborations, such classics as 'Raging Bull', 'Mean Streets' and 'Taxi Driver' are more than likely to spring to mind. Their sheer exposure and acknowledgement as some of the best films of all time has led to one of Scorsese/De Niro's works almost going completely under the radar. But make no mistake about it; pound for pound, 'The King of Comedy' is as innovative and ingenious as all three of its predecessors. Out of the three, the film is probably most similar to 'Taxi Driver'. Another study of lunacy and the nature of sociopathy, De Niro plays aspiring comic Rupert Pupkin, a benevolent Travis Bickle if you will, that is if Bickle had \"stayed home watching TV with mom instead of going to 'Nam\" as Laura Bushell put it. Mainly misunderstood or ignored by the few who have seen it, its black comedy and cringe-worthy humour creates extremely uneasy viewing, largely due to Paul D. Zimmerman's hilarious and genuinely witty script, and even more so, De Niro's fantastic performance as main protagonist Rupert Pupkin.As far as believability and authenticity goes, De Niro's performance is as genuine and realistic as his Oscar winning role in 'Raging Bull'. The best indication of this is the scene in which Pupkin stages his own chat show in his basement, along with life-size cut outs of Liza Minnelli and his comic idol Jerry Langford, played by real comedian Jerry Lewis. It is a truly masterful scene, and De Niro truly shows his worth as a comedic actor, holding the screen single-handedly through-out not only this scene, but the entire film, with his great timing and cringe-inducing gags. It is a wonder as to why De Niro's recent ventures into comedy haven't been done with the same commitment and determination that you see when you watch him in this film. Some have contributed this to his current trait of starring in any script that falls on his doormat, in order to fund his self owned Tribeca Studios. Whatever the reason, De Niro hasn't since produced the comedic form that he did in this film in no less than eight tries, and is very unlikely to do so in the future. Albeit De Niro's dominant and thoroughly consistent performance in this film, his support cast certainly doesn't hinder his cause. Jerry Lewis plays a brilliant version of himself in Jerry Langford; a famous comic obsessed by his fame, ignorant to his fans. He and De Niro share great chemistry in their scenes together, most notably when Pupkin turns up at Langford's mansion uninvited and acts as if they were friends. This scene truly is one of the most squeamish and flinch-invoking ever committed to celluloid, without a single drop of blood or word of abusive language used.Sandra Bernhard also stars, playing Masha; a rival autograph collector of Pupkin, who is also obsessed with Langford. She too shares great chemistry with De Niro, the two of them competing with each other over who knows more about Langford, and who has shared more contact with him. She plays a brilliantly eccentric, almost psychotic stalker, and the scene in which she ties Langford up and forces him to have dinner with her is truly painful to watch. The film is occasionally interrupted by scenes which can be only described as dream sequences spawned from Pupkin's wild imagination. One sees Pupkin signing autographs whilst sitting at dinner with Langford, whilst the another sees him on Langford's chat show as a guest, marrying his school-time girlfriend (played by De Niro's real ex-wife Diahnne Abbott) on air with his ex-head teacher as the vicar. It all sounds very crazy, but such is the working mind of Pupkin. These dream sequences, as well as how his jokes deteriorate during his stand up, give us an idea of an apparent darker side to this film. Pupkin is obviously a disturbed mind, and when his stand-up routines start off as a joke but end with him unconsciously citing personal traumatic experiences, it quickly becomes evident that Pupkin had a troubled childhood. The dream sequences also suggest this, most notably when the ex-head teacher starts ranting about how well Pupkin has done and how he is sorry for any pain that he may have caused him during his school years. 'The King of Comedy' is without doubt Scorsese's most underrated film. The fact that it was the first film to follow arguably their greatest work in 'Raging Bull', the epic biog of boxer Jake La Motta which was applauded for its realism and hard-hitting authenticity, meant that an immediate move into black comedy was always going to come under some scrutiny. Maybe fans and critics thought that following the success of 'Raging Bull', more of the same could be expected. But in truth, by diverting away from such serious, realistic films, and widening his range of genre into comedy, Scorsese really has shown his worth as one of the world's leading directors.",

The film has some scenes that I felt were as if not maybe even more disturbing than those in the infamous Taxi Driver.  The movie has De Niro as a struggling comic named Rupert Pupkin (if you define struggling as a man who talks to cardboard pictures of Liza Minelli in his basement working on his talks on the show he plans to get on) who stalks a comic named Jerry Longford (Jerry Lewis is gives straight laughs here) to listen to his material so he can get on his show.  When Pupkin fails at his attempts, he goes for the desperate and kidnaps him.  Startling most of the way, but it is the ending which will feel audiences feel stunned from the righteously irony in the tie in.  One of the best Scorsese films (but of course, there are so many great ones, it's not fair to compare); he appears briefly as a director form the talk show.  By the way, considering how annoying Sandra Bernhard can get, she actually gave a good breakthrough here. A",

            "content": "Who doesn't have a little Rupert Pupkin in them? The poor guy who just aimed the bar astronomically high. 'The King of Comedy' is a brilliant black comedy by Martin Scorcesse. It is a masterful work containing one of DeNiro's most brilliant characters. It is brilliant in it's staging, it's writing, it's acting but really what makes this film so special and noteworthy is the execution of the material by Scorcesse.What 'The King of Comedy' wants to do is create a parody of the system. Rupert Pupkin wants to be a celebrity more than he wants to be a comedian. His life is a void of any fulfillment. He is a 34 year old man living in his Mother's basement. He is someone who has been ridiculed his whole life. He wants to be a celebrity. He wants the glow of the limelight because only then will he matter in his mind. This makes for the most brilliant twisted parody of the show business I've seen in film. Pupkin is obviously mentally ill and Scorcesse films scenes that occur only in Pupkin's mind. It's not enough for Pupkin to be noticed and appreciated, he has to outdo his hero. Pupkin gleefully imagines Jerry Lewis' character Jerry Langford tell him he is better than him and how he can't handle the business like Rupert can. With Pupkin as the star he weds his high school sweetheart live on Jerry's show. His High School principal who failed him comes to officiate the ceremony and beg for Rupert's forgiveness and thank him for the joy he's brought to everyone's lives. This scene is my favorite of the film. It sums up the spirit of the picture perfectly, the concept of celebrity means being a God of sorts.One interesting thing about the film is how we are asked to perceive Rupert. Frankly DeNiro is cast against type and it's one of his most brilliant performances. Rupert is a hopeless nerd with no connection to the outside world. Like in Scorcesses' epic Taxi Driver we identify with a lonely man capable of terrible things. I can't say that I liked Rupert as a person but I felt for him. Scorcesse wisely plays with the feelings of rejection. We have all been rejected in our lives. To be told you aren't good enough is a terrible feeling. Essentially what the film is about is someone who won't take that answer.A lot of credit has to be given to Jerry Lewis. He isn't a clown here. Lewis is asked to be the straight man to DeNiro's loon. I can't imagine the picture working better with someone else in the role...unless that person was Johnny Carson. Lewis is asked to be Carson and he is. He represents not Johnny but what Johnny represents. Jerry Langford's show is where America goes to laugh. He is the epitome of comedic greatness. Langford is the true \"king of comedy\" and Pupkin has to dethrone him. The title \"King\" is interesting. There are plenty of great comedians but The Tonight Show is where the \"King\" is crowned. Langford is the Tonight Show.My only real complaint about the film is that I think it could have gone darker. It's a minor complaint because I think the film is perfect the way it is and it hits the targets it set out for. It isn't really a complaint more than an interesting hypothetical. I kind of would be intrigued though to see Pupkin become homicidal. It also would have been interesting to see Sandra Bernhard's character actually rape Jerry Langford. I think an opportunity was missed particularly in Pupkin's debut. I think the material should have been sick and depraved or just plain lousy.A lot of debate surrounds the ending. Like Taxi Driver we wonder about the authenticity of the ending. Did Rupert's stunt cause him to become a celebrity? Or was it merely one last fantasy? I think both scenarios work and work well. If a real life Rupert Pupkin attempted this I think there would be a cult faction that would deem him a celebrity. You know killers and crazy folk do become household names through acts of irrational violence. It's ironic that all Rupert had to do was pull a gun on his hero. I love the fact that Rupert still \"considers Jerry to be his friend and mentor\" I don't say this often, but I want this film remade. I think we have only gotten worse in the nearly thirty years since this debuted. Our glamorization of celebrities have created countless more Rupert Pupkins. Scorcesse tapped a nerve and has shown us an ugly side of our pop culture. I couldn't happier to see the ugliness be brought out into the open.A Masterpiece.",

Such a compulsive nature is not that unusual, especially considering the fact that Pupkin is a New Yorker!! Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro's character) was very impervious to the fact that being a famous television personality requires a lot of patience and perseverance!! The expedition of being a celebrity dictates that you devote a good portion of your time to obligatory publicity ,and that you have a thorough comprehension of the industry's rigid guidelines with regard to standards and practices!! The aggregate requirements to stardom seem very mundane to Rupert Pupkin, Rupert Pupkin's idea of add water and stir success is something that professionals such as Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis' character) know is not possible!! In the pursuit of such a seemingly glamorous fate, Rupert Pupkin becomes the proverbial recipient of polite shove offs, a stilted Park Ave decorum, and a patronizing demeanor from hatchet men who dish out an underlying belittlement of a Brooklyn simpleton, Rupert Pupkin, and his desire to be a high profile comic!! All of this sparks a perennial state of agitation for Pupkin with his amateurish drive to be an overnight television icon!! The acting in this movie is terrific, Sandra Burnhard, Robert De Niro, and Jerry Lewis are all sensational in this film!! Martin Scorsese, who is one of the greatest directors in the history of movie making, does a remarkable job with this movie!! Surprisingly enough, I found this film to be my favorite Scorsese film out of all of them!! The itemizations and peculiar depictions of pejorative emotional reactions in this movie had a succinct and sorrowful element of reality to them!! Scorsese is very well known for so many excellent movies, and, he is best known for masterpieces such as \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Raging Bull\". Like most Scorsese films, \"King of Comedy\" illustrates aspects of human behavior that are generally misunderstood to the American public!! The intense grasp on such deliberate proclivities with all of the main characters in this film is phenomenal!! \"King of Comedy\" effectuates the intuitiveness of Mr Nobody (Robert De Niro) to be neurotic about getting national attention by way of being on a nighttime talk show!! Coercive disruption of this nature is generally not taken lightly in the real world, but, for innovative movie material, HOW ORIGINAL AND CREATIVE!! The grade this movie gets for originality with relation to the plot, would be an A++!!! New York City emanates such a compounded exuberance in this film, which becomes very conducive to the wry component of erratic behavior that this movie orchestrates!! All in all, \"King of Comedy\" emerges as a resounding winner in the cinema industry!! Word to the wise, please do not try this reckless stunt at home, if you did, the only famous place in New York you will wind up in is New York's world renowned mental health facility called Bellvue!!",

            "content": "THE KING OF COMEDY is Martin Scorsese's strangest film, something so different from his other work but still frighteningly good. Up until 1983, he had perfectly captured small-time hoods, New York insomnia, and raging boxers, amongst other topics. With this picture, he does a 180 and displays yet another side of New York paranoia in the form of celebrity-obsessed freaks. \"Rupert Pupkin\", as played by Robert De Niro, is a complete nut, a loose cannon not seen before in films this way. De Niro becomes \"Pupkin\" and creates a stunningly sad and demented character. His verbal thoughts and disillusionment are hilarious, and his screaming mother reminds us that they are illusions. \"Shut up Rupert\" yells his Mom when Rupert gets out of hand interviewing a cardboard Liza Minelli in his basement. The real performance to catch is Jerry Lewis as a Johnny Carson clone, an understated, realistic portrayal of a talk-show host who has had enough and seen it all.None of Scorsese's typical techniques are here, but no matter. Maybe a couple of quick zooms and some camera bulbs splashing, but nothing like the fluid movement seen in his other flicks. He presents a brutal portrait of a very real epidemic; the stalking of celebrities who have access to an audience the stalkers could never fathom. Just listen to Howard Stern and you will hear at least one \"Rupert Pupkin\" a day, trying to gain attention with crank calls or unannounced appearances. This is an art film that does not tell a story in straight narrative whatsoever. A loony De Niro and an even more sick Sandra Bernhard (in a truly memorable performance) make for quite a scene, especially after De Niro loses the last glint of sanity he has. They both want the fame but have no realistic idea of how to achieve it except to pursue Jerry Lewis' character night and day. Surprisingly, it actually works for one of them.For an absolutely funny and offbeat experience, see THE KING OF COMEDY. Scorsese is so good at recreating a mood or a period, usually composed of mobsters, tortured women, or whacked-out civilians. Here, he perfectly creates something fresh and real with two superstars (De Niro & Lewis) at the top of their game, with De Niro splurging and Lewis playing someone who may not be that far from who he really is. If you think about it, there is a Rupert Pupkin in us all, isn't there?",

What Network does with television news, The King Of Comedy does with the entertainment side of the television business.There are a lot of talented people in what we call show business out there doing comedy or drama for love of it. 99% will never get the big break that will make them big stars. Of those that do make it most won't have any kind of staying power. The King Of Comedy is about a man looking to do a bit more to get his chance at stardom.DeNiro creates one of his great characters in Ruppert Pupkin who knows that if he can land a spot on the evening Jerry Lankford show his future is secure. He does everything he can to bring himself to the kingmaker's attention and gets rebuffed at every turn. The man does not lack for nerve. Finally he and his nutty female sidekick Sandra Bernhard kidnap the TV talkshow host and the results are quite the commentary on the American cult of celebrity.Jerry Lankford is played by Jerry Lewis and Lewis creates a character who is a combination of himself and Johnny Carson. This may be Lewis's finest dramatic performance and he and DeNiro play beautifully off each other.Sandra Bernhard does get a few innings in, but The King Of Comedy is essentially a two person show with DeNiro and Lewis with DeNiro getting the lion's share of attention.

            "content": "In the cannon of Martin Scorsese films, this one stands apart. The film does feature Robert De Niro in the lead, is set in NYC, and includes many of Scorsese's regular behind the camera crew members, but in terms of visuals and drawing attention not the camera, \"The King of Comedy\" represents Scorsese at his most subdued. In this film, Robert De Niro creates one of his most fascinating characters with Rupert Pupkin, a obsessive fan of late night talkshow host Jerry Langford, a wickedly good Jerry Lewis. Pupkin stalks Langford after shows, sets up his own talkshow set in him parents' basement, and is self deluded enough to believe he has a real personal relationship with Langford. The story is a serviceable one for a comedy, but where Scorsese and the cast shine is in the darkness they bring to the comedy. Taken on it's own, the script is not necessarily that dark and in lesser hands might have been a light breezy comedy. De Niro makes Pupkin a likable character, even if it does appear that he must be mentally ill, and never plays him for broad or overt comedy, yet delivers what is at times a hilarious performance. Jerry Lewis gives what has to be the best performance of his career as Langford, a character that I'm certain allowed him to tap into his personal experience with obsessive fans, balancing his need to be kind to his public while also protecting his own privacy. It would be easy to write Langford off as the villain of the piece, the guy who continually shuns Puplkin and won't give him his big break, but Lewis brings a reality to the part where you feel bad for him and almost understand why he's a bit of a jerk when having to deal with crazed fans. The scene were Langford walks down a busy NYC street and politely greets fans, says canned witty retorts he's said a million times before, and in the end really just wants to get where he's going is pure cinematic magic. When the one woman at a phone booth begs him to speak to her nephew Morris and Langford politely says he's running late, how quickly she turns on him saying, \"You should only get cancer! I hope you get cancer!\" is hilarious and at the same time extremely sad for Langford, who has likely experienced this many times before. While Scorsese makes his visual presence not as pronounced in \"The King of Comedy,\" his sensibilities still pervade this a dark comic classic.",

            "content": "Andy Warhol once said that in the future everyone would be famous for fifteen minutes. Rupert Pupkin, however, is a man who has not yet achieved his fifteen minutes of fame, and is getting desperate. Rupert's great ambition is to be a stand-up comedian, and a chance meeting with his idol, comedian and chat-show host Jerry Langford, convinces him that he is in with a chance of realising his dream. He sends Langford a tape-recording of his act, hoping that he will be invited onto the show. When he realises that Langford has never listened to the tape in person, Rupert starts to pester him, first at his studio and then at his luxurious home, trying to persuade him to do so. All his efforts are met with a rebuff, and, in desperation, he, together with Masha, another obsessive fan, kidnaps Langford As the price for Langford's release, Rupert demands a slot on the show and to be introduced as \"the new king of comedy\".In the past, I have never really thought that Robert de Niro and comedy suit one another, so I was surprised by how good he is in \"The King of Comedy\". Rupert can be seen as a darkly humorous, satirical, take on Travis Bickle, the character he played in an earlier Scorsese film, \"Taxi Driver\". Both men are obsessive loners, living in a fantasy world. Bickle, however, always seems menacing, whereas Rupert is, for the most part, charming and polite. Even his surname, with its overtones of \"puppy\" and \"pumpkin\", suggests someone benign and unthreatening. His main fault is that he never knows when to take \"no\" for an answer. He is a Walter Mitty figure, not a brooding avenger of society's wrongs. He genuinely imagines that he is a brilliant comedian and that Jerry is a close personal friend. We never learn what his job is, but we know that lives with his elderly mother, whom we hear but never see. He is unmarried, but has a casual, on/off relationship with Rita, an attractive barmaid from his local bar, but she dumps him after the attempt to gate-crash Jerry's house.There is another very good performance from Jerry Lewis as Langford. Although on television he comes across as a charming personality, away from the cameras he is smug, cold and unfriendly, treating his fans with patronising condescension. When Rupert and Masha kidnap him we are left hoping that they will get away with it, not only because there is something very likable about Rupert but also because we sense that Jerry is getting his just deserts.There is a brilliant, surprise ending. After the show's producers have agreed to Rupert's demands and he has performed his act for the cameras, he is being led off to jail by the police. As a favour, they agree to take him to Rita's bar so he can watch the show on television. For the first time in the film, we get to see Rupert's act. Up to this point we have been lead to believe that Rupert will be exposed as a dreadful comedian and that his act will prove to be a disaster. Instead, his presentation is very slick and professional and his material very amusing, if sometimes in dubious taste. He ends with the line \"Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime\". We learn in a coda that after serving time in prison, Rupert goes on to become a comedian and media celebrity in his own right, bringing out a much-praised autobiography and selling the film rights for eleven million dollars.This ending can be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand, it can be seen as just one more Mittyesque delusion. (There are scenes earlier in the film which clearly reflect what is going on in Rupert's imagination rather than in the real world). On the other hand, it can be taken literally, as a satirical comment on the nature of fame and the media's obsession with celebrity. A criminal act turns Rupert from a na\u00efve, unworldly loser into a sudden winner, a man who is much more famous because of his crime than he would be if he had achieved success legitimately by working his way up via the comedy circuit. It is essentially the same point that Oliver Stone and Quentin Tarentino make in \"Natural Born Killers\"- that the media love all celebrities, even (or especially) those who have achieved their fame through crime. The difference is that Scorsese makes his point with a lot more lightness of touch.This film was not a great success at the box office, and was totally ignored at the Oscar ceremony (where the big winner was the horribly sentimental \"Terms of Endearment\"). Its lack of recognition by the Academy was perhaps not surprising, given that, at least prior to his recent win with \"The Departed\", Scorsese was never their favourite son and that satirical comedy, with occasional exceptions such as \"The Apartment\", has never been their favourite genre. Today, however, \"The King of Comedy\" can be seen as one of its director's major achievements, a bitingly satirical comment on the pretensions of the showbiz world and on the media's obsession with celebrity, an obsession which has grown ever greater over the intervening quarter of a century. 9/10",

            "content": "Though comparing Rupert Pupkin with Jake La Motta and Travis Bickle is not entirely inappropriate, The King of Comedy was a decisive change of pace for both De Niro and Scorsese. At this point De Niro was already a major star, having made his bones not only in Scorsese masterpieces like 'Mean Streets' and 'Taxi Driver' but also in Cimino's classic 'The Deer Hunter' and of course as the young Vito Corleone in 'The Godfather Part 2'. He already had at this point two Oscars under his belt, one for Best Supporting Actor ('The Godfather Part 2') and one for Best Leading Actor ('Raging Bull'), plus two more nominations. And it was at this point that Scorsese cast him in a bizarre and off-beat dark comedy alongside slapstick legend Jerry Lewis.The King of Comedy was, not entirely surprisingly, a flop, the biggest commercial fiasco Scorsese had since he first reached major recognition with 'Mean Streets'. Reviewing it today, it seems like 'The King of Comedy' was years ahead of its time, and underneath a couple of cheap laughs it has disturbing dark undertones that make it one of the most fascinating creations in Scorsese's career. Jerry Lewis plays not the goofy kind of character he's famous for, but is actually quite impressive playing straight man for Robert De Niro, who is nothing short of brilliant (as he always was when working with Scorsese). De Niro plays Rupert Pupkin, an aspiring but obnoxious stand-up comedian who is certain that talk-show superstar Jerry Langford (Lewis) is the one who will help him get to the top. When he realizes that no help is coming his way, Pupkin resorts to desperate measures and kidnaps Langford in order to force him to give him a spot on his show.The premise doesn't sound like much, but it's the construction of Pupkin's character that makes it a truly fascinating watch. Pupkin is ambitious, enthusiastic and eager to please; yet behind his cheerful smile and perfect manners a twisted brain works, as he creates for himself a fantasy world in which he and Langford are best buddies. In a way, Rupert is similar to Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver \u0096 like him, he's an almost na\u00efve idealist who resorts to violence to achieve his goals in face of the harsh world surrounding him. But Rupert, who seems at first like a harmless eccentric, becomes creepier and more disturbing \u0096 and at the same time, almost identifiable \u0096 as the film goes by, up to the controversial and disturbing finale. A nice addition is the character of Masha (stand-up comic Sandra Bernhard), Pupkin's eerie sidekick (though exactly how she knows him is unclear), who also has an imaginary relationship with Langford and helps Pupkin with his plans in order to get her own. Masha is in there mainly for laughs, but she also does well in shedding a different light on Pupkin's character, and the interplay between the two is wonderful; Pupkin thinks that Masha is imagining things and treats her with disregard \u0096 while Masha, of course, holds pretty much the same opinion about Pupkin. Bernhard finally grants one of the film's most poignant moments when she passionately sings Ray Charles's 'Come Rain Or Come Shine' to a tied and gagged Langford.The King of Comedy is a disturbing film to watch and is not to be taken at face value. It's well recommended, though, a masterpiece by Scorsese that somehow got lost in his huge pile of classics. It's maybe not as universal as Taxi Driver, but it's just as timeless and just as sensitive and inventive. Essential for fans of Scorsese and of De Niro.",

King of Comedy is one of those films that involves you to the extent that you feel embarrassed on behalf of Rupert Pupkin and the people he comes into contact with during his demented pursuit of Jerry Langford. In the latter role, Jerry Lewis, one of my least favourite comedians, is very convincing as the superficially pleasant talk-show host. Despite his weirdness, Pupkin is sympathetic to an extent and there is a nice twist whereby once he finally gets on air he turns out to be a passable comic rather than dying in front of the audience as expected. Twenty years ago the ending could have been read as ambiguous, was it real or just Rupert's fantasy? Now, when just about everyone has their five minutes of fame there is no doubt that someone like Pupkin could become a celebrity.",

For those who know a little about movies, there was little to touch De Niro in the 70's or the 80's in terms of the quality of his performances(scorcese has cast De Niro 8 times between 1973 and 1995)and this surely to god must be his crowning glory, ahead of Travis Bickle, Jake la motta, jimmy conway and even Leonard in Awakenings (a sumptuous performance). De Niro plays Rupert Pupkin, a total nobody who will do anything to be a somebody, no matter what it takes and whoever treads on him, he will,(in this case)get his slot on a TV show, even if it means resorting to kidnapping the host... De Niro gives such a towering performance as Pupkin its almost as if he becomes the natty little man, you almost forget hes acting, and as the movie develops we begin to understand what the movie is saying about the media today, and what a sad fickle game fame is. Whether you take it as satire or not its surely scorecese's scariest movie simply because the truth hits like a hammer blow. De Niro should have romped home with the Oscar for this,(but wasn't even nominated) but having won raging bull in 1980, they probably felt someone else deserved it. this ought to be in top 20 movies of all time. simply Brilliant. 10/10",

            "content": "\"The King of Comedy\" is a very odd film. This is not a complaint, but it is obviously a film that will appeal to some and put off others. I have known people who just thought the movie was embarrassing and unfunny--while others think it's a work of genius. The same type of reaction often occurs with unusual niche films like \"Being There\" and \"The Hudsucker Proxy\"--films you either love or hate. Well, apparently the public hated this Martin Scorsese film, as it lost a ton of money at the box office and he reportedly wished he'd never made it--yet I think it's truly a brilliant and innovative film and I nearly gave it a 10.The film is about a deluded and not particularly talented aspiring comedian, Rupert Pupkin (Robert Di Nero). Rupert is also very, very deluded and imagines he's a lot more talented than he is AND that success is just around the corner. In fact, his only 'experience' as a comedian is performing in front of giant cut-outs of celebrities in a set like \"The Tonight Show\" that he's constructed in his home! It's pretty embarrassing to watch him performing, but it's also a brilliant character study. It does get a lot worse, however, as Rupert begins to believe that he's famous--and just shows up at the show and later the home of the host of this show (Jerry Lewis). He's obviously a nut and Lewis is terrific in this serious role of the befuddled host. When these delusions do not pan out in a TV appearance, Rupert decides to take his next crazy step....which you'll need to see for yourself.The film is terrific and very inventive. The direction and most of the acting is amazingly good and I loved Di Nero in this very different sort of role. However, I have no idea why Sandra Bernhardt was chosen to appear in the film and she was pretty tough to take and didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the movie. With a different actress and a slightly different role, it would have been perfection. As it is, it's darn near perfection and a brilliantly creative film...that few seemed to like when it first debuted. Now, years later, it is a bit of a cult film...though I still think it's a movie you'll either love or hate.",

            "content": "Watching a film like The King of Comedy would seem almost anachronistic to a modern viewer. Before social media turned talentless people into millionaires, people actually had to go up a ladder and earn their stripes so to speak. Fame was only for the most ruthless, connected or in a few cases...talented. There were very few platforms during this low technological era to truly make it into the entertainment industry, and for those that grew up during this time, the dread and tension one experiences watching this film is palpable.We all knew a Rupert Pupkin in our lives, someone that was a \"could-a-been\" whether it be in sports or entertainment. The only difference is, most of the people with this mindset had some clarity about their failings, which could take years to realize but ultimately reality settles in. This is what made Pupkin so horrifying. The delusion was so real and so within his grasp, we couldn't help but wonder what parts of the movie were In his mind or actually happening. Much like Brazil, another reality slanting film Robert De Niro starred in a couple years later, are we watching the false reality of a disturbed individual or is this happening?Which ever side you take in this argument will have plenty of logical details which will aid in your summation. The 80s were a growing time of news outlets and sensationalism, and so a story like this could have been plausible. You can also say it's a critique of Reagan's America, one where mentally disturbed people lost their grip on reality due to the closure of psychiatric hospitals and the expense of drugs. Both arguments can work, and both arguments could be right. What makes the summation even more difficult is the fact Pupkin's comedy monologue is actually pretty funny. Even these few minutes make you wonder if Pupkin had a horrible home life which led him to create these false narratives as a coping mechanism. Who knows.Nearly 40 years later, society has developed a deeper lens to stare into the soul of people like Pupkin, and it's easier to empathize or recognize the delusion as dangerous or a result of mental illness. Do people who troll online or instigate criticism on their podcasts do this because they think it will guide them to being one of their heroes who make seven figures, or do they do it because they truly think what they are doing is right? It's a difficult conversation to say the least. The cynic in me feels people instigate, harass and troll simply because it might be easier than learning an actual helpful skill that benefits society.Whatever you think, it can be interpreted both ways when putting this movie into context. Where does Rupert's journey begin and end. Is he humming to himself in a jail cell during the final scene, considering he is wearing a mono-colored suit when throughout the movie his clothes had wild and vivid patterns and dreaming this all up? It's for us to decide.",

It's a subject uncomfortably familiar to Scorsese, given the obsession Ronald Reagan's attempted assassin, John Hinckley, had with Jodie Foster, largely because of her performance in \"Taxi Driver.\" The tone and storyline to this film were incredibly tricky to pull off. If those involved had carried the humour and slapstick elements of it too far, it might have come across as glib; but if they played up the disturbing elements too much, it would have ceased to be funny and would have seemed like a warm-over of \"Taxi Driver.\" As it is, I don't see how the film could be better. De Niro makes his character warm and endearing enough to keep you sympathetic with him, while making him menacing enough to take seriously, while Lewis for once shows himself adept at playing the straight guy, and gives a spectacular performance as a hang-dog celebrity whose quiet and sober personal demeanor is at odds with that of his on-screen personality.And praise also must go to Sandra Bernhard, who gives a delightfully wacky take on another aspiring star and accomplice to Rupert, whose plans go awry in hilarious and unpredictable ways. Bernhard is a ball of energy here, and I've never liked her better.This is truly a must-see film.Grade: A+",

He is, without question the best actor to have graced our screens, and though I love the so many other varied genius performances he has become more famous for, I think this to be his finest work.The character he plays draws inevitable comparisons with Travis in 'Taxi Driver', as in both roles he plays individuals so detached from reality, they feel the need to commit criminal acts in order to expel the frustrations they have at their lowly position in society, and how little they can do about it. Travis's frustrations are centered more on the decaying state of society and the streets he drives around, whereas Rupert is simply trying to achieve his life-long ambition of fame and fortune that celebrities on television enjoy. But Rupert is such a clever creation by de Niro. He is detached in a very different way to Travis. Whilst Travis is only too aware of what is going on in society, Rupert has his own little view of how the world works. He fantasises being a celebrated comic to such a degree he convinces himself of events that haven't actually happened (most notably when he starts believing his own lie, that he's been invited to Jerry Lewis' summerhouse, is actually true!) It is a magnificently subtle take on the insane and is the De Niro performance I enjoyed the most.I felt compelled to offer my opinion on De Niro's 10 best roles, so here they are: 10-The Untouchables, 9-Heat, 8-The Godfather Part 2, 7-Midnight Run, 6-Awakenings, 5-Taxi Driver, 4-The Deer Hunter, 3-Raging Bull, 2-Mean Streets, 1-The King Of Comedy",

Both can be likened to Lee Harvey Oswald-men leading lives of quiet desperation, wanting to do something-ANYTHING-to have SOME impact on the world.Pupkin is further removed from reality than Bickle (actually Bickle's attitudes about his environment aren't entirely unreasonable) and it's unlikely he could ever be \"normal\", no matter how much therapy he had. He's lost in his own little world, a world devoid of any real substance.  To him, Heaven would be a place where he would exist solely on TV.  Real life is too messy.\"The King of Comedy\" is the best satire I've seen about the vapidness of society's values and the public's obsession with celebrity.  It has its share of funny moments but the overall effect is deadening.  Even though things went about as well as Pupkin could have expected in the end, what has he gained?

Who else has created so many memorable characters that have remained in the minds and hearts of filmgoers long after the films have been released? Not very many. There's Travis Bickle, young Vito Corleone, Jake LaMotta, Jack Walsh, and then there's Rupert Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin? Who is that? Perhaps the most endearing and strange character that DeNiro has ever played in his legendary career. More endearing than any of the lightweight comic characters DeNiro has played late in his career? Yes. Stranger than Travis Bickle? You betcha. The late, great film critic Gene Siskel was asked one time on a talk show that he and his fellow critic Roger Ebert were on (and I'm paraphrasing) 'What character do you remember most from all the films you've seen?' and Mr. Siskel replied 'Rupert Pupkin'. As flawed as this film has been accused of being, after it's over, you'll never forget about Rupert Pupkin. Only Robert DeNiro could take such a loser of a character and pathetic human being like Rupert Pupkin and make him damn near 100% likable. That's the brilliance of Mr. DeNiro.The King of Comedy is yet another collaboration between DeNiro and director Martin Scorcese, perhaps the greatest actor-director duo in all of film history. I don't know what these 2 gentlemen bring out in each other, but they ought to work together ALL THE TIME. Personally, I don't believe the film to be flawed, but that's just me. The film is a very dark comedy about struggling comedian Pupkin who can't catch a break in 1983 New York City. Rupert desperately wants to be a guest comic on famed talk show host Jerry Langford (played by comic legend Jerry Lewis in what has got to be the most serious, least self-deprecating performance of his career). Lewis plays it totally straight, while DeNiro is the offbeat, 'funny' character.Pupkin attempts various times, mostly unsuccessfully, to meet with Jerry, and even when his schemes work, they usually end up with bad results. Rupert uses at various times 2 women, Rita (played by Diahnne Abbott, who had a brief scene in Taxi Driver with DeNiro) and Marsha (played by Sandra Bernhard in a totally wacky, original performance). Rita is an old high school 'friend' of Rupert's who he tries to impress by saying he's going to be on Jerry's show as a guest comic. Marsha is a spoiled, rich girl who appears somewhat mental herself. DeNiro and Bernhard have some real funny moments together walking the streets of New York going off on each other about who Jerry likes more. In the climax, Rupert enlists Marsha's help to kidnap Jerry and force him to put Rupert on his show. This is one of those moments that end badly.And with all of this psychosis going on, you still empathize with Rupert. Rupert lives with his mother's (who is heard, but never seen) home in her basement. There's a funny, sad, disturbing scene in his basement where Rupert is literally playing the role of Jerry's guest on his show next to a cardboard cutout of Jerry and acting like he and Jerry are having a real conversation. There's also another scene where Rupert is waiting outside Jerry's office for hours and hours to see him and he keeps getting put off by Jerry's secretary (played by none other than model Shelley Hack from Charlie's Angel fame); this scene is very disturbing as well, but strangely realistic. And an awkward scene where Rupert takes Rita to Jerry's mansion to 'visit' him as his houseguests for the weekend; this scene always makes me cringe b/c of how badly you see that Rupert wants Jerry to like and accept him and Jerry will have none of that and almost calls the cops on him. The ending of the film is, like the entire film itself, dark, comic, sad, and strange.I guess that I'm just such a huge fan of DeNiro and admirer of his work that I give this film, although not considered the best of he and Scorcese's collaborations, such high marks. While maybe not the most complete or best, it is certainly perhaps the most fascinating and interesting thing that they did together. The greatness of the film lies in its central character: you just latch onto Rupert Pupkin and let him take you along for the ride.",

He is the best. Streets ahead of anyone else in the game and universally adored by one and all, unable to walk the street without constantly being delayed by admirers and autograph hounds, and after taping his show he must pass through a sweaty feverish throng of well-wishers and overzealous fans.It is during this running of the gauntlet one evening that Langford meets Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) \u2013 whether he wants to or not. Pupkin squirms his way into Langford's limo after a stroke of luck and against his better judgment \u2013 or perhaps to avoid further argument Jerry allows Pupkin to ride along for the short journey to his hotel.It is during the trip that Pupkin informs Jerry that he of course admires him greatly, but that further to this he sees himself as someone that could suit the show as a guest. It turns out that Pupkin is immensely confident of his stand up abilities, so Jerry ultimately decides to agree to listen to his stuff and will consider him for the show as long as he can provide a tape of his work.All good so far right. But as we learn quite rapidly Rupert Pupkin is not some talented no-name trying to fast track his way to the top, but a largely talent free never-will-be with incredible delusions of grandeur, delusions that manifest in the basement of the home he shares with his Mother where he runs his own variety show \u2013 complete with laugh track \u2013 and interviews the same cardboard cut-outs of real celebrities every night, while Mum continually yells at him to keep the noise down.The following days see Rupert continuing to role play while he waits for news from Jerry and the production company staff. When this is not forthcoming Rupert visits the company offices. Frequently. Of course Jerry doesn't come out to meet with him personally, so to Rupert's surprise he is left dealing with what he views as 'underlings', he decides that this breakdown in communication will be best solved by going direct to Jerry himself.While Rupert's view of his own abilities and reality are poles apart, he still manages to talk a good game, so much so that he convinces a dubious barmaid to accompany him to a 'meeting' with Jerry one evening. A meeting that does not go well.Far from being daunted and calling it a day, Rupert and a similarly 'intense' fan of Jerry's named Masha (Sandra Bernhard) \u2013 all 6 foot two with a face of 'ewwww' \u2013 concoct a more extreme plot, one that will guarantee they get attention\u0085 Up to this point I was less than overwhelmed by events as they unfolded. Rupert's bizarre self confidence even in the face of an obvious lack of true capability was more embarrassing than fascinating, which is why the awful acts on American Idol are the ones they replay 37 times per season. The train wrecks are always infinitely more memorable than the actual talents.But does that provide a lick of entertainment? Perhaps in another film but not here. Not The King of Comedy. I found the finale contrived and extremely unlikely. After all can you imagine how hard it would be to meet Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods, let alone have enough time to take things further\u0085 I mean unless you were a cocktail waitress or a cheap floosie that is. Bad example.While I yield the point that The King of Comedy is indeed a disturbing tale of what some ordinary citizens will do to share a moment in the spotlight, I can't say it is a great one. In fact I don't care how you spin it, who stars in it and who made it. The King of Comedy is the epitome of 'just a movie'.Final Rating \u2013 6 / 10. Now that I have the Scorcese-freaks riled up, might I add that I found De Niro's performance a little TOO over the top?",

De Niro is terrific in what has to be the most pathetic character he's ever played. Pupkin is the non-menacing version of the frustrated semi-lunatic from \"Taxi Driver\". While the latter remains mysteriously silent and therefore uncomfortably unpredictable, Pupkin appears basically harmless and can't stop talking. Pupkin's inner and outer world, the latter which includes the even more insane (or far more insane) Bernhard, is a lot of fun from the first scene onwards. The pathos is always there from the very start, and it's hard not to almost get embarrassed watching the totally prideless Pupkin make an idiot of himself over and over in front of a celeb like Lewis, then later in front of Lewis's staff (and even when alone at home in his fantasy world). Clever, how much we learn about Pupkin in the opening scene alone. His day-dreams and fantasizing are funny and at the same time easy to identify with, even if Pupkin's fantasies appear to be very over-the-top naive. Lewis and Bernhard are also very good. Lewis has a couple of funny lines himself, the best being his smart-ass \"self-defense\" replies when confronted with the uninvited De Niro at the former's villa. In particular Lewis telling De Niro that he didn't become (an a**hole) after his success but rather that he was \"always like that\" is hilarious. But De Niro walks away with the movie. I was a bit surprised by the ending. I didn't expect Pupkin to gain much from the whole ordeal, but this IS a comedy, after all - if a satiric one - and even Scorsese can feel obliged to end a comedy with a \"happy\" ending. Plus, with this ending he gets to make a very ironic point.",

            "content": "The King of Comedy is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a huge satire on fame, comedy and trying to make it big in show business, it's quite funny but not necessarily in a way that you will be laughing out loud, I remained quiet throughout but there was always a humorous atmosphere, it speaks a lot of truth, I feel, to just how far some people would go in order to get the fame they believe they deserve. The only thing about this movie that sort of bothered me were Rupert's fantasies, these scenes were never really clear, I felt they needed more purpose, given us more insight on him, what his motivations are, how he is feeling, these parts could have added a whole new layer to the character, but I don't feel they succeeded in that. The cast is outstanding, no one holds back, Jerry Lewis and Sandra Bernhard are great and the movie wouldn't be the same without them, but the majority of credit must go to Robert de Niro, who I always knew was a good actor but never knew he could play a character like this, it's far from the Godfather of Raging Bull, it's a very troubled comedian, who starts off very likable, and as the film continues he becomes more of an anti-hero, what I loved about Rupert Pupkin is that he never saw bad in what he was doing, he came across as a reasonable and sensible person when he speaks, but it was clear that he would stop at nothing for a bit of recognition. Funny, discomforting and an pessimistic atmosphere throughout, I would recommend the King of Comedy to anyone looking for a drama or dark comedy. A wannabe comedian develops a desperate plan for stardom he believes he truly deserves. Best Performance: Robert de Niro",

Unlike thousands of other aspiring funny-men, however, Rupert is obsessed with the idea of appearing on Jerry Langford's Tonight Show and will stop at nothing until he achieves his goal. Robert de Niro turns in one of his best performances as the driven Mr. Pupkin in Martin Scorcese's The King of Comedy, a film that did not achieve box office success but is now considered by many to be a classic. Not being a fan of de Niro, Scorcese, or Jerry Lewis who plays the Johnny Carson-like talk show host with the utmost seriousness, I was not expecting much. What I found was one of the most daring, innovative, unsettling, and thought provoking films I've seen in a long time.Rupert is a 34-year old who lives with his mother and dreams of stardom, yet has never taken the preliminary steps necessary to develop his talent as a stand-up comic. Like many in today's mediaocracy, he wants instant gratification and is willing to take extreme measures to force the world to recognize his talent. Instead of trying to find work in a club, he collects autographs and pretends to be a close friend of the world's celebrities. Responding to the suggestion by Langford's production assistant (Shelley Hack), he puts together a sample of his work in his mother's basement surrounded by cardboard replicas of Langford and one of his guests. He fantasizes about Jerry asking him to take over the show for six months and about his being married on the show to his high school sweetheart Rita (Diahnne Abbott) who now works in a local bar.Like Bill Murray's psychiatric patient in another black comedy about obsession, What About Bob?, Rupert pursues Langford relentlessly trying to secure a spot on his show, even going to the lengths of dropping in unannounced at his summer home with Rita while Jerry is out playing golf. Unceremoniously shown the door, he cooks up a scheme with his insane girlfriend Masha (Sandra Bernhard) to kidnap Jerry at gunpoint and demand a spot on his show as payment for his release. The results of this escapade are too juicy to reveal but the film evolves in strange and unexpected ways. De Niro is sufficiently creepy and manic as the aggressive celebrity hound who is determined to get his way. Jerry Lewis is also remarkable as the sad-eyed clown whose off screen persona is the reverse of his on-air image. The King of Comedy was a cutting-edge slap in the face at the television celebrity mania in 1983 but may have been ahead of its time. Sadly, today it is more relevant than ever.",

Even though he is in his 30s already, and has never performed before a live audience, he believes he can convince popular late night host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis playing a Johnny Carson type of character) to let him appear on his show and do his routine. Much like today's American Idol TV contestants do, he has convinced himself that all he needs is the big break and he will rise to stardom. Today De Niro has been doing comedic roles again, but here in 1983 this was a big change for him, after films like Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. Here we see a completely different De Niro, playing a vulnerable character who seems completely out of touch with reality, who won't take no for an answer. I saw this movie on DVD and I admit that I fast-forwarded through most of the scenes with Sandra Bernhard. There are few actors that I cannot bear to watch, and she happens to be one. But I've always enjoyed Jerry Lewis, and here he plays a mostly serious role as a celebrity who loves the attention and adoration on one level, but really wants to be left alone. I also enjoyed seeing Shelley Hack as Cathy Long, an assistant to Lewis' character.SPOILERS. Failing to get his foot in the door by strong insinuation, Rupert and his friend (Bernhard) use a plastic gun to kidnap Jerry and threaten to kill him unless he orders his producers to let Rupert guest on the show and do his routine. Which he does and, we are surprised to see that Rupert is actually very good as a standup comic. Arrested afterward and confessing to everything, he is sentenced to 6 years in prison, gets out in less than 3, and becomes a celebrity including a best-selling book.

It is an interesting study of pandemic loneliness in our society and how the artificial and man-made become the all-important to those in our \"Modern World.\" OUR STORY\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085In New York City, the king of Late Night is one Jerry Lawford (Jerry Lewis in the role of a fictionalized version of a Johnny Carson-like character). As a highly successful icon of show bizz, Mr. Lawford has a tremendous following of fans, groupies, bimbos and far out, strange true fanatics. Two of these extreme types, Masha (Sandra Bernhard) and Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) are constantly conniving to get close to their Icon, Mr. Lawford. While the two are most usually cast as rivals, they do work together so that Rupert can fake doing Jerry a really big favor, thus gaining consideration of his audition tape of Rupert's delusional stand-up comic routine.Because he had been dreaming more and more of becoming a famous comic and he starts to believe that he and Jerry are on a first name basis, he believes that Mr. Lawford has given his Stand-Up Routine his Imprimatur. But no such conversations ever take place and Rupert never has any meeting with Jerry. He is the recipient of a polite, but cool meeting with a show staffer, who suggests that he get some experience at a local comedy club first, and then maybe he will be ready for an appearance on the show.Having realized that he has been given a sort of polite brush-off by Lawford's production aide, Cathy Long (Shelly Hack); Rupert plots with Masha to kidnap Jerry; thus leveraging his way into a booking to appear on the Lawford Show.He and Masha do kidnap Jerry and she holds him at her place, all bound in Duct Tape and mouth gag; while Rupert gives his demand to the Network that he must get to do his routine at the beginning of the show, or Jerry will be harmed.Tony Randall (playing himself) introduces Rupert with one of the aspiring funny-man's own gags, something like: \"We have no writers tonight because they were all shot by the Network Firing Squad!\"Meanwhile, Jerry manages to trick Masha into releasing him and he works his way back to the Theatre where the Show, HIS SHOW, is still in progress. Pupkin is arrested and a montage of graphics and voice overs boom out the story of his arrest, trial and sentencing to the State Pen.The announcements cover a great deal of time in a very short time and finishes up displaying a stack of Rupert Pupkin's Best Seller about how he did it all, and had the whole Network and Jerry under his power. THE END!Or is it?By way of me own theory, it appears that Director, Mr. Martin Scorsese, has left the ending very ambiguous, indeed. It appears that rather than just wrapping things up, one way or the other, we are left to decide for our selves. Did this business about Pupkin's Best Selling book real, or is it, like so much of the rest of his life, imaginary. After all, this is America, where anything can happen!",

            "content": "I suppose this is the film that people look back on and say: 'Yeah, this is where Scorsese cemented his place in the modern era of film' and they would be so very right to do so. The King of Comedy is an extremely interesting and involving film that cleverly uses the overall genre of comedy as both a backdrop and a sub-genre. Using comedy as a sub-genre is a difficult thing to do; often people will laugh at things that aren't supposed to be funny in films and label it a 'comedy' merely for that fact and yet at its core; at its heart; The King of Comedy uses that lifestyle and that world of stand up comics and jokes as a sort of American Dream setting.It's not the film that is funny, it's the world in which the story is being told. It's inhabited by the oddest people; Rupert Pupkin (De Niro) and Masha (Bernhard); its sets are of the oddest variety: Pupkin's dwelling complete with fake audience and cardboard chat show manikins; the studio's reception area with it's eerie elevator music, symmetrical look and bizarre colouring makes it look like something right out of The Overlook Hotel, from The Shining three years earlier. I would go so far as to say that although this is an American film produced at a time of great leaps and bounds in technology and a demand for blockbusters; the film ignores all of what people want it to be and breaks away from the rules somewhat. The film starts in chaotic fashion: Pupkin stalks the exit to a TV studio as his hero Jerry Langford (Lewis) steps out; flashbulbs pop, autograph hunters go crazy and people are yelling above one another and yet Pupkin, the obsessed guy that he is, gets closest to him when he 'saves' him from a possible situation. It was clear (to me, at least) from the moment the film restarts after a flash bulb freezes Pupkin's face to allow the credits to begin that the film was going to be sort of special in its own little way.I said this is the film people probably look back on for Scorsese's cementation but De Niro likewise. Pupkin is a sort of hybrid of Travis Bickle and Jake La Motta in the sense he contains the craziness and obsession of Bickle as well as the overconfidence and arrogance of La Motta \u0096 both of course Scorsese films from previous years. What I'm getting at here is that this film cements De Niro's status as a brilliant actor. The King of Comedy then breaks away from typical content and storytelling as I said it did, since there are jump cuts; there are spatial leaps between characters and the continuity is ignored somewhat although I feel none of this is deliberate. The reason for this brings on the next piece of evidence for the film's deliberate breaking away of traditional Hollywood conventions: the debate over what's real and what's a dream. Pupkin will frequently have dreams, daydreams and possible hallucinations meaning that he's more dangerous that you think. The best example of this is when Pupkin (in a dream, funnily enough) is telling Langford where he gets his material \"It comes from my life; I look at my life and how bad it is and make it funny\" says Pupkin along those lines \u0096 the very next dream is him getting married on live TV to a girl he used to go to school with by the principal who thought he'd become another bum. These repressed memories are supplying fantasies of an alternate and glorious life away from living at home with the only friend being an enemy of his idol and its here that Pupkin feels like an extension of Travis Bickle.So with this in mind, the spatial leaps and jump cuts would suggest that the boundaries between dreams and reality are blurred somewhat thus challenging the viewer to work out (possible during) what's real and what isn't. So with fantastic characterisation and a real sense of the modern age with a lot of the film revolving around television; us watching the film through television; the director Scorsese casting myself as a director; having real-life commercial success Jerry Lewis as the 'idol' for Pupkin and narrative being purposely played around with, The King of Comedy not only hits the mark as a piece of entertainment but as a funny and clever film dealing with obsession; the American Dream in an alternate form and mental illness in another form.",

            "content": "If one were to meet the legends we idolized on television and on the big screen growing up, we'd have difficulty communicating with them. We've really grown to worship them, but we as individuals don't exist in their world, and never could. But we adore what we imagine they are. We as a public put more into the individual than they may even be giving out, because they act for a hope and a fantasy. We as big audiences and ecstatic mobs lose ourselves in those individuals.Stardom must be treacherous, something too explosive and awkward to be one's daily life, it would seem. Let's say your idol does fulfill a request of yours, his biggest fan. After you tell him or her your favorite of their work, that they mean a lot to you, what next? At the end of the day, what do you want from them? The King of Comedy is a comedy of manners, of agonizingly awkward situations, especially when Rupert shows up at Jerry's house. No exception to the imperative, spontaneous performances that bring a deeply relatable uneasiness to the screen, Kim Chan has a memorable little bit as Jerry's butler, who's hilarious because he really feels the unexpected desecration by Rupert and his date. Again, we're unsure: What does he really want from Jerry? Jerry Lewis's scenes are utterly his own, the droll timing terse and low-key. But De Niro's performance as Rupert Pupkin is a seemingly oft-overlooked opportunity to see him shelve the masculinity hang-ups that he exalts in many of his other seminal characters. And yet, few of them have been as desperate, and to such a rash, dangerous degree, as his Rupert Pupkin. He's not just an important character in De Niro's body of work, or even just in Scorsese's. He's an essential character in contemporary movies, so much so that he's a reflection of so many burning feelings in the audiences that normally go unaddressed on the screen. He's so passionate and obsessive about his desire to just be out there, for any reason he has latched onto.And then there's Sandra Bernhardt's performance, which might just about take the cake as, or at least come neck and neck with, the cream of Scorsese's crop of female performances. Her Masha is a bottleneck of desperate, ashamed insecurity, distraughtly deluded fixation and an emergency need to hurtle herself headlong into the existence of someone who won't reject her. This makes her an agonizingly pitiful character, but equally as predatory as Rupert. The imperativeness with which she overcompensates is not only a threat to her own sanity but with Jerry's privacy, safety and propriety.Those fantasy sequences are brilliant. They are equally as realistic in tone and performance as every other scene on either side of it, including the things that are said and done only in our childish daydreams. And as wryly, ironically funny as that makes them, along with that giddy irony is the classic element of pain that can be found in so much great comedy. We, too, want all those jerks and teachers in high school who didn't like us to recognize that you and I were actually the special ones, and that they were the ones not deserving of attention, consideration or even the time of day, if for no other reason than because they were too ignorant to see our potential. You and I, Rupert, had a significance that they didn't see, but we knew we had. Being a star, being famous, recognized, adored, worshipped, it's about our self-respect. That is the nature of celebrity. That is the hunger for people to know who we are. Even if Jerry gives Rupert his blessing as a performer, it's still not going to be sufficient. He needs to upstage Jerry, outshine him, if he is to be better than him, and as things transpire, in order to show him the importance that he doesn't see in Rupert Pupkin.Rupert and Masha are like a sadistic brother and sister. They're clearly obsessed with Jerry, but The King of Comedy is a movie in which the line between love and hate has never been so fine. Every scene in this film plays a certain level of antagonism. This theme of aggression has its own climax even, in Shelly Hackett's scene as Jerry's rep at the studio office. She emerges to tell an aggressively unrelenting Rupert the feedback on his demo tape, which she does, being a good sport. \"Excuse me,\" he replies. \"Are you speaking for Jerry?\" The polite fa\u00e7ade behind the hostility is never more strained than in this scene, even after Rupert and Masha have taken extreme measures to get what they believe they want from Jerry. Who is this lackey, he thinks of Hackett, that she thinks she knows the rapport between Jerry and me? Meanwhile, not only is she doing her job but she's also going out of her way for him. Who is this guy who barged into Jerry's car one night? Why does that merit that she listen to his material? And yet, when Rupert is finally forcibly ejected from the premises, our sympathies lean very much his way. Not hers, not Jerry's.",

Rupert Pipkin whilst a less dangerous sociopath than Travis Bickle is very similar and casting Robert DeNiro adds to the problem .It might not have been recognised too much in 1982 but the one flaw in the genius of Scorsese is that he does tend to do unintentional remakes through the years . He remade TAXI DRIVER again with BRINGING OUT THE DEAD and he remade his masterwork GOODFELAS a few years later with CASINO and the audience will always notice how the original was superior That said despite the flaws Scorsese is a genius and he understands the human condition in general and the male psyche in particular .

Here Scorsese mixes the two together and, while I'm not convinced this is very common, it is an interesting idea. And yet, how much drama or even comedy is there in watching De Niro play a pathological moron for over 100 minutes? I'm guessing if you have a thing for the guy then it works regardless but I was very surprised after having missed out on seeing this film until now, just how tedious it can be. There is a scene towards the end when Sandra Bernhard's character is really beginning to lose it, half naked with Jerry Lewis, and the picture bursts briefly into life before fading back out with such a dire finale. Nothing wrong with De Niro's performance, Bernhard's fluctuates rather but Jerry Lewis keeps his eye on the ball and gives a perfect rendition of the ageing star fed up with having to deal with his fantasist and fanatical fans.",

John Lennon's assassination shocked and frightened the world as nobody could understand why a Beatles super fan would take the life of one of his supposed idols. Then, months later, President Ronald Reagan was gunned down by a would-be assassin named John Hinckley. Why did he do it? Bewilderingly, he did it to impress actress Jodi Foster, whom he was in love with, after watching the film Taxi Driver. Martin Scorsese's iconic masterpiece instantly became engrained in American history, and for the worst reasons possible. It's not clear that these events inspired Scorsese to make The King of Comedy, but I can't for the life of me think that it wasn't somehow an influence.This is one of the greatest comedies ever made. It's perhaps the greatest dark comedy ever made. For Zoomers, it must be said that without it, you'd never have Joker. But unlike everyone's favorite killer clown, Rupert Pupkin isn't on a mission of disruption and chaos. No. All he wanted was to make it in show business. Pupkin is a pathetic human being, with mediocre dreams and mediocre morals. He's your average kind of weirdo. That's what makes him so terrifying.Rupert is a Jerry Langford fanatic, and that's putting it mildly. His bedroom is adorned with his memorabilia. His best friend is an unhinged stalker who desperately wants to sleep Langford. He's on a first name basis with the Langford team, from his secretary to his security detail. Nothing, not a single thing, can get between Jerry and Rupert, whose twisted fantasy slowly becomes an unholy reality. Scorsese ensembles The King of Comedy like a visual personal diary. Spliced between Rupert's uncomfortable failed attempts at encroaching the Langford inner-circle are his sad and creepy fantasies of making the big time on The Jerry Langford. One of which includes Rupert marrying his high school sweetheart, live on air, administered by his groveling high school principal. Pupkin isn't just a fanatic, but also a fully-realized, deeply insecure, weakling of a human being. A man who's starry-eyed ambitions are almost entirely driven by his own inadequacies. Scorsese reaches in and captures the very soul of the psycho celebrity super-fan.There isn't a scene, nor minute, nor second of The King of Comedy that I would change. When Scorsese takes a swing and connects the ball with the bat, it's a grand-slam home run. Like Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Mean Streets and The Wolf of Wall Street, when you watch The King of Comedy, it feels like so much more than a movie.",

            "content": "''Better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime.'' Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro successfully teamed up once again in what probably was their most different and unique collaboration together. It is a wonderful and unsettling film with a great performance from Robert De Niro. I feel sorry for younger audiences who have only seen his recent work, because they are missing out on one of the best actors during the 80's and 90's. Here, De Niro plays a mentally unstable character who is obsessed with becoming famous. I don't know if our culture was so obsessed with celebrity and fame during the 80's as they are now, but The King of Comedy is very much prescient today and that is one of the reasons why it still speaks to its audience more than 30 years after its release. It isn't an easy watch, especially if you are expecting a Scorsese film like Goodfellas, but it is equally effective. The King of Comedy plays out as an edgy cultural satire and despite feeling unsettled by some of the characters motivations I still was engaged with the story. This is a unique dark comedy because it is much more restrained than others, and it isn't a comedy that will have you laughing throughout the movie, but it works in a creepy and unsettling way thanks to Scorsese's direction and De Niro's inspired performance.This satire of our celebrity obsessed society was written by Paul D. Zimmerman and it stars Robert De Niro as an aspiring comedian who is obsessed with becoming famous. We first see Rupert Pupkin hanging around a crowd of fans outside a local TV studio where Jerry Langford's (Jerry Lewis) comedy show is taped. Jerry is greeted by his fans as he exits the show and heads for his limo, but an obsessed stalker named Masha (Sandra Bernhard) awaits for him hidden in his car. In the midst of all the turmoil, Rupert separates Jerry from Masha and the rest of the crowd. He then seizes his opportunity and ends up alone with Jerry in his limo distancing himself from the rest of the crowd who in his opinion are simply autograph hounds. Rupert then introduces himself and tells Jerry that he is an aspiring comedian and wants him to invite him to his show because he believes he has potential. In order to get rid of him Jerry politely gives him some advice and tells Rupert to send a tape of his jokes to his assistant, Cathy Long (Shelley Hack), but he recommends he start at the bottom and begin performing in small local shows. Rupert is so fixated with himself and his desire to become famous that he has a difficult time trying to separate what is real and what is fantasy. Back home he begins fantasizing about his conversation with Jerry, and now that he has gotten this far he won't stop until he gets his shot at fame.Rupert isn't an easy character to root for considering he only cares about himself and can't take no for an answer. His presence unsettles everyone around him just like it does with us as we watch him invite himself to Jerry's country home or as he insists on meeting with him in his studio. Scorsese does a great job with this film creating this unsettling and disturbing atmosphere. Jerry Lewis gives a much more restrained performance and it is very different from the quirky roles we've seen him play before. In a way he's just playing himself and that is why he is so believable in his Johnny Carson like role. Sandra Bernhard's performance divided critics as some considered it to be over the top, but I thought she was great considering this is a satire of our culture's obsession with celebrities and fame. I thought the ending of this film was also perfect and very poignant. There are two ways you can read into the ending (since Rupert fantasizes so much it is hard to separate that from reality) but if it really played out the way it's presented at the end I thought it was a powerful critique of how we as a culture value success and fame over morality. It was a very satisfying ending and I really enjoyed this film.",

Rupert Pupkin is hilarious at times- as a comedian and in real life- in his appearance, his bumbling harmlessness and not so convincing act as a threatening kidnapper, whilst at other times he seems quite unnerving- his obsessions and his fantasy world we are left to construe are slightly discomforting. Jerry Lewis is dynamite as the old crettenous chat-show host who hates the world around him. One of the best stylistic devices in this film are the trips we take into Rupert's mind: a place where he regularly meets Jerry Langford, gets told how brilliant his material is, and is told to spend the weekend at Langford's country house. It is this huge difference between the fantasy world in Rupert's head and the reality of his life (he's lonely, an egotist, he still lives with his mother, his friends are mainly autograph hunters and to top it off, he's actually not that funny), it is these things that make you realize about half way through the film that the man is insane.This is one of those rare movies which make you laugh as well as make you uncomfortable; in its own way it is probably a more unsettling film than Taxi Driver because you never know how you are meant to react as a viewer; various parts of the film blur the line between reality and fantasy, and the ending is extremely ambiguous.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen, I am proud to review a twisted, creepy, and very fun film to watch....or in other words a Martin Scorcese picture. Compared to his other films whether it's Taxi Driver or Goodfellas, this film has a different vibe. It's not about angry people or gangsters, but it's about a man who wants to live his dream as a comedian. This is a lot funnier than you would expect and I'm sad how this film was misunderstood when it was originally released. This is a near masterpiece.Scorcese's film is about a man named Rupert Pupkin who idolizes stand-up comedian Jerry Langford and dreams to be on his show. After he has been rejected numerous amounts of time, Pupkin finally gets the courage to kidnap his idol in order to be on the show.This is another stand-out role by the great Robert De Niro. It's a different role, but he certainly gets his role done. He is creepy and offbeat, but somehow I felt strangely sympathetic towards his character. It is clear that he only wants to do stand-up comedy and nothing else. Jerry Lewis as Jerry Langford is excellent as the man who dislikes being famous.Overall, The King of Comedy is your quintessential Martin Scorcese film. It's strange, offbeat, and oddly humorous, but it stretches the boundary of cinema (at the time) and it offered something new to the table. Movies like these are why Martin Scorcese is one of the greatest directors Hollywood has ever seen. I rate this film 9/10.",

Rupert Pupkin has spent a lot of time on his routine and he shows great perseverance, but I didn't find it funny. Nor does Jerry Langford (played by Jerry Lewis, whose nickname interestingly enough was \"The King of Comedy\"... ) Rupert will not be deterred, but there's a fine line between determination and harassment, and Pupkin leaps over it. What kind of mind just doesn't let go? Scorsese allows us to get close enough so that we're sure we might find out...It's the cinema of revulsion expertly executed, pushing to the limits of how much the people you are playing to can take. The material may not always be light and easy to watch, skating close to the edge of excess sometimes without ever falling off, but think about this: Isn't it true that you have to suffer for your art? I guarantee that this is what Rupert Pupkin thinks he is doing, and who knows, from some people's point of view he may even be right...",

            "content": "While The King of Comedy lacks the bloody violence so prevalent in Scorcese's more popular work, this film is filled with the dark undertones that are a trademark in this director's work.  Taxi Driver allowed the audience to peer into the inner world of a psychotic.  The King of Comedy plops the audience right into the mind of a fanatic.  Robert DeNiro is Rupert Pupkin, a wishy-washy, yet determined loser, desperate to be famous at any cost.  His idol and mentor is Jerry Langford (played by Jerry Lewis), a late night talk show host (a la Johnny Carson), who Rupert sees as his ticket to the top.  The film opens on a somewhat disturbing note, with Langford being mobbed by autograph hounds.  When he escapes into the back of his limo he is suddenly accosted by Marsha (played by Sandra Bernhard), a madwoman who would do anything to sleep with him.  It is here that we meet Rupert, who uses the opportunity to get a brief meeting with the star.  The story seems typical so far.  Rupert is an opportunist, a struggling comedian looking for a break.  He asks Jerry to appear on his show.  We know that Rupert isn't working with a full deck when Jerry tells him to call his people, and Rupert can't see that this is just a brush off.\nThis is no ordinary story about someone trying to make it show business. Soon we see what goes on inside Pupkin's head.  His fantasies of Jerry swooning over him, begging him to host the show are played out.  Pupkin's room is a set.  He has cardboard cutouts of Jerry and Liza Minelli and uses them to play out his fantasies.  As Rupert laughs and cavorts with these life-size figures we can hear the canned laughter that echoes inside his head.  There is nothing funny about Rupert.  He life is sad and his behavior is eerie.  This is movie about fame.  Everyone dreams about it once in awhile.  Rupert Pupkin lives with this dream all the time.  He truly believes that he belongs up there. Rupert flirts with Rita (Diahnne Abbott), a barmaid who he thinks might just believe in him.  He invites her to be a part of his make believe world, leading her on to think that one day he will be hobnobbing with the stars and assuming that to her this is all that matters.\nThe story paints an interesting picture of the other man, Jerry Langford. This character has achieved what everyone else in the story can only dream of.  Yet ironically, he is miserable, cranky and paranoid.  When he walks out of the studio in broad daylight, he likes to be in crowds, 'he feels safer that way.'  While Rupert tries to separate himself from the crowd, Jerry is desperate to get in.  Bernhard's character, Marsha, is another story altogether.  It seems apparent that she has inherited money.  She doesn't work and she doesn't need to.  She spends her time, not looking for her own fame, but looking to mate with it.  Jerry Langford is not a stepping stone, but rather her goal.  As the movie rolls along, and as Rupert is beset by one obstacle after another, we are never really sure of his true potential.  We aren't privy to the jokes and one liners that are his stand up act.  That all comes out at the end.  Good or bad, what we witness is Rupert pouring his heart out. Pupkin, like most Scorcese characters, is a soul in pain, willing to go to drastic lengths just to be heard.  For Rupert Pupkin, fame is happiness, the only escape from the hell that is his life.",

            "review_title": "Funny, Dark, and Cynical",
            "content": "Martin Scorsese's 1983 feature, The King of Comedy is an underrated film that speaks volumes about celebrity culture-and not much in a kind way. This dark comedy features the legendary director at his best and at his darkest. Coming off the success of 1980's Raging Bull, people were excited for the next collaboration between Scorsese and Robert De Niro. The people who initially saw the movie was let down. People misunderstood this movie big time. With the word \"comedy\" featured in the title, they expected full blown-out laughs. Oh no! That is not what Scorsese was aiming for. The man instead created a movie that blasts celebrity culture and the idea of people becoming famous just for the sake of being famous. While at times funny, the movie is also cynical, dark, and sometimes a bit open-ended.How this movie came to be is quite fascinating. Paul D. Zimmermann wrote the script in the mid-70's and it fell in the hands of De Niro. The actor showed it to Scorsese, but he was uninterested because he could not find a personal connection to it and the duo made Taxi Driver instead. After the success of Raging Bull, Scorsese was thinking about retiring from directing. He fell ill constantly, and his rising stardom made him feel empty in the inside. Michael Cimino was going to direct the movie, but obligation to another film kept him back. De Niro showed him the script again and convinced him to direct with the promise of little to no Hollywood interference. On a side note, I am thankful Scorsese did not retire, because he is still one of the best working directors today.Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) and his weird friend Masha (Sandra Bernhard) are diehard fans of standup comedian and late-night show host, Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis). Rupert lives in his mother's basement, where he keeps cardboard cutouts of Jerry Langford and Liza Minnelli to name a few. His intention is to become a famous stand-up comedian himself. First, he encounters Langford as a fan and the comedian gives him some advice. Rupert takes that as Langford is his brand-new best friend-which means he thinks he will be on Langford's show. When it appears that he will not be on the show anytime soon, Rupert and Masha have to decide how far they will go to achieve Rupert's dreams.With another De Niro and Scorsese team-up, you would expect De Niro to be on top of his game-and that he was! His portrayal as Rupert Pupkin gave me some Taxi Driver vibes. After all, both Pupkin and Travis Fickle are two deranged men who cannot distinguish between reality and fantasy. They are both different characters though-and De Niro made sure of that. To prepare for this role, De Niro did something called role-reversal. He was the one actually stalking his fans-so he can learn who these stalkers are and how they do it. Jerry Lewis is fantastic. He is not necessarily an actor by trade, but he was able to capture the essence of the late-night show host. The hilarious man on-air, but a very cranky personality in reality. Sandra Bernhard was a little weird here and I do not think she brought much to the table. The movie is all about De Niro versus Lewis.It is sad to see how this is Scorsese's movie that no one saw. It was criminally underseen and wholly misunderstood at first. But as the years went by, the popularity began to increase as more and more people truly understood the film. It's a dark comedy that effectively blends fantasy and reality-which is a dangerous thing for stalkers and the celebrity culture. If you are famous, you tend to have these crazy autograph seekers follow you. Also, the fact is where De Niro wants to be famous for famous sake. In today's world, we can certainly relate to that. Just turn on American Idol where people try to be the next big thing.Overall, Martin Scorsese created another memorable movie that is funny but cynical. The ending is very divisive, and you have to go back to the whole fantasy versus reality debate to understand the ending-which I really liked. He ended the movie on an open-ended note. I also liked how he did not rely upon or overuse the music. He wanted to focus on the words themselves, but he did blend songs and an original score together-one of the first films to do so. Zimmermann's script, Scorsese's direction, and De Niro's acting makes this film worth the watch.\"Better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime.\"\n-Rupert PupkinMy Grade: A-",

            "content": "I saw this movie for the first time earlier today and I found it to be very creepy bordering on unnerving at times. The King of Comedy was indeed ahead of its time when it first came out in 1982 and has main mostly relevant up to today in terms of celebrity worship and how the media portrays celebrities and fameYou see it time in and time out of the years obsessed fans stalking and terrorizing their idols to the point something either really awful happens or it is prevented at the last minute and the perpetrator is thrown in jail having their 15 minutes of fame of wanting to be noticed by the world. This is in itself can be related to mental health issues as a driving factorI have so many mixed feelings about Robert De Niro's character, Rupert Pupkin. On one hand, I loved his passion and drive to fulfill his dream of being a comedian appearing on his idol's show. Even going far as feeling sorry for him as bits of his past and childhood are revealed towards the end and his need to be adored and for the world to notice him where he often lives out fantasies in his headOn the other hand, my feelings toward Rupert are that he is insane, dangerous, and quite possibly schizophrenic and I don't agree with what he did and his motives to eventually get his 15 minutes of fame in the world. Earlier on in the film, Rupert is rejected but is given some constructive criticism on how to not only kick start his career but possibly get his idol to not only notice but also have Rupert appear on his show. Rupert ignores this and continues to stalk his idol until he finally accepted rejection and went down the criminal route of kidnapping his idol with his plan to put himself on his idol's show so he can do his act and get every bit of attention, fame, and love he craves.I feel a lot of sympathy for Rupert's idol, Jerry. He's a famous comedian who is constantly adored by fans all over New York and quite possibly both the country and the world. However, with great fame comes crazy obsessed fans like Rupert and his accomplice who is very unhinged and uncomfortable to watch in the form of a woman named. Marsha is love obsessed with Jerry. Although Jerry did do Rupert wrong in the beginning but I understand why thoughThroughout this movie, you see Rupert in his fantasy world of talking to Jerry like he's best buddies with him and whatever setting they are in before turning back to what actually is going on with Rupert himself or with Jerry. It makes you question at times what's really happening in some scenes they are in. Are they real? Are they not? The ending really gives of this uncertainty as it appears Rupert finally got what he wanted. Quite honesty I think it was pure fantasy and he's just daydreaming while serving his prison sentenceI have to thank JOKER and its inspiration for how that movie was made which in part King of Comedy was an inspiration along with Taxi Drive. You can see some aspects from King of Comedy played in Joker which is a nice tribute. Great stuff.",

            "content": "When one thinks of films made by Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro the first thing that comes to mind probably isn't a PG certificate comedy; don't be put off by the child-friendly rating as this is certainly a grown up film. De Niro plays Rupert Pupkin, a man obsessed with becoming the next 'King of Comedy'. To this end he jumps into the car of talk show host Jerry Langford and starts talking about how he thinks Jerry is great and how he wants to follow in his footsteps. He asks Jerry for some help breaking into the business and eventually Jerry tells him to contact his secretary. We then see the two of them having dinner; Jerry is begging Rupert to take over his show for six weeks; clearly some time has past and Rupert has made it big... no! This is all a delusion of Rupert's; he is talking to himself.When Rupert turns up at the office he is given the brush off by Jerry's secretary who points out that his act needs more work and he should try performing in a comedy club before trying to get onto a national television show. Rupert doesn't take this advice of course; instead he visits Jerry at his house in the country along with his friend Rita who believes they've been invited for a party... needless to say the staff weren't expecting them and Jerry orders them to leave. Clearly Rupert will have to try something more drastic if he is to get on the show... like kidnapping Jerry!When I started watching this I was doubtful that I'd enjoy it as the protagonist was clearly so obsessive as to be unlikeable. I decided to stick with it though and soon found myself enjoying it... Pupkin was such an irritating person that he went beyond embarrassing to being funny. De Niro did a fine job in the role showing that he can do comedy as well as dramatic roles. Given that Pupkin claims to be a comedian we don't see or hear any of his material until the end; this was a great move as it means the viewer has no idea whether he is really a funny guy who just needs a break or whether he is just a sad case who is only funny in his own mind... the scenes in his basement make his famous monologue from 'Taxi Driver' seem sane! Solid support comes from Jerry Lewis who plays Langford; a man who knows comedy is a serious business and by Sarah Bernhard, who plays Masha, an obsessive fan who helps with the kidnapping. The comedy we get is for the most part fairly dark as it explores the obsession with celebrity and becoming a celebrity; that isn't to say it isn't funny though; just don't expect a rapid fire succession of gags.",

            "content": "The King of Comedy has been Scorsese's one sore spot in an otherwise fantastic career. It generally got unfavorable reviews and in one way I can understand why. The theme of the movie is of course fame obsession and has become an even bigger issue today than when the film was released in the 80's. I even think it sat two years on the shelf so when it was made nothing like it had ever been done before. That it is rather dull doesn't seem to be the opinion of most of the commentators on this site. The start is rather shocking when we hear a romantic song being abruptly interrupted by a herd of screaming fans trying to get in contact with the celebrity, Jerry Langford (Lewis). One of the main characters, Masha (Sandra Bernhard) jumps into Jerry's car to distract him so the other main character, Rupert (De Niro) can jump in and supposedly save Jerry. Here Rupert is rather clever but for the rest of the picture he couldn't be more oblivious.The Langford character behaves like most celebrities would today, I think (I never known one so I'm only guessing). He tries to please Rupert without promising him anything. Unfortunately, Rupert can't see through him because he is so blinded by the fact that he actually came in contact with Jerry. Later, he goes to Jerry's studio and tries to meet him. He again is promised nothing but still believes that he's in. He goes to Jerry's house but is thrown out and still he absolutely denies that he has been rejected again. In the end where he finally realizes how he has been ignored is played out far too far-fetched. Are we supposed to think that he has the brains to kidnap Jerry when he can't even hold the cue cards in the right order, the cue cards with his demands that he makes Jerry read over the phone. The montage where we see his wish finally come true is also too far-fetched from everything that has gone before. Sure, he could easily be famous for kidnapping a star but to have him become popular as a stand up comedian? Give me a break. So what is the real conclusion? Is this a fantasy or is it reality. I know that we are supposed to figure that out for ourselves but we don't get any clues as to why someone like Rupert could actually succeed. Is it because Scorsese thinks audiences are stupid or is it because he thinks that anyone regardless of talent can be famous if they just push hard enough. The film doesn't give us one clue so therefore I think that it would have been a better angle if Rupert's character was sane and have him fail miserably instead of this cheat of an ending. Well, that's my opinion anyway but as all Scorsese films it is worth watching but it isn't the satiric masterpiece many people think it is.",

            "content": "I'm a huge fan of De Niro and Scorsese (at least of how they used to be), but I feel I have to inject a note of dissent here. Such that I can pretty much predict that \"0 out of 8 people will find the following comment useful\" (you ever notice that nobody ever finds it useful when you pan something?) I remember 'King of Comedy' being released. I was twenty. In the crowds I moved in at the time it was pretty much seen as a success: an audacious departure. And in many ways it comes very close to being that. But nearly a quarter century later, 'King of Comedy' seems to lack real satiric power, and despite some great acting from De Niro and Lewis, feels like it's lost its way.De Niro plays Rupert... well, he complains that his name is often misspelled, so you'll excuse me if I don't try here... a delusional, aspiring but talentless fan of Jerry Lewis's 'comedy king' character. Abbetted by an even more deranged female accomplice Rupert kidnaps Jerry, as his only means of getting his break in showbiz.Early on the movie has a relatively conventional feel. De Niro is genuinely chilling (as well as embarrassing) as the gormless Rupert. Lewis's stoic grumpiness is perfect, too. It's when you begin to become aware that the film is straying into black comedy and satire that things start to go a bit awry (for this viewer anyway). Of course it's difficult to get away with being critical of such a movie, because it's possible for anybody to argue that any sequence I see as a blunder is actually not meant to be taken seriously. Nevertheless, I don't feel that Sandra Bernhard's hysterical babbling in her scene alone with Jerry Lewis works either as drama OR comedy, and Rupert's comic abilities seem to improve dramatically overnight for no reason at all.These aren't my major problems with 'King of Comedy' though. I'll admit it's actually quite riveting a lot of the time, and it's certainly nowhere near either Scorsese or De Niro's worst film (frankly, after the terrible 'Gangs of New York', and the 'Aviator', which could have been made by anyone, I wouldn't really mind if Scorsese chucked it in and stuck to 'directing' Larry David in CYE. And let's not even mention that Dreamworks cartoon.. urrrgh!) Err, yes. This review isn't going very well, is it. Maybe I should just stop now, like in a Monty Python sketch.OK, my main problem is I don't really see what this movie 'getting at', or in what way it's controversial or audacious. It's black humour doesn't seem that black today, and whatever point it's trying to make about celebrity leaves me with a feeling of 'so what?' I'm sure this would have been more powerful and surprising back in 1983, but if you're looking for a black comedy/drama about TV, 'Network' knocks spots off this, and it's about seven years older (and don't tell me that wasn't a comedy-drama. There's nothing in 'King of Comedy' as funny as the black Marxist terrorists arguing with TV execs about syndication rates).Oh hell, this review was a mess. I know, I know. 0 out of 8 of you are going to find it useful. That's if you even see it, seeing as how for some reason rave reviews get automatically bumped to the top in this weird system.It's a decent film with good acting, and is certainly worth watching as a curiosity, but whatever it was trying to be, I just think it didn't quite cut it. In its favour, I can't quite think of anything to outright to compare it with, and it's worth seeing for that reason alone.",

            "content": "A roundabout 1983, Spielberg and his buddy Scorsese started to \"experiment\". Not wanting to be typecast they began branching out, exploring areas of cinema that didn't necessarily come naturally to them. Spielberg, perceived to be a mere peddler of whimsical fantasies, wanted to prove that he could tackle \"grown up stuff\" and \"reality based stories\". Scorsese, in contrast, perceived to be an artist who wallowed in grim reality, wanted to prove that he could tackle fantasy.Thus, Spielberg hit us with the big budget double cheese-fest of \"The Color Purple\" and \"Empire of the Sun\", while Scorsese hit us with \"The King of Comedy\", \"After Hours\" and the Spielbergian thriller \"Cape Fear\".The best of these films is probably \"The King of Comedy\", in which Scorsese internalises the fantasy element of his story. His story being the tale of a lug-headed man (Rupert Pumpkin) who obsessively wants to be on TV. The film's great joke is that Pumpkin (DeNiro) is already on TV (or at least believes himself to be), Scorsese adopting a static camera, mimicking 70's TV studio cinematography/sets and having background character's make faces at the camera. The world is Pumpkin's stage, but everybody is fighting him for screen time.And so as Pumpkin prances about his hollow sets, Scorsese's flat aesthetic (ugly props, cardboard walls etc) eventually serves to reveal how hollow Pumpkin's passions are. The guy's not just delusional, but the vapid product of a vapid society which breeds vapid desires. Give him his five minutes of fame and throw him away.Oddly, for a film supposedly critiquing modern celebrity culture, Pumpkin comes across less like the byproduct of a sick society than a genuinely mentally handicapped guy. And for all his problems, Pumpkin does work his butt off trying to get on shows and practising his routines. He simply comes across as a hard worker with a couple screws lose at birth.Still, the film sports another interesting if overrated performance by DeNiro. He may be too tense, too uptight, but he's more interesting than Scorsese, whose direction is unusually lazy, the director never quite getting a grip on the satirical tone of the film. The reason, I suspect, is because Scorsese is primarily a documentary film-maker. He picks a character, follows the character with his tethered Italian camera, and periodically inserts bravado sequences of violence to whip up some excitement and give his films some direction. When he's bored of following his subject, he simply calls down some external act of carnage to terminate the story.A \"Taxi Driver\" styled character study of Rupert Pumpkin would have no doubt been a good film, but Scorsese's been there and so wants to try something new. The problem is, he's just not a visual enough thinker. He's a documentarian, not a moralist or satirist. The result is that \"The King of Comedy\" ultimately becomes a half baked satire. It doesn't go far enough.But historically, all of Scorsese's self conscious \"experiments\" have been failures. \"Cape Fear\" failed as commercial psycho-thriller. \"New York, New York\", though underrated, was a dud of a musical. With \"Gangs of New York\" he tried to break away from his tethered camera and treat architecture and space as the camera, but that was a dud as well. Meanwhile, \"After Hours\" failed at surrealism and \"King of Comedy\" as satire.Now look at his one self conscious \"experiment\" that works well: \"Kundun\". \"Kundun\" is Scorsese playing with the ethereal qualities of cinema. It's all music and visuals, framed as a child/adult's hazy, waking memory. But why this film works is that it allows Scorsese to play to his documentary strengths. First and foremost, he's documenting the life of a real character (the Dali Lama). He explicitly understands the content and so is comfortable and confident to experiment with the form or language of film.As for \"Pumpkin\", Scorsese has confessed that he had no passion for the film's screenplay and felt very withdrawn whilst directing it. DeNiro acts his method heart out, but the film never pushes itself further and succeeds only because of him.8/10 - Worth three viewings.",

It doesn't look like a Scorsese movie to me, however that doesn't mean it's a bad movie, and even though De Niro plays a slightly unusual role for him, he did a great job. Jerry Lewis is literally playing himself here. It is obvious why they chose the names of the main roles, Jerry because that is the name of Lewis, and Pupkin because of how it would often be mispronounced. I was a little bothered by the role of Sandra Bernhard, I didn't like it, and I don't think it had any effect on the whole film. From the behavior of the main character Rupert, who is desperately looking for the \"right\" opportunity for success, I got the impression that the character is a psychopath because his persistence turns into obsession and the boundary between reality and his dreams does not exist. That's why my ending loses on quality because it's left to us viewers to decide what the real reality is.",

            "content": "Like \"Rope\", the long-forgotten experimental 1948 film that serves as the official Hitchcock/Stewart sleeper, \"The King Of Comedy\" is the equivalent of such for Scorsese & De Niro. Indeed, its not as ambitious as most Scorsese films but it is nonetheless compelling. As Rupert Pupkin, De Niro is a hapless loser posing as an amateur comedian, clinging to the idea of being \"discovered\" by a Johnny Carson type celebrity named Jerry Langford - (played wonderfully by Jerry Lewis, what a great casting choice that was!) - that Rupert is obsessed over. Rupert finds some solace in fellow stalker Marsha, whose yearnings to meet Langford are even more selfish than his. Meanwhile, Rupert seeks validation for his meek efforts through Rita, an attractive nearby bartender. Once it becomes apparent that neither Langford nor Rita would ever acknowledge Rupert (or Marsha in Langford's case), Rupert and Marsha take matters - and Jerry - into their own hands.This obviously was overlooked by the public due to its less-than-volatile subject matter we're all accustomed to seeing from Scorsese. Also, Scorsese doesn't really dispense any of his arsenal of camera and editing tricks (partly because he doesn't have to), the travels inside the mind of Rupert are frightening enough, especially the 'fantasy' segments, where not only does Rupert imagine a meteoric rise to fame by way of Jerry Langford, but he also becomes Langford's confidant. The television wedding is one of the most funny and frightening scenes I've seen; it's funny to observe how it unfolds, it's scary to think that Rupert is seriously wishing for all this to happen.The film, via Rupert's warped brain and Jerry's tarnished spirit, illustrate the devastating effects of fame - both on the celebrity and the person who watches them. Towards the end (I won't really ruin it for you), Langford passes by an electronics store, he sees Rupert's face on his own TV show; the price of celebrity Langford must pay is explained quickly and in complete silence, all that's required is a close-up of Jerry staring back at the germ of a monster he unknowingly helped create. Like \"Raging Bull\", this film was proposed by De Niro, who asked Scorsese to write & direct it for him. Sandra Bernhard and Diane Abbott are also great as women who who wish to deny Rupert their attention because he's so annoying but at some point they give in because he seems so harmless. Aside from the overall great performances from De Niro and Lews, Lewis also delivers a very grounded monologue about the everyman's misconception of fame. And how can you not love Scorsese's ambiguous ending? It suggests that maybe none of this ever happened at all. An overlooked masterpiece from the great duo.",

            "content": "Prior to airing the film the other night, Turner Classics film critic Ben Mankiewicz put up an interview he did with Jerry Lewis a few months ago. At almost ninety years old, Lewis had some interesting observations about the picture, stating that he asked director Martin Scorsese to change the name of the character he portrays in the film to his own name 'Jerry'. His rationale was that so many people knew him by name on the streets of New York that it would make those scenes where they call out to him a lot more natural and believable. I'd have to say it worked out pretty well.I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most people probably know a person or have come across someone like Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro). In my case I had a guy working for me once that constantly badgered me about moving him up in the organization we worked for. He was at a custodial level and wanted to be a clerk, not the same league as late night talk shows but you get the idea. The guy's presence was ubiquitous, just like Rupert, and you had to have the patience of a saint. That's why Shelley Hack's restrained performance in the picture was so credible; you just know she wanted to scream.And wasn't Sandra Bernhard's character just full tilt gonzo? Man, how would you like to hook up with her some night? In company with Rupert, the pair of them were like escaped lunatics from the asylum. Go back and check that scene right after Rupert is escorted from the building by the security chief - they're both standing there arguing with each other right underneath a sign for 'Chock Full o' Nuts'. Whoever had that idea ought to get a prize.So the story line begs the question - was Rupert simply a would be, no talent comic with delusions of grandeur, or was he genuinely mentally ill. One could make a case for the latter, and with that in mind, the picture's brilliance is in the way Scorsese fleshes out these characters in their personal interactions with each other. Rupert bringing along Rita (Diahnne Abbott) to Jerry's home was the kicker for me, the tipping point that convinced me he was a mental case.I passed on this film when it first came out because I didn't care for the hype, and Jerry Lewis, although a gifted comic in his own right, has a way of grating on my nerves in his movie roles. But I have to say he did an excellent job here and maintained a genteel presence throughout, even when hogtied and serenaded by Bernhard's Masha character. For her part, Bernhard might have had the best line in the picture that didn't make any sense at all - \"I cover the waterfront. Remember that!\"",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's film The King of Comedy (1983) stars Robert De Niro as Rupert Pupkin, a man who has his name spelled wrong everywhere and is desperate for becoming a real comedian in television alongside his idol, a hyper popular talk show host played by Jerry Lewis. Pupkin has also a friend, who is madly in love with Lewis' character and before the credits in the beginning have appeared, she has already tried to rape him in his own car. This film may sound and look like a comedy when noticed at the video store, but this ain't normal comedy, if the genre \"comedy\" is correct in the first place.The King of Comedy is a shocking depiction of world, our world, which is full of shallow people desperately searching for a meaning for their lives through media and television in particular. Pupkin doesn't think he is anybody before appearing in the TV and thus be the King. He tries to fill the gaps in his life by becoming popular and loved, just like the comedian he finally decides to kidnap. How could this wonderful life of glory and money be bad or uncomfortable? Because it requires one to live his life for others, not for himself, as Jerry's character, a cynical older comedian and De Niro's idol has learned. He is sick of being noticed everywhere in the streets and he is in fact very lonely and tired elsewhere than in his \"television life.\"The film has many great details and segments typical to Scorsese. De Niro's last speech as he finally is on television is very fantastic proof of his acting abilities, and the structure of the ending is like in Taxi Driver, as we learn what happened and happens to the main character, again De Niro. Also the beginning and the image freeze-framed on the background of the credits is very genius and just continues after the credits. This technique makes the viewer to pay attention to the screen all the time as the image may start moving anytime.. Also the long and slow camera drives are present and strong use of music to make the images even more powerful. Also the segment in which De Niro tries to get inside the building to get to chat with Jerry is very long lasting and horrific as we see how desperate this man is and what would he do if he doesn't get inside. Well, the answer for that question comes very soon.Scorsese is a master in the field of cinema, and even though this film isn't among his most personal and powerful works, I still appreciate this very much as it hasn't gor any flaws in my opinion. It is dark satire of our media filled world which creates empty and shallow people who aren't able to live in peace without the reason to live, television and acceptance reached through it. Scorsese deserves 10 rating again.",

            "content": "The King of Comedy is unfairly marginalised when most people think of Martin Scorsese/Robert De Niro collaborations. I guess this is to do with the fact that it's so very unlike the others. In it, De Niro plays Rupert Pupkin, a would-be stand-up comedian with a serious inability to differentiate fantasy from reality. He is obsessed with late night talk-show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) and mistakenly believes they are equals with an understanding. In reality Langford thinks he is a schmuck who won't go away. Pupkin is in fact a stalker, and this eventually leads him to a criminal act.Far from being a minor film, this is in fact amongst Scorsese's best. Its subject matter about people obsessed with celebrity culture and the shallow pursuit of their fifteen minutes of fame is a very prescient one. In the years that followed the release of this film the reality of stalkers and people dangerously obsessed with celebrities has become more and more well known. The King of Comedy has gotten more and more relevant as the years go by. It wasn't a success at the time and I am guessing that this was because the subject matter didn't touch a nerve at the time, while the PG rating might have put those off who were expecting another Scorsese/De Niro film in the vein of Mean Streets or Taxi Driver or Raging Bull. But in truth, despite the relative restraint in the picture, the subject matter is far from harmonious. Rupert Pupkin is a seriously warped individual with clear psychological problems and his behaviour is liable to make you uncomfortable quite a bit of the time.De Niro puts in one of his best performances here simply because it's very atypical. He is effectively playing an \u00fcber nerd. A very unglamourous character. And he pulls it off perfectly, not only that he is pretty funny as well which may be the biggest surprise of all. It also has to be said that Jerry Lewis is never anything less than convincing as Langford in a role he was probably born to play. Scorsese himself holds the whole thing together with his usual mastery and as a result The King of Comedy is a must-see movie.",

I always find myself asking, `Could Travis Bickle be driving me around?'  What a scary thought.  That fear has lingered into my adult hood.  Now thanks to Mr. Scorsese I'm afraid of stand-up comics.  Stop scaring me.The King of Comedy tells the story of Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro, Flawless).  Pupkin is a man with a dream, to become the newest King of Comedy.  He will stop at nothing to get on the hottest late night talk show `The Jerry Langford Show' and after many months of trying he finally forces a meeting between him and the host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis, Funny Bones).  After the meeting Rupert thinks he's made a new friend.  Too bad Jerry doesn't realize that.  So Rupert begins to stalk Jerry, showing up at his office, and out his summer home. Then Rupert gets fed up with Jerry's games and decides to kidnap him.  Will this get him a shot on the Jerry Langford show?  That's up to you to find out.THE KING OF COMEDY is Taxi Driver light.  Rupert Pupkin is disturbed but not dangerous.  This works really well, because it gives you an under dog to root for, even if the ends don't justify the means.  But aren't all of us a little star struck.  Don't we all at one time or another look up and see some hack on television, or a Michael Bay movie and say `Hey I Can Do That?' I think well all have a little Rupert Pupkin in us.De Niro makes Pupkin come alive.  Rupert Pupkin is a really annoying guy. He's the kind of guy who attacks famous people with banal chitchat.  If I were famous I'd want to steer clear of a guy like this.  I would assume De Niro has had exposure to people like this and that's why he can channel a character like this.  It's a strong performance with subtle wit and amazing presence.  I especially liked the scene outside Jerry Apartment Building where Rupert doesn't want to stop talking to Jerry and Jerry just wants to get away from this nut.  I loved the urgency in Rupert's voice like if he were to stop talking this night would end and that can't happen.  It's almost a letdown when Jerry walks into his apartment.  The mind game over.  It's a shame.Another bright spot in this film is an actress I usually have very little faith in Sandra Bernhard (Hudson Hawk).  She plays Masha, another one of Jerry Langford's obsessive fans, and Rupert's partner in crime.  There is a sequence in which she tries to seduce Jerry; it's a performance that is both painful and silly, and really astonishing.  I was impressed.THE KING OF COMEDY is a lot of fun.  It's also quite painful, and beautiful at the same time.  Director Scorsese does a bang up job, even going as far as inviting the likes of Dr. Joyce Brothers and Tony Randall in as guest stars.  Offering us that little spark of reality.  What a great movie THE KING OF COMEDY is.Why not give it a try yourself.",

Scorsese's trademark , a clever score, combining good original music by Ronnie Robertson, and several brilliantly chosen pop tunes. One trademark of Scorsese at this best has been an undercurrent of dark, bitter comedy, a sense of the absurd that keeps breaking into even his most solemn, measured films. Here, the comedy reaches its peak in an explosion of dark, vicious satirical irony. Scorsese's 'message' is all too clear. American society has foresaken true heroism and achievement in the pursuit  of celebrity. America has become the \"entertainment state' par excellence. Like the great black comedies of the sixties- Doctor Strangelove, Lolita,  Lord Love  A Duck,or Kiss Me,Stupid- The  King of Comedy  assaults the false Gods of our materialist and superficial culture. It is, in an very indirect way, one of the most powerful Christian critiques of America ever put on the screen.

I must admit Sandra Bernhard was nothing special here though, only really drawing attention away from de niro and lewis who were the main attractions.For me, the films highlight was when we finally got to see some of Rupert's material at the end of the movie. I also liked how the movie was put together (a bit like taxi driver) where we were left wondering which events actually happened, and what was just in his head.Don't go into this movie expecting a comedy/de niro-scorsese master piece. But if you would like to see something a bit different from Robert, this is definitely worth a watch.",

            "review_title": "Marty's ahead-of-its-time masterpiece about celebrity, popularity and desire's misery ...",
            "content": "\"The King of Comedy\" is rarely regarded as one of Scorsese's best films, and I think this failure to recognize the underrated genius of the film clearly indicates the distance between the critics, Marty's peers and the audience. One must put the glasses of a poor schmuck to read the perfect examination of the three psychological levels of being an active fan, the passive stage consisting on being a simple admirer. This cinematic exploration is highlighted by Rupert Pupkin, Robert De Niro in the performance that paved the way for his comedic roles. Pupkin is soft-spoken, funny, eccentric, but don't get it wrong, this is still a Scorsese film, and Pupkin's mind isn't freed from any violent impulses ... he might even display more psychopathic and dangerous behavior, than Travis Bickle or Jake La Motta.The first level of fan-being relies on the autographs' collection. The movie opens with the comedian Jerry Langford, Jerry Lewis in an obviously self-reflexive role, leaving the TV Station when he's literally attacked by a group of fans. We share Jerry's discomfort and feel some contempt toward those who marginal people, with \"no life\" as we would say now, people who can't do anything but conquer a symbolic parcel of a celebrity's stardom, to feel better. This is the primal state, annoying but still harmless. This is how Rupert Pupkin started, but with his sophisticated geeky look and flamboyant costume, he outshines the autograph's collectors, he climbed the social ladder and is now determined to reach Jerry Langford more personally. In this move, he's joined by Masha, a hysterical fan fiercely obsessed by Langford. Both will manage to get in Langford's car, but only Pupkin with Langford inside. Masha represents the second type of active fan, the stalker.Masha is guided by a terrible desire to possess Jerry, she's the kind of fan who thinks she knows him so well, there ought to be a sort of reciprocity. The pathological example of the fan who elaborates a dreamy vision of a star, and includes herself in that idyllic vision, driven by a personal fantasy. The aggressiveness of Masha's behavior and her constant obsessions highlight the movie's darkest and scariest overtones, reminding of Jodie Foster's fan who tried to emulate Travis Bickle. But the portrayal of Masha's condition, by the talented Sandra Bernhard, serves a double purpose, besides the fact that her obsession completes Pupkin's personal dreams, as together, they will be able to elaborate one hell of a wicked scheme, Masha also emphasizes the pervert side of stardom when all the cheers, the praises, the laughs, the love, the desire, inspire the fans a sort of Oedipal impulse, this is Pupkin's condition.Pumpkin is totally disoriented when he meets Jerry in the car, because he knows. Pupkin is basically the boldest reply to the question: \"Why are we fan?\" Because we want to emulate the star, kill the star to be the star, like Freud told to kill the father to become a man. Pupkin's goal is to dethrone the King. His whole life is made of fantasies, he imagines himself answering to the journalists, acting like a friend of Jerry, being popular, loved and applauded. The fantasies in \"The King of Comedy\" get more and more preeminent and the more systematically, the doors get closed in Rupert Pupkin's face, the more he insists. He looks nice and polite, but he's explicitly hostile, and the intelligence of the script is to put us in Jerry's shoes in quite embarrassing situations: when he's harassed, when he finds Rupert in his house. Jerry doesn't know how to handle him, because he can't understand, while we do. \"The King of Comedy\" can be seen as the triumph of perseverance in a quest for celebrity. The running gag involving Pupkin's name or the way he's constantly rejected, by the door guy, or the blonde assistant, help to root for him, as a sympathetic character, but he's no better than Masha and feeling empathetic toward him would be like understanding why Travis took Betsy to a porn film. No, these people had good reasons to reject Pupkin, and Pupkin did the best he could to show how hostile he was, and was violent whatever were his motives and his success. But I guess the fact that we all root for Pupkin reveals how we understand his fantasies, and how the movie highlights our own perversity. Scorse has a unique talent to make you root for a character and feel guilty for it.The film was visionary in its denunciation of how obsessed fans love to emulate the stars, but it's nothing compared to now. Look at Facebook and the social websites, aren't we proud to show ourselves beautiful or talented, just to get more comments, isn't the desire to achieve something ego-driven more than inspired by a sincere desire of accomplishment. We want people to see us, the way we do. In one of Rupert's fantasies, his old school principal realizes that he misjudged him. Scorsese depicts celebrity as the success based on a desire to make up for a pathetic life. Pupkin's success implies that stardom compensates repressed memories, and the desire to be loved is proportional to the hate and humiliation accumulated in the past, but who cares of being a schmuck in a lifetime, if you're allowed to be the King one night and maybe more?I felt guilty to root for Rupert, but so did probably the stars who were reminded that they are ex-losers while losers are wanna-be stars, how ironic. \"The King of Comedy\" is one of the brilliant sociological satires against the perception of stardom in our modern society, and the least we could say, is how selfish we all are, and how relevant the film gets after each year, which may explain why it was so severely overlooked in its time ...",

            "content": "THE KING OF COMEDY is an oft-overlooked gem from the De Niro/Scorcese library that is one of my favorite films and is part of my permanent video collection. De Niro gives one of his most on-target performances as Rupert Pupkin, a slightly demented fan of talk show host Jerry Langford, who wants to be a stand up comic and goes to very extreme lengths to achieve his goal. De Niro's Pupkin is ultimately hysterically funny and tragic at the same time, almost heartbreaking in the way he justifies in his own twisted mind the things he does to get what he wants. Jerry Lewis practically channels Johnny Carson, in the performance of his career, as Jerry Langford, the no-nonsense talk show host who blows off Rupert and pays a terrible price for it. I saw an interview with Lewis once where he stated that this role was the easiest thing he had ever done and that he wasn't really acting, just reading the lines, but I disagree. Lewis gives us deep insight into the pressure of celebrity fame and the sacrifices that come with that fame. Sandra Bernhard steals every scene she is in as Masha, another fan obsessed with Langford who finally gets her chance to be alone with the man. Her rendition of \"Come Rain or Come Shine\" is a classic. There is a school of thought that Scorcese erred by having Pupkin come out at the end smelling like a rose and I understand those that feel that way, but I found myself so strongly sympathizing with the character that I found the ending quite satisfying. Not for all tastes, but if you are a DeNiro/Scorcese fan and love the business of show business, THE KING OF COMEDY is a must see.",

            "content": "It is not necessarily Scorsese's greatest or most \"important\" film, though it was made during the period of some of his most influential pictures. It is filled with astounding editing\nthat starts in the credit the moment the Ray Charles song ends and we are cannonball shot from the psychosis unfolding in the limousine to the insanity unfolding in the crowds outside.Jerry Lewis is great, De Niro in a first comedic role, though heavily undercut with implicit violence that he was already so well known for, and Sarah Bernhardt in her greatest wildest performance by far.The movie is about taking the scraps of a disconnected existence and forcing them into a solid and sensational reality by ANY means necessary. It's about paying a calculated short term price for\na lasting and monumental success. It is, in a sense, what Scorsese did with a relatively unknown De Niro, with whom he so brilliantly collaborated and launched an empire of great work.All the elements of the famous partnership, the humor, violence, supreme irony, are here. Scorsese himself shows up in cameo, as he did in the back seat of De Niro's taxi in TD, here playing the director of the show Rupert Pupkin extorts his way into.Seeing this as a young man with my own specific glorious goal and no way in the world to make it happen, i collaborated with a brilliantly accomplished individual, with his own special agendas in collaborating with me, was dubbed the \"Human Drill Bit\" 3 decades before Owen Wilson's movie about 'Drillbit' etc. In And the 2 of us had watched this film together and glanced meaningfully at each other.In General, this destroyed country, founded on theft, murder, and exploitation, has always been euphemized as the land where one can \"create themselves.\" There was a time when a case could be made for that. Eons ago there were people who came from nothing (financially for the most part) who through talent\nor through ruthlessness, rose to vast wealth or recognition, sometimes even, though rarely, based on genius in some area that was recognized, and brought to the attention of billions of people via contemporaneous marketing. Etc.But this movie mocks all of that. It hot wires fantasy into fast track reality, and inspired me to an enormous type of success by simply performing a succession of \"stunts\" that amounted to walking with utter indifference and frequent hilarity, through the center of an exploding social hydrogen bomb of my creation, and being nerveless and unshakeable regardless of the chaos being created. In my case there was no prison term, but a lot of astonished people. It is of course about grifting, and of course you should watch the wonderful \"The Grifters\", and these movies have been with us forever, what's the famous one with Redford and Newman?, or House of games.....But this one sits at the apogee. Possibly because the grifters aren't grifting at all.It's the gospel of subliminal America. Buried beneath work ethics, and puritanical repressions, the vast depressed majority are suffering but the prisons are packed, we have more then any other country, not just with the tiny fraction psycho's, but essentially 'normal' men and women who for a doomed moment, actually act out what they really want to do. Such is the case here, reality inverts, it is subverted by 2 dreamers who aren't lying or deceiving anyone. Pupkin's fantastic \"grift\" is his sublime interior TRUTH being exposed, indifferent to obstacles to the dream. Total unflappable certainty of an inevitable positive outcome, every \"NO\" is just a syllable waiting to covert to a solid \"YES.\"There are a lot of levels to appreciate this movie, this exercise in the power of applied imagination on. It's a great movie whether you are 'getting something from it as a textbook', or admiring the story, the acting, the relative uniqueness of the conception, the great storyboarding of Scorsese, etc.I love this picture. I took a message from it that worked. You might just enjoy it....or not. The \"average\" person can no longer do what he could from 1950 through 1990. There will always be exceptions, but because of what this inspired in me as a young guy with a ton of energy and imagination and a healthy IQ and a willingness to do special things, it was life changing, like a musician who hears Bach, or Hendrix,\nor a guy learning about Soro's approach to synthetic derivatives and his market disequilibrium theories, or someone who really can understand Einstein's physics, sometimes something clicks the right brain cells for you.",

He'd sell his mother to anyone that could give him his \"big break\". Instead, he becomes the persistent jerk who thinks he has what it takes to hit it big. He has all the talent of the so called funny guy at the restaurant or shoe store the typical person works in or visits on occasion. And he's got the nerve of an assassin.Jerry Lewis is the subject of so many stories, most of them not flattering, that who knows what he thinks of fame after having been in the public eye since he could legally buy alcohol. So many years of meeting wannabes must feel like the weight of the world and the cumulative stress of telling them they're not show biz material has got to make him hate this aspect of celebrity. His character here is not a nice guy, but given what Robert and Sandra Bernhard put him through, a double murder might have been justified.The late, great Catherine Scorsese made many appearances in her son's films and this is among the best.

I watched it again recently and I realize that this is like Aaron Sorkin doing 'Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'. Martin Scorsese is a great director but they both suffer from the fact that they're not from the comedy world. There are things that ring a bit false. Langford would tell Pupkin to do standups at the local comedy clubs. He would never tell him to call his secretary. I found myself needing a break from him every ten minutes or so. Robert De Niro creates an amazing character. This is definitely not a comedy. This is a creepy disturbed character study and a rather difficult watch. It may actually be easier to watch if Scorsese turns it into something much darker and less annoying like Travis Bickle. The police should be involved sooner to elevate the tension.

            "content": "Apparently it was a failure at the cinemas, but I can see why the critics give it five stars, and why (almost like The Shawshank Redemption story) it has become a little masterpiece from BAFTA nominated director Martin Scorsese and his popular partnership with the main star. Basically, Rupert Pupkin (BAFTA nominated Robert De Niro) is the obsessive aspiring stand-up comedian and stalker-in-waiting (kind of like Robin Williams in One Hour Photo), and he dreams of fronting his own TV show, like his idol, talk show host and comedian Jerry Langford (BAFTA nominated \"King of Comedy\" Jerry Lewis). He does meet Jerry and pleas to perform on his show, and he said he's get back to him (obviously to get rid of him), and as he keeps trying to get his way, Rupert is given the run-around. He constantly rehearses his performance by himself with cardboard cutouts of stars, and imagines he is really on the show, which his mother keeps talking him to keep down, and he also makes a tape to give to Jerry's studio. He doesn't give up, and he will keep stalking till he gets what he wants, he even goes to Jerry's house with his \"love interest\" Rita Keane (Diahnne Abbott). Eventually, he knows that Jerry won't listen the polite way, so he teams up with psychotic Langford-obsessed friend Masha (Sandra Bernhard) to kidnap Jerry in hope to finally perform on his show. The cops do have him arrested, but Rupert warns them that if he doesn't perform on the show, he will kill Jerry. After he has performed his routine on the show, he goes to the bar where Rita works so that she (and we the audience) can see it on TV. Masha meanwhile is showing her insane (literally and mentally) passion for Jerry, tied in Sellotape, but he manages to temp her to take the tape off, and he escapes. In the end, Rupert is put in prison, and Jerry rescued, but the ending, like some of his other daydreams earlier in the film, we never know if this is just another one, or if Rupert become famous on covers of magazines and a proper stand-up performance is reality. Also starring Cathy Scorsese as Dolores, Catherine Scorsese as Rupert's Mom, Leslie Levinson as Roberta Posner, Scorsese himself as the TV Director, Ed Herlihy, Liza Minnelli (must mean the cardboard cutout, LOL), Victor Borge and Tony Randall (maybe also the cutout). De Niro is funny and slightly creepy as the stalker wannabe comedian, Lewis has some good moments of dialogue and reaction to his behaviour, there is an interesting mix of daydream with reality (although questionable which is which, especially at the end), and the direction by Scorcese is fantastic, just a terrific film. It won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Editing, and it was nominated the Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm for Scorsese. Robert De Niro number 2 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 50 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Al Pacino) on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 40 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You.

THE KING OF COMEDY is undoubtedly a brilliant film which was misunderstood and shunned by most audiences on first release (later even by Scorsese himself), which resulted in it being a flop. This is a shame for a number of reasons.First of all, the acting is top-notch. Method man De Niro shines as the lowly Rupert Pupkin, creating a truly memorable character when he converses in his bedroom with cardboard cut-outs and imagines himself as a television great. On top of this there's a fine \"straight man\" role from Jerry Lewis, the object of Pupkin's growing obsession, and the two get to share some fine moments - particularly when Pupkin breaks into Lewis' country mansion later in the film. Female support comes from an understated Diahnne Abbott as Pupkin's love interest, and Sandra Bernhard as a fellow mentally unstable fan whose role is alternatively funny and rather tragic. A seasoned troupe of veteran performers largely play themselves and add to the movie's realism.Scenes in which Pupkin tries to infiltrate Langford's offices and finds himself repeatedly shunned are a delight to watch, and both dramatic and pretty funny with it. The twist ending, in which Pupkin achieves his fame IN SPITE of everything that has happened, will leave you scratching your head and wondering if this is another dream-fantasy from Pupkin's mind or whether it really did happen. In any case, the pairing of two talented men - Scorsese as director and De Niro as star - once again makes for unmissable entertainment, a film which you can't take your eyes off the screen when watching. A totally unique cross between black comedy and psychological drama, this both scary and funny, a feat often difficult to achieve, and I don't know of any other movie quite like it out there.",

This is particularly true of Scorsese who has been, and still is famous for more gritty, hardhitting films like Taxi Driver, Mean Streets and Raging Bull. The dynamic duo take the Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver and transplant him into this. It almost like what Stanley Kubrick did with Dr. Strangelove, taking a serious subject and turn it into a dark comedy.Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is a struggling stand-up comedy in New York, and idealises a popular talk show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis). One night after Langford's show the host is attacked by a stalker and Pupkin helps him. This gives him the opportunity to talk about his act, and Langford says he could arrange a meeting with his secretary. Rupert starts to pester Langford's show staff, and their try to give him the brush-off, even listening to his tape of material and give him some advice. Pupkin lives him a fantasy, daydreaming that Langford would love his act and he would become a famous comedian. After Langford threatens to call the police to Pupkin, the comedian takes extreme action. He kidnaps his icon and demands he get to go on the show to perform his routine.It is obvious that Pupkin is an obsessive man, who has boundary issues. He is a daydreamer, which there is nothing wrong with that, but he takes it to the next level, becoming a stalker and doesn't see when people are telling him to go away. He is a good example of a modern celebrity stalker. Pupkin is a man who wants to be famous, but wants to take a shortcut, not earning his fame. He takes the wrong way to fulfill his American Dream. Both Robert De Niro and Jerry Lewis offer excellent performances. De Niro as Pupkin has some cringe worthy moments.Martin Scorsese shows once again why he is one of best directors ever. He gets the pacing just right, perfectly casts the film, shows the darker, but also a lighter side of human beings and make New York and show business into a character themselves. He is able to combine a real world, like how the studio would react to Pupkin, with Pupkin's fantasy world. Few directors can do that. Scorsese also has such a flair for scenes and shots. Scenes of particular note are when Pupkin fantasizes having lunch with Langford, where Langford is in a restaurant whilst Pupkin is in his bedroom. The other is a long continuous when Pupkin is kicked out of the production office: I love those shot generally.However the film should have been funny. There could have been more jokes and Scorsese was a little unsure with comedy. But even a weak Scorsese is still better then most films that are released.An entertaining film.",

            "content": "Despite the title and the presence of Jerry Lewis in the cast, this Martin Scorsese film is only nominally a comedy- it's more of a companion piece to Taxi Driver, and in some ways is even abrasive. Robert De Niro plays another obsessed loner on the outskirts of society yearning for attention, but in this case his attempt takes the form not of violence but of stand-up comedy. De Niro's character, Rupert Pupkin, is a celebrity hound whose goal in life is to appear on a talk show, hosted by a Johnny Carson-type character played by Jerry Lewis. However, Pupkin doesn't want to bother with gradually building up his reputation by performing in comedy clubs; as far as he's concerned, he's entitled to instant celebrity. Pupkin has built up a completely deluded persona for himself, acting with condescension towards everyone he meets, as if he's already a world-famous celebrity. Everything about Pupkin is as fake as his polyester suit. In the hands of most talented actors he would probably be funny, but the De Niro of this movie is closer to the guy who made Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Once Upon a Time in America than the guy who made Meet the Parents and Rocky and Bullwinkle (In some ways, De Niro's role as La Motta seems to have prefigured his own acting career.) He has to be the most unlikable character De Niro has ever played, which is saying quite a lot. I've never actually seen a Jerry Lewis movie, and I'm not in any rush to either, but from what I do know about him his performance bears little resemblance to the rest of his work; in King of Comedy, he is perhaps the sanest character, since he actually knows that being famous doesn't lead to complete fulfillment. Scorsese's direction here is probably the most restrained of his career, which is not necessarily a compliment. In a book of interviews with Scorsese that I once came across, he actually seemed to have regarded this stylistic moderation as a stylistic experiment of its own, certainly not something that would occur to most directors. If this makes King of Comedy less enjoyable than his other movies, it probably is the right decision for a movie about a guy obsessed with talk shows, which after all are not the most visually stimulating subjects. So King of Comedy may not exactly be fun- it's occasionally funny, but is more often as abrasive as Pupkin- but it sure is interesting to watch.",

What seemed implausible and bizarre 25+ years ago is today's unfortunate reality. With our current celebrity universe packed with ridiculous no-hopers like Joe the Plumber and \"OctoMom\"--i.e. \"stars\" who attained their fame/infamy purely through outlandish behaviour--an obnoxious , no talent train wreck like Rupert Pupkin would be in constant demand for reality TV and talk shows everywhere. Hell, he'd probably even get married to Carmen Electra or Britney Spears-if only for a couple of days. Scorsese captured lightning in a bottle with this film (even if he still doesn't realize or acknowledge it) and Robert DeNiro hit a creative peak with his depiction of the desperate unfunnyman Pupkin that he hasn't approached since.",

            "content": "This is a pitch-black comedy about fame, celebrity, and the lack of communication in a world dominated by the illusions of mass media. It also feels like an alternate universe treatment of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver where, instead of getting a job with a taxi company he went to a comedy club and saw Jerry Langford's premiere performance.Rupert Pupkin (sounds a lot like bumpkin to me) is a celebrity and autograph hound who has a very low-level job as a courier (which he calls communications) and an obsession with Jerry Langford, a late-night television show host in the vein of Johnny Carson. Pupkin, who lives in his mother's basement, also holds a fantasy of becoming a hugely successful comic like Langford. One night after taping his show, Langford gets mobbed on the short sidewalk to his car from the television studio in Manhattan and Pupkin sneaks into the car, convincing Langford to allow him a few minutes of his time because of a minor injury he sustained in the bedlam. Through his earnest interactions with Langford, Pupkin gets a mealy-mouthed promise of something for the future regarding Pupkin's comedy act and a potential spot on the show. Being delusional, Pupkin takes this empty promise as an assurance that his future fame has been cemented.In this world of mass communication, very little ends up communicated between people. Langford gives Pupkin hints that he has no interest in helping him, but Pupkin doesn't hear it. Langford's producer's assistant outright tells Pupkin that he doesn't have a chance yet to be on Langford's show, but Pupkin refuses to believe or even really hear it. When Pupkin and the only person he could remotely call his friend, Masha, another autograph hound obsessed with Langford, have a disagreement about the truthfulness of Pupkin's relationship to Langford, neither really listens to the other as they justify their positions. When Langford is walking the streets of New York from his apartment to his job, he likes the distance of people saying hello to him without him needing to actually get to know them. There's a wonderful moment (apparently based on a real event from Jerry Lewis' life) where he stops to sign an autograph of an older woman, but when he walks away without talking to her son on the payphone, she wishes for him to get cancer. Jerry loves the fake connection with his audience, but he really wants nothing to do with them individually, the relationship with his audience through the television is a mirage and he prefers his isolation. When Pupkin and Masha end up kidnapping Jerry, Masha is left alone with Jerry and tries to have an intimate dinner with him, implying a deep relationship with him based on nothing but her view of him through the television.This idea is presented cinematically through Scorsese's decision to film both reality and fantasy in the same, matter of fact manner. When the concept is introduced early, it's done in an obvious way with Pupkin talking to himself in his mother's basement intercut with the fantasy of him and Jerry having the same conversation in a swanky restaurant. It's also held in the performances. In that same scene, de Niro plays Pupkin two completely different ways. In reality he's earnest and overbearing. In the fantasy he's cool and relaxed. As the movie goes on, more and more gets fantasized, but the technique of treating the two \"realities\" the same makes it harder and harder to tell the difference between the two until the very end.After Pupkin has fallen prey to his fantasies completely through a visit to Jerry's weekend home outside of town, going so far as to bring a girl he knew from high school who works in a local bar along. This is the most pointed moment of lack of communication when Jerry has to say repeatedly that he wants Pupkin gone before Pupkin deigns to say that he can take a hint. Rejected by his idol, he cracks the scheme with Masha to kidnap Jerry and use Jerry's safety as leverage to get himself on to do the monologue on Jerry's show. It's here where we can't be sure as an audience whether any of this is happening. Is everything from the moment Pupkin leaves Jerry's summer home a fantasy? Is everything from his performance on a fantasy? Is it all real? These are interesting looking questions but they don't really matter to the film's central point.The point is that blurring of reality brought on by mass media. The implied relationships that are all based on airwaves instead of real interactions create a sense of fantasy that are unmoored from reality. Pupkin represents an extreme example of that, of course, but it's born from a real unhealthiness.Now, one of the film's great appeals is its sense of humor. This is uncomfortable stuff where people who can't communicate with each other talk past each other and the audience is screaming for someone to listen to someone else. And yet, it's still really funny when those breakdowns in communication happen, for a certain sense of humor. Pupkin just sitting right back down in the reception area after the production assistant tells him to, pretty much, go away is funny. Masha baring her soul to a tied up Jerry who doesn't move is funny. One thing that isn't terribly funny, though, is Pupkin's monologue.I remember the first time I saw this film and I was laughing pretty consistently through the monologue. Watching it now, I found it okay, better towards the end than the beginning, but still only okay. The audience laugh track helps sell it, but at the same time, we've seen Pupkin deliver a monologue to a large black and white image of an audience with the sound of canned laughter sweeping over the laugh track before. How real is it in that moment? I recalled the production assistant telling Pupkin that some of the one-liners weren't that strong, and I suddenly realized that she was right. Pupkin's comedy was okay, but it really wasn't ready for primetime. That realization made me question the entire reality of everything, especially since we don't see a single reaction to a single joke, we just watch Pupkin do his routine through a single, extended take.This movie is funny, uncomfortable, and puts a harsh lens up to celebrity culture. Anchored by de Niro's dedicated performance as a loser and Jerry Lewis' steady performance as himself rather than his well-known film persona, The King of Comedy is a gem from Scorsese's early 80s output.",

            "content": "'The King of Comedy' could be considered a lighter film than the two grueling previous collaborations between director Martin Scorsese and actor Robert De Niro, 'Taxi Driver (1976)' and 'Raging Bull (1980).' It's played as a sort of twisted black comedy, with De Niro demonstrating that his remarkable acting talent does boast a humorous side, something he would prove once again in such films as 'Analyse This (1999)' and 'Meet the Parents (2000).' Unfairly a commercial flop upon release, 'The King of Comedy' has since developed a loyal following of admirers, many citing it as being on par with Scorsese's very best.Rupert Pupkin (De Niro), a 34-year-old nobody from New York, has convinced himself that he is destined to become a famous stand-up comedian, the \"King of Comedy.\" He is obviously very infatuated with the idea, borderline psychotic. In his home, he has erected a makeshift television studio, complete with cardboard cut-outs of his hero, Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) and Liza Minnelli, with whom he has animated talk-show conversations. In show business, it is said, you must start from the bottom and work your way up. This isn't how Rupert Pupkin sees it: he wants to start from the very top! Jerry Langford, a popularity television talk-show host, assures Rupert during one meeting that he will consider allowing him on his show, but he only says this in an effort to get rid of him. Rupert takes Jerry at his word, repeatedly turning up at his place of work, stalking him and visiting his home, all under the delusion that he and Jerry are friends, and that his own stardom is within reach. When all this turns out to be in vain, Rupert resorts to more drastic methods.'The King of Comedy' is both hilarious and disturbing at the same time. We understand how potentially sick Rupert actually is, but we are sympathetic towards his aspirations, with De Niro opting to give his character a sort of bumbling stupidity, most apparent in the scene where he tries to hold out cue cards for Jerry to recite. Rupert's comedy act \u0096 when it eventually comes \u0096 is actually genuinely funny, a big surprise considering how we had been led to believe he was absolutely hopeless.Aside from De Niro and Lewis \u0096 who are both superb in this \u0096 another key character is Masha, a fellow reckless Langford fan, played by Sandra Bernhard. She is perhaps the more disturbed of the two. Whilst Rupert desires only to be a much-loved television personality, Masha harbours an extremely unhealthy obsession for Langford, quick to anger and prone to reckless actions. We know that this may prove interesting when she and Langford are left alone together, the latter tied firmly to a chair with copious amounts of masking tape.",

            "content": "Introducing Rupert Pupkin, stand-up comic and quintessential twerp, who in his own mind is a \"struggling young talent\" while the rest of the world sees only a 34-year old loser. In Robert De Niro's gaudy and unsettling portrait Rupert is, all at once, pathetic and abrasive, tenacious and untalented, and the one thing more embarrassing than his fantasies of fame and success are the lengths to which he pursues them, finally kidnapping his TV celebrity idol to secure a guest spot on a popular late night talk show.Contrary to popular opinion, this brilliant show-biz satire really is a comedy, albeit not one for every taste: it offers plenty of laughs, but it's the uneasy laughter that comes after recognizing ourselves in not very flattering portraits. The film was by no means a commercial success, and it's easy to see why: there's more than a touch of acid to the story of Rupert Pupkin, a character which at one time might have suited his co-star Jerry Lewis, who portrays the object of Rupert's obsession (television idol Jerry 'Langston') with cold, reclusive perfection.There's not a false note in the entire film, and the unflinching honesty (unusual for a comedy) may be what many people found so hard to take. Rarely, if ever, have the cult of stardom and the cold appeal of show business been satirized with such pinpoint accuracy: the film is both totally outrageous and all too plausible: every sad, pathetic daydream of the celebrity wannabe and ardent autograph hound is left intact, and the viewer can only writhe in pity and embarrassment. And if the joke appears bitter the punch line, at least (\"better a king for a day than a schmuck for a lifetime\u0085\") is inspired. But is the happy ending an ironic surprise or just another of Rupert's cracked show-biz daydreams? Credit Thelma Schoonmaker for another ace editing job, and Scorsese and De Niro together for the dubious tactic (according to one hopefully apocryphal production legend) of keeping Jerry Lewis uptight and in character with anti-Semitic jokes at his expense.",

DeNiro's performance is so cringe inducing, it's downright scary...he's a master at making an audience uncomfortable. The scene in which Rupert invades Langford's country house will make you queasy. Jerry Lewis is cast as Langford and, in his first role of substance in years, plays it straight --- he's icy, aloof and repulsed by Rupert's antics. As Masha, Rupert's rich and kooky best friend, Sandra Bernhard comes close to stealing the film and if she were in more scenes she probably would have.

            "content": "This is a wonderful film that anyone who's ever gotten a bit of a cold shoulder from a celebrity would like. Martin Scorsese uses remarkable degrees of tension as his paintbrush, making the emotions felt by Robert DeNiro's character so extreme, that you literally wince with anxiety when he oversteps his boundaries over and over again.Essentially, this movie looks at how to be successful in show business without really trying. Rupert Pupkin is an obsessive fan who's not only obsessed with Jerry Langford, the Carson-like host of his eponymous television show, but obsessed with getting a little fame himself. He doesn't want to waste time honing his bits at small clubs and working his way up, he just wants to do his act (the act which he's done a million times in the privacy of his own room and he believes to be solid) on The Jerry Langford Show as soon as possible. And so, with the help of fellow obsessor Sandra Bernhard, he kidnaps Langford in an effort to secure a spot, however fleeting, in national spotlights.Although found in the DRAMA section, \"The King Of Comedy\" is one of the damndest comedies I've ever seen. Rupert Pupkin's life, his habits, his desires, are all extremely funny. Because while some people might nod off during lunch to the fantasy of meeting a celebrity, Rupert takes his anxious wishes to action, going to ridiculous measures to make sure his rather intricate fantasy world (the fantasy world where he's a bigger star than Jerry, and he hangs out with Jerry on the weekends, etc.) doesn't come undone by the actual and very blunt rejection from Mr. Langford himself. Rupert just won't listen to anything anyone has to say unless it facilitates into re-affirming his fantasies. And it's this stubborn insanity/dedication that makes Pupkin (often misspelled and mispronounced) one of the great characters.This film is tight, fitting in as many angles of the nooks and crannies of Rupert Pupkin's crazy, crazy mind as possible with it's allotted running time. Scorsese doesn't fuss with doing anything extra to get his point across; he knows what is needed and he accomplishes it.Keep this in mind to rent next time you go to video store if you haven't seen it.",

            "content": "Perhaps due to its somewhat misleading title, visionary director Martin Scorsese's The King of Comedy has garnered a slew of different reactions, with surprisingly few positive ones. And perhaps this should not come as a surprise; the film is, without question, a difficult watch, and even more difficult to classify. Black comedy doesn't seem to fully capture the essence of the film, nor is it simply dramatic or comedic. It seems best to process the film as a portrait of a disturbingly deluded and obsessive individual and an examination of the darker underbelly of the glitzy exterior of celebrity culture. The film might at first seem a bizarre change of pace for director Scorsese, for those more accustomed to seeing prior works such as the visceral Raging Bull or Taxi Driver. But the more thought one invests into the production, the more sense Scorsese's involvement seems to make - in the end, for all of his slightly juvenile edge, comparisons between Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle and excruciating aspiring stand-up comic Rupert Pupkin are inescapable. Both are isolated and mostly socially inept men, who overcome their inability to fit in with society or achieve their aspirations of grandeur by climactic ethical lapses: Bickle turning to violence, Pupkin to kidnapping. As easy as it is to get lost behind the chuckle worthy boyish exterior and mannerisms, one can't quite ignore the note of raw desperation behind De Niro's gaudy grin and questionable moustache - a glint unquestionably similar to Bickle's. Scorsese once again thrives on exploring the dark nuances of human potential, this time turning over the archetype of the obsessive and slightly pathetic fan, and exposing the raw desperation to make an impact on the world in some shape or form. But for whatever reason, perhaps due to the static, mostly uneventful or unwatchable life of Pupkin himself, the film never really seems to take off, touching upon, but never quite embracing the true emotional impact of the character and lifestyle. Even the technical effects seem noticeably stunted - the mostly stationary, uninspired camera work and prominent lack of score seem very deliberate, as if to thrust into the audience's collective faces the painfully awkward moments, enhancing the squirm factor. Even so, deliberate or not, it's hard to embrace the film as well made when the initial reaction is such a feeling of distaste. It would seem a difficult task indeed, when even the inspired genius of Martin Scorsese has difficulties making a film about such an unwatchable man watchable. Similarly interesting, yet just as frustratingly underdeveloped is Scorsese's portrait of the bleak emptiness behind the flashy exterior of a life in show business, as lived by Jerry Lewis' semi-autobiographical performance as talk show host Jerry Langford. Langford is continually confronted by passionate fans, who never seem to know exactly what they want from the man once autographs have been signed - an interesting take on celebrity as a consumer commodity, and one in which humanity is quickly swallowed up. A one on one confrontation with a fan on the street results in Langford departing, with the fan vehemently wishing cancer upon in one of the film's most chilling scenes - Scorsese's bleak outlook is an unsettling one indeed, and the film's screenplay hits so many poignant notes, it is highly frustrating to not see such threads developed further. Once again, it is difficult to judge the merit of the cast's performances, seeing as the majority of their jobs were to portray strikingly untalented, or emotionally stunted individuals. It goes without saying that Robert De Niro unquestionably is the star of the show, and his Rupert Pupkin is a piece of work indeed - delusional, disconcertingly socially disconnected, and cheerfully determined, all just charismatic enough to keep the audience's attention while still repugnant enough to keep them suitably deterred. A noticeably subdued Jerry Lewis is an interesting presence, playing a role uncannily similar to that of his own life, leaving one left to wonder how much of the fictional Langford's flat, emotionless persona was based on fact. And Sandra Bernhard is painfully irritating yet chillingly effective as Pupkin's fellow obsessee, seemingly wanting to possess Langford's fictional persona as a commodity. While the film may not be one of Scorsese's most iconic works, and justifiably so, as the film always seems to stop short of fully exploring its emotional and thematic potential, the disconcerting accuracy of the unsettling content and De Niro's painfully inept yet fixated characterisation make the film worth a watch. Though the film may have the occasional comic moment, it is by no means a 'comedy' - nor a straight out drama, but instead an squirm inducing take on the less flattering aspects of celebrity worship and the all consuming draw for success. Much like Rupert Pupkin, while it may not be pretty to watch, the film sure is difficult to shake off, or leave behind.-8/10",

            "content": "Just how far will a person go in the single-minded, obsessive pursuit of fame, and are there limits or boundaries involved that are inviolable? Exactly where does one draw the line, and upon what must fame be based to be given validation?  Is it a matter of extraordinary talent, or is sensationalism alone part of the criteria?  Director Martin Scorsese addresses the matter and makes some observations and speculations about the cause and effect of fame in `The King of Comedy,' starring Robert De Niro as aspiring stand-up comedian Rupert Pupkin.  Obsessed with fame and the famous, Rupert's greatest treasure is a book of autographs he has collected, one page of which bears his own signature, possibly in anticipation of a future as reflected in his own mind's eye.  His immediate goal is to be a guest on the late night talk show hosted by Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), which he believes will catapult him to the pinnacle of notoriety.  The sad fact of the matter is that Rupert just isn't that clever, and he is decidedly not funny, despite hours spent in his room at home rehearsing his monologue.  His evenings are spent queuing up outside of Langford's theater with other fans and wannabes (many, sadly, like himself), waiting for Jerry to emerge.  Things suddenly take a turn for Rupert when one night, with an exceptionally aggressive crowd on hand, Jerry is mobbed while attempting to get to his car and Rupert comes to his rescue, getting Jerry safely into the car, along with himself.  And it's the beginning of a relationship that will prove to have a dramatic effect of the lives of both men. \tScorsese's film is something of a response to the criticism he received for his violent and somewhat controversial film, `Taxi Driver,' over the outcome of his antihero, Travis Bickle (played by De Niro).  This film is a character study, not only of the individuals involved, but of a society-- in this case a character in itself-- that allows fame for fame's sake, and perpetuates the problem through the irresolution of the masses.  On one hand, it's as if Scorsese is saying `What are you thinking?' while on the other, he's taking a step back, holding up a mirror and saying, `Go ahead, take a good look at yourselves!'  For it is no mere accident that drives Rupert to the extreme measures he ultimately employs to effect his goal. \tAs always, De Niro gives a performance that is impeccable.  In De Niro's skin, Rupert Pupkin comes alive, and every bit of his single-minded, simplistic nature is believable.  He's the guy who can't quite get a handle on things, but hasn't the mental wherewithal to realize it.  Nevertheless, he is harmless until provoked, whether it be in reality or in his own mind; a man of simple tastes but grandiose dreams that have a way of intersecting with his own version of reality.  And De Niro conveys is all and more with an uncanny grasp of the character, the likes of which few actors could manage with such depth and perception.  Also turning in an exemplary performance is Jerry Lewis, who so succinctly captures the whole `Steve Allen/Johnny Carson' persona, as well as that sense of what late night television is all about.  And though he received little notice for it at the time (or since, for that matter), this is possibly the best work he's ever done. \tThe supporting cast includes the lovely Diahnne Abbott (Rita), Sandra Bernhard (Marsha), Ed Herlihy (Himself), Lou Brown (Band Leader), Catherine Scorsese (Rupert's Mom), Liza Minelli (Herself), Shelley Hack (Cathy) and Margo Winkler (Receptionist).  A somewhat caustic wake-up call, `The King of Comedy,' with it's blend of humor and profound observations of human nature, packs a wallop without shedding any blood, as it were.  It's an entertaining, challenging film that works on a number of emotional levels, and is something of a minor classic in it's own right.  And-- thanks to De Niro-- Rupert Pupkin is a guy you're not likely to forget anytime soon. Another noteworthy milestone in the Scorsese/De Niro canon.  I rate this one 9/10.",

So, I have to give it a good but not great rating.Interestingly, despite being a stalker, DeNiro plays it as more naive than menacing. Which, given DeNiro's ability to be menacing, is a nice switch... I would have never seen that coming.There are also aspects that anticipate \"Requiem for a Dream\"... not sure if this was an influence or if I'm just seeing things, but I see some things that really connect the two in a variety of ways.

            "content": "Though 'The King of Comedy' stands on its own two feet (and quite well, I might add), it bares a striking resemblance to 'Taxi Driver'.Aside from the blatant Scorsese-De Niro connection, both films center on similar characters, though that is not to say they're identical. Whereas Travis Bickle's persona was built around loneliness, Rupert Pupkin's was built around obsession.However, each character has an inherent violence that bubbles underneath the surface. In 'Taxi Driver', Travis Bickle gives into the pressures mounting within and kills three people at the film's end. With 'The King of Comedy', however, Rupert Pupkin's violence never really erupts. You're always watching him, waiting for something to happen that never does. Acts that seems like they might be frightening and violent turn out to be rather comical and pathetic (i.e., the kidnapping of Jerry Langford). His self-important feelings of being a \"great\" stand-up keep his energies focused on his dream, so he's constantly occupied; with Travis Bickle, however, there was nothing and no one to keep him from going over the edge.Though Rupert claims Jerry Langford to be his idol, he really just wants to be bigger than Jerry. In Rupert's fantasy conversations with Jerry, Rupert is always the one in charge, while Jerry is always begging and telling Rupert how great he is. One fantasy sequence involves Rupert and a surprise marriage to a high school crush on the Jerry Langford show. Rupert's high school principal, who is now a justice of the peace, performs the ceremony and tells everyone how wrong he and all the bullies in high school were for picking on Rupert. What Rupert wants is vindication. He wants all those who once looked down on him to beg for forgiveness so that he can, in turn, look down on them.Toward the end of the film, when Rupert makes it on TV, his jokes aren't that funny, but that's not the point. The audience laughs. It has been trained to laugh. That's what audience's are supposed to do when a comedian comes on. Plus, if he's on TV, he must be good. Everyone at the bar, watching his performance, was not so much amused by the material as by the fact that Rupert made it on TV. He was a celebrity.The film closes much like 'Taxi Driver'. In these two films, both characters went to prison, only served part of their sentences, and received vindication upon their release. With Travis, he was once again paired with the woman he had obsessed over earlier. And, as for Rupert, he became a pop culture icon. Probably with his own obsessed following.'The King of Comedy' is one of Scorsese's best, despite its initial failure. It's truly a dark comedy with 90% of the emphasis on the word \"dark.\" De Niro gives a great performance. Coming off the success of his brutish role in 'Raging Bull', he is able to deftly switch over to a comical role, the type of guy that his character in 'Raging Bull' would have beat up. And Sandra Bernhard! Performing her role as an obsessive compulsive, manic depressive so well that she probably had doctors all over the country writing her prescriptions based on her performance.",

The issues displayed in this film have aged into a time where celebrity culture is at its peak, making the themes of this film hit deeper and make us as an audience re-evaluate the societal norms surrounding said celebrities.Robert De Niro absolutely smashes it as Rupert Pupkin in this film and convincingly delivers an amazing performance as the crazed lunatic, he was very uncomfortable to watch, even in scenes where he wasn't drastically threatening someone, just his mannerisms were creepy. It made you really feel how alone yet crazed this character is.Martin Scorsese's directing in this picture was amazing too, while I don't think this is his best from what I've seen, it's still pretty great!I did have to pause the film for 20 minutes around the 01:18:00 mark due to it being 2am and myself being ridiculously tired but I still managed to appreciate the rest of the film.Rupert's final conclusion was also mind boggling, someone as clearly crazed as himself, gets praised by the public and becomes a popular figure in the show-biz industry after his release from prison. This itself works as a demonstration of the society around us and some of its issues. I thought the ending was done brilliantly though, showing that Rupert really did win in the end.Jerry Lewis was also good as Jerry Langford, the paranoid yet stoic TV Host!Overall I think this was a pretty great movie!

            "content": "Once again, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro team up for another memorable film. I only saw this one because the Jerry Lewis telethon is coming in two weeks and always wanted to see Jerry in something other than his comedies; boy, was I surprised by this one.A story about how some people crave being a celebrity and others hate being a celebrity, The King Of Comedy features De Niro as Rupert Pupkin, an aspiring comic who is also a certified nutcase and positive thinker. Jerry Lewis is Jerry Langford, a Johnny Carson/Jay Leno/David Letterman clone who hosts the hottest variety show on T.V. He is so popular that people treat him as if he's Elvis and for someone who enjoys his privacy, it has made him somewhat bitter. Pupkin has a friend named Masha (played by Sandra Bernhard, a woman I find very attractive for some very strange reason) who is madly in love with Langford. Rupert also has an old flame named Rita (De Niro's then wife Diahanne Abbott) that he wants to impress.Rupert and Marsha scheme a plot in which Rupert will be able to try and get a chance to talk with Langford about giving him a chance on the show. Masha somehow gets into the limo and tries to rape Jerry but she's thrown out and Rupert is able to get in and have small talk with Jerry about getting on the show. He, in his positive thinking mode, believes that Langford will give him the chance and he actually tries to talk to Langford as if he's a buddy and attempt multiple visits to Langford's headquarters. After he's finally told that he is barred from entering the offices, he cons Rita into visiting the mansion that Langford lives in and he tries to pass himself off as a friend. After Langford warns him that he will be arrested the next time he tries any stunt like that again, Rupert and Masha do the last resort, they kidnap him and finally the two of them will get their wishes granted. Or will they not?Although TKOC is listed as a drama, I thought this movie was laugh out loud funny. Robert delivers one of the best performances ever on film. He plays Pupkin like a clown. Whether he's at a payphone, holding it up from others thinking that Langford will call him back, his multiple attempts to talk with Langford at his office or his love for blue suits he had me laughing like crazy for the first time in awhile. The movie's multiple Pupkin positive dream scenes in which all goes well for him are hilarious, too. He's a lovable nutcase much in the same vein as Dwight Schultz's H.M. Murdock was on \"The A-Team\". Jerry Lewis, as Langford, was incredible. The man can act. Just the scenes where he shows his rage were believable. He portrays a tired man, sick of his fame, fed up with all the hanger-ons and wanting an escape. Bernhard is delicious as the lovesick lunatic who delivers a temperature-rising performance; I don't care, this lady is a knockout. Even the others like Abbott and Shelley Hack do well. It's funny how the office employees at Langford's can continue to be so nice to him despite his constant harassment of them. Also, the freeze frame shown while the opening credits appear is a classic. All in all, one of the best films I've ever seen. It's rare that a film about comedians (even De Niro's stand-up act made me laugh) can be filled with sheer hilarity. This is a must-see film in the first order!",

Often compared to Taxi Driver, this 'black comedy' (on closer inspection not a comedy by any means) is one of the more genuinely sad films I've seen. Rupert Pupkin, played by Robert De Niro, is a wannabe comedian stuck in a dead end communications job. He desperately wishes he were Jerry Langford, his idol and a comedy show host. He manages to meet Langford, but when he is brushed off he devises a more drastic and immediate way to get his routine on the Jerry Langford show. It's very much like Taxi Driver in a lot of ways - Rupert and Travis Bickle share ultimate loneliness, although Rupert tries to cover his up with laughs, while Travis builds his existence around it. They both unsuccessfully attempt to make connections with the outside world, which fail because they really are living in a dream world (Rupert more literally than Travis). While Travis turns his terrible pain into violence against himself and strangers, Rupert tries to turn his into laughter. This is most notable in his actual routine that he does - it's full of jokes, but they only serve as a shabby cover for an ocean of sadness. I guess the most glaring similarity are the very ends of both movies, which would give too much away to tell.",

            "content": "\"The King of Comedy\" is a knockout dark comedy that remains quite relevant in our current celebrity-worshipping North American pop culture. It shows what happens as Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro), a 34 year old hopeless nerd, is desperate for fame and fortune. A struggling stand-up comic, he tries and tries to endear himself to the nations' # 1 comedian / talk show host, Jerry Langford (a well cast, and excellent, Jerry Lewis). When the celebrity ultimately gives him the big brush-off, Rupert and his unhinged friend Masha (Sandra Bernhard, in an impressive breakthrough performance) abduct Langford.Working from an engaging script by Paul D. Zimmerman, master filmmaker Martin Scorsese is able to say a lot about the nature of celebrity. Even today, we do have a climate where people can be famous for no really good reason, yet still milk the situation for everything that it's worth. It also makes you think about peoples' priorities, and misplaced confidence in whatever \"talent\" they possess. As we can see from Ruperts' big moment in the spotlight, his material just isn't that great. (Although I personally got a chuckle out of the line, \"her alcohol contained 2% blood\".)It's all enacted with a fair amount of realism, a healthy amount of attention paid to the real-life machinations of the talk show world (both Johnny Carson's and Merv Griffin's series were used as influences), and some absolutely great performances by De Niro and Lewis. The supporting cast has no slackers, either: Bernhard is clearly relishing her role, De Niro's lovely then-wife Diahnne Abbott is appealing as a bartender whom he tries to romance, real life 'Tonight Show' producer Frederick De Cordova is solid as the producer of Langfords' fictional show, and various real life stars have funny cameos as themselves. Members of The Clash have bits as \"street scum\"; Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (in her film debut) is an extra in the opening crowd scene.Darkly humorous without ever being too, too outrageous, \"The King of Comedy\" is one of those films that's continued to look good and resonate, almost 40 years later.Eight out of 10.",

It works so incredibly well. You can see Jerry Lewis visibly uncomfortable as an actor and Scorcese's process and it is perfect for the role and it is just too REAL. Deniro has never been better.

It was a real pleasure for me to discover this movie when I did, given Bobby D's present tendency to repeat himself over and over. I'd recommend that you give 'The King of Comedy' a look just to see what a mesmerizing actor De Niro once was.The movie is a comedy so dark it almost isn't a comedy. It stares unflinchingly at celebrity, those who have it and those who aspire to it. In 1983 the idea of crazed stalkers hunting down celebrities must have seemed new and bordering on absurd. Jerry Lewis is terrific as late night talk show host Jerry Langford, who's fame doesn't prevent him from seeming more miserable than Rupert at times.Sandra Bernhard is Rupert's equally disturbed female counterpart, Masha. If anything she plays her role even more convincingly than De Niro, though it doesn't call for the same amount of development.I don't think anyone seeing 'The King of Comedy' for the first time could help but be surprised at the lack of notice it gets. If it's not the best of the Scorsese/De Niro pairings then it's close. In short, both the movie and Rupert's stand-up act are funny, but not ha-ha funny.",

Rupert clearly has a few problems mentally, as does his friend and accomplice.The movie was made by Martin Scorsese, who works very well with Robert, as they have made numerous movies together in the past... but again this was not one of his best.Roberts accomplice was a lady named Masha, who is a massive Jerry fan and is obsessed with being with him... so when they kidnap him she has everything she wants.

            "content": "'The King of Comedy' is a black-comedy film directed by the great Martin Scorsese and it is a product of the famous Scorsese-De Niro collaboration which is in itself a separate film category in the books of many a film enthusiast. Robert De Niro stars as the immensely weird and idiosyncratic Rupert Pupkin, a daydreamer of the highest order. He spends his life stalking celebrities and collecting their autographs. On a chance encounter, he finds an opportunity to talk to the very famous celebrity talk show host Jerry Langford. This random encounter establishes the idea in Rupert's head that Jerry is highly impressed with him and will allow him to appear on a separate slot in his talk show, even though he has no experience whatsoever. So he starts stalking Langford and his office.This reminded me of two other films namely 'Taxi Driver' and 'Misery'. The 'Taxi Driver' connection comes from the similarities that I found between the characters Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin. Both these characters are the product of post-Vietnam and post-Watergate America of the 1970s. Both live in New York. Both belong to a restless society trying to start again after massive events. Both are complete outsiders. Both have spent a lot of time in complete solitude and this loneliness has driven them to a psychological state of delusion where they find it difficult to separate reality from their imaginations and daydreams. But both share an undying and overwhelming urge to make their presence felt. Both want to do something that will make them famous. The scenes in 'Taxi Driver' where Travis is getting ready in his cosy apartment bear a striking resemblance with the scenes in 'The King of Comedy' where Rupert in his head is participating in a talk show with cardboard cut outs of Jerry Langford and other celebrities. While Travis's scenes are a bit more adversarial and Rupert's scenes have a sense of humour to them, they both convey the extent to which both these characters are mentally deranged. They live in their own palace made with the bricks of their own delusions. When push comes to shove, I think Rupert can be as violent and dangerous as Travis. They both resort to extreme measures as a response to getting rejected by people they admire.I thought this film has a thematic connection with 'Misery' as I think both films explore the relationship between a celebrity and a fan. Both films show that the admiration that a fan has for his/her hero can sometimes turn into an unhealthy obsession. The distinction is that Annie in 'Misery' genuinely admired Paul for his writing, while I don't think Rupert really ever admired Jerry for his comedy. He looked up to Jerry as a role model not for his comedy, but for his fame. In one particular scene we find that Rupert has kept a collection of autographs of various celebrities belonging to diverse professions. So this shows that Rupert really wasn't interested in them as artists, he liked and envied their fame. This relentless urge to be famous has its roots in his past as it is hinted that he was bullied during his school days. The encounter with Jerry just made Rupert transfixed about him in particular and forget about the other celebrities. His delusional mind led him to believe that he and Jerry had a 'real relationship' and Jerry was going to give him an opportunity in his show. This theme of being fame-hungry was relevant back in 1982 and its relevance has only increased with every passing year especially with the advent of the internet and the reality shows.This is a fantastically directed film as you would expect from Scorsese. Like a great black-comedy, it is extremely funny, but we can't help but feel a bit disturbed while laughing. Scorsese uses Paul D. Zimmerman's script and leaves his stamp all over it. The film is beautifully edited. There are scenes where we go back and forth between the reality and Rupert's imaginary world and the editing is seamless. The similarities between Travis and Rupert made this a film with a protagonist who is troubled and deluded and when it comes to films with troubled protagonists, you can't get anyone better than Martin Scorsese to make it.I think 'The King of Comedy' is an acting masterclass. Robert De Niro gives another example of his versatility as a method actor. This was a character different to all other characters that he had played prior to this film and he again completely became the character of Rupert. I saw Rupert Pupkin in the film and not De Niro. Instead of the machismo and tough guy mannerisms, we see De Niro play a character with an awkwardness which exuded humour as well as a disturbing aftertaste in the mouth. Jerry Lewis is absolutely brilliant. He is known for the exaggerated, slapstick humour. But in this film he plays the character of Jerry Langford in a very understated manner and makes the character very believable. Another actor that deserves extreme admiration is Sandra Bernhard. The character of Masha like Rupert is infinitely delusional and mentally unstable. She is an outsider and thinks the best way to get society's approval and counter her lack of self esteem is to attract and seduce celebrities. Sandra is absolutely dynamic and like De Niro is funny, but still very disturbing. Even minor characters in the film are funny and memorable like the receptionist in Langford's office or the Asian butler,etc. I think 'The King of Comedy' is another Scorsese masterpiece, but sadly it doesn't have the same popularity as some of his other films. It has great acting. It has a very interesting and peculiar protagonist. It makes a social commentary about the relationship between a fan and a celebrity. It also addresses the need that some people have to pursue fame at any cost. Highly Recommended.",

He fantasizes he is a wildly popular comedian while in fact he is inept, unfunny, grim, and embarrassingly persistent. His real world is bleak and lonely, but his mental disturbance is such that reality and fantasy interplay in his life to the point that he can no longer distinguish between the two. Finally he steps over the edge and then the movie takes a dark twist.This role was surely written for De Niro and it is hard to imagine who else could have played his part. Lewis is outstanding as the jaded TV-show host who has had just about enough of the phony world of show-biz. Lewis doesn't have a funny line or a gag in the entire film.

Yes, its great acting, but its in my opinion a thing that destroys the movie, to follow a main character which is annoying and boring.The photography is nice and the remaster looks great, the movie catches the 80s look and feel of New York well.It may be worth seeing out of academic interest, but seems entertaining only to masochists.",

            "content": "Released two years after the senseless murder of John Lennon, Martin Scorsese's 'The King Of Comedy' is an investigation into the dark side of fame. You might think it wonderful be to be famous. But along with the money, prestige, power ( and sex ), it unfortunately also brings stalkers out of the woodwork, such as 'Rupert Pupkin' ( Robert De Niro ). The oily-haired, moustached Pupkin wants desperately to be a comedian, not just any old comedian either, but the 'King Of Comedy'. He idolises the Johnny Carson-styled chat show host 'Jerry Langford' ( Jerry Lewis ) so much he dreams of being asked to take over his nightly show. After cornering Jerry in a limousine, he begs his advice. The host tells him to start at the bottom with night club appearances and the like. Rupert does not heed his words, and rather like today's reality show contestants, sets about trying to get to the top by the quickest route imaginable ( not letting a minor thing like a lack of talent get in the way ). When a tape of his stand-up act is roundly rejected by Jerry's secretary ( Shelley Hack ), he enlists the equally insane 'Masha' ( Sandra Bernhard ) to kidnap Jerry off the street. The ransom demand? A three-minute spot on 'The Jerry Langford Show'...Written by Paul D.Zimmerman, this is a marvellous film, disturbing and funny in equal measure. The 'Pupkin' character has much in common with 'Billy Liar', created by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall. Both are nobodies who dream of better things, the latter wants to be a comedian's scriptwriter while the former aspires to being the comedian full stop. Pupkin has life-size cardboard cut-outs of Jerry and Liza Minnelli in his bedroom, which he talks to as though he were on television. In one of the film's best scenes, he does his act in front of a wall-sized photograph of an appreciative audience.De Niro is magnificent, giving one of his best performances as the crazed 'Rupert'. Critics who for years had written off Jerry Lewis were forced to eat their words after seeing this film. Diahnne Abbott is 'Rita', the barmaid he wants desperately to impress, but succeeds only in repelling. Pupkin invites her to spend the weekend at Jerry's country house. The thing is, Jerry issued no such invitation, it was all in Rupert's mind. Sandra Bernhard is terrifying ( and put the wind up Bob Monkhouse when she appeared on his '80's B.B.C. show ). A surprisingly good performance comes from Shelley Hack. I say surprisingly because she was in 'Charlie's Angels' only a few years before.The film can be confusing at times - the fantasy sequences are interlaced so tightly with the reality its often hard to distinguish between them, but repeated viewings soon sort out the problem. The ending is the cherry on the cake. After viewing this on Channel 4 back in the mid-'80's, I wondered if someone would copy Pupkin by abducting Terry Wogan!",

            "content": "It's difficult to completely pan \"The King of Comedy,\" but it's also nearly impossible to recommend. This ambivalence derives foremost from its legendary collaborators. De Niro and Scorsese helped to creatively reinvigorate Hollywood in the 1970s with \"Mean Streets\" and \"Raging Bull,\" and it seems impossible that such an illustrious team could have managed so profound a misstep. And yet despite its talent and its ambition,\"The King of Comedy\" is nonetheless an artistic failure. De Niro stars as Rupert Pupkin, a manic, unstable New Yorker who fixates on stardom as a comedian as his path toward redemption from obscurity and loneliness. Pupkin has little talent and even less charm, but has an insistent perky patter that he uses to overwhelm others into seeing him as the giant talent he imagines himself to be. Jerry Lewis plays Jerry Langford, a Johnny Carson-like talk show host that Pupkin fixates on as a means of starting his comedy career. Sandra Bernhard plays a psychotic, obsessed Langford fan who has built a vaguely defined friendship with Pupkin over their shared Langford fixation.The theme of the film is the power of fame and celebrity in American culture and its perverse effects on those who seek it and those who have it. But the story never quite commits to how it wants to present that message. An uncomfortable mix of satire, drama, and joyless comedy undermine the message. In \"Network,\" the sheer vicious scale of the satire succeeds in communicating a similar premise about fame, mass media, and culture. But \"King\" shuffles along never quite rising to any great height, only succeeding making the viewer uneasy and ambivalent. De Niro does an admirable job portraying Pupkin, but never demonstrates any depth to the character other than a type of monochromatic manic naivet\u00e9. Bernhard's performance is loud, obnoxious, and narrow, giving all this signs of being almost entirely improvised. Unfortunately, instead of improvisation giving her character an immediacy and freshness it often is mere shouting and raving within a very narrow compass. Lewis in a very quiet and subtle way gives the strongest performance as Langford, a man trapped by his fame, who in many ways is as lonely as Pupkin, despite his achievement of everything Pupkin longs for.",

            "content": "This is indeed a great film. People are correct when they say that it's Martin Scorsese's underrated masterpiece, and it's because \"The King of Comedy\" is very different from Scorsese's other films. While \"Taxi Driver\", \"Goodfellas\" and \"The Departed\" are all gritty, urban dramas, this movie is an urban comedy that's not quite as gritty. It shows New York mostly in the light of day, and puts a greater focus on the American desire to be in the spotlight. In Scorsese's other movies, the ambition of the main characters is more pursuit of happiness by means of respect or escaping loneliness, but not by way of fame and instant gratification.It's also a very different film for Robert De Niro because he plays such a pathetic man, and he plays him so well! People are usually used to seeing him play characters who are as tough as nails, be it a gangster, a cop, or a stalker. He plays a stalker in this film, but he plays him in an effective way where you're thinking, \"You idiot\".I'll always remember the part of the movie where his demo tape is rejected by Jerry Lewis's executives, and he wanders into the television network's work area only to be chased down by security. It is just unbelievable to me that someone that age (late 30s I'm guessing) would be so naive and inconsiderate, but I know it happens in real life.I've run into a few celebrities myself before, in a way similar to De Niro's character first meeting Jerry Lewis's character, except for the fact that I didn't sneak into their limo. I've met a few spontaneously while in New York a few times, and I've always tried to be as respectful as possible. Watching this movie is a perfect example of the celebrity dehumanization that occurs through the eyes of some fans who don't know better. It's also a great way for people who are not famous to know how NOT to act when encountering celebrities.If there was one thing this film could have done better, I think it probably would have been more firmly establishing De Niro's character. I mean, we know his motives, but I find it very hard to believe that he lives with a mother who is completely oblivious to his son's dreams. After all, he had to have moved those cardboard cutouts downstairs while someone was noticing. Also, did his character even have a job, or some sort of history of employment? He had to have if the character is in his late 30's.Otherwise, the movie was very good. Unsettling at parts, but very good. It's also interesting that Scorsese made a movie that's rated PG. That is still very much a rarity in the Scorses catalog.",

And neither of us are really Jerry Lewis fans, so it was just as well we didn't stay for him.Yes, DeNiro's character was supposed to be a mope. But even a mope should give the viewer a reason to take interest in him. DeNiro didn't look like a mope, he looked like a hack actor trying to play a mope.

Rupert Pupkin is an eerie creation, not coz he represents the worst side of celeb fandom but also the best.Played by De Niro, it doesn't take long for him to get on the viewers' nerves which is exactly what the motive was. And he finely articulates Pupkin's delusional mind & relentless persistence. Jerry Lewis delivers a highly understated input as a late-night TV host and his performance is in apt contrast with De Niro's energetic act.Overall, The King of Comedy has only grown more relevant with time and makes more sense today than it did at back then, and is an interesting example of celeb worship gone extreme. Steered by Scorsese's solid direction and strengthened by strong performances from its cast, The King of Comedy isn't refined but it sure is stimulating. Worth a shot.",

            "content": "After Robert DeNiro had teamed up with Martin Scorsese on films like 'Mean Streets' and 'Taxi Driver' it was hard to see anything the pair of them worked on failing. Then came 'King of Comedy.' I think that it's unfair to call it a 'fail,' but it certainly didn't set the Box Office alight in the same way their previous collaborations did. At least it has slowly picked up more of a cult audience over the years, but, perhaps most pertinently, it seems more 'of its time' today than in the early eighties when it was actually released. This time round DeNiro plays Rupert Pupkin - the deliberately oddly-named man who lives (basically) in his mother's basement, where he rehearses for the day he becomes a rich and famous stand-up comedian. So sure that he'll make it big time that he constantly stalks a genuine celebrity, Jerry Langford (played effortlessly by Jerry Lewis who basically plays himself throughout), acting like the two of them are old friends. Along the way Pupkin is 'aided' by another of Jerry's stalkers, this time a woman (played by Sandra Bernhard). The two of them, despite not getting on as they're both competing for a place in Jerry's life, team up in order to both get what they want out of their 'friend/lover.'Perhaps one reason it didn't resonate with audiences at the time was that, for a film with the word 'comedy' in the title, it's not - technically - that funny. It's not supposed to be a laugh-a-minute chuckle-fest. If it is any sort of comedy then it's definitely 'black comedy.' You'll feel a sense of sadness for our 'hero' as he's more pathetic than heroic. He can't see what we - the audience - can. Today we live in a world where you can become 'famous' from the comforts of your own home (or mother's basement in Pupkin's case) simply by becoming a 'Youtube star.' Back in the early eighties I'm guessing that not everyone wanted to be famous. Okay, so most people have the odd daydream about being a film star/rock star/astronaut/whatever, but it didn't seem to be until the millennium (perhaps when reality TV took off in a big way?) when everyone decided that fame was within their grasp (and without much talent or effort needed to achieve it!).'King of Comedy' shows how just because you WANT to become famous and think that it's your 'right' because of your 'talent,' you actually need a little more than sheet desire and self-belief. Yes, luck will always play a part in anyone's rise to the top, but what we have here is more of a sad tale of a man who's dream outweighs his talent. If you know what you're getting then you'll definitely find an excellent little piece that is more relevant today than it ever was. Robert DeNiro is still regarded as one of the greatest actors of our generation and it's films like this that will always play a big part in his rich history - even if they weren't quite appreciated at the time.",

The title \"The King of Comedy\" had me thinking the Scorsese film would be a biopic of some talk show host I had never heard of. Instead, the film is an off-beat character study which kept making me feel embarrassed for Robert De Niro's character, Rupert Pupkin, but in a good way.I'm sure we all have fantasies of meeting our one true hero, and we imagine a conversation with him/her will go really well. Rupert Pupkin has this fantasy about his hero, Jerry Langford, a famous comedian played by Jerry Lewis, but this fantasy takes a quick turn to more of an expectation for Pupkin. After one encounter with Langford, Pupkin, who still lives with his mother while he is in his 30s I believe, constantly harasses the people who work for Langford because he believes Langford has become his friend and has agreed to let Pupkin appear on the show, which couldn't be further from the truth.During the course of the movie I found myself feeling embarrassed/awkward for Pupkin since he does so many things which made me internally say \"come on, man, don't do THAT.\" In this sense the film reminded me of feelings I constantly have when I watch \"The Office;\" well, at least feelings I have when Steve Carell plays Michael Scott and makes things super awkward for the people around him. De Niro's performance as Pupkin was so on-the-spot for this quirky and awkward character, proving he has a great range in his acting ability since he often plays \"tough guys\" like Jake La Motta, Al Capone, and the younger Vito Corleone in \"The Godfather Part II.\"I feel that one mentally ill character was enough for this film, though in hindsight I guess De Niro's counterpart lady friend was essential to the film. There are scenes with her towards the end of the film, however, that make her appear to be abnormal \"just because,\" whereas De Niro's character is abnormal out of a strong passion for his image as a comedian and out of a need of approval from Jerry Langford and his love interest, Rita.Certainly not one of Scorsese's best films, but then again Scorsese has so many movies that I don't believe I've even seen a third of his filmography yet. I'd still recommend this film because it is a nice change of pace from the typical dark drama which Scorsese often directs.",

The real revelation is the performance of Jerry Lewis.His best work usually came with others directing rather than himself behind the camera,and with one of the world's best filmmakers,Martin Scorsese at the helm,this is possibly the best of his career.There's none of the familiar exaggerated mugging on display here,just a refreshingly underplayed,even subtle performance with facial expressions which tell a thousand stories.Had Lewis worked more with other directors in earlier films,his career may have been far more distinguished than it turned out;this was his first film in over a decade after years of critical and public indifference to his overbearing comic style.There are very funny sequences around(especially De Niro's imaginary meetings with Lewis,where he's told how 'brilliant' he is.The reality is totally different of course!),but most of the film is rather disturbing,like De Niro's character,and especially Sandra Bernhard,who also gives an outstanding performance.There's even an effective brief performance from Shelley Hack,normally the blandest of bland pretty actresses,as a secretary who tries to gently persuade De Niro he's simply not good enough,but to no avail.All in all,a film definitely ahead of it's time,it's mordant,biting satire rather too hard too take at the time,and perhaps not entirely truthful then but certainly now.Here in the UK,90% of the time,we're treated to stories on all media about tedious,insomnia-inducing nonentities(Jordan,Jodie Marsh,Abi Titmuss,Kerry Katona,etc...the list is interminable)which is read or watched by addicted millions with nothing better to do.Maybe those reading or watching the above will soon become famous themselves.Watch this outstanding film and see how the sublimely ridiculous,unpleasant and talent-free get there.It's so accurate.",

Pacino is excellent in certain films such as the first two \u0091Godfathers' and the one all Pacino fans harp on about \u0091Scarface'. But De Niro's performances, not necessarily his films, are more varied and yet so consistent. For a true measurement of the gulf in talent between these two,watch \u0091Heat'. Pacino spends the whole movie needlessly bellowing at the top of his lungs.Anyway, in regards to this film, this is De Niro's best performance to date. There has been so many incredible performances as a variety of different characters, from the villains he is known best for in \u0091Raging Bull', \u0091Cape Fear' and \u0091Taxi Driver' to breath taking realisations in \u0091Awakenings', \u0091Heat' and \u0091The Deer Hunter'. Yet it is this portrayal as man who has such a misguided interpretation of reality that stands out as his greatest achievement.The film itself is a near masterpiece and it is scandalous how it was not received well. Barely anybody is aware this film exists and that is so hard to believe considering just how good it is. It invites the audience to laugh at how Rupert Pupkin tries persistently to get his foot in the door at Jerry Lewis' studio. But it is also makes for uncomfortable viewing as De Niro's performance is so chillingly realistic you can't help but feel for him and you're just as desperate for him to succeed as Pupkin himself.\nNow , honestly Pacino fans, could he ever  pull anything like this off?",

            "content": "The question \"how far will you go for fame?\" sounds like a tagline best suited for the movie poster for a dramatic thriller, but Martin Scorsese turns that idea into a satire of sorts in \"The King of Comedy.\"Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is an aspiring comedian who worships late-night TV personality Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) and wants nothing in this world but stand-up spot on Jerry's show. After managing to finally meet his hero and receive a half-hearted promise to take a listen to Rupert's act, Rupert finds himself getting the runaround, but instead of backing down he continues to up his tactics\u2014drastically.The first big choice Scorsese makes (and ultimately what defines the quality of the film) is that we don't get to hear any of Rupert's stand-up. Given his desperation, lack of social graces and the fact that he lives with his mother at age 37 suggests he's a very persistent yet likely unfunny comic, but that's all we get. Scorsese wants to focus on a comedian's arduous climb out of obscurity, not whether or not Rupert is funny enough to deserve his big break. On the heels of his collaborations with Scorsese on \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Raging Bull,\" De Niro gets to flex his comic muscles, or at least his quirky ones. Rupert is a bit out of his mind, but in the delusional sense, not the Travis Bickle sense. He's written with such ignorant charisma and the fact that he's nearly 40 suggests he has a few screws loose, as no one sane his age would have such determination despite Jerry and his people's clear indications that they want nothing to do with him.His crazy is only matched by Sandra Bernhard as Masha, a woman scarily obsessed with Jerry. She ratchets up the cuckoo to 11 whenever she steps into the frame and her presence is so shrill that you really start to feel for Jerry and other celebrities his character embodies. Neither the famous nor the not-famous are made out to be in the wrong here.The jumps Paul D. Zimmerman writes between reality and Rupert's imagination as well as Scorsese's choice to not provide any indication through editing that there's a switch from one to the other really puts you in the shoes of a dreamer. Anyone who's dreamed of being famous has imagined some big moment in their head, and in this case Rupert has pictured what it would be like to appear on the Jerry Langford Show thousands of times. Even if you don't identify with Rupert's tactics, you identify with his dream.Eventually, as an audience we get to the point where we start to withdraw from Rupert because we don't respect that he's not willing to work his way up like any artist trying to make it in entertainment. Even after a civil exchange between him and one of the show's producers in which she gives him some feedback, he still insists that Jerry will just put him on the show. It's not until Rupert gets desperate and puts his illegal plan to action that we begin to see the point of the film and respect Rupert more despite his crazy.\"The King of Comedy\" is a smart and honest portrayal of what someone will do for fame, albeit an off-beat one. In the wake of two great Scorsese-De Niro collaborations, it unfortunately gets overlooked due to its simplicity. That might be so, but it doesn't make the message of following your dreams any less true.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out moviemusereviews.com",

He gets rejected, kicked out each time, and at the end he sees no choice but to kidnap the man he sees as his teacher. It tooks a weird turn; however, it makes sense, this was his choice, and he was not afraid to do the extreme to get what he wants.Overall, it is a good movie 8/10, and not the kind of movie that you can see everywhere.Sidenote: This movie is very similar to the movie \"nighcrawler\", or at least that is how I see it. The plots seem similar, there are two men who is ready to do absolutely anything to get the job they want. They are both ready to do non-familiar ways to get the job done, and both movies have the same uniqueness and anomaly. If you liked this movie, I recommend you to watch nightcawler as well.",

            "content": "I first came across this movie when I was casually watching a Reaction & Review video of it on YouTube. It was a channel that I trusted because of the incredibly honest and serious reviews given to the movies it covers. I believed the praise given to this movie and grew curious to give it a watch. Luckily, I found a full version on YouTube.This movie gave me an insight of the \"dark side\" of fame, how it affects celebrities and how their fans attempt to interact with them. It felt like an hour and forty minute long survival guide for people who want to be in showbiz (which may or may not frighten them to the point where they decide to change career paths) and a guide demonstrating how not to be an obsessed super fan and how not to get famous the illegitimate way.It is also one of those movies where it mixes in between reality and fantasy and makes a \"guessing game\" out of it - if you know what I mean. Black Swan for example, sort of does the same \"guessing game\" technique but in this movie, it is not in the slightest bit tragic. It's similar to daydreaming about a scenario and imagining all of the things you wished had happened in real life - and becoming a Number One comedian, featuring as a guest on a popular talk show and being best friends with said talk show's popular host is one of the many examples (there are even a couple of scenes where Rupert is acting out conversations in his mind and out loud).As a lot would point out after the first viewing, I felt a little lost halfway through up to the end, which I thought was a positive.This movie had me thinking about all of my favourite celebrities and imagining them going through the exact same position (except getting kidnapped). Although I have never planned to do this, it has put me off the thought of hassling one of my favourite celebrities for good.On the same day I first watched this movie, it remained stuck in my mind for hours until I forced myself to re-watch it a second time that day, and I felt glad doing so. Speaking of which, since I am writing a review of this movie, I feel like re-watching it again!!",

            "content": "At first I thought I was going to watch a tragic character......but the truth is I was pleasantly surprised. Instead of a sombre look at the consequences of being too naive for your own good in a cruel world, this movie showed a rare up-lifting instance where childlike faith, determination and self-esteem is rewarded rather than punished.I really didn't expect that, seeing how many times people working for Jerry's show called our protagonist anything but his real name. I had all reasons to think that I'm going to be drowned by a sea of Fremdscham, feeling only pity for the poor guy who is on his own path to destruction. So glad I was wrong.\nII felt so genuinely gleeful when Robert De Niro's character, Rupert Pupkin, later said ''Better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime.''I believe I've just witnessed one of the greatest and most up-lifting personal victory ever put on screen. Combined with some great comedy, an intelligent script and an incredible performance by the legendary Robert De Niro, this movie certainly makes it in my top 20 ever, even if I don't have one for moment.Maybe a slight improvement on the conclusion of Martha's character and Rita's reaction seeing Rubert on TV would have been welcomed but not a big flaw for me.A 9,9 out of 10 from me.",

            "content": "I consider myself a fan of Martin Scorsese and \"The King of Comedy\" has been a movie i overlooked far too long. But finally i caught it on TV a while ago. And i'm very happy i did.The movie itself feels like a bizarre mix between exceptionally dark comedy and drama. Robert DeNiro's character is both pathetic and admirable at the same time and really shows why DeNiro used to be considered such a great actor (i think his latest performances have been too much auto-pilot). And the acting is the first part of this movie that really makes the whole thing fly. Both DeNiro and Jerry Lewis are excellent as the wannabe and the star. Also Sandra Bernhard is memorable as a stalker who has completely lost it.What surprised me the most, and was the second part of what made this movie fly, is that it's almost more relevant today than in 1983. Without ruining the ending i can say that it elaborates on the machinations of fame and the media-intense society we live in today. With reality-shows on every channel and enough degradation on screen to go around, it feels like today more than ever fame is more important than what you're famous for. Which makes this movie not only a show of great acting or a dark comedy masterpiece, but also raises some thoughts about the times we live in. It feels like an oddity in Scorseses production, but a great oddity.I rate it 7/10.",

Scorsese uses the medium of excruciating farce to drag from us a mixture of deep embarrassment and disgust at the world in which Rupert Pupkin sees his life opportunities. The fact that he succeeeds is the deeply depressing point of the film, and by extension the depressing thing about the American capitalistic enterprise. De Niro captures the pathetic and absurd nature of one mans dream so perfectly. What a performance. It has a similar effect to watching the equally brilliant Ricky Gervais as David Brent in \"The Office\" Like touching an open sore, your reaction is to turn away, shut your eyes and splutter disgust.

He keeps trying and trying to see the host of the show (Jerry Lewis, in an uneven part), but keeps failing miserably.

What follows is a messy kidnapping, silly cue cards and DeNiro's shot at the big-time. Daydreams by DeNiro's character are more confusing than funny as it is difficult to identify fantasy and reality in the film many times. DeNiro's enthusiastic performance almost makes the movie work anyway, but Scorsese's self-indulgence and the lack of ample support make \"The King of Comedy\" one of the more disappointing films of recent memory. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",

In case you're wondering, the appearances on these shows are often paid in advance, and all the comedy, wackiness and casual interaction is essentially planned, or subject to censorship. When Rupert is politely rejected, he persists to bother the shows famous host, and then kidnaps him in order to set up an on air appearance as ransom. His actual routine isn't very funny, but it IS a damning list of the frailties, health issues and classism that trouble mainstream society, a reality that wasn't examined in the self-censoring world of 1980s mainstream TV, and still isn't for the most part.The King of Comedy is a punk-era masterpiece; its revisionist, self-aware, well written and deserves all the critical acclaim its received elsewhere.

            "content": "`The King of Comedy', which is possibly director Martin Scorsese's most underrated film, asks a simple question:  What makes people famous, talent or opportunity?  In `The King of Comedy', the nebbish Rupert Pupkin (brilliantly played by Robert De Niro), an aspiring but decidedly unfunny stand-up comedian, decides it's his lack of opportunities that are holding him back from becoming the star that he so desperately wants to be.  He decides that by becoming a guest on the Jerry Langford Show, he'll be able to become famous.  Through a series of events -- some accidental, some deliberately contrived by Pupkin -- he meets Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), and begins to put a plan into motion to actually appear as a guest on the show.. Rupert Pupkin is the driving force behind `The King of Comedy', and he's perhaps Mr. De Niro's most effective portrayal of a lunatic . . . simply because he's so believable.  Pupkin understands to a degree that he's odd, but he doesn't understand that he's also dangerous.  Unlike other madmen played by De Niro (Max Cady of `Cape Fear, or Travis Bickle of `Taxi Driver', Pupkin isn't able to get what he wants through strength or intimidation -- he's too much of a wimpy loser to do anything like that. Instead, he beats people down with persistence, beating people over the head with single-minded doggedness again and again until he gets his way.  He's willing to do whatever it takes to turn his fantasy world into something real, and the matter-of-fact way in which he goes about this is funny, scary, and uncomfortably realistic.  Jerry Lewis puts in a nice turn as well as the talk-show host Jerry Langford, a man who starts out as being something of a paranoid, fan-hating snob . . . but after meeting Rupert Pupkin, Langford's paranoia suddenly becomes very sensible.  After watching this film, I found myself wishing that Jerry Lewis had taken on more serious roles like this one -- his portrayal of Langford is very engaging, understated, and quite good. \nBut it's the character of Rupert Pupkin that defines this black, edgy comedy.  He is an unforgettable character, one of the best ever played by Robert De Niro.  Pupkin alone makes `The King of Comedy' a truly admirable, thought-provoking film.  It's another terrific collaboration between De Niro and Scorsese. A-",

I even think that his performance here is one of the convincing things for him to nab the role in The Fan (1996). It's nice to watch this movie, one of Martin Scorsese's little hyped-about works. But for an entertainment, I don't really get the feel for it. The movie's pace is nice, yet it's filled with scenes that feel like repetition of earlier scenes.

            "content": "When this film came out in 1983, I kinda remember it had limited release. I actually saw it on the Los Angeles Based \"Z\" Channel by accident. What made me stop and look was...Jerry Lewis.At the age I was, I was always expecting to see Jerry Lewis in a silly comic movie so running into this was a rare find indeed. He was brilliant so against what I always thought Jerry Lewis would be like. (I really think he should have gotten an acting nomination out of this one.) He was a snob, nasty--very nasty!!!-- and being admired and stalked by his fans. Two fans in particular who represent each side of the \"stalking\" spectrum are played wonderfully by Robert DeNiro and Sandra Bernhard.DeNiro brilliantly plays the over 35, live at home big time LOSER, Rupert Pumpkin who only wants his shot at the big time which he sees as getting a small comedy spot on a Popular National Night Time Program hosted by Lewis. Pumpkin feels that by going to every show to try to get next to Lewis and personally give him a tape of his comedy, he would get his shot on his show and...be instantly famous.On the other side of this is his sometime acquantance/hanger, Masha, played by Bernhard who is utterly over the top and in love with Lewis. She'd do \"anything\" to be with Lewis. She plays it well. Together they participate in a scheme to each try to get what they want -- Rupert, a spot on Lewis's nationally famous show and Masha, to have a romance with Lewis!What makes this film disturbing and watchable at the same time to me is looking at it through two different eyes. I was 20 when I first saw this film and I thought it was crazy. I didn't get \"it\". Who would EVER do something like this to get on TV???, I thought.20 years later, I watched at this film recently and found it very close to real situations with all the news stories and items I've seen since \"The King of Comedy\" first came out and what some will do for a one in a million three miinute shot on TV to become \"famous\". A celebrity. Somebody.\"The King of Comedy\" opens up and shows you a bit of all sides of the issue, from fame to jail, even \"crime-fame\" if you can imagine, and the trials and pressures of famous talk show hosts, this one played by played by Jerry Lewis being constatly approached and bothered and still trying to keep HIS popularity going. (Yep, a bit before the Late Night talk Show Wars, I might add.) Lewis's monologues regarding \"the bizness\" are wonderful-- pay attention -- there are gems of wisdom in them and he delivers them perfectly.Then there is Rupert Pumkin, shoving his way into Lewis life, private and public, because Pumkin thinks it's glamorous and he MUST have it so his life can be better and above everyone elses...but is it..really?Masha's role is definitely \"the stalker\". It's disturbing and over the top as it can get as I assume most stalkers missing a few screws, are. Again I say, young Sandra was perfect casting.The real acting/musician personalities in this film that were cast also give you a \"real\" feel for late night TV at that time and why some felt it was so \"make\" or \"break\" to get that three minute slot on that particular Late Night program for their career. Let's be honest, back then, spots like that DID make or break comedian's careers.Another bold directorial choice for Martin Scorsese with a perfectly good script, and as usual, Scorsese accomplishes the \"New York\" Late Night TV and area of that time exceedingly well. A rare find of a film, it's black comedy at points so it's not for everyone...but quite a look into lives that entwine via 'quiet train wreck style' and the ending may leave you to think: \"My, my, my. What one wont do for celebrity. Let's see how he likes it now.\"",

            "content": "So much darkness here, too much for me really, and this is a film I've found mesmerizing and yet unpleasant each time I've watched it. It shows the price of celebrity as 34-year-old Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) harbors fantasies about being the \"King of Comedy,\" despite only performing in his parent's basement and not in an actual comedy club. He's obsessed with a late night talk show host modelled after Johnny Carson (Jerry Lewis), and is extremely pushy about getting into contact with him. Pupkin (whose surname is hilariously botched again and again by others) is delusional, and on top of it, each time he's told \"no,\" it's done so politely that he doesn't get the message. Compounding things are a fellow loony (Sandra Bernhardt) with fantasies of her own egging him on, and security that's rather lax, allowing for some frightening levels of access.De Niro is excellent in the role but I found the film a little too exclusively in his character's head for my taste. To start with, there are pacing issues in the fantasy sequences which he imagines which frankly became a little tedious. Meanwhile, while showing just the smallest glimmer of the talk show host's funny side was undoubtedly part of the point - to show that in real life a celebrity might be very different, particularly when they're being harassed - I think that would have been amplified had there been some contrast to Lewis's character. It's all very one-note, and while Bernhardt's character adds to the nightmare, there isn't much depth to her role either.Perhaps the film is in Pupkin's head at the ending as well, I don't know, but regardless, I didn't find it very satisfying. Seeing his stand-up routine offered some insight into how he turned out the way he did and there is darkness in the idea of the audience laughing along, undoubtedly cued by applause signs, but it wasn't enjoyable to watch, and we've never been given any reason to empathize with him. I liked De Niro not playing a tough guy at this stage of his career, and liked the shift away from zaniness from Jerry Lewis, but this one leaves me cold.",

            "content": "In New York, Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is a delusional wannabe comedy star. After he connives to meet superstar talk show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), he pushes further to arrange to do a comedy routine on Langford's late-night show.\"The King of Comedy\" may very well be Martin Scorsese's best film even if it happens to be one of his most under-rated. Working with a brilliant screenplay by Paul Zimmerman, Scorsese has created a film that reflects various collective obsessions about fame including the belief that fame can be the solution for an unsatisfying life (Pupkin) while also showing fame's downside and its associated lack of personal space and safety (Langford).Scorsese's skills as a crime film director come into play in the second half when a very unusual twist takes place. What began as a comedy later becomes a thriller. The frequent scenes in which Rupert visits the office of The Jerry Langford Show are also greatly orchestrated. All of the staff act politely and professionally toward Rupert even while they are gradually cluing in that he is a wacko who must be resisted.The two main stars succeed well in playing against type. Lewis is a cool-as-a-cucumber, been-there-done-that, jaded type. De Niro courageously takes on the part of someone who is as repulsive as he is pitiful. (The inclusion of fantasy scenes in which he is professional pals with Jerry add greatly to the exposure of a contorted mind.) And as Rupert's partner-in-crime, Sandra Bernhard is hilarious especially in a scene near the film's end.For anyone familiar with the entertainment scene in the 1980s, it is fun to see the list of guests (popular at the time) on Jerry's show. A few even show up in the film.Underappreciated in its time, \"The King of Comedy\" has proven its worth over the years and decades since its release especially as the collective preoccupation with fame and celebrities is at least as insane today as it was in the early 1980s. The film was released before the creation of reality shows, selfies, and social media. Yes, it clearly exposes the collective mental foundation of what would be expanded decades later. - dbamateurcriticRATING: * * * 1/2OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:Directing by Martin ScorseseScreenplay by Paul Zimmerman",

            "content": "3. THE KING OF COMEDY (comedy, 1983) Rupert Pupkin (Robert DeNiro) is a struggling stand-up comic in N.Y. He constantly daydreams on appearing on the hottest show in town (\"The Jerry Langford Show\"), and meeting its host, Jerry (Jerry Lewis). Along with Masha, a \"supremo\" Jerry fan, they engineer a plan by which to meet and convince Jerry into letting him appear on the show. Nevertheless, Jerry ignores him as another crackpot. Rupert, however, remains undaunted in his efforts and looks for other ways to capture the attention of his longtime idol.Critique: Robert DeNiro's long and successful partnership with director Martin Scorcese has produced some of the best films of the last decades. In their films, DeNiro usually plays dark and disturbed loners whose volatile nature makes them a threat. Therefore, it comes as a pleasant surprise to find in the Scorcese-DeNiro oeuvre 'The King of Comedy', their first venture into comedy. While DeNiro's Rupert Pupkin is still a lone-loser, his comedy-plus performance is faultless. The major asset of the film though is Jerry Lewis, as a 'Late Night host'-type icon. After years of playing the sidekick idiot to Dean Martin (as well as countless \"kid\" comedies), Lewis for the first time plays it straight. His embittered, show-biz-like personage brings to the film a reality that is essential to its theme. His performance has left me wondering where his acting awards have gone.QUOTES: Rupert: \"Better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime.\"",

            "content": "\"If I was to meet actors and actresses of the period of Hollywood film when I was growing up...\" tells filmmaker Martin Scorsese in the documentary 'A Shot at the Top: The Making of The King of Comedy', \"I think I would have trouble communicating with them.\" He muses thoughtfully, \"You really get to love them, but they don't know you... You love, I think, what you imagine they are.\"Luckily for obsessive fan and aspiring comic Rupert Pupkin (De Niro), he gets a chance to meet his idol; the jaded, middle-aged and quite obviously famous comedic talk-show host Jerry Langford (played with bitterly arrogant Semitic charm by Jerry Lewis) who shows his funny side solely to the public. Rupert asks Jerry if he would listen to his routine and tell him what he thinks of it. In order to get rid of him, Jerry tells Rupert to \"call his office\" so he can withdraw to his private apartment in a luxurious Manhattan skyscraper made especially for the rich. Rupert gazes up in admiration and yearning at Jerry as he enters the lobby. Rupert doesn't want what Jerry has, he believes he needs it. His equally delusional and off-the-wall Jewish friend Masha (Sandra Bernhard) has similar ideas.Throughout the film, Rupert often retreats into his fantasies of fame and fulfilment; dreams in which he is offered his big break from Jerry, who, also throughout, detracts further and further from Rupert's imagined idea of him. After imprudently believing one of his fantasies to be true, Rupert takes his girlfriend (the actor's real life partner) Rita Keane (Diahnne Abbott) to Jerry's mansion. Here, Jerry confronts Pupkin (or Pumpkin, Pupper, Pipkin or even Pupnik as others mispronounce it) and unsympathetically asks him, \"Did anybody ever tell you that you're a moron?\" Rupert surprisingly catches this and forges it into a joke. \"Now, normally I would never let anyone speak that way about Rita. But since it's you Jerry, I'll let it go.\" Rita uncomfortably forces a smile to please Rupert. The state of affairs grows to be more embarrassing as they unfold, with Jerry finally having to assert himself and force Rupert out. \"Look, I made a mistake.\" elucidates a confused and pitiable Pupkin. \"So did Hitler!\" Jerry retorts angrily. A jump cut in time then takes us to Rupert and Masha sitting inside a car, waiting patiently for Jerry outside his apartment. The two successfully kidnap Langford, allowing Rupert to hold him to ransom unless he is given a shot at the big time on the show.Tony Randall gives a special appearance as himself playing the guest host who introduces Pupkin's pathetic routine. After his terrible laugh-track-guided skit, Pupkin walks off where he is escorted by security into a small back room for a meal and lax questioning by authoritative figures. A dumbfounded security chief asks him why he did it. Pupkin doesn't answer the question. Whether by then he doesn't know himself or he is afraid of humiliating himself in front of the man, we don't know.In the end, Langford escapes the clutches of the worryingly fixated Masha and, running past a TV window, discovers the newest 'King of Comedy' has stolen his limelight. Rupert is now the next big thing.Back when it was first released onto an unsuspecting public, 'The King of Comedy' was thought of as a sort of avant-garde film, its subject matter being so different and ahead of its time; although the critics and cinema-goers of today's times have formed something of a coterie, hailing it as one of the director's greatest achievements. And truthfully, it is.While it may not have the excessive violence or bad language of 'GoodFellas' or 'Raging Bull'; the film is still a memorable and great one and possesses many of the fine aspects we have become accustomed to in Scorsese's work \u2013 an innovative opening titles sequence, excellent acting, outstanding camera work, humorous yet human dialogue, superb editing and a cameo appearance by the man himself.'The King of Comedy' is an anthology of underrated classic scenes. A noteworthy example would be the one wherein Rupert fantasizes about being married with Rita on the show in front of his high-school principal George Kapp who wishes to beg his forgiveness along with \"the rest of the nation\". This is where we learn that Rupert 'must' have everyone's respect and admiration; just as he had for Jerry. We all want to be embraced and appreciated by people, but we know we're not going to get everybody's respect. Rupert, unfortunately, still sees the world through a child's eyes and madly desires all of these unreachable things.On each subsequent viewing, the film becomes progressively more frightening, with Rupert's overly enthusiastic smile growing more and more menacing with each moustache-hooded beam he gives us.Doubtlessly the most profound moment is in the final sequence and the credits that follow. After Rupert has been crowned the latest 'King' and served two years and nine months of his six-year sentence, a Pupkin-thirsty crowd of fans sit in anticipation of their 'idol'. As the man walks on, a huge applause greets the newly released comedian. His own theme swells up on some speakers; the camera dives down over the swarm of followers and stops at Rupert who gives a wide, appreciative grin to his enthusiasts; the credits then role with Van Morrison's 'Wonderful Remark' accompanying them.Truly, it is a wonderful remark. On how we, as a society, overvalue celebrity? Yes, it is. The media have made us like this. Both 'Taxi Driver' and this seem to be telling a similar story. Pick up a gun and shoot somebody or kidnap a talk-show host; either way, you're gonna be a star. But did Rupert really want to be remembered as talented or gifted? No. He just wants us to remember him. And the thing is; we do.",

            "content": "I just finished watching Martin Scorsese's 1983 film, The King of Comedy, for, what? the tenth time maybe.  I love this movie, but I would consider it one of Scorsese's \"overlooked\" works.  The King of Comedy naturally says a lot more to me now than when I first saw it, at about fifteen or sixteen. It depicts a star-struck New Jerseyite,  named Rupert Pupkin and played by Robert De Niro.  Pupkin dreams of becoming a stand-up comic, and he believes that New York talk-show host Jerry Langford, played by Jerry Lewis, is his ticket to the big time.  By happenstance, Pupkin manages to snag a seat in Langford's limo one evening as it speeds away from a throng of hysterical fans outside the TV studio.  In order to be rid of the pesky fan, Langford promises to listen to a tape that Pupkin has prepared of his best jokes. Of course, Langford has no intention of putting Pupkin on the show.  How Pupkin does indeed end up on the show forms the plot of the movie.  The King in Comedy is also a very intelligent examination of the modern fame, that is celebrity.  In today's culture, I wrote some years ago, fame is the flipside to privacy.  Where, as in highly-cohesive societies, there is no privacy and everyone is known to everyone else, there is little desire for one's reputation to exist beyond those whom one knows.  It is only where privacy and solitude form the common experience that individuals thirst to be known by all.  Rupert Pupkin, as portrayed so excellently by De Niro, is not clinically insane.  But he clearly lives in a dream world, as demonstrated by his collection of life-sized cardboard cut-outs of Jerry Langford and other stars, which he uses as props on the talk-show mock-up he's constructed in his basement.  There, Rupert mingles with Langford and the other guests, making jokes, and laughing at their own, unheard, wisecracks directed at him - until his mother calls from upstairs to alert Rupert that the bus to the city is imminent (at which point, Pupkin rises ceremoniously and says, \"Jerry, I'm so sorry. I have to go.  I have to catch a bus.\"). Langford's own mock interest in Pupkin's tape, Rupert takes for real, and then imagines himself sitting in Langford's office (its decor made appropriately garish, to suit Pupkin's own fashion sense), with Langford telling him, \"I don't know what you've got, but you've got it.  You've got it so much that you wouldn't be able to get rid of it.\"  In fact, Pupkin is so self-deluded that even after he is forcibly ejected from the Langford show's lobby, he promptly takes himself and a woman he wishes to marry (more self-delusion) to the star's residence  on Long Island, and is shocked when Langford himself viciously berates him and throws him out.  Rupert Pupkin is the insignificant nobody seeking to be a somebody.  Yet the writer of King of Comedy evidently understood the character of modern celebrity well enough to portray Langford as a person who is as lonely and friendless as Pupkin. The opening of The King of Comedy is the initial minutes of The Jerry Langford Show itself, virtually a direct copy of the old Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, down to the Las Vegas-style orchestra and a sidekick named \"Ed.\"  Cut to the stage door, where Pupkin is crowded with dozens of other fans awaiting their \"idol.\"  When Langford emerges, he's swamped by autograph-seekers and young women whose only wish is to sleep with him. But shortly on, Langford is shown sitting eating a late dinner, alone.  It is the paradox of modern celebrity, the adulation by millions can lead to profound loneliness on the part of those so adored.  Elvis Presley achieved great wealth and global fame due to his musical career, but for years before his death, he hardly went outside his mansion without being fully protected from contact with anyone not in his entourage (he used to rent Memphis roller-skating rinks for the evening just so he wouldn't be bothered by fans while doing something he loved).  Ringo Starr said he first experienced the loneliness of fame as a Beatle, when his own family began to treat him like an important guest in their houses, cleaning up and preparing the most elaborate teas when he came over.  This is the meaning of a line in Langford's apologia to Pupkin, in a scene following their confrontation at the Long Island mansion, when Langford says that he must put together a show every day but he can't be certain if he can trust the intent and competence of the people who are supposed to be his friends.  Langford's profession is sociality, and his icon belongs to the common, yet he has no true family, nor any real friends (even Pupkin has his mother).  His function as an entertainer, in turn, is necessary just because so many people are lonely, and wish for fame for themselves.  It is a yearning that seems universal, no matter if few will admit to it.  Why else are people so immediately excited when given the opportunity to see a celebrity \"in person\"?  It isn't merely that we \"admire their work\", for we want to see a celebrity even when we don't care about her or his work.  Instead, there is an irrational belief that the iconic status of the famed will rub off on the unknown.  When ordinary people encounter celebrities, they inevitably tell others immediately afterward.  They may, given an more extended encounter with a celebrity, tell friends and family years later (on that score, I don't think I've ever related in these pages the time when I was in New York city, on a tour bus, and I saw Yoko Ono...).  It's as if seeing someone famous is a claim to fame in itself.  In The King of Comedy, there are a couple of sequences in which Jerry Lewis, as Langford, is  accosted by fans on New York's streets (during one of these, Lewis, spotting a stalker, played by Sandra Bernhardt, begins to jog and then run away from her, doing so ironically in the fashion Lewis made famous in his earlier screwball films). What is significant is that these parts of the film could have indeed been real, as Jerry Lewis was at the time as well known to the public as his film alter-ego, Langford.  At one point, the Bernhardt character, after finally succeeding in getting Langford to sit down for dinner with her, babbles on a length about very little, until suddenly declaring, \"I love you.  I've never told anyone I've loved them before.  Not even my parents.  Of course, they never told me that they loved me, either.\"",

This is a severely underrated comedy/crime movie with a role from De Niro that is still to be beaten. The film may seem quite simple for all involved but the making was meant to be quite a grueling process. Everything about the film is magnificent; the direction, the acting, the cinematography, even Rupert's painfully bad jokes make one unforgettable film.Robert De Niro plays the part of wannabe comedian Rupert Pupkin with brilliance and a hint of madness as well as being extremely funny. Jerry Lewis plays Jerry Langford, a parallel version of himself. The basic plot line is that Rupert Pupkin is a huge fan of famous comedian Jerry Langford and is convinced that he's pals with him. This increases his psychosis and he turns up at his office everyday as well as coming to his country home but when he realizes he cannot do so he resorts to kidnap with hilarious results.. This movie is one of my top five of all time and I think it deserves to be up there with Raging Bull, Gooodfellas and Taxi Driver as Scorsese's best. The ending sums the entire film up in a great way and has an ending that many viewers may deem too perfect for someone who had the tragic endings of movies like the ones stated above but I think it would be an injustice to have any violence or sadness in a film so delightful. There are many great one-liners and the overall screenplay is excellent, mixing human drama with some dark comedy and I'm still in shock it's not in the Top 250.Also, I still quote the famous \"It's better to be a king for a night than a shmuck for a lifetime\" line today since I've seen it.Coolest Scene: The fantastic ending that leaves open the idea that it's all in Rupert's headVerdict: A thing of beauty, The King of Comedy is a movie that you just have to see if you are any way interested in movies.",

Well into their cups, they come up with a great idea! Let's make a movie about psycho fans! \"King of Comedy\" is relentless in its portrayal of Hollywood folk as honest, hardworking, and put-upon; every single non-Hollywood character is some kind of nut or grifter. And they play it straight: Jerry Lewis, for example, has NO comedic lines. His role is to offer sensible, straight-forward career advice to all the low-life fans who won't accept it. The plot is entirely predictable. There's a supposed \"surprise ending\" that you can see coming from a mile away (with disgust), and finally unfolds in fewer than 60 seconds of screen time. None of the characters is developed - they are all hollow stereotypes performing scripted roles without motivation. At one point an explanation for De Niro's character is tossed up: an abused childhood (along the lines of \"Daddy didn't love me.\"). There's some kind of weird love interest with a female bartender that goes nowhere. Ugh - just writing this makes me feel like the movie is wasting even more of my time.

Zimmerman instrument an ambiguous comeuppance thanks to the film's shrewd amalgam of reality and hallucination.As a pungent satire to the instant showbiz fame and the celebrity's overwrought mental condition with the autograph hounds and devout stalkers, the film is an eloquent body of work in manipulating its viewer's empathetic oscillation between Pupkin and Langford, for instance, on the one hand, I feel repellent towards Jerry's hubris and snootiness (his deadly oomph towards women is something I could never understand, what a great job for Bernhard to deliver the madness in front of such a distasteful sine qua non), on the other hand, when put myself in his shoes, the nettlesome Pupkin is a parasite-like cipher one instinctively despises. The same could be transposed with Pupkin, one moment you regard him as a deadbeat chatterbox by badgering Jerry, next scene you feel sorry for him because we know Jerry will shatter his dreams sooner or later, and when that dramatic moment eventually happens, the interplay among Pupkin, Jerry and Rita (Pupkin's love interest played by De Niro's then-wife Abbott) is spontaneous, awkwardly cringing and impeccably acted.De Niro has unwaveringly forsaken his acting skill since his glorious years (70s to 80s), a committed incarnation of a stand-up comedian in his hard-earned live stint, but an overall, his comedian bent may be not as hyped as he claims, at least, not ground-breaking enough to be at a king's level, thus making the ending resound with a more cynically suspicious irony. De Niro's methodological strenuousness seems to be markedly discordant with Lewis' more naturalistic instinct-driven skill, which actually is an opportune win-win situation both for the comic vein and for the actors, they are ranking high in my respective categories. Also Bernhard is spectacular in her nut's sickly possessiveness despite of her less-limned backstory, maybe she is a much qualified comedian than her pal. An unfeigned delight to watch this film and to revere more towards Mr. Scorsese, whose all- purpose greatness is an unerring beacon to guide his disciples and an insatiable lure to his ceaseless fan club recruits.",

The only shortcoming here, is it's running time. Rather than being 109-minutes long, it could've easily been done with a crispy 95-minutes, and that would have only elevated it's impact. Paul D. Zimmerman's Screenplay is quite good. Scorsese's direction is nuanced, like always. Fred Schuler's Cinematography is good.Performance-Wise: Robert De Niro is brilliant. He proves his range yet again by playing a stand-up comedian with such charm. Jerry Lewis is flawless from start to end. Diahnne Abbott does very well. Sandra Bernhard & Shelley Hack are good.On the whole, a must watch black-comedy. Scorsese and De Niro are truly legendary!",

            "content": "The King of Comedy was billed as a \"dark comedy,\" but it didn't reach the levels of absurdity needed to be genuinely comedic. The movie had tremendous potential to be either very funny or very suspenseful, but it maintained a much too moderate approach to be either.The character of Hubert Pupkin was intended to be comedic; Pupkin instead was written and played as fairly likable and moreover, relatable. Yes, he's an adult living in his mother's basement (something that wasn't trendy in 1986) and yes, he has an elaborate fantasy life that motivates his actions, but there were moments in which many viewers could empathize with him. His repeated efforts to get his comedy routine heard by Jerry Langford, followed by the repeated brush-offs by Langford's staffers are very reminiscent of many job applicants' attempts to get an interview, only to be e-mailed a form letter stating \"Although your credentials and accomplishments are admirable, we have chosen to pursue applicants who are better suited to the position....\" The audience is led to both pity Pupkin for his lack of insight, but admire him for his persistence. Pupkin isn't so comedic when he looks like a great number of people in the audience who have succumbed to the popular message of \"follow your heart.... follow your dreams...\" without regard for the consequences.The character of Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) is sadly underdeveloped in the movie as well. The character isn't given a lot of lines, so there is no way the audience is led to either like him or hate him. Other than the \"mob of fans\" scene at the start of the movie and the interaction he has with the obnoxious woman on the telephone, we don't see Langford as being continually oppressed by the demands of a voracious audience. Langford is shown as attempting to be gracious to Pupkin and his other star-obsessed fan, Masha, both of whom take his polite responses as invitations. Even though he has little material with which to work, Jerry Lewis transitions from comedian to serious actor very well in this role.The ending is also not all that satisfying. Pupkin gets his wish - to appear on Langford's program - by kidnapping Langford using a toy gun. He delivers his comedy routine, which is primarily a recitation of an abusive, dysfunctional childhood, to the incomprehensibly wild applause of the audience, and he is arrested. His fame ultimately comes not from his performance, but from the book he writes about kidnapping Jerry Langford and the media focus on that event. Pupkin is neither a hero, nor is he a villain. All in all, The King of Comedy was unfulfilling. Had Pupkin been written to be a little more sinister, obsessive and driven, this would have been an excellent thriller. Had Pupkin been less likable and without the pathos, it would have leaned more toward the comedy it was intended to be. As it is, it merits the audience reaction it received when first released: \"What was that we just watched?\"In many ways, the movie was ahead of its time. The theme of \"fame at any price\" is much more relevant in today's \"Youtube\" and \"reality TV\" environment, where people with no noticeable talent become \"stars\" through unabashed self-promotion (the Kardashians) or feats of incredible stupidity (the criminals who post their criminal behavior for all to see). With a little retooling, a talented screenwriter could redo this movie for today's audience and develop it to fulfill it's potential.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's The King of Comedy is a film that seems to become more and more understood with audiences today. When released in 1983, it garnered marginal critical success, yet performed extremely poor financially, just recuperating 13% of its overall budget. It's hard to wrap your head around the idea of Scorsese making a picture like this. This is the first time he has stumbled into the area of comedy and satire, and what I believe is his only venture into the field, and he does it by painting pictures of such a harsh, modest reality. Or... unreality? Although it is different in its genre, style, and technique, its themes aren't completely distant from what Scorsese did in his 1976 drama Taxi Driver, focusing on an insomniac cab driver, lost and alienated in a world where arrogance dominates. Here, our protagonist Rupert Pupkin (De Niro) is so shallow, lost, and diluted in his world that he believes every encounter he has with people is authentic and that everyone likes him and is playing the same game he is. Talk about rude, unwanted wake up calls from society.Pupkin is an aspiring comedian, always dapper and sophisticated, with his idol being a talk show host named Jerry Langford, played by a very calm and subtle Jerry Lewis. Pupkin wants to make it big, and has numerous discussions with Langford about how he could potentially take his dream to great heights. Eventually, Langford understandably becomes annoyed and irritated with Pupkin's persistent ways and nonetheless, finds himself being stalked and watched by him almost constantly. This leads to Pupkin and his friend to kidnap the comedian, so that he could take over Jerry's show for one night.The humor presented in The King of Comedy is viciously dark and wickedly funny, sometimes even so desperate and tragic we cringe and are unsettled in our seats. What I still can't describe is Pupkin's personality. I can't decide if he is intelligent or downright clueless, and if his decisions are feasible or cloyingly inane. That's the beauty of the film; the utter insanity of it all and the fact the character is so dynamic he's difficult to decipher.I can also see how some people have stated the film is, again like Taxi Driver, quite possibly focusing on delusion rather than reality. Is this all a dream? Are the events truly taking place? Or does Pupkin think up all these deeds in his mother's basement. The incredible use of toying with the audiences' head is used wonderfully here, and the writing provides a fair commentary on the great lengths one might go to achieve fame in America. This commentary on society could also, more or less, be compared to John Waters' Female Trouble. In that film, it focused on how America has a disturbing and mind-boggling fascination with criminals. Scorsese comments on how desperate some are to achieve fame and why we are so intrigued with them.The King of Comedy is a strange little film, one that isn't the most pleasant to experience. Its main character could be considered dastardly, with very few redeeming qualities, but could also be consider, an absurd dreamer, hellbent on achieving his personal goals. Or, he could be considered a daring and admirable soul who actually works his way to the top. Man, the stuff one could dream up in his mothers' basement.Starring: Robert De Niro, Jerry Lewis, Sandra Bernhard, Diahnne Abbott, and Shelley Hack. Directed by: Martin Scorsese.",

            "content": "After viewing Joker, I decided to take a look at the films which inspired it: The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. Scorsese is one of the most consistent directors out there and this film is one of his best.The King of Comedy ia about Rupert Pupkin, a failed comedian who wants to be in the spotlight and craves fame. In order to do this, Pupkin decided to kidnap his idol.This movie does everything in the best way possible and is a fantastic companion piece to Taxi Driver. It's interesting how similar both films are but at the same time very different in presentation. Whilst that film is relatively violent and serious in tone, The King of Comedy does the opposite. It's sad to see the lack of attention this film gets when looking at Scorsese's entire filmography because I believe this movie is executed perfectly.The film lighthearted tone provides for a great contrast to the character of Rupert Pupkin. At times it is funny but a lot of the film is subtly dark and cringey to witness. A lot of that has to do with De Niro's masterful performance as Pupkin and Paul D. Zimmerman's terrific script. A great choice for the film was its blur between fantasy and reality. It's handled seamlessly and perfectly captured Pupkin's mental state as well allowing the audience to think which events really happened and which were in Pupkin's head. It's a film that I thought about a lot and it conveyed to me how people crave fame and recognition and the lengths they would go to just to get any amount of it no matter how short-lived it may be.Robert De Niro is in his prime here and this just might be my favourite performance of his. His incredible act at the end which runs for a few minutes goes to show his tremendous acting abilities. I don't there could've been any other actor that could replicate the craziness and embarrassing nature Pupkin possesses other than De Niro. Jerry Lewis is also terrific here as well as Sandra Bernhard's Masha who is equally as crazy as Pupkin.The King of Comedy is a very entertaining character study that shows a lot of themes and messages in a very subtle manner. Robert De Niro is absolutely mesmerising here and I loved how this film contrasts with Taxi Driver. It really shows Scorsese's talent as a director. He managed to do it again!",

            "content": "When it debuted, it was considered the biggest flop of the year. And it's not hard to see why. It's not because the script was bad. It's not because the actors were bad. It's not because the directing was bad. It flopped because you simply cannot top \"Raging Bull\".When a bar is set as high as Scorsese set it for himself, it's going to be hard to even come close. \"The King Of Comedy\" is good movie as it stands alone, but it is certainly not De Niro's or Scorsese's best. Jerry's? Perhaps. Sandra Bernhard's? Doubtless.The movie is about Rupert Pupkin, a struggling wannabe comic who develops the theory that \"It's better to be King for a night, than Shmuck for a lifetime.\" Motiving himself with that, he kidnaps late night talk-show host Jerry Langford after many failed attempts at connection. He holds him hostage as he gets the chance to appear on his show.De Niro's depiction of this character was excellent, as to be expected. After playing so many macho, scary characters, it was refreshing to see him play a bit of a geek. In Taxi Driver, the protagonist lives by himself in a tiny apartment where he broods over the evils of the world. In King, the protagonist lives in his mother's basement where he's set up a slightly disturbing shrine for his idol. The character is more pitiful than his others, and it's a nice change of pace.Is this movie Scorsese's masterpiece? No. But is it worth watching, especially if you're a Scorsese or De Niro fan?

            "content": "Yeah, I know, for every \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Raging Bull,\" there's a dud like \"New York, New York\" thrown in there to make you think that those two movies may have been a fluke.  But seeing the ultra-black \"The King of Comedy\" will prove to you once and for all that De Niro and Scorsese are the single greatest actor/director combo in film history.I say this film is \"ultra-black,\" because it literally is a jaw-dropingly disturbing film.  But what makes \"The King of Comedy\" such an interesting and completely watchable experience is the way the material is handled. This is not an R or X-rated shocker filled with \"offensive imagery,\" or depraving drug use, or rape.  \"The King of Comedy\" is a PG-rated film. However, it is darker and makes the viewer feel uneasier than most NC-17 rated movies I've seen.The story centers around a 34-year-old loser named Rupert Pumpkin (De Niro) who lives with his mother.  He's in his own world.  Literally.  Between unbelievable daydreams about fraternizing with his idol, the ever so Johnny Carson-like \"Jerry Langford\" (Jerry Louis), who hosts an ever so Tonight Show-like show called \"The Jerry Langford Show\" (the similarities are so closely drawn together here, that they even have guys who work for, and have been guests on the Tonight show playing themselves in the movie), Rupert also stalks Jerry under the self-convinced guise that he and Jerry are meant to be a comic-duo.Rupert is a wannabe standup comedian who has spent years perfecting his mediocre standup routine in his basement while his mother yells at him to \"keep it down.\"  Set up in his basement are cardboard cutouts of Jerry, the Jerry Langford show set, the band and various guests who have been on the show before.  Jerry sits down between all of them and acts out a fantasy as though he is a guest sitting down on the Langford show, talking to Jerry like he's know him forever.  From the first scene shown in his basement, it is clear that Rupert Pumpkin is a very sick man.Furthermore, Rupert finds himself in a situation where his obsession level escalates to an all-time high.  After \"saving\" Jerry Langford from a mob of fans who were mauling him after a show one evening, Rupert jumps into Jerry's limo with him.  Instead of throwing Rupert back out onto the cold street, Jerry decides to be nice and listen to what Rupert has to say, and let him pitch why he would be a good guest on the show.  Jerry lets Rupert down with a typical \"come into the studio some time and drop off some of your material to my agent and we'll look into it\" response.  Naturally, Rupert takes Jerry literally and sees what he said as a definite interest in his material, rather than a quick way of letting down a guy who won't take no for an answer.De Niro is incredibly great in this film.  Not quite as great as his subtly brilliant roles in \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Raging Bull\" and \"The Godfather Part II,\" but definitely near the same level and way off the stratosphere in terms of intensity.  De Niro is so utterly believable at playing a man that has absolutely no clue whatsoever how to behave and act normally in public that you often wonder about the state of his own psychosis at times.  The scene's where De Niro is waiting in an office trying to get an interview with Jerry to be on the show are gut wrenching.  Never has a movie so clearly and brilliantly conveyed the uneasiness of a moment and the hopelessly clueless demeanor of a man who quite simply isn't all there.Moreover, \"The King of Comedy\" is also a brilliantly executed satire on the nature of fame and the unbelievable things that people will do to achieve a certain level of it...  even if it is for only 15-minutes.  What makes the movie so astounding almost twenty years later is how ahead of its time the film feels.  Despite some examples of bad 80s fashion, film production aesthetics (well, at least on the typically poorly transferred 80s VHS copy I watched) and the fact that this film is sending up the Johnny Carson-era of the Tonight Show, \"The King of Comedy\" never feels like an 80s film at all, and it ended up pre-dating the 90s media-psycho fascination by nearly fifteen years!  A brilliant, brilliant film that I cannot say enough good things about.  Paul Zimmerman's script must have been amazing.  Pay close attention to the scene where Rupert finally performs his stand-up routine. Some of his jokes actually are quite funny, but most of them are direct and disturbingly autobiographical tidbits about his life and his horrible, horrible childhood.  This is top-notch writing.Scorsese and De Niro were just the men to bring such a story to life during their creative zenith from the early 70s to the early 80s and \"The King of Comedy\" holds up extremely well next to known classics like \"Mean Streets,\" \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Raging Bull.\"  One of the most underrated and under appreciated movies ever.  If you have a weak tolerance level for watching EXTREME social depravity, you might want to avoid this film, though.  I give it a 10 out of 10.",

He and Masha, another stalker fan, kidnap Jerry and blackmail Rupert onto the show. This is where it breaks down. Sandra Bernhard simply doesn't have the movie-acting chops, even with the support of the two old troupers. She's making such a meal of improvising it, her mouth churning dialogue to fill the void, it's painful. Jerry Langford sits fuming, wrapped in duct tape as Masha holds him prisoner, and you know how he feels. Vary the tone, Sandra! Anyway, Rupert gets to do his turn, and is led away by the cops. The point about his cheesy act not actually bombing and making him a household name, with celebrity waiting for him after he leaves jail, is apposite today, with no-talent celebrities everywhere you look. What the script is saying is that fame is artificial, an illusion, and Rupert manages to bust his way into the circuit - his talent, or lack of it, is irrelevant: the audience will take what it's given. Masha is left running around in her scanties and we never see her again, and the payoff with Rupert achieving his dream is a little flat. This is the sort of film you can watch again if you've half-forgotten it - there's plenty to enjoy in the sight gags and asides, but the fizzle-out story and Sandra Bernhard's amateurish performance hole it below the waterline.",

In both I expected it to all come crashing down, and there are moments when both do, but they end up being all the stronger for it in the end. The King of Comedy particularly does feel like a critique both of the entertainment industry he tries to break into and the audience. The industry has a lot of bureaucratic steps preventing it from going in new directions, which Jerry also hints at early in the movie talking about how his show has been stale. Similarly, the audience just craves something new and different, so they embrace Pupkin despite (or even because of) the abduction that gave him the opportunity. De Niro is very convincing as a man who just keeps talking and does not take no for an answer.

In Taxi Driver, Bickle was an externally violent character, therefore you could fear him because you can see him coming. Rupert Pupkin(\"Often Mispronounced and misspelled\")is a very internally violent man and you don't know just how crazy he is until it's too late. And violent not in the sense that he'll harm a person, cause he never harms a person at all during the film, but he's always on the edge. You don't know when he'll lash out, and though he doesn't, the chance for it is always there. DeNiro is a nerd. Plain and simple. He's an obsessed nerd and thinks that his only way to redeem how he feels about himself is through sucess in comedy. His fantasies, at first, are obvious. Then they begin to flow into real life, and you almost cannot tell where the fantasy begins and real life ends. Its frightening. The comedy in this film comes from all the main characters, but it's comedy from everyday life. It's not forced. It's comes very naturally.The most suprising comedy comes from the director and his mother. Martin Scorecese has a cameo as the talk show director who's small moment includes finding Pupkin funny when no one else does, and Martin's mom who plays the Offscreen voice of the nagging Mrs. Pupkin. The King of Comedy. Dark, Depressing, Frightening,Funny, and Suprising. See it.",

            "content": "A flop in its day, The King Of Comedy is now rightfully revered as the masterpiece it clearly is, beheld as one of Martin Scorsese's most prolific pieces of work to date. Arguable Marty's most underrated classic, the story of Rupert Pupkin's deleterious quest for fame is one that the New York maestro still has issues with, avoiding discussion of it in interviews. Regardless of this it remains a cornerstone of its kind, giving us an unsanitary view of fame and fortune, and the quest to reach it, every bit as pertinent in 21st century western culture as it was at the time of its release.Jerry Langford (Lewis) is the host of a Johnny Carson style talk show. He is bombarded with fans outside his studio after every show, two of them being wannabe-comic Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) and maniacal fame-glorifying Masha (Sandra Bernhard). After a potentially dangerous ruckus Rupert manages to worm his way into Langford's hastily departing limousine. He manages to convince Langford to give him his office number. We then meet Masha again, who appears to be equally obsessed with Langford, although purely because of his fame, rather than to gain fame herself. Pupkin then continually bugs Langford's office in order to get his act heard. He then pursues a relationship with bartendress and former high school beauty Rita Keane by continually offering her embellished stories about his relationships with various celebrities.The King Of Comedy is about the deranged people who yearn for the rewards of celebrity, yet have no ability to actually achieve it. Rupert Pupkin is a man who wants to guest on the talk shows and sign the autographs but doesn't actually have much of an act to speak of. The film displays his pathos by showing us his lonely, demented fantasies acted out in his mother's basement. In one scene Rupert practises his act on tape, with the sound of laughter gradually drowning out his voice. All he hears is the audience laughing and not the jokes he is telling. He fantasises about Langford loving him and his act, labelling Pupkin a genius. He envisages the fame and rewards, but neglects the work that comes with perfecting the art of entertainment. He even dreams of marrying his high school sweetheart on The Jerry Langford Show. In today's world of celebrity nobodies Rupert Pupkin would probably fail the entry requirements of Big Brother. Masha, meanwhile represents the unhealthy worship of fame, rather than the quest for it. She tries to get close to Langford whenever possible and even makes obscene phone calls to his apartment. Jerry Langford is the source of both these individuals obsessions, yet he himself is an insolent man, continually discourteous to his fans. This is somewhat apt as it is rumoured that Scorsese had great difficulty working with Jerry Lewis on this film.De Niro plays Pupkin with a subtle horror. Like a lounge singer being booed off stage, he is gloriously hideous in his pathetic blue suit and red tie, with the worst moustache this side of World War II. Watching The King Of Comedy, it is hard to believe this is the same man who looked so suave and sophisticated as Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II.Perhaps in today's Big Brother watching, MTV fame worshipping world this film is more important to 2006 than it was to 1983. There are far more uninteresting people inundating our television sets in the 21st century than ever before, with countless TV channels and reality programmes. Perhaps that is one reason why the movie failed to do any business on it's release. Maybe it is the absence of a likable character. It certainly doesn't garner the same accolades and appreciation as some Scorsese's other work from the same era such as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, yet is every bit as compelling and showed us that Scorsese can have a wicked sense of humour when he wants to. The performances are first class, with Robert De Niro displaying his multi-dimensional range like only he ever could and creating a new star with the excellently deranged Sandra Bernhard. It is more than worthy of your attention and should be sought out by everyone.",

            "content": "The Martin Scorsese/Robert De Niro team usually doesn't do much for me (and usually turns out something I loathe), so going into The King of Comedy I wasn't expecting to be impressed. To my surprise, I was not only impressed but came away thinking it was the best work they had ever done together. Working from a superb Paul Zimmerman script, Scorsese and De Niro combine their efforts here to create a satire on the price of fame and what it takes to get there, which also serves as an absolutely hilarious comedy.Robert De Niro is an actor I was never able to develop a fondness for, almost always finding him to be one of those people who is never able to shed themselves and dive into a role full-on. With rare exception, it always seemed like it was De Niro playing a part rather than the character just existing in it's own accord. Here though, I was amazed by how well he shed his own skin and dove into the role of Rupert Pupkin, an aspiring stand-up comedian who utilizes a forced encounter with talk-show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) as his way to make it into show business. Pupkin is an excellent character to play, filled with narcissism, delusions of grandeur and an absolute blindness to his wealth of personal flaws, and De Niro nails every tick of him.It's interesting in a lot of ways how the character draws from De Niro's incarnation of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. This is a man who constantly believes that he is doing no wrong, set in his ways and determined to make his plan work. He's a dangerously psychotic man, perhaps even more dangerous than Bickle himself because Pupkin is doing it purely with his own self in mind. Pupkin gives off the idea that he idolizes Langford, but really he idolizes no one but himself and is using this kiss-ass routine to further his own success. He wants to become Langford, to have Langford kissing his toes the way that people do his, and through several fantasies we see those desires play out in Pupkin's mind.De Niro plays this character brilliantly, taking him on the same way that he would take on Vito Corleone; he never plays Pupkin as a lunatic, never as a moron who the audience is supposed to laugh at. At all times he is believable in the skin of this character and it's a large part of what makes the film work overall. His Pupkin is unsettling more than he is humorous, a grown boy turning into a man who is fascinating and potentially terrifying. I think it's easily De Niro's finest work, but he's still upstaged by the miraculous Sandra Bernhard, who portrays a fellow Langford-obsessed fan that eventually teams up with Pupkin in their big scheme.Bernhard is a force of nature, getting more laughs in her screen time than most films are able to pack into an entire picture. She is seductively psychotic, absolutely deranged and howlingly hilarious. It's one of my favorite performances, period. She devours this role and her scenes at the dining table with Langford produced some of the hardest laughs I can ever remember having. The film comes around full circle to a final sequence that is intriguing in it's ambiguity, along with it's parallel to the ending of Taxi Driver. Pupkin gets everything he ever wanted, all of the praise and adoration, but as an audience we're left wondering; is it real?",

            "content": "Tragedy and comedy have long gone hand-in-hand; the one complements the other. However they aren't mixed as often as they should be, at earlier times because of the rigidity of genre, in more recent ones because of politically correct notions about having to treat certain subjects with solemnity. As such there has never really been a golden age of tragicomedy, but here and there examples of mature and sensitive black humour have shone through. Such a one is 1983's King of Comedy.King of Comedy represents another turn in the zigzagging career of Martin Scorsese, in his quest to bring various personal projects to the screen. This apparently wasn't a picture he had much enthusiasm for and would later regret making. This perhaps explains why his visual style is far less elaborate here than it normally would be, with none of the long-drawn out tracking shots for which he is famed. However this fact works in the picture's favour, as we get less of the overt director's \"touch\", allowing us to see scenes unfolding naturally before us. Scorsese's approach is still lightly expressionistic, with lots of tunnel-like views such as the narrow corridor shot as Diahnne Abbott takes her leave of De Niro after their awkward date. There's also Scorsese's slightly surreal, detached manner, with characters picked out through thronging crowds or viewed straight down in a god-shot. As in Taxi Driver this helps to give the necessary feeling of oddness and confusion for depicting the slightly deranged loner type.Unlike Scorsese, lead man Robert De Niro was supposedly all for making King of Comedy, and this is really much more his movie than it is the director's. It's nice to see the star really exploring his range for once, rather than just playing another of the near-identical Italian-American hoodlums who have dominated his career. De Niro shows off his comedy chops here in a way that really works for the picture. He displays genuine comic timing and delivery for example when acting out his chat show routine with the Liza and Jerry cardboard cut-outs, leading us to believe that Pupkin actually has some talent even if he is deluded about everything else. But De Niro also allows us to laugh at the character's very nature, making Pupkin somewhat ridiculous in his naivet\u00e9. Able support comes from Sandra Bernhard, giving a very authentic portrait of someone with moderate mental illness, and the great Jerry Lewis, playing a comedian as renowned as himself but showing us the sober reality of the off-duty celebrity in a way that is forceful, very believable and occasionally humorous. Lewis has that uncanny ability to make us laugh while giving the appearance of playing serious. And of course Lewis also knew a thing or two about mixing the tragic and the comic.It seems King of Comedy has split audiences and reviewers into those who take it as a creepy thriller and those who see it as a poignant drama. It strikes me that the former are likely to be disappointed, because this is not quite the gripping tale of a man pushed to his limits that Taxi Driver is, and we are certainly not supposed to sympathise with Lewis as a kidnapping victim. And to miss the emotional revelation of the nature of Pupkin's stand-up act is, I feel, really to miss out on the point of the whole picture. For King of Comedy is a story of the endearing outsider, and not really all that far from the heart-tugging works of Tim Burton like Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. This picture has a tough comedy shell, but one that serves to give the tragedy its bittersweet edge.",

I'm a fan of Scorcese's filmography, but for some reason, I always thought The King of Comedy would be one of his lesser and more forgettable films. Oh boy, how wrong I was...If the film has a lot to say about fan culture and its excesses through a brilliant character who is scary and dangerous, it also has surprising and cynical messages about the path to success and how we are often ignored by everyone until we do something drastic (the fact that Pupkin's name is never pronounced in the right way until he forces his voice - through the wrong methods - says a lot).Robert De Niro has always been on a different level and, although similarities can be drawn in psychological terms with other characters, the way he embodies this role is totally different from that seen in, for example, Taxi Driver, giving it a unique dimension. Jerry Lewis also surprised me in a restrained and very realistic role, while Sandra Bernhard lives another - more impulsive - face of Rupert Pupkin.Filled with powerful dialogue and lines that remain in the history of cinema, the argument is quite smart in the way it balances reality with the fiction created in Pupkin's head, but much of this merit has to be attributed to the intelligent and creative way in which Scorcese carried out the work, even catching me off guard in some situations, not expecting such greatness. Editing is another of the strengths of a film that is much more influential - and incredibly relevant for current times - than what was thought on its release date.",

Pupkin is essentially a loser, an outcast like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. Indeed the two characters share much in common in this respect, unable to conform to the accepted social norms, suffering from societal alienation and isolation. Whereas Bickle's isolation results in a terrifying and violent conclusion Pupkin's isolation, whilst still very creepy is hilarious.Some of the best scenes in this film are indeed cringe worthy as Pupkin is told repeatedly that Mr Langford is not in, Pupkin replies by saying he will wait until eventually he is removed. Another disturbing scene sees him sat with cardboard cut outs in a hideous simulation of a talk show only to be interrupted by his mother who he still lives with.The climax to the film is both hilarious and disturbing and I shall not spoil it for anyone except to say watch out for Pupkin's gun as he gets out of the car to confront Langford.A superb and underrated film, De Niro is very believable as the central character, Jerry Lewis is also convincing and Sandra Bernhard brilliantly forms the other half of a strained and disturbed comic duo with De Niro.",

Do this film's first image \u2014 which is usually of life \u2014 here is of a TV image. From here on, the media image trumps any reality. The film explores that gap.In the last shot Rupert Pupkin (Robert de Niro) stands at a mike milking the audience's applause (as Langford did earlier). He stands in the darkness with no clear context. He may or may not be on a stage or before a camera. He's pinpointed by lights, in his garish showbiz suit. He's not doing anything but basking in the lights and wallowing in the applause. Pipkin has completed his prison sentence for abducting Langford and he has been paid a million dollars advance for his best-selling confessional book. Now he is celebrated for being a celebrity not for anything he is doing. The act has supplanted the person. The shot seems so unreal it suggests it may be Pupkin's fantasy, an image of the ambition or desire his career has left unfulfilled despite his apparent success. The casting advances that meta-cinema mode. It plays in the grey area between reality and its mediation. Among the minor characters, Johnny Carson's producer Fred De Cordova plays Langford's producer Bert Thomas. The Ed MacMahon role is provided by McMahon's predecessor on the Jack Paar Tonight show, Ed Herlihy, effectively playing the oleaginous McMahon. (Johnny Carson himself was offered the Langford role but declined it.) Familiar guests Dr Joyce Brothers and Tony Randall play themselves. Media figures Bill Jorgensen, Marvin Scott, Chuck Stevens, William Littauer and Jeff David speak as themselves. Producer Edgar Scherick plays the network president. Director Scorsese plays the show's director, with his mother Catherine heard as Pupkin's \"Ma-aaa.\" His father is at the bar watching Pupkin's TV appearance. DeNiro's wife Diahnne Abbott plays Rupert's romance. Other castings play against their familiar image. Comedian Sarah Bernhardt plays the needy, wealthy Masha with an abrasive ardor for star Langford. Her brashness and anger are an extension from her comic persona. Comic pianist Victor Borge appears as pianist in Pupkin's fantasy of his TV marriage \u2014 but neither cracks nor plays a joke. Similarly, Lewis is almost exclusively known as a manic comic but he plays this role absolutely straight, without a scintilla of a lapse into the persona that has defined him. De Niro's Pupkin is a dramatic variation on his usual Scorsese role: the constrained savagery of an alienated brute on the make. As Pupkin pulls a comic routine out of his family life frustrations, Scorsese makes this DeNiro character an adept aper of TV's false warmth. In his fantasy patting of \"Jarelleh's\" cheeks the De Niro and Lewis personae touch and spark. As Pupkin dreams of surpassing Langford, he \u2014 like the film itself\u2014 appropriates the royal title to which Jerry Lewis has the plausible claim. These castings convey the film's central confusion between role and reality, privileging the former. Artifice is all. Hence the abyss between the friendliness and warmth that Langford projects on air and his bleak solitude at home. There he eats alone. He walks around with a single golf club. He may well golf alone. In his mother's basement Pupkin practices a social glibness that he learned off TV \u2014 and criminally contrives to air it. Of course one of the main forms of this false human connection is love. \"I'm going to love you like nobody's loved you\" opens the film's theme song. Sick loves, twisted loves, abound in this arena of social fakery. In his fantasy Rupert expresses his love for Langford and Liza Minnelli, as if his emotion can bring their cardboard cutouts to life. Masha's passion for Langford has nothing to do with what either is or feels, just her random though total commitment. The theme is concentrated in the street scene where a woman tells Jerry she loves him. When he declines to speak on the phone to her cousin she yells at him, hoping he gets cancer. She too loves him like nobody loves him. But it's not a matter of come rain or come shine. It's a matter of reality supplanted by artifice. In this light the film foreshadows the inflection of American politics into reality TV show.",

            "content": "Almost 30 years after the release of The King of Comedy, Martin Scorsese's marvelous look at the volatile nature of celebrity and its relationship to the public, remains a polarizing film to many. What, exactly, is the intention of Scorsese here? What are his feelings towards the notion of celebrity and the consequences that come with it? These are questions open to interpretation, but what isn't is the magnificently memorable manner in which Scorsese approaches this material.Everything great about this film begins and ends with two performances; those of Robert De Niro as the quirky, obnoxious and thorough wanna-be comedian Rupert Pupkin and Jerry Lewis as the professional, straightforward Jerry Langford. These performances glue everything else together as they create a relationship in which one is going to get what he wants one way or the other. Indeed, both Jerry and Rupert have much in common in that they both view comedy and television as the pinnacle of greatness, a path to fame, fortune and love from others. However, where Jerry is calm, methodical and willing to remain professional, Rupert is much more brash which makes up the main plot line.As the story progresses, I can understand why many people would be put off by such a film, which is totally uncharacteristic for Scorsese, De Niro and Lewis. All three are working against their usual personalities, which may be why this film works so well. De Niro is doing a Lewis-type performance while Lewis remains much more stoic and Travis Bickle-like introverted. Scorsese paces the film wonderfully while at the same time hardly giving any laughs at all. Some would call this a black comedy, but comedy is very hard to come by. In a way, this is similar to the usual Mean Streets and Taxi Driver Scorsese has been categorized by. Like Travis Bickle, Pupkin is lonely, anxious and willing to do anything to be noticed and make a difference. I would argue that neither character intends initially to bring harm to people. Yet, when they see no other alternative, they go with what is available.In the years since, many have either disregarded or ignored this film, but I would say it's one of Scorsese's best, right up there with Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. Maybe it's the setting and approach that's different, not the character.",

            "content": "It may be heresy to say but this may be perhaps De Niro's finest performance. The sympathy that he evokes is the bedrock on which The King of Comedy is able to be more than just a satirical stab at the celebrity culture that seems even more prevalent now. Why this works is because his Rupert Pupkin has a sort of fake pleasantness about him that allows him to worm his way under and past regulations that would bar people like Travis Bickle, for example. De Niro has this quality in Taxi Driver too, but here it seems even more pathetically earnest because there is no real threat of violence or predatory obsessiveness. He smiles a little too often, he eases and reassures, and maintains respectable boundaries as much he can, even though inside he must be jumping out of his skin. It's such a thin line to tread between the boundaries of uncomfortableness, but Pupkin is less a guy you want to get away from immediately and more a guy that you hope will leave you alone if you just do what he wants for now. Problem is, he is persistent. Scorsese has added a few little touches here and there to emphasis the disillusionment of Pupkin. The backgrounds are dim and flat, much like those cardboard cut-outs he converse with and his life when not dipping his head into fantasy, and if you look closely and pay enough attention you will actually spot extras in the distance staring intently at Pupkin himself. No doubt this is a manifestation of his dreams and does lend further credence to those who the ending is all in his head. The switching between the two realities does not happen with any real indication, further blurring the boundaries. In one instance an imaginary conversation between him and Jerry Lewis is shot in the conventional shot-reverse-shot style, only Pupkin in his eager modesty is home along in his mother's basement rather than in the lavish restaurant. Later Scorsese slowly pulls out to reveal the grimy emptiness of the room (I recall a similar shot in Glengarry Glen Ross). Actually compared to his companion Matha who also obsesses over Jerry Lewis Pupkin is rather sane in some segments. The line is tread ever so carefully. We see, in his repeated attempts at wooing the bartender Rita, that he is not nearly as socially inept as we expect him to be. Scorsese dangles a line for the audience and Rita, slowly lulling us into a little bit of false sense of security, charming us with lines that target Rita's loneliness, and then caps it all off with a tiny little transgression, his beaming sense of pride at having his own autograph as the top prize in his collection. Rita has only a small part, but is extremely well written. We sense that even as she sees Pupkin's eccentricities and breathes a sign of relief at him declining the offer for coffee she is still a lonely bundle of low self esteem and on some nights a small-time charmer like Pupkin just might do. If anything, he is at least courteous and respectful to her, which is why he is so easily swept up into his daytrip lie. The way she shrivels up in embarrassment having been so stupid to believe his fantasies in Lewis' home is perfect. And at the very bottom of the loneliness ladder, below even these two, is the nutcase Masha. In her few appearances she is manically screaming and obsessing over Jerry Lewis like there is no other meaning in her life. And it's true. In that quiet, faux-intimate scene, she has finally landed the man of her dreams, and conventional stories tell her that she needs to dress up and prepare a candlelit dinner (complete with a tied up guest). This is the only real opportunity for her to actually talk, and she responses by opening up the floodgates and releasing a myriad of childhood and mental problems that we would never have considered. Her vulnerability is so obvious that it leads to Lewis easily persuading her to untie him. And then just before he escapes, he cruelly slaps her down despite her never really posing a threat to him. It's the sort of celebrity lie that Scorsese tries to attack; that glittery, affable funny-man who becomes a pointed, harsh critic off-screen. So it does seem apt that his dismissal of Pupkin would mean that his appearance on the show is not the train-wreck we expect. It's good, even, for a couple of light chuckles. We can see he really belongs on the stage with his body language, gestures and timing (the assistant was right about this - the flip-side is his laughable timing on the kidnapping cue cards). The routine is a perfect blend of comedy and melancholy - for Pupkin his whole life was leading up to this 5 minute moment of fame where he was on top of it all, and it will never be as good again. Scorsese holds back on the moments right after we see the clip - he does not ever linger on any jovial audience, hysterical shrieking or applause, the surprised TV executives, or even the look of admiration from Rita. All in all it's a little sad. If only Jerry Lewis hadn't immediately written off Pupkin as a lunatic (even if he might deserve it - the firing squad joke was a hit after all). If only we didn't marginalise people like Masha and just sat down and listened to them for a while. But that's not the way showbiz works.",

He has concocted the idea that sits deep like a reality in his mind that he has befriended late night show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), who is going to give him his shot. As the viewer you must decide what is a reality and what is all just going on in Rupert's head. I love that as a viewer especially with talents like De Niro and a great director like Martin Scorsese who are showing it to you. Rupert believes the fantasies more than the reality that he is in. Sandra Bernhard also stars as his friend Masha, who also has some serious mental health problems, but she is in love with Jerry.I thought Lewis did a wonderful job in the film. In comparison to De Niro, he doesn't have a lot of dialogue, but his performance is more in watching his reaction to things that are happening around him. I do believe Scorsese is a great director and could be the best living director around today. I really enjoy his comedies and usually they are pretty black, like AFTER HOURS. He also has some serious messages in his comedies. But, to some viewers they might find them a little on the weird side.Sadly, this film was a bomb at the box office only to find its life later. You can make comparisons between this film and an earlier Scorsese/De Niro film in TAXI DRIVER. Also the recent box office gem THE JOKER takes some big inspiration from this film.Also starring Tony Randall, Shelley Hack, Victor Borge and Scorsese himself has a cameo as the TV director of Jerry Langford's show.",

But... a complete disconnection with reality leading to extreme obnoxiousness, self degradation, and an adoration expressing itself, paradoxically, with a total disrespect for the personal life of the adored one - here the celebrity literally becomes the fan's \"thing\".And what, might you ask, happens to the crackpot fan? Why, he writes a book about his crackpotness and becomes famous.Sounds familiar? Walk into any bookstore, open your TV: the Rupert Pupkins are everywhere.

But being a true believer in himself, Pupkin won't give up and comes up with the ultimate plan to appear on The Jerry Langford Show: kidnap the host.For those who think Scorsese is just a guy who does heavy dramas, you're right; The King of Comedy is no comedy, it's a creepy, visionary tale about a self-delusional man without a life who stalks better people than him because he thinks the world owes him something for having done absolutely nothing, for never having proved himself before an audience. That's Rupert Pupkin, a man who thinks he just needs a great break to show what a comedy genius he is. It's a movie about modern times, in which everyone is brought up thinking they can have anything without struggling for it.Robert DeNiro is perfect, always, as a superficially-calm man who's boiling with rage beneath his skin.

It is done well and mixes drama and comedy to make a film that is hugely enjoyable but also has a very unpredictable plot which shows us how much people can go to get near there celebrity idols. In the end I felt this film was safely very good, and here below is why so.The story is well timed and for the length that it is, it plays out very well as a plot. In the end you come out thinking \"was that a comedy, or a drama\" well in a sense it is both but because it contains so much of both, you may be think it just one of the genres. It takes maybe a little while to truly get stuck into the plot but it is worth it by the end as the ending is very unpredictable and will leave you with a sense of what is going on here.Robert De Niro in the main role as Rupert Pupkin is very good and shows all his class that we don't always see in a comedy role, this is perhaps his most diverse performance ever in film. Jerry Lewis as the chat show host is calm and comfortable in the role and to say he is a comedian in real life, he lets others take the funny bits as if to say Jerry isn't allowed to be the funny on there, he has to take it by others. The rest of the cast do well but no one stands out as much as De Niro really and no wonder Scorsese and him work together so well.Now on to Martin Scorsese he directs this well and really brings the script alive with his commanding role that in my opinion, is the reason De Niro is such a good actor here. He seemed to bring the best out of everyone but also with the solid script he had to work with, it is no wonder it works so well to listen to and to watch. It has some good bits of humour, not chocked full but could pleasantly entertain some fans of Drama comedies.There isn't much wrong with this film but what I will say is that it could lack enough humour to be funny, and that maybe the story isn't the smartest Scorsese has ever done, maybe the most fun but not smarter than most he does. I think the comedy also changes too much and bits are funny then it goes away for long spells only to randomly come back with it's more humorous ramblings, funny bits are funny though. Any Scorsese fan should love this, as I say maybe won't have you struck by the power of it, but will still thoroughly entertain you and you know it is by him it done so well. Most people should enjoy this as it contains all the elements a comedy drama must have and some very if not weirdly likable characters in it. Some may dislike this as it can be very quiet at times and slow compared to the beginning pace, but most should have positive thoughts after watching this.Overall I give this a 8/10, it is a Safely Good Movie, not near to being Great in my opinion like so many others think, but I still felt it was very good like I say and that makes it very very fun. With this you have to marvel at the acting skills involved and may even serve as a cult film to some as we really get to explore the mind of Pupkin and why is he so obsessed with Stand up on the Jerry Langford show, and Jerry Langford himself.",

De Niro's character in this film is essentially Travis Bickle-he is delusional (constantly dreaming about his imaginary friendship/rivalry with Jerry Lewis' character), socially awkward, and is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. Unlike \"Taxi Driver\" however, De Niro has an accomplice in the form of the crazy female fan and his motivation is clear-to get some airtime in Jerry Lewis' show. I think in this film, Scorsese uses less of his usual visual and editing flare, and focuses on the story-it's quite refreshing to watch especially after something like \"Raging Bull\".

But somehow there's no joy in watching him do his thing, even though Deniro plays the part really well. Maybe he plays it to well? Movies like that as meant to be uncomfortable, but there's also meant to be something there to latch on to, and I just couldn't find it in this movie.The last part of the movie, which I won't spoil, redeems is and makes it worth watching. That's more a straight forward comedy though, with several funny scenes and some good character moments. I'm not skilled enough as a watcher to know what went right in the last part, or what I'm missing in the first, but either way the movie disappointed me. Despite all it has going for it.",

            "content": "Like Raging Bull before it, The King of Comedy is a masterpiece whose cinematic brilliance has become more appreciated with the passing of time. Having said that, the film has little more than cult status: an oddity to casual De Niro fans and an unsettling irrelevance to those hardcore followers who only want to see him play tough guys. If his more acclaimed role of Travis Bickle presents an obviously deranged individual, then De Niro's performance as Rupert Pupkin is, in some ways, more unsettling. Indeed, it is hard at times to decide whether we should view Pupkin's pathetic fantasy world as an exercise in comedy, or indicative of the darkest recesses of human delusion. To my mind, the scenes of Rupert sat in his bedroom cum mock studio living out fantasy conversations with his idol are far more disturbing than anything in Taxi Driver. His performance, especially in those embarrassing scenes of persistence with Jerry Langford's secretary, is masterful. De Niro's performance is ably assisted by a brilliantly under-played role from Jerry Lewis. Sandra Bernhard is equally fabulous as the manic Masha. What sets it apart from other films is that it presents the audience with a question of who is really the crazy one? Pupkin or the millions of people like him stuck in dead-end jobs. That he eventually succeeds seems to prove that, ultimately, that it is western culture that is really to blame. This is a funny, disturbing, compelling and thought-provoking film which really is a tour De force of contemporary cinema.",

It's about a 34-year old nerd(De Niro) who dreams about becoming a big stand up comedian just like his idol. A popular host for a talk show(Lewis). It shows the backsides of being famous and it does it very well. It has a very timing and you laugh but the film is far from being just a comedy. It had a tense to become a little uncomfortable sometimes( a style that I did not quite like) but entertaining all the time and for me I would give it a very strong 8/10(Which is very good).

Talking of which; I have heard from several sources that this is considered the best; or certainly one of the best; performances from Robert De Niro. I must say his portrayal of Rupert Pupkin is quite stunning and I'm struggling to disagree with that assessment. I also thought Jerry Lewis did and excellent job as Jerry Langford; a more serious role for him and I thought he played it very well. Also worthy of note were; Diahnne Abbott as Rita Keane and Sandra Bernhard as Masha.I love the way Scorsese switches the action between reality and Pupkin's fantasies and back again. It really keeps the audience guessing just what is real and what is coming from inside Pupkin's head. This is where De Niro really shines; it's his performance that gives it credence; Pupkin's delusions become real because Ne Niro makes them appear so. It's a masterful performance I must admit. As to the mystery; well, is the ending real or is it another of Pupkin's fantasies? Scorsese leaves us no clues which I think is pretty cool.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 9.2/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",

Both movies feature the character rising up to fame by doing something extreme.It is the losers wet dream, only if I could do this or that I can be famous.In \"King of Comedy\" Robert De Niro plays Rupert Pupkin, a loser who idealises a talk show host Jerry Langford played brilliantly by Jerry Lewis. When he gets to talk to Jerry his fantasies of close friendship with a great star begin to take over reality.To make his fantasy comedy career come true he decides it is better to kidnap Jerry Langford than to spend years on the comedy circuit. Do such extreme measures pay off.It is up to you to decide.....after all is the ending reality or dream.Is the movie worth watching. Well, I have long grown out of Rupert style dreams. I have succeeded by hard work and had fantastic opportunities and stuffed them up.I think the movie spends too much time telling us he is a loser. Perhaps this is because Scorsese wants to convince us that there is no other way out for Rupert expect the extreme one. However it fails to convince me. Once the kidnap part of the movie starts the story telling becomes more interesting but as this is the fantasy come true not enough time is spent on the characters inner development.Watch it if you still dream that the only way to make it big is to have your break, and that once you make it big everyone who was ever bad to you will now worship and apologise for their wrong doing (as opposed to selling your loser stories to the tabloid press just to tell everyone you are really a loser) and the dream girl will be yours.Oh, one other thing...Bob (Mr De Niro to you) you are a great actor, one of the world's finest, an actors actor, but baby...don't do comedy. In movies like Brazil you are fantastically funny because you are playing it straight and understand the characters motivation. But Bob baby, but comedy involves more than a funny face and waving your arms about...you only got away with it here because the character is meant to be a loser...but I have seen you do the same in other movies (don't worry, they are our little secret and I won't tell the reader about them).",

            "content": "First: while i don't believe the king of comedy is scorese's finest is still a very good film. First because it is crazy: but at the same time there's something relateable to rupert pupkin - his dreams and aspirations are something we can identify ourselves in. his \"dream sequences\" might sound a bit far-fetched but i bet almost anyone already daydreamed about contexts like the ones the movie presents. he's completely delusional sure, but... is he different from so many people that walk to some reality shows thinking they're going to be famous just for 15 minutes?was andy warhol's sentence somehow present here? I believe so. Rupert has a very sad life: he's 34 years old, lives with his mom seems alone, jobless with only one purpose: meet and become someone like Jerry the comedian he admires. He's not the only one: there's also Masha that dreams to own Jerry's body. But he behaves in such a creepy way that makes us laugh while being uncomfortable - the movie gives us reasons to believe he can commit something very wrong to Jerry. But is Jerry a happy character?Nope. He also seems alone. He doesn't seem to have many friends. He doesn't live with his mom sure but it appears that he lives only for himself: rupert and masha live for him too. They portrait our generation of fandom that is able to do the weirdest things in order to touch their idols. But at the same time to become someone famous - and receive the validation from that in an heartbeat. Rupert doesn't want to go to shows to start his material - he seeems he can do anything to become the king of comedy: on his mind he already is - that's why he doesn't want to take big steps towards his goal.The answer the movie gives at the end seems perfect for me. Because we can relate to what happens now where you can be famous by leaking a porn film or saying something nasty on tv. He might be everything only in our head and instead of trying harder for yourself you make the world try harder for you. when you live in your own mind that is what happens. the script is very genious on portraying a society travel a path that concluded in what we're now.there are a bunch of dark funny moments, mostly cause by the complete delusion rupert lives - the comedy of the embarassment - in way perfected by ricky gervais in the office: the most delusional guy ever. deniro is perfect as a borderline funny/ criminal/ creepy rupert pupkin and probably deserved an oscar nomination. I also enjoyed Diahnne Abbot and Jerry Luis, even the actress who does Rita- But the niro wins here. Scoresese gives more space for the script to grow but we can se he was having fun while doing is.conclusion: while not being by favourite scorsese there's a lot of content you can take from here. there's definitely enough material here to be way more than just a dark comedy - but a criticism about celebrity culture and how celebrities are creted - and why people fall on this illusions. is a very clever, funny, well acted and directed film. That should be more regarded in scorsese's career than it is. Is no raging bull but it's a very good and smart movie.",

The storyline is nothing grand, and the acting is passing fair, but it is the little psychological pieces that keep poking in that make this movie an interesting one to watch. This is not a typical Jerry Lewis film by any means. He is not a comedian in this film (of course, I know many who think, 'he's not a comedian in any film'). He plays the straight man, a rather sour and jaded entertainment professional. Robert DeNiro (as Rupert Pupkin) and Sandra Bernhard (as Marsha) play two star-struck fans who have focused their lives on Jerry Langford (Lewis' character) to the extent that they are imagining weekend outings with him and knitting sweaters for him. The story largely revolves around Rupert's desire to be a comic and appear on Langford's Tonight Show-style talkshow.In an interesting twist, given the Tonight Show character of the show, the movie features cameos from many old talkshow stand-bys, including Victor Borge, Dr. Joyce Brothers, and Tony Randall.As Rupert and Marsha compete with each other to outdo the other in establishing a 'relationship' with Langford (everything from owning memorabilia to autographs to event attendance) Rupert's imagination keeps concocting more elaborate relationships, which he finally fails to be able to distinguish from reality. This comes to a confrontation when he travels out to Langford's weekend home (with an unsuspecting woman in tow) and gets ejected from the home by Langford and told, in no uncertain terms, that he is neither known nor wanted.At this point, being confronted with a painful reality, Rupert decides upon drastic action, and with the assistance of Marsha, kidnaps Langford and holds him for ransom, the ransom being an appearance on the show.Rupert's fantasies include being married to his high school crush on the show, by his old principal, who apologises for not seeing the worth in Rupert; Langford pleading with a resistant Rupert to guest host the show; essentially, in Rupert's fantasies, everything wrong with his life gets put right. But will reality prove as accommodating?This is dark humour, to be sure, and the pace can be rather slow. But this movie is largely overlooked, and deserves a bit more attention for the interesting psychological devices in the story.",

It's a Martin Scorsese film that I think is often forgotten and I actually had no idea it existed until about a year ago and I thought it was good. It has very good performances by Robert De Niro and Jerry Lewis, and I thought the characters were very interesting, especially Rupert Pupkin (De Niro).Pupkin is a psychopath who is obsessed with being on Jerry Lewis' show so he can become famous as a stand up comedian. De Niro's performance is pretty compelling and I thought there were many similarities to Taxi Driver, as far as the character goes. Pupkin is a very interesting character to watch and it's just entertaining to see how he reacts to the world around him and he's a strangely sympathetic character as well. Jerry Lewis' character is also great. I loved how he's presented as a very famous person who seems like a nice person but is just tired of the public eye and I think Scorsese and Lewis did a great job in portraying these emotions. These are the things I liked the most about King of Comedy, I think it's a movie completely driven by the performances and the compelling characters.Unlike Taxi Driver however, King of Comedy is a very straight forward film as far as directing and cinematography goes. The movie doesn't really have any moment that stands out and it just feels like the whole movie we are watching these characters interact with the environment but since the direction is pretty straightforward there's almost no artistic stamp on the movie, so it doesn't really feel like a Scorsese film.Because our main character is so stubborn and is completely set on accomplishing his goal, the movie does seem a little repetitive at times and the best word to describe it would be frustrating. Frustrating in the sense that the characters are frustrating and the way they end up interacting with each other is frustrating. They experience no arc. There is no catharsis so in the end as a viewer it feels unsatisfying.The King of Comedy is not a perfect film, but it's a movie that did something different and it features great performances and compelling characters, even if the story may be frustrating at times, I can't deny I was invested in Pupkin and his actions. 7.0/10",

De Niro gives a fantastic performance here as the celebrity stalker and creates great amounts of tension and really made me squirm with awkwardness due to his character being so relentless and unable to take a hint. This is definitely one of De Niro's greatest performances. Jerry Lewis is also brilliant here; his dry, impatient character is brilliantly written and he performs it almost as if it is actually him. His best scene is towards the end with Sandra Bernhard who plays this incredibly unstable stalker. She is absolutely fantastic here and both her and Lewis worked great together in that scene.The plot on paper looks fairly predictable but Scorsese has managed to make it seem so new. Dialogue from all characters was written so well and that was crucial for this film. You don't expect the characters to say certain things, particularly Bernhard who shocks you sometimes and can be hilarious.Overall, if you are a fan of Scorsese's work you will like this; it's not something you would assume Scorsese to direct but it works well. If you've never seen a Scorsese or De Niro film then this is a great film to start with. It is definitely worth a watch and it deserves a lot more attention that in gets.",

            "content": "Turns out, that was Martin Scorsese. He thinks that he \"probably should not have made this film\". I can't see why, as I found it excellent on so many levels.Amongst the likes of Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Casino in Scorcese's department, it's easy to over look this film. If you've seen it, you can probably understand why I see this as a movie whose sotry is parallel to Taxi Driver. A guy who is \"different\" becomes obsessed with something/someone in both films. Some scenes are very similar. Both movies have open endings. Both are quite saddening. And this one is very funny! To call it a parody of the ground-breaking classic would be going too far, however, as The King of Comedy is still its own movie.The acting is top notch. Sandra Bernhard is great as the freaky, obsessive woman. Jerry Lewis gives a great performance. His actions and reactions really seem realistic, especially in the scene where Rupert Pupkin comes into his home without permission. But, once again, the show belongs to De Niro. He doesn't play the lovable, obsessed weirdo. He IS the lovable, obsessive weirdo. His engrossing dialogue, unusual facial and hand expressions, and even his moustache kept my eyes glued to the screen. Pupkin may be different, but you always understand his motives and feel for him greatly in certain points in the movie.De Niro has always amazed me, but the fact that he seems to understand this character so well is a little overwhelming. Whether he is delivering cringeworthy gags to a cardboard audience, or embarrassing himself, obliviously, in front of Jerry Lewis, his consistency is amazing. His motives are understandable to anyone who's ever had a dream. Perhaps it's De Niro's early ambition as an actor, that fuelled this shamefully overlooked performance.Its very funny, too. Not fall-off-your-dinosaur-and-get-trampled-by- martians funny, but the film provides enough laugh out loud moments. Comedy is not the main thing about the movie, however, and it's more about what lengths a man would go to be something, even if it's just for a night.Travis Bickle from \"Taxi Driver\" and Rupert Pupkin from \"The King of Comedy\" are not as unlike as they may first appear. They are men desperately searching for some meaning in their spiritually empty lives, neither man connecting with anyone else; the consequent strain drives each to his own brand of insanity.This is one of those films that leaves you with mixed emotions (kinda like One flew over the Cuckoo's nest), and in a good way. There are a some particular scene that highlight Rupert Pupkin determined nature in refusing to acknowledge the fact that he doesn't know Jerry Langford. He goes so far, in fact, that you gradually start to question his mental stability. It is then you realized that you are watching a pretty emotional drama about a nobody who dreams of being a somebody\u0085all disguised under the label 'comedy'.This is widely thought to be 'Minor' Scorsese in action. But I disagree. It's one of his best.Final Word: Underrated.My rating: 8.5 /10\"Better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime.\"Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/2012/04/09/movie-review- the-king-of-comedy/",

A film that does not deal with the mafia or the decadence of a man.\nIn 'The King of Comedy' we see how Rupert Pupkin tries to achieve his dream of being a comedian, taking increasingly questionable steps. This story, Scorsese does not treat it as a drama of decadence, but on the contrary with a very comical, almost satirical tone. And it's clearly good to see how the director controls not only the Gangsters drama, but whatever genre he sets out to. In this case he uses 'The King of Comedy' as a tribute to the comic strips of previous years, even naming several of the most recognized comedians in the cinematographic medium. And of course, there's Jerry Lewis, who delivers an outstanding performance. But it is Robert De Niro who steals the spotlight, with one of his best performances and one of the most underrated as well.\nThere is nothing more to say, but this is further proof of the great talent of Scorsese and De Niro, two great artists who when they join are dynamite, as the great Rupert Pupkin would say.",

De Niro stars as Rupert Pupkin, the would-be stand-up whose ambition is far more impressive than his act. He is obsessed with becoming a star, and goes to extreme lengths when talk-show host Jerry Langford (Lewis) refuses him a slot on his programme.De Niro is both tragic and ghastly as the over-ambitious, psychotic Pupkin, trapped in a weird fantasy world, while Lewis is, ironically, funnier than he has ever been in what is technically the straight-man role.A deliciously dark commentary on the fine line between fame and infamy, which goes to great lengths to show just how far some people will go to achieve the former.Verdict Worlds away from the bravura flash of other DeNiro-Scorsese collaborations, this underrated, claustrophobic, chilling satire is particularly prescient of today's celebrity-fixated society.

Sandra Berhard won a National Society of Film Critics' Best Supporting Actress Award for her intense, psychotic Masha and if you look closely at the scenes she plays with DeNiro, you'll see something very interesting: her ability to dominate any alpha male.  She's the only female that can run circles around television boys David Letterman and Howard Stern -leaving them looking cornered and speechless- by simply playing their game.  She does the same thing here with Jerry Lewis and Robert DeNiro; it's a performance she's never equaled as an actor.    Scorsese's dark humor and satirical eye are not as predominant as they once were and his movies now are proficient, yet uneventful.

They'd look up at the monitor, watch for a bit, then move closer, standing at the television, fascinated.  After a few minutes (or, in one case, a half hour), they would turn to the register and ask, \"What IS this?  Who IS that?\"Well, it's Robert DeNiro.  At the time, he was nearly unrecognizable physically, and the performance is so far from what you expect a DeNiro performance to be that the viewer can easily be disoriented.  (The camerawork, beautifully done, is so restrained it's hard to recognize Scorsese's performance, as well.)  Of course, the team's typical themes of relentless obsession are evident, but this is a giddy, horrifying, auto wreck of a film.  It runs a little long, but it's worth it.

De Niro heads up his usual role as some form of delusional spirited protagonist. I was surprised to see that this film was shot after 'Raging Bull' and yet follows with many of the elements of 'Taxi Driver' except not as cool (minus blood and guns).

            "content": "Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro have teamed up to make great films eight times. This is one of them and in my opinion is the most underrated and the most complex (tied with Taxi Driver). The story follows Rupert Pupkin, an aspiring comedian who wants to get onto a talk show to perform his comedy act. In essence, as you will see as the film progresses, Rupert is a saddo and a moron, making for an interesting and diverse character. Robert De Niro gives his most underrated performance as Rupert Pupkin with such difference from his normal roles that you hardly recognise the rough tough gangster actor. De Niro's character clearly stands out because of his personality, dress and difference from other people, in fact, he faintly reminded me of Travis Bickle. Watching Jerry Lewis was a pleasure, he brought such an aura to the movie that his performance seemed effortless, although I can good and well tell it was not. Scorsese brought a side to the film with his directing that I found fascinating, the way the story was told was quite mesmerising and brilliant to see, like in many of his films he actually had a brief cameo, watch out for that. Set and costumes were great in this, especially the costume of Rupert Pupkin which definitely showed the flamboyance of the character (reminding me ever so slightly of Johnny Boy's costume in Mean Streets). Also Jerry's house set was great and really showed and emphasised his characters personality, the way of showing character in this movie was very different to how it is done in say, The Deer Hunter in which it takes a full hour of rather boring film making to introduce each characters, whereas in this film you are learning things about all of the characters immediately with clever dialogue and clear and for the most part brilliant acting. Overall this is a brilliant film and is probably one of the best collaborations between Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese, although it must be noted that the casual movie watcher may think that this film is a comedy but it is by no means a comedy, it is a dark and complex drama and although it is a PG is still quite disturbing. A great film to watch when you want something that will stick, for a long time. 10/10",

            "content": "This was definitely a fascinating movie to me in regards to see what lengths some people will go in order to achieve fame, and perhaps to make any dreams that they have come true. Some of which were admirable, whereas others I seriously have to draw the line and would hope others would too. I thought De Niro was excellent as Rupert Pupkin, as this struggling comedian desperate for fame. His character Rupert is friends with a woman named Masha, played by comedienne Sandra Bernhard. I didn't know she was actually acting this far back, but that being said I thought she was really good in this, and kind of creepy to be honest. Truthfully, I found her to be much creepier than Rupert. Rupert wants desperately to appear on The Jerry Langford Show as a guest and Masha is a super-obsessed fan that loves Jerry. It kind of makes sense that they're friends, given their narrow-focused obsessions towards the same person, albeit for different reasons. Jerry Langford is played by none other than the late Jerry Lewis. I'm very young, so I haven't seen any Jerry Lewis movies but I thought he was fantastic in this one. There's also a woman that Rupert is involved with played by Diahnne Abbott who does a fine job as well. I do feel like this movie is well directed by Martin Scorsese, and it looks really good too. I even like the set design of the reception area of Jerry Langford's office. There's another scene where Rupert is standing with his back turned in front of a huge blown-up black-and-white picture of a crowd and the camera pans out while a soundtrack of laughter is playing over the scene that I thought was mesmerizing to look at. I'll say that the themes in this movie are relevant today in a lot of ways, and all the more perhaps with the advent of social media. But it's real easy to see where the movie is going based upon its set-up. And the ending to me does compromise because it doesn't commit to what I thought was going to be the ending. Don't get me wrong. It's a movie and I can live with the ending they chose but at the same time I was like \"yeah, right\". But it was definitely an interesting character piece by Scorsese for sure.",

Along with supporting roles from Jerry Lewis and Sandra Bernhard. The film is underrated in my opinion, and is a gem in Scorsese's large body of work. It was so ahead of its time, and is very relevant in todays culture. The film is not very violent, or wild, or extreme, like most of Scorsese's other work. Rather it is more tame, as far violence goes. However the film is a dark, sad, and uncomfortable comedy. And it makes you really look at yourself and the culture of the world. De Nrio gives a great perfomance, different from a lot of his roles,d while Jerry Lewis and Sandra Bernhard do solid jobs in their roles. The film is very mature, yetfollows a very immature character. This film is about the danger of celebrity worship, entitlement, delusion, and a constant search of acknowledgement and validation in humans, through attempting fame at whatever the cost. Rupert has no care for the art of comedy. He really doesnt want to work on his material or get better at his act, he wants to be famous. He wants to be in Jerry Langford's position. He was bullied by his peers, and set aside by his parents as a kid, so all he wants is acknowledgement and validation. He is insecure, self pitying, but most of all greatly naive and deluded. In the end, the fillm can be interpreted in two ways, either he went to jail, got out early, lived his 15 minutes of fame, and it ended there, meaning he imagined the very end where he was still in the spotlight. Or he went to jail, got out early, and actually became infamous for what he did, making him a figure of that. Whether he ends up liking it or not is up to interpretation. The film is so relevant, because it discusses how people need to be validated, and a way to do that it become famous. They have unresolved problems in their lives from their past, that they want to tie up. This a common thing that people attempt to do in current culture, along with the obsession of celebrities in the spotlight, doing everything you can to meet them or get in their position. They are just people. Maybe Rupert imagined the ending, and in reality he is back out on the street with nothing, or still in jail. Or maybe he became infamous past his 15 minutes, maybe he likes it, now maybe he realizes it not that great. This film is a underrated gem. Tragic, Telling, funny, and true",

I usually only buy a flic after seeing it a few times and KNOWING that I would actually watch it over and over again.  But since I had done a scene from this movie in an acting class, I felt a bit of a connection to it...nuff said. So, Rupert is a very likable guy.  I didn't see him as the least bit stalker-ish or violent (unlike Mr. Bickle), which makes his decision to actually kidnap Jerry more unpredictable, but yet logical.  He of course never intended to harm anybody, he just wanted to be noticed.  Nothing wrong with that eh?  I mean here's just a nice, simple, misunderstood guy, who wants a celebrity life to prove to his parents/teachers/high school classmates that he IS somebody.  Tell me that we all don't wish that at some level.  He's a bit shrewd by getting Jerry alone to talk with him, but since he was a bit naive, didn't understand he was getting the brush off.  The bottomline...was Rupert Pupkin's act funny?  Actually I thought it was...tragic in the sense of how truthful it was, but yet he did have a nice comic outlook on it...best line: \"come on, hit me...don't you WANT to graduate\"  Do I think Rupert knew what was going to become of him after his performance...I'm not sure.  I don't think he really planned the media explosion, or maybe he did, and thus he is even MORE maniacal than Travis Bickle.  But the point is Scorsese nailed the satire on the media, especially with how we sensationalize celebrities today.  Hell, there are countless \"personalities\" who are only famous for being famous...and I would say Rupert would be one of those.  His self-initiated fame will probably end, since he had nothing to back it up with...I loved his \"show\" after he got out of jail...it was just him standing there and the announcer saying \"give it up for Rupert Pupkin\" over and over and over again...like that was the whole act.  Not a foundation for true fame, but I don't think Rupert cares. Anyways, a fantastic movie.  I liked all the characters (even if I'm not a Sandra Bernhardt fan).  I did think Masha? was disturbing and yes VERY stalker-ish, oh and NOT sexy...(even if you were taped to a chair, do you actually WANT to do it with HER? *laughs*) Rent it or buy it...you'll connect and enjoy it.",

This man is compulsively awful, from the clothes he wears, to his slick hair and that trim little moustache, to the ingratiating sing-song \"Hell-oo\" he uses on the telephone. The constant tie-straightening, the condescending bend of the head, all these mannerisms build up a remarkably solid protrayal of a dreadful person who probably exists.While he is funny to an observer, the dark side of Rupert lies in the fantasy world inside his head: a world where being famous melts away your mediocrity and makes you sophisticated, urbane, witty and above all envied by the 'suckers' who didn't make it. (His TV hero, the avuncular Jerry Langford, actually appears to be an isolated, lonely, possibly even anti-social man off-screen). Rupert never listens to what is actually said to him and even believes his imagined conversations really happened.We now live in the world of 'Big Brother' and 'Popstars' where it seems anybody can be 'famous' (at least for Andy Warhol's 15 minutes). When the film was made in 1983 the final sequence probably seemed outrageously unlikely, now it looks like social prophecy. A final thought: Rupert Pupkin finds a way out.

The movie's not a masterpiece or something but its really solid and enjoyable. The beauty of the movie is that throughout the movie one would think Rupert Pupkin would fail miserably... Flaw after flaw after pathetic flaws; but he doesn't fail... He comes out as a winner... He shines bright... The end as well as the movie is really classic...

Robert DeNiro's performance as Pupkin is absolutely devastating: there's a superb scene at Jerry's, when he gets kicked off by security, in which he tries to remain cool and respectable, and it's simply amazing. Jerry Lewis is also great (although I personally never liked him in comedy... sorry) in a drama role, but is still DeNiro's show.His stand-up comedy show is also great, when you realize how right he was when he said (while he imagined himself being complimented by Jerry) that he makes great comedy out of his own misery. Finally, the ending is not too clear: we're witnessing reality or one of Pupkin's imaginations?SAY NO MORE",

This could be the film's genius. We laugh at his idiocy, his persistence, his stupid clothes... but the problem is his actual act, and his jokes, STINK. It's a great twist. It's also just a little painful and scary too. Not scary in a blood splattered over the walls kind of scary, but frightening in its reality and its astuteness. There's a complexity to this movie that is too often lacking in many Hollywood movies, but Scorsese doesn't lay the complexity on too thick nor does it come over as too clever for its own good... the characters may be cocky or obnoxious, but the filmmaking never is. And to answer lulu_153's question - I think the guy in the restaurant alone is meant to be there... he's simply listening in to the conversation Pupkin is having with Rita and laughing at his idiocy. It's beautifully observed because it's what people do.I'd recommend King of Comedy very highly. It has the kind of title that if you came across it while browsing in a video store, you might ignore it... but forget the title, forget the PG certification. See this and you'll find something sharper, funnier, and more entertaining than a lot of stuff out there.",

            "content": "this film is not a film that I'll likely revisit to watch again, but the meaning I derive from it will definitely linger on, and for this I'll highly recommend it. To me It's an disturbing movie about what terrible effects our society's warped idolization of fame can have on people who are utterly disenfranchised from the things in life that gives purpose and meaningIn this film it's obvious that neither the characters who lust for fame, nor the ones who have fame, derive true meaning and purpose from it. In this way, it's an ever relevant film, 35 years after its release, as our culture is ever more idolizing fame for fames sake. And even more of us are disenfranchised from purpose and meaning. I find two interesting sub-plots in the movie that gives it such a high score. The first is what adverse childhood experiences can do to a persons later dis-connect with self-worth, and how the desire to reclaim this sense of worth can lead out to worship false and terrible gods (i.e. Fame). The other is the lens we use to describe the haves, and the have-nots. Our anti-hero Rupert (DeNiro) meets a world where he amounts to nothing, and this drives his lust to attain the position of his idol (Lewis). But because he has not, his character is portray as utterly sad and delusional. If he had that elusive 'star quality', or perhaps more accurately- the means, social position and mental fortitude to manufacture it, we would see him as forceful and driven. The victorious writes history, after all. I'm no filmmaker, but I imagine that the execution of this film has had some effect on its poor reception and lack of status among the other Scorsese/DeNiro collaborations. It's gritty, and in many ways a better story than movie. However, even though the dark undertone and lingering discomfort of this film can make it an hard movie to stay with, as indeed is the quality of the main character himself, it's well worth the watch. The lack of breaks from discomfort makes the film almost nagging. It is also, in my view, thoroughly anti-climactic. There seems to be an ever present excitement building, but it's never truly released, it's only shifted and twisted by small revelations with great impacts on what the movie has to tell us. Nevertheless, these are the qualities that makes this movie for me, and it reminds me to return to films from way back, when in need for movies filled with substance paired with some true grit. In short, an intelligent, relevant and interesting film that you should definitely see.",

            "content": "Most people think Robert De Niro got his comedy start in Meet the Parents. Very few people know Robert De Niro was at one time The King of Comedy, delivering one liners and an unforgettable monologue. He literally brought the house down on the Jerry Langford show. This is not to say that Robert De Niro was in fact a stand up comedian. He was the star of The King of Comedy (1983). De Niro plays Rupert Pupkin, a struggling comedian in his mid 30's. Pupkin idolizes the host of network televisions most popular late show, Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis). Pupkin approaches Langford, after saving him from a teaming mob of fans, about making his debut on the show. Langford, being polite, tells Pupkin to call his office to arrange an appointment. Rupert does not know the 'Hollywood' way of being polite and assumes Langford is serious. Rupert begins calling the show's office trying to arrange a meeting. He finally goes to the office to set up a meeting in person. Rupert speaks to Cathy Long, a talent coordinator for the show and she assumes he is a real aspiring comic. Pupkin makes a tape to show off his talents to Miss Long and Langford. From that point on the film takes an interesting journey through the eyes of an obsessed comedian, determined to make his break into show business.The plot of the movie is phenomenal. It doesn't make any unexpected twists, but it does make some slight turns that were not expected. The story, written by Paul D. Zimmerman, is good, but without a great cast it could not be nearly as successful as it is. Each actor embodies the qualities that make the character unique. Robert De Niro is spectacular in his portrayal of Rupert Pupkin. Once this film is viewed it will be hard to imagine anyone else taking this role to greater heights. De Niro plays Pupkin with an innocence that at many points makes the viewer feel heartbroken. Pupkin's approach to show business is polite and determined, thanking everyone as he leaves the building. De Niro leaves some great awkward pauses between lines, in the conversation with the receptionist, that leave the viewer leaning forward in anticipation.De Niro's portrayal of Pupkin is juxtaposed with Sandra Bernhard's depiction of Masha, another overly obsessed fan. Both characters are obsessed with Langford - just in different ways. Masha stalks Langford, sneaking into his car, waiting outside his office, and following him down the street. She is the true definition of a stalker even making phone calls to his personal residence. When placed side by side Masha and Pupkin are a dynamic duo. Bernhard's lunatic outbreaks and absurd rambling about her love for Langford are priceless.Langford himself is a caricature of many different late night talk show hosts. Jerry Lewis departs from his classic absurd comedy to become an annoyed and stuck-up famous comedian. Lewis keeps his perturbed attitude through the entire picture. At one point Langford and Pupkin have an argument in which Pupkin says 'Well I'm sorry. I made a mistake' and Langford's response is 'So did Hitler.' Lewis portrays Langford as the typical Hollywoodite, having people bring him autograph books to sign and detesting everyone who surrounds him (for their incompetence).The story and actors are brought together by legendary director Martin Scorsese, famous for Gangs of New York, Casino, and Goodfellas. His touch can be felt through the entire film. It is a hard essence to describe, but when shooting De Niro, Scorsese chose to make him powerful yet vulnerable. This shows the character's determination as well as his relative inadequacy.Before anyone passes judgment, this is not the average Scorsese film. Pupkin is a character that is consumed in his delusions of being famous, but is not just a mental case. Aside from being slightly delusional, he is a sweet character who approaches every situation from a na\u00efve point of view. When asked if Mr. Langford was expecting him Pupkin responds 'Yes, I don't think he is.' It is not hard to find one rooting for Rupert to succeed, and not only become famous but to get the girl too. One has to appreciate a character whose motives are based on good instead of evil. The King of Comedy is a drama, a comedy, and a crime film on top of all the rest. Along with those classifications it is also a lovable innocent film about a man who wants nothing more than to be famous. Can you blame him? In the final scene when Pupkin is being introduced, it is hard not to feel some gratification. Rupert Pupkin everybody.",

For whatever reason I expected KofC to give some insight into Jerry Lewis' comedy, and comedy in general. I saw a book called King of Comedy (about Jerry Lewis), so maybe I'll have to investigate that. The film KofC is concerned with formality, procedure, naivet\u00e9', childhood, adolescence, crude, polished crudeness. Though I dislike writing spoilers I must add this detail, because for me it sums up the entire film. Please don't read this if you haven't seen the film, or if you plan on seeing the film without preconception. -stop-. As you know the film is painfully embarrassing, taking extra time to crystallize; deliberate over its own uncomfortable stature. From the beginning we slowly ooze off our seats and couches into the bowels of Dali's paintings like persistence of memory and clocks chime time. But the crux of the film pivots around the fact that it was a plastic gun. Not only are these two (DeNiro & Bernhard) psychotic, delusional, and (possibly) mildly autistic (autism, which basically means a genetic/biological auto-ism, or \"self\"-ism), they are also, in the end, overgrown children. There is an innocence to them, and this innocence is materialized in the plasticity of a gun and foam pellets. So the murder weapon is an Oldenberg. In contrast then, it is the world of celebrity which is cold, rigid, dinosaur, and aging. And it is within this comparison that the Scorsese delivers the punchline of the film. Redemption is too strong of a word, I do not think De Niro is redeemed. But as the film closes, we have witnessed his pathos pathetic-ness, in his lonely and alone celebrity moment of auto-biological-comedy, which we see, not delivered to the TV-live audience, or to us in the theater at home, but to the high school sweetheart of yesteryear. (For which this is all about maybe, but maybe not). But then, there he is standing on the bar, on the bar, like a trapeze artist with his arm around, (the TV), now announcing the king of comedy.",

            "content": "Everyone idolizes someone. Whether it be an athlete, a family member, or a performer, we all aspire to be like someone. For some, however, this love and aspiration is taken deeper, and it becomes one's life goal to literally become their idol. Such an instance is evident in the story of Rupert Pupkin. Infatuated with late night show host Jerry Langford, Rupert is desperate to become the next \"King of Comedy\". When we first meet our protagonist, he is in the middle of the crowd outside the building where the Jerry Langford Show is filmed. After the mob of fans surround's Jerry's car, Rupert manages to get into the car with his idol, and Rupert does his best to spark up a relationship. Insisting that the man call the office, Langford gets out of the car, and Rupert still seems cluelessly optimistic about his career in comedy. Following his chance encounter with Langford, Rupert is insistent that he is worthy of comedic stardom, and even though he is turned down time and time again by the studio, he remains oblivious to the fact that he is going about this the wrong way. Still disillusioned, Pupkin retreats back into his mother's basement, where cardboard cut-outs of Jerry, celebrity guests, and a crowd stand posed in his room. As he carries on his fantasy in his room, the real world that he refuses to face moves on. Still driven by his desire for a slot in the Langford Show for a stand-up set, Rupert resorts to the most desperate of plans, kidnapping the show host himself. With the name \"The King of Comedy\", one may probably think that this is a comedic film. As much as Rupert Pupkin would want it to be a big comedy performance, his story is not one of humor. Though tenacity is a desirable trait in the working world, there comes a point where one must realize that their ambitions are unrealistic. For Rupert, he simply does not think his actions through from the other person's point of view, and his persistence is futile. Taking the \"crazed fan\" persona far past normalcy, Pupkin is seemingly unaware of his odd behavior, which makes him sympathetic in a way. However, this feeling of sympathy dissipates when he kidnaps Langford. This film was made after Scorsese classics Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, and this film shares one common vein with the previous two: an isolated man that struggles against his surroundings and situation. For Travis, Jake, and Rupert, the problems that they face are amplified by the fact that they are at odds with the world that they live in. From a filmmaking standpoint, this film is good, but not up to par with its predecessors. Robert De Niro delivers his signature method acting as usual, but the cast around him don't seem to even the film out. Jerry Lewis isn't his usual funny self (as a kidnapped man usually is), and Sandra Bernhard is utterly....psychotic. This film does not attract the eye with stunning cinematography, but it is still a great Scorsese film.: I didn't like how the film ended. It isn't true to the character of Rupert. Also, the intention of this movie is not to wow the viewer, it is to spark thought. Still a great film, however, and I encourage its viewing. This film, and the character of Rupert, is summed up in one of his biggest lines: \"It's better to be a king for a day rather than a schmuck for a lifetime.\"*Quick Note: though this is a PG-rated film, it's a grown up movie. The idea behind it won't register in a youngsters mind, and an odd scene involving the removal of clothing (down to bra an panties) and invitation for \"doing it\" won't be a wise choice to let a child see*www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",

            "content": "In a filmography spanning nearly fifty years which has taken in everything from gangster epics to gritty dramas, The King of Comedy remains one of Martin Scorsese's odder works. The films recounts the story of Rupert Pupkin, an aspiring comic and celebrity wannabe attempting to land a spot on a late-night television show. Creepy and disturbing, the film is a powerful character study and commentary on our culture's obsession with celebrity.The King of Comedy begins one night when Rupert Pupkin (Robert DeNiro) manages to slip into the limousine of comedian/talk show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), pleading Langford to give him a spot on his show. Langford gives him the number of his agent in an attempt to get rid of him, which leads Pupkin to later stalk Langford's reception office. Eventually kidnapping and holding Langford for ransom, the studio executives decide to give Pupkin a spot, where he performs a bizarre set drawing on his dysfunctional childhood.Throughout history there have been many instances of artists living up to the weight of expectation following a landmark work not by trying to trump it but by doing something completely different. Coming off the massive success of Raging Bull, you sense Scorsese indulging his whims in opting to do something smaller and a lot more art- house, and from the expressionistic shots of Pupkin against a blown-up photograph of a roaring crowd to the general atmosphere of existential isolation, this is one of Scorsese's strangest and most experimental movies by some margin. Special praise must also be given to DeNiro, the film's ability to get under our skin in no small part due to his ability to effectively put across the creepiness and desperation of Pupkin as a character.Though maybe not a cinematic masterpiece on a par with Scorsese's more well-known films, The King of Comedy is still an interesting work which modern movie-goers should revisit. In its commentary on social degeneration through the spectre of one character it can be seen as a sort of companion piece to Scorsese's earlier Taxi Driver. At the very least, the film is another testament to the DeNiro-Scorsese collaboration as one of the great actor-director collaborations in the history of the movies.7/10",

            "content": "i have watched several movies of Martin Scorsese like casino,good fellas,departed,shutter island,wolf of the wall street and enjoyed those very very much. but the king of comedy was a totally different ride for me. as for the comedy aspect i am not saying i had lots of laugh out loud moments, but they managed to keep it interesting throughout the movie, not a single minute of boredom.as my title says this movie is strangely realistic, but i didn't find it strange, but i know there will be people who find this very very strange.let me say why.. at one point protagonist is trying to convince other people, mainly to Jerry Langford, who is his mentor to give him a part in the popular comedy show of the Jerry Langford, and in the next scene we see protagonist is having lunch with jerry Langford and they are friends. at this point i really started to like this movie, because i know that normal people like me do this every time. we picture us with our mentors, we imagine that they are our friends,and we are famous or better than them. i don't know about others,but i always do that.like it depicted on the movie people pronounce my name wrong many times,when people achieve their success they forget who they were, they ignore the people who are below there level, they say they are busy so much that they cant find 10 minutes of there time just to help someone who needs help. if they don't like us they don't have the guts to tell it in person..all this things are brilliantly depicted in this movie.and also this shows us the other side of the story. in this case when someone is famous you get stalked,followed,you get confronted by lots of fake people, so it will be really hard to identify real ones from the fake ones.so if you are not a hot head, if you are just a normal human being who have faced and dealt with different kind of people in your life, if you are down to earth then you are gonna enjoy this movie very very much.",

            "review_title": "8/10. Unusual exploration of the human mind",
            "content": "This film is a black comedy starring Robert De Niro and Jerry Lewis, written by Paul Zimmerman and directed by Martin Scorsese.It's about a Rupert Pupkin(De Niro) who obsesses with becoming a comedy great and collects autographs at the back door of famous talk show host Jerry Langford(Jerry Lewis). He helps out the host by stopping a mob from overrunning him and then pesters him to let him on his show but he only gets the run around for a few days after being told to phone his assistant. He does not give up and keeps stalking him but eventually the host gets annoyed and stops humouring him. After this the comedian hatches a plan with a female stalker, whose obsessed with the host, so that she can have sex with him and he can finally perform his stand-up routine.The film shifts between bleak reality as Rupert lives in his mothers basement practising in front of a wall of painted audience members and pretending to talk Jerry and a guest,both cut outs on a set of his show. In his imagination he sees himself as a entertainment great being told how much of genius he is by the talk show host and being married to his love interest by his ex-elementary school headmaster turned vicar, who tells him how sorry he and everyone at the school is for not realising his greatness, on the Jerry Langford show. These scenes are sometimes difficult to spot as reality blends with his imagination, especially the last scenes and leaves you occasionally not knowing if what your watching is real. These really show how mentally unstable he is and how his early life effected him and left him scarred me with an extreme sense of unease as you progress through De Niro character.The film is painful in places as you see the lives of these lonely, angry people who are obsessed with fame and glamour and while they hunt pitifully for it they seem to become more and more cut to pieces while they always manage to bring themselves back to together, in a sense a more broken person but still functioning. The film starts by making you feel sorry for the character as you feel he is only trying to get his foot on the ladder in a difficult business but quickly turns to show a more scarily childlike obsession with fame. The film has no real link to any other films as it never gives an uplifting note, bar one which you are not even sure is uplifting, so it is quite depressing as you see these people strive towards the inevitable cliff edge while ignoring everyone else so to focus on there personal gain.As a film it is very different and left me feeling like I had taken something in. I'm unsure what and I don't think its a life lesson but just it seems to have hit me in some way seeing the characters madness with no one to help them, no one wanting to help them or even noticing them. De Niro is powerful in the role as the oblivious Rupert moving closer to the edge of sanity, while the stalker played by Sandra Bernhard is creepy, I think more praise is due for the non actor Lewis as his increasingly frustrated and pestered talk show host which was apparently caused by a method acting De Niro using anti-Semitic remarks to anger Lewis while filming .The film looks alright and has a few songs in it but I feel that most of the effort was put into the lines and feel for the characters for greater effect. It feels a little rushed towards the end and while certainly not being perfectly made gives you a powerful punch to the face over fame and the power of entertainment.I enjoyed the film greatly, also feeling that while the term black comedy is given to this the comedy in it can be viewed two ways and the film is more of a drama or thriller though even these terms fail to explain its quality in its unusual exploration of the human mind.8/10",

I've really only known her as a standup comedienne but her scene alone with Jerry Lewis was just unnerving and intriguing.  Man, with that performance how come she hasn't been in more films at least as psychotics.DeNiro was DeNiro.  What a character!  You felt all the unease that surrounded him, yet never got into His head.  You could easily draw the line from his present plight to where he came from and probably could think of two or three people you know that could of turned into Pupkin.  Worth the movie just to see his stand-up gig.  How entertaining was that!The real weak link though was Jerry Lewis' character and the lack of chemistry he brought to the movie.  It left me wanting to know more of DeNiro's psychosis rather than how he could get to Lewis.  It was a lot of unnerving yo-yo ing around until the last series after they captured the star, Lewis.  From then on was brilliance, as were the scenes with no reference to Lewis.  His character kind of weighed down the movie.  If you throw him out and get a more intriguing actor and character you have a great movie, instead of a good one.The concept and screenplay are still very good.  But overall all a 7. Just make sure you watch the last 20 minutes.  The kidnapping and standup act are memorable.",

            "content": "I recently revisited this and all I can say is WOW! This is a really, really special little film that got slighted way more than it deserved. \"King of Comedy\" is actually a bit of a precursor to more modern titles in that there's lots of little seeds germinating here that would later come to fruition. The twin themes of alienation and desperation and the effective, comic manner in which they are delivered would later spring to life in definitive 90's think pieces such as \"Election\", \"Fight Club\", \"The Truman Show\", and even in this year's flawed but visually precise \"One Hour Photo\". The acting's also great here. De Niro is really, really funny as Pupkin, proving he could do comedy well before \"Meet The Parents. I like Lewis here as well, playing it straight for once. No offense to the French intended, but for my money, this is the only JLL movie worth watching more than once. Free of that often annoying, pre-Carreyesque shtick, Jerry has room to roam here, showing that he could actually act when he wanted to. And of course, Sandra Bernhard is genius in her hilarious, star-making performance. It's a shame we don't hear more from her big mouth these days.     Just as a self-indulgent aside here, I think it's interesting that ever-present punk diva/actress Courtney Love used to name check this pic alot. I remember reading interviews where she would flatly state that \"there's a little bit of Rupert Pupkin in all of us\". While this casual remark certainly speaks volumes about her life as a relentless self-promoter, it may well also be true for the rest of us. In essence, Rupert Pupkin is not only yearning for the elusive nature of fame to define him, but he is also driven by an almost unearthly ambition to achieve his goal. Are any of us celebrity-cognizant, film-watching internet surfers quite so different? Somehow I think not. See this if you haven't and if you have, give it a second look. It's worth every minute of your precious, precious time. Thanks.",

However, he proves that simply recording the story in this case does just the trick.  It certainly doesn't hurt to have a brilliant performance from Robert DeNiro either.  DeNiro gives one of his best performances (if not his best) ever and certainly his most underrated. As Rupert Pupkin, the creepily obsessive stand-up comedian, DeNiro makes his character revolting in a wonderful sort of way.  And when in the end (CAUTION: POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD), Rupert finally gets what he wants (and totally undeservedly so), the audience can't be happy for him, knowing his background and what he's like.  Instead, this is where the hard-hitting satire sinks in and Scorcese's tale is horrifically realized.  This film is one of Scorcese's forgotten masterpieces and certainly showcases a powerhouse performance from DeNiro.",

ZIMMERMAN do more screenplays.Another brilliantly made Scorsese film which also shows his versatility as a director as well as De Niro's as an actor.In my opinion, this film is superior to the much talked about TAXI DRIVER. Its box office failure I can only guess, is due to the subject matter and its slightly misleading title.I also recently saw MEAN STREETS(in its entirety) for the first time and that in conjunction with Raging Bull, Goodfellas and The King Of Comedy is enough for me to rate Scorsese as one of the great filmmakers of the last few decades.",

            "content": "Writing this review in 2011, it is quite ironic that although this movie wasn't brilliantly received on its first opening, it can certainly be viewed now as ahead of its time. This picture deals with the \"celebrity\" and the mania that surrounds a fanatic. We see nowadays with pop stars and film stars the attention they receive in public from everyday people and this film seems to consult a subject that is relevant in our society almost 30 years later.The storyline is quite simple - a wannabe comedian hassles and bothers his celebrity comedian idol (Jerry Lewis) until he is forced into drastic measures. Scorsese has given us some psycho/sociopath characters over the years in Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver), Max Cady (De Niro in Cape Fear), Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci in Goodfellas) and Nicky Santoro (Pesci in Casino) to name a few, and once The King of Comedy has been viewed, you can certainly add Rupert Pupkin to that list, wonderfully played by Robert De Niro (in his 5th film under the direction of Scorsese).Pupkin is a character most people identify with as we look to a better future and wish to be held in higher esteem. De Niro is perfect as Pupkin in a very underrated role. He brings the everyday man to the character as well as displaying a combination of comedy and horror at the same time as his character delves into a disturbed state.The film itself is funny and has some wonderful lines and scenes that are memorable days after viewing. Films like this aren't made any more, films that is a real character study of a average man trying to be anything but average.The rest of the cast are also quite brilliant in this picture. Jerry Lewis kind of playing himself as a famous comedian (the chemistry is brilliant with Lewis and De Niro), and Sandra Bernhard as De Niro's rival fan who has a lustful agenda toward the famous comedian.Also look out for cameo's by Martin Scorsese (as a TV director) and his late mother Catherine, who plays Rupert's mother off-screen as we only hear her holla's from upstairs in the house.If you are a fan of De Niro or Scorsese, or just a fan of black comedy, this is a film for you. Very underrated and has an unusual PG rating for a Scorsese/De Niro movie as it is what is not said that is easy to see for the audience. Great film!",

It is hard to verify, but it almost seems like Scorsese is a bit sarcastic towards stand-up as an entertainment form, perhaps because of the fact that it is very common. Today especially. The visual impact of this movie is also astonishing, and Scorsese manages to bring it to an artistic level. The music is also very good, and amplifies the atmosphere and DeNiros self-esteem and growing dimentia. By the way, DeNiros effort in this motion picture is unique.
