            "content": "This is a good follow-up to the 1978 movie \"Grease\". Although it has gotten some bad reviews over the years, I still think the movie is a good comedy musical and it is just as much of a swooning romance as the first film. This film is desperately underrated on IMDb and deserves a second watch.What I really loved is the romance between gum-smacking bad girl Stephanie and the seemingly upper-classed and very intelligent Michael. The romance is very much like the first \"Grease\" story but in reverse but \"Grease 2\" is a romance story all of it's own.The soundtrack is not bad - in fact, it's quite good for a musical! There are not a whole lot of musicals where the songs are catchy like in both of the Grease films.Again, I think more people should give this movie another chance (viewing) and for those that have not seen Grease 2 - watch it and judge the movie for yourself instead of reviews! 8/10",

            "content": "You know, Grease 2 has taken a lot of flack & extensive bad reviews for not living up to the original. I really don't think that is to fair considering the cast was totally different. Granted there was no super-star-pop-icon like Olivia Newton-John. There wasn't the hot-70's & 80's actor John Travolta. However, there were some great stars in this film. The writing may have been a little less than perfect...the direction might not have been up to par. But for me, being EXTREMLY young when both Grease 1 & 2 came out, I never compared the two. I think they are two different films with the same \"type\" of concept. The music was good. The dance scenes are good. & yes, even the story is okay. Grease mania is about being a devoted fan... that is something I am. I liked both of these films on two different levels. Grease without a doubt is the better of the two. But this one is not as bad as the negativity everyone feeds into it. If see one, see the other. Just note that they are both FUN movies! Nothing more. The sequel centers around Sandy's cousin Michael. He is in love with Stephanie, & trys EVERYTHING possible to win her over. The Pink Ladies are still cooler than ever. The T-Birds are not as tuff, but are sexy! 1-10 Grease(10) Grease2(8) Z.",

            "content": "I grew up with both of the Grease films but I must say, Grease 2 is my favourite and there are many reasons.  It does have the same kind of formula as the orginal Grease but is dealt with in a completely different way. Danny faniced Sandy back, but Stephanie (played by the young Michelle Pfhieffer) doesn't even give Michael (Caulfield) a second glance.  Also, instead of cars, a motorbike is the new 'thing' to have.Michael Carrington, a straight A student from England, transfers to Rydell High and is immediately put into the 'nerd' category and the T-Birds brand him 'Shakesphere'.  He is smart, extremely uncool and very shy.Stephenie, the leader of the Pink ladies has come back from the summer holidays having broke up with Johnny, the T-Birds leader, having grown out of him.  Johnny is clearly still interested in Stephanie but she doesn't want to know.  Her loyalty to the Birds has faltered as she wants someone even cooler.First day back Stephanie sees the Birds picking on Michael and defends him, from that moment on Michael vows to become a T-Bird and win her heart.So there is the story, but what Grease is famous for is the memorable songs, and this film has them!  There are 12 songs on the soundtrack and there isn't one that I really skip.  The music has changed since the first Grease as it was made in the decade of the 80's.  Its early 80's rock that you are getting yourself into for the most part.  You have the romanitc songs (Turn Back The Hands Of Time, We'll Be Together, Charades), the heavy rock songs (Cool Rider, Who's That Guy), the happy-go-dancing songs (Score Tonight, Back To School), the sweet songs (Love For All Seasons) and the down right silly songs (Reproduction, Prowlin').  These are all songs that stick in your mind and just can't stop singing them to yourself.  All the songs are quality and stand on their own.  Absolutely brilliant soundtrack.What would Grease be without the classic characters?  We have the T-Birds who are actually not cool in any way or form, its only the leader (Johnny) who is 'cool', the others just follow his lead.  Johnny is a classic character who makes you laugh over and over again, its hilarious whenever he loses his cool.  Frenchy unfortunately doesn't have a big part in the film but nethertheless she is there.  The coach is back but you only see him twice if that.  Mrs Mcgee and Blanche are also back making quite a funny duo as they did last time.  Two new teachers; a very sexy female who always has low cut tops on and pays $500 for her hair (according to the cheer leading twins).  She falls for the unlikely nerdy substitute teacher, Mr Stewart, who teaches the immortal 'Reproduction' lesson.  The new Pink ladies have very distinctive characters, one of them is obsessed with her nose and doesnt come into it much (Rhonda), Paulette is somewhat the second leader in my view who has a crush on Johnny, she does have her own intentions but she does care for her friends; nothing like Riz.  Sharon is a bubbly flirty character who is the prey of one of the T-Birds (Louis) to get into bed. Then there is Dolores, Paulettes little sister who isn't a Pink lady but a pink lady mascot, she looks about 12, mouthy and carries a skate board everywhere.The performances were actually very good in my humble opinion, especially Max Caulfield who seemed very uncomfortable... and that is the way Michael is supposed to be!  He wins me over with those puppy innocent eyes, then when he is the mysterious guy he acts completely cool.  Max was a triumph. His voice isn't the best thing in the world but he didn't sing that much anyway.  Michelle Pfhieffer was wonderful as an actress and singer.  When you hear her sing you won't need to wonder why Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted her as Evita in his film musical and NOT Madonna.  She shines in 'Cool Rider'.  The whole cast was believable.  I normally sit back in films and watch peoples performances and dig at them but I didnt do that at all in this movie.This film has a lot of negative feedback as every one compares it to the Original Grease.  My opinion isnt common, preferring this one to the original, therefore my advice to you is to forget the first movie when watching this one.  It needs a chance!",

In Grease 2 I like the songs better and the guys are much more better looking than the first one.Overall this movie for me is quite entertaining and I like it, and I certainly do not compare it to the first one as it is a whole new different movie and storyline.So if you haven't seen Grease 2 before because people say it's crap and that it's a waste of time, at least give it a chance and watch it, it might surprise you.",

I think part of the reason it wasn't successful was because people loved the original so much, felt nothing could compare, and didn't give it a chance. Personally, I liked it better than the original.  Yes, it's silly and a little farfetched, but it's not trying to be Shakespeare.  As a musical/comedy, it succeeds on every level.  The music is just terrific.  The song \"Cool Rider\" is so catchy and \"Reproduction\" is hilarious.  They are my favorite numbers. The story is sweet and charming. The characters are funny, likeable, and Michelle Pfeiffer, especially, gives a terrific performance. She had such star quality in this film; I have been a fan of hers ever since. I liked how several characters from the original were used and it was also a great idea to include actors from that era such as Tab Hunter and Connie Stevens. This movie is a guilty pleasure for some, and I have a feeling that there are more than a few people out there who can sing from memory every song on the sound track!",

            "review_title": "So appalling it exerts a perverse fascination!",
            "content": "I used to work in a record store in the late 80s/early 90s, and one thing we sold a copy of at least every week was the Grease 2 soundtrack. I used to ask the people buying about it, and they all acknowledged that it was one of the worst movies, but that there is something about it so lovable, and that the songs are terrible, but there's something about them so charming\u0085 Now that I've seen the movie, I know what they mean.This movie is appalling in nearly every respect, but there's just something about it--perhaps how brazenly appalling it is--that gives it an almost hypnotic fascination. I love how the producers made only the most surface-level attempt to even appear 50s. The clothes, hairstyles, songs, and ways of speaking all scream 80s. I haven't the slightest idea why they decided to dress Michelle Pheiffer in things that essentially look like sweatshirts for the first half of the movie. And she's got on those huge dark glasses all the time\u0085 making her look like early Debbie Harry. You just really have to wonder. As for the sets\u0085 I don't think I've ever seen such low production values in a movie released by a major studio. The sets also are brazenly 80s\u0085 When Michelle is being tutored, they are OBVIOUSLY in an Elias Brothers Big Boy! Couldn't they at least have found a 50s-themed diner? There is also a scene showing guys motorcycling through a subdivision that looks like 1985 Westland, Michigan, and another time--my favorite--when Michelle and someone are sitting out in what is obviously some municipal park, with a huge superhighway with massive 18-wheelers barreling by in the background. I really have to take my hat off. What's also charmingly appalling is how the producers made NO attempt to recapture ANYTHING you may have loved about the first movie. And I tell you, this movie makes the original look like Gone With the Wind. You really should be required to see both to appreciate what a graceful, charming movie the first one is. This is so obviously just a craven cash-in by whoever owned the rights (that's you, Allan Carr!) that, in some perverse way, only makes it the more appealing.Everyone in this movie looks embarrassed, but none more so that Michelle Pheiffer. Obviously WRONG in every way for the part, and obviously PAINFULLY aware that she's going to look like an idiot on movie screens across America, poor Michelle seems afraid to really put herself behind any expression, movement, or song, as though by staying as still as possible she can diminish the damage. The poor girl, you can really feel her pain, especially as she sings 'Cool Rider,' and tries to dance up that ladder and down. The thing about musicals is that the characters have to appear to be transported with joy or anguish to the point that they break out in song, and poor Michelle is just so embarrassed that it really clunks. Of course, ALL the musical sequences clunk massively. If you're not buying a musical sequence it just looks like a bunch of people idiotically moving around on a set\u0085 and that's what we got here. Those poor, poor individuals.I was amazed how poor the sound quality was. I hear this has been improved on the DVD, but it's quite clear that they were aware that these people COULD NOT SING, and tried to bury their voices as deep as possible.What else? Well, I guess that's about it. Truly poor direction just adds to the general malaise. If you like bad, cheesy movies, they just don't get any better than this. If you are a fan of the original, you should definitely watch this, as it'll just make you love the chemistry, charming songs, and graceful story arc all the more.--- Check out my website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com",

            "content": "Ok so it's a little \"kitch-ey\". Maybe more than the original And not all songs are amazing. And the hero wears goggles.But when you grow up on this, this movie is coool. The songs with choreography are great. The school setting is classic. The characters are fun, no one takes themselves too seriously except Max Caulfied (ugh, more about him later) . The T-birds are still cool. But the coolest? Are the girls. They don't take crap from anyone. Not Stephanie, nor Paulette, not even squeaky Sharon. The fashion is neat, especially those Pink Lady jackets when reversed. Michelle is amazing in \"Cool Rider\", I've played that song over and over again... and even in the diner scene, with her stuffing her face with the burger, not sure why, I think her cute clueless-ness is cool. But then again, Pfeiffer is just a natural actress.And some lines are classic. \"I've got a rep to protect\". Everything DiMucci says, including the line about a girl and boy not playing it safe, \"The greatest hits of Beeeeethoven?\"... Nogerelli inviting the principal over for \"Pasghetti\"... \"He's a dead man, D-E-D, dead\"\nFunny songs like Reproduction and \"Let's do it for our country\" also shows this movie doesn't take itself too seriously.Now for the lead. I feel it was a really poor choice. Everything I see this actor in, I think he is one of the worst actors. He doesn't have any personality. Is has this empty look. But then his character is not given anything to work with. His slow song is horrible!! His leather clothing is atrocious. And what is with the goggles? It's not cool. I didn't always know what cool was at the age of 6 when this came out but I know goggles and an bare hairy chest under a leather jacket was not. Or... maybe on someone else it would be... there's also a scene, can't remember when, where he grins and his teeth are so huge and white. Anyway, clearly, for me, he brings the score of this movie down a lot.But I'm giving it a 10 because it's really unfairly ranked right now.Off to watch Cool Rider again...",

            "content": "When I was 11, Grease 2 was like crack. It was a classless, shameful, euphoric, and powerfully addictive experience. My sister and I would watch it, rewind it, and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another. So, if you are an 11-year old girl, and you reviewed this film as \"brilliant\" or \"fun\" or \"better than the original Grease,\" you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass.If, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane, artless, slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production, distribution, and/or consumption.For the sake of criticism, I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows\u0085 1. In a well-executed musical, the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters. In Grease 2, with a few debatable exceptions, to the music is obscenely pointless. Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way (\"Score Tonight,\" \"Reproduction,\" \"Do It For Our Country,\" and \"Prowlin'\") without making one concrete statement about any of the film's characters or themes. Plus, all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance.2. The T-birds should be badass, and if not at least somewhat likable, but instead each of them is an annoying wussy-dufus-loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T-bird jacket and initiates him into the gang, Michael should kick it to the ground, spit on it, and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it. But of course, he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads, there is no greater honor than to be one with the T-birds. 3. Since Michael is beautiful, smart, kind, resourceful, and above average in everyway (his musical impotence notwithstanding), it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a slovenly, slack-jawed, bubble gum smacking, dirty sweatshirt wearing, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat. So aside from being pretty (I guess), she harbors no likable characteristics, thus, audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michael's attraction to her.I could go on and on, but I didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. I will say this though, to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time's sake: Grease 2 is an experience akin to re-living your first kiss. Only you are 32 now and kissing a snot-nosed 13-year old kid with acne and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed. Trust me.",

            "content": "Depending on when you saw this film relative to when you saw the original \"Grease,\" your viewpoints probably differ as to the quality of this movie.I saw both within a month of each other at age 13. I hated the original and loved this one.As I've gotten older, I've come to recognize that the original is a better piece of work, overall. The music from the original is better when taken as a whole. The supporting cast of the original has better players. The storyline doesn't seem as convoluted at times.But there's something about this movie that holds on to you. It appeals much more to the age group pictured in the movie (i.e., junior-high and high-schoolers). The song \"Cool Rider\" and the scenes that accompany it in the movie rival anything in the original.The dialog is better in places and the interplay between the male and female leads are better, I believe, than in the original. The original movie's pairing of Travolta and Newton-John gave us a dimwit trying to woo a goodie-two-shoes girl whose performance was oftentimes wooden and uncomfortable. This one gives us Caulfield and Pfeiffer, and the interplay between an intelligent, wise-beyond-his-years male lead and the \"wild child\" female lead.Adrian Zmed's supporting performance as Johnny still cracks me up and is one of the few performances from this movie that still entertain me as an adult.That's because outside of the performances of accomplished character actors Christopher McDonald, Eve Arden and Dody Goodman, the rest of this cast is just plain bad. Some of it is bad acting, some of it is miscasting and a lot of it is bad writing.What we're left with today, 20-something years later, is a movie that made a really good attempt to build on the original, but in the end, was the souffl\u00e9 that fell. It's still better than most want to admit, but it could have stood a couple of rewrites and a little more attention to detail in the prospective cast interview room.",

            "content": "When I was 14, I saw this movie over summer vacation.Naturally, having seen Grease and like anyone else who saw it, I didn't think it possible to make a sequel.Either, 'at all' or to make one that wasn't as good as the first.Now at that age, I did like the movie and understood it wouldn't star Travolta or Olivia Newton John (who were too busy making so-so or even worse films at the time.)I got to re-watch this recently, first time in a long while.First, to all of you who truly love this movie, if you love\nit that's fine but I honestly can't like it as much as you do.I feel the characters, some of the songs just don't\nhave the heart that made \"Grease\" enjoyable for me.Unlike the first, it seems no one in this movie really cares about anyone but themselves... but, I can't totally dismiss it either. There are some good things in the movie, it's true. Too bad it's all in the first half only.In the opening, Sandy's cousin Michael Carrington has come to\nlive in the U. S. and attend Rydell High in California like she did.In this case, he's a 'male' Sandy & Pink Lady 'Stephanie Zinone' is the female 'Danny Zuko'. She of course thinks he's a nerd & uninteresting. He meets up with Frenchy (Didi Conn) as he gets off the school bus.After this scene, Didi Conn pretty much vanishes.It's not long before he's fallen for Stephanie, who's getting sick of the immaturity and bossiness of current T-Bird leader Johnny Nogerelli, who's only her boyfriend only because she's a Pink Lady. Michael decides (despite Frenchy's warning) to try and become a T-Bird type himself and win Stephanie's love & respect.In mere weeks (in movie time) he's practically Evel Knievel on a motorcycle, wearing a leather jacket and disguising his voice in a weird deeper American voice. He single handedly takes on & defeats the T-Birds rival gang outside the bowling alley.Anyway, up to the point of the \" Prowlin' \"\nnumber, it was a good movie. Then it all falls apart.Right after that is a somewhat dull scene in a diner with Michael & Stephanie. An even duller song by Caufield, \"Charades\" with way too much echo effect) the goofy fallout shelter scene and a bit later, the unbelievably embarrassing and badly staged 'Graduation Luau' .I have to say this, for being a young actress at the time, Pfeiffer's is the best actor of all in the whole film. .... but has no choice but to somehow get through the scene of her and Zmed in the boat in a round swimming pool.Johnny's actually trying to row his way out, when the rival gang shows up to wreck the place.... and her screaming \"Stop yelling at me!\"Another question...why ask Sid Cesar, Dody Goodman, Eve Arden to appear, when they really didn't give them much to do in the film? I feel their talents were wasted here. It's more like they're extras than real characters. As mentioened, even Frenchy disappears after awhile.Tab Hunter & Connie Stevens don't seem to add much to the mix either. He plays a straight arrow type teacher, she's a fairly promiscuous one.Again, in the first half, the musical numbers are really\ngood. Which gives the impression it's going to be a great movie.The opening number, \"Back To School Again\" (sung in a voice over by The Four Tops) is a great one. The dancing is perfect and the song's exciting.Other good numbers are Pfeiffer's \"Cool Rider\" (sort of 1980s Pat Benetar, being sung in 1961, with MTV like moves). Still, one of her best remembered moments in the film.\"Score Tonight\" (sung in the bowling alley) is more of a funny song than one to be taken seriously. Still, it works in how it's put together. \"Reproduction\", despite it's incredibly tacky lyrics, is also funny and it's routine works too.\" Prowlin' \" - Sung by Adrian Zmed (depending on your opinion of his singing of course) and \"You're Girl For All Seasons\" are great too.The rest of the songs, \"Who's That Guy?, \"Love Will Turn Back The Hands Of Time\", \"Do It For Our Country\", \"Rock-A-Hula Luau\" and \"We'll Be Together\" .... are anywhere from dull to just really uninspired songwriting.There's even the bad edit from ONLY Stephanie & Michael starting the \"We'll Be Together\" number, to everyone in less than a second, all coupled up (including them) and slow dancing / walking to the camera. Topped off with some silly 'spinning and/or 'ballet' like routine.So, all of this, is why I'm rating it 5 stars.A good jump start in the first half but a 2nd half that\ngets lost and runs out of gas on the way to the finish line.

The songs, for the most part are hideous and i cringed with embarasment when i watched it recently.... but i can remember singing along with delight to \"reproduction\" when i was 14 years old!! first a foremost a film is to entertain, whether that means it gives you a good laugh when strictly speaking it isnt a comedy, then there you go!! this film could have been so much more, but unfortunately it died on its arse.  still, just for being a teenage favourite i still have to give it an 8 out of 10 (so shoot me!!).",

So of course I remember watching Grease since I was a little girl, while it was never my favorite musical or story, it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it's still a lot of fun to watch. I heard horrible things about Grease 2 and that's why I decided to never watch it, but my boyfriend said that it really wasn't all that bad and my friend agreed, so I decided to give it a shot, but I called them up and just laughed. First off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn't really clever, not to mention they just used the same characters, but with different names and actors. Tell me, how did the Pink Ladies and T-Birds continue years on after the former gangs left? Not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy, gee, what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these T-Birds were just stupid and ridiculous.Another year at Rydell and the music and dancing hasn't stopped. But when a new student who is Sandy's cousin comes into the scene, he is love struck by a pink lady, Stephanie. But she must stick to the code where only Pink Ladies must stick with the T-Birds, so the new student, decides to train as a T-Bird to win her heart. So he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the T-Bird's butts. But will he tell Stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own? Well, find out for yourself.Grease 2 is like a silly TV show of some sort that didn't work. The gang didn't click as well as the first Grease did, not to mention Frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable, because I thought that she graduated from Rydell, but apparently she didn't. The songs were not really that catchy; I'm glad that Michelle was able to bounce back so fast, but that's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel, I wouldn't really recommend this film, other than if you are curious, but I warned you, this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical.2/10",

He eventually wins over the leader of the Pink Ladies (Michelle Pfeiffer, right before SCARFACE) by posing as a mysterious biker who takes on the entire rival motorcycle gang.A couple of catchy songs (\"Back to School\" and \"Reproduction\" are both fun) cannot compete with a moronic screenplay (by the same guy who wrote and directed AIRPLANE II), dreadful performances and some abysmal songs (particularly \"Let's Score Tonight,\" \"Who's That Guy\" and \"Cool Rider\").Pretty much an embarrassment for everyone involved, especially such wasted talent as Connie Stevens, Eve Arden and Sid Caesar. Tab Hunter fares the best out of the guest stars as a nervous substitute teacher.The movie has developed a loyal cult following. Then again, so has Charles Manson.",

            "content": "Okay, so was the original Grease the greatest movie of all time? Of course not. But at least it was fun, had catchy songs, and a good cast.Grease 2 has none of the above. The problems with this movie, as well as why it bombed so badly are as follows, in my opinion.1. This movie had no star power. the original \"Grease\" had John Travolta, who had just come off doing \"Saturday Night Fever\" and had been on \"Welcome Back Kotter.\" It also had Olivia Newton-John, at the time one of the biggest recording artists in the world. Jeff Conaway was on \"Taxi\" and had been on Broadway. Stockard Channing was also known for film and TV. Who did \"Grease 2\" have? Maxwell Caufield, who was unknown, and Michelle Pfeiffer, also unknown at the time.2. The story line and characters. The \"Grease\" sequel had a bad girl and good boy meeting and going against the high school social hierarchy, opposite of the first film. That would have been fine, if both of the characters had been willing to change for each other, as Danny and Sandy both were. But they weren't, and none of this movie made much sense. Why did they start prepping for an end of the year talent show on the first day of school? On top of a poor story line, not one of the characters were even likable. If you have unknown actors in a film, you need a story line, or something, to attract them.3.The songs. The original \"Grease\" film had songs that are still played on the radio today. This film has classics (haha) like \"Reproduction\" and \"Cool Rider.\" Yeah, I never hear those songs on the radio these days.4. The direction. They hired a former choreographer to direct this film instead of someone with actual experience directing a film.There are some movies that are so good they're bad. \"Grease 2\" is not one of those films. It's just plain bad.",

This time around, we have Sandy's younger cousin Michael falling for Pink Lady Stephanie. Who's almost over her dead 'romance' with T-Bird leader Johnny. Who incidentally falls for 2nd Pink Lady, Paulette. Stephanie's equally hot, sassy co-leader.The songs are cute and catchy, like \"Reproduction\", \"Cool Rider\", and everyone's favorite, \"Girl for All Seasons \" And a few teachers get in on the act, with Mr Stuart singing a few parts in \"Reproduction\" which didn't happen in the first one.I got a kick out of Johnny comically misquoting the menstruation quip as 'mental-stration'. And the cute way he and Paulette totally dig each other, with the hot flirting thing. They had more chemistry than he and Stephanie together.The pairing of Louis and Sharon was cute and sexy. Him dawning that adorable combat helmet in \"Do it for Our Country \" Alongside other fun and playful moments.As others stated, it's a sequel. And some sequels don't necessarily follow an original. Characters can change. Directors change, etc. What should matter here, is the score and the cast. Which were entertaining and fun. Hence, a musical comedy.John Travolta didn't repeat his Danny Zuko... we get Adrian Zmed, whom I had a big crush on in 'T. J. Hooker' An equally built, hunky, cool, lady-swinging, and brassy leader of the T-Birds...AND a decent singing voice. With Pfeiffer rolling it as Stephanie...the new Pink Lady 'Rizzo'. Who's sharp, sassy, and fit.... as a Pink Lady leader should be.The rest of the T-Birds and Pink Ladies suit their roles well And most of them hold a decent note.It's a Yes with me.",

A lot of them are more youthful looking or they at least does not feel like as old as a your parents. They also made the film's Sandy (played by Pfeiffer) more intuitive and generally less emotive.But that's pretty much were the success of the film ends.Sadly the film fails in one aspect that really made the original successful, the music.Leaving the music behind, the original is not really a noteworthy film, in hindsight. Grease's story is just enough fluff and edge but it is not something to write about. But original's musical core really pushes it into another territory.In Grease 2, the story pretty much drives the film. Its kind of awkward actually seeing some of the music, because it feels unprompted (ie the Cool Rider scene) and sometimes too out of the blue. It's a distraction. In addition, the music is too wordy for its own good. None of the song registered compared to the original, which I also barely knew before watching but does remember at least five by the end.Overall, the film is okay but more so as an appreciation of the story unlike the original, which is an appreciation for the songs.[3/5]PS: The film has a weird obsession with the male lead played by Caulfield. There is a lot of \"glamor\" shots of him inserted for reaction shots. I know that he is REALLY HOT and I guess, the studio was banking for him as the next big star but really movie?",

Sick of the T-Birds Bizarre rules and being someones \"chick\" all the time, she wants a \"Cool Rider\" but she doesn't realize how close this Mr. Right is. Michael almost immediately fall in love with her not realizing the problem this cold cost with the T-Birds. To win her heart he soon realizes that he has to get a bike and become the \"Cool Rider\"; Stephanie mentioned to get her full attention. But later on reviling who he really is appears to be harder then expected and in the end...well I'm not going to spoil the end...You' just have to watch it.Seeing Michelle Pfeffer in this movie is the bast part of this movie for me...seeing her as Stephanie with both good acting skills and a good singing-voice, the rest of the plot is also great and we have Didi Conn back as Frenchy...and we see old characters from the first on as Miss McGee, Blanche, Coatch Callhoum and the nerd Eugine.But the main advise I have for those who are going to watch this movie...please don't compare i with Grease 1, see it as a complete new movie...it is so much better that way...! I wouldn't look at it to much as a musical either...more like a movie with some nice music and funny songs : )",

Lazy or rushed, you decide.Look, I'm going to make this a quickie, much like all the horny \"kids\" here wanted. I only watched this movie to listen to the great podcast: \"How Did This Get Made?\" on my drive to Vegas in a couple of days. They covered this, so to join in on their fun, I watched it. I both curse and will eventually praise them.Truthfully, I wasn't a fan of the first film. I saw it waaay after the release. 30 years, to be precise. I only know this, because after listening to the incredible soundtrack for decades, I saw the movie was coming back to theatres for a 30th year anniversary in 2008. So, I figured that would be the best way to see it first: on the big screen. And\u0085it was a big letdown. Sure, the music was still incredible, but the production of the movie: eh. And now\u0085that said, the first is a masterpiece in comparison to part 2.Random scenes, terrible music, an ultra-thin \"plot,\" and mid-20 to 30- year-olds posing as high school students? Well, at least it made all the teachers and faculty lusting over students less creepy\u0085I guess? Can't really give a synopsis since there didn't appear to be a script involved, but what it boiled down to: Foreign exchange student lusts over a forbidden \"girl,\" and since she only likes bikers, he pretends to be one so he can Clark Kent/Superman her. (He even mentions that duality at one point.)Admittedly, I found the music catchy at points, though it still sucked and most of the cast was really trying, though horribly directed. So, I didn't overall hate this, but boy it felt like it was put together in hours. The entire film, I mean.This movie and many more pointless sequels are proof that not every great \"classic\" needs a follow-up and obvious cash-cows don't always need milking. Shame.***Final thoughts: So glad, despite this, Michelle Pfeiffer had a career. She wasn't terrible in her first lead role here, but, boy, was she badly directed. I almost felt sorry for her as she was just horribly led.",

There is nothing flavorful and fresh to offer, and it looks half-baked, as if they just did the whole film in two takes.\"Grease 2\" holds no real resemblances to the first, except for the school. Characters you may have liked are all gone, instead replacing Danny Zuko (masterfully played by John Travolta) with the nerdy British exchange student Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caufield) - who only sang one song - and Sandy Olsson (also masterfully played by Olivia Newton-John) with the most popular girl in school, Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer) - it's a role reversal plot at its worst, and there's tons of bad suspense points cheesy dialogue, tie-ins to the early '60s (1961 to be exactly), it's all so bleak and bland that it looks like a bootleg ripoff. The stupid songs, on the other hand, sound like something that came out of a high school chorus rendering of a '50's doo wop medley.To sum it up, the whole thing was atrocious. \"Grease 2\" makes \"High School Musical: Senior Year\" look like an Oscar contender. That is how low this movie can go and a boring way to cash in more on the franchise nobody wanted a sequel for. Those who even say Pfeiffer's performance was a redeeming factor are wrong - a year later, Michelle would make up for \"Grease 2\" by playing in \"Scarface\" with Al Pacino, and her role in \"Scarface\" rocketed her career and put her on the map (I also assume that Ms. Pfeiffer regrets having accepted to act in \"Grease 2\"). \"Grease 2\" is one of the all time worst...if you want to watch good movies with Ms. Pfeiffer, go watch \"Scarface\" instead. Oh no, this movie is very violent for you, since you only know her for her romantic comedies. Michelle Pfeiffer isn't Julia Roberts, Reese Witherspoon or Katherine Heigl, you know!",

The plot and dialogue are fraught with silliness, and if you watch carefully there are numerous little mistakes that should have been edited out. (Spoiler: Michael's motorcycle right out in plain view of Steff, with him leaning on it, when he's hiding his \"cool rider\" identity from her.) Some of the songs are especially painful, particularly in the ultra-serious motorcycle heaven scene, and the choreography is just bad. Watching Michelle Pfeiffer dance and sing \"Cool Rider\" is terrible--she should not be dancing that way, or singing at all. One has to wonder why Crater Face was included as a \"villain\" in this film, because now his tormenting of the high school students is just sad. Then again, I have a soft spot for Grease 2 that I don't have for the too oft-shown first film. For one, just to get this out of the way, Maxwell Caulfield is gorgeous in this movie. If you hate the film, you can always (assuming you swing that way) just watch him. It's not as if his acting is bad, and neither is Michelle's, though her lines are. And Grease 2 is funny, in its own way--you simply can't watch Michelle dance and sing without laughing. There is a lot to laugh at--and even with--in this musical. \"Reproduction\" is fun to watch, if certainly campy, and a couple of the T-birds are entertaining (Leif Green and Peter Frechette's characters).As I said, I have a fondness for this movie that is pretty inexplicable, I know. It's not a classic film by any means. Still, I'd say if you're looking for a so-bad-it's-good that still isn't too incredibly awful, to laugh at with your friends, Grease 2 is worth a rental.",

Just for the record, I really like Grease, it isn't in my top 250 nor is it my favourite movie musical, plus it is a movie that has grown on me over-time, but it was good spirited, energetic, nostalgic fun with fun performances and great songs and choreography.Grease 2 has very little of that. In fact, it is almost the exact anti-thesis of Grease, it is dull, lifeless and predictable with poor songs and forgettable performances. The only real point of interest is Michelle Pfeiffer, while her acting and singing is nothing amazing she does look gorgeous and does try, bless her heart. It is just a shame that the other performers are so lacking in chemistry and energy, and she and the cast are further disadvantaged by songs with irritating lyrics and unmemorable melodies, barely tolerable singing(I've heard worse such as in Mame and At Long Last Love but it is still bad here) and slip-shod choreography.The dialogue is also very embarrassing, there isn't a witty or quotable line here, in fact I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the cheesiness. The story is predictable, badly paced and dull as well, and spoiled by cardboard characters who don't interact with each other very well at all. Worst is the direction, it is absolutely wretched. Patricia Birch doesn't seem to have an idea how to direct this movie, and when anything interesting or worthwhile happened which was occasionally, it is spontaneously hampered by some hideous camera shots.All in all, a mess of not only a musical but of a film. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

The songs in this one are simply dreadful, when Phifer sings about how she wants a cool rider one can imagine all the dogs in the neighborhood lifting their heads and howling. Sadly that is probably one of the better songs in the movie. Stupid attempts at humor are made in the form of an awful bunker scene along with another horrible song and the whole film looks bad compared to the original.

In many ways, it's a shame that it IS so bad, the choreography is actually quite good (though frequently lost to very bad edits), with some very good dancing by the extras (much like the original, no less).But of course, that can't save horrible acting, tuneless songs (of which there are FAR too many) and an absurd \"plot\". And I don't even mean how Michael becomes a cyclist who out rides guys with years of practice under their belt in less than six months, either. Cause even THAT'S not nearly so unthinkable as: A) the teasing Stephanie is subject to over Michael's crush. Granted, he's a \"nerdy bookworm\", but he's clearly an incredibly handsome nerdy bookworm, while the \"cool guys\" are all dorky looking and acting---making one wonder if perhaps ALL the Pink Ladies need glasses.B) totally hot twin cheerleaders are portrayed as icky prisses that no guy wants----but disheveled Stephanie (and yes, I do consider Michelle to be a very beautiful woman, just not in this movie), in a greasy sweatshirt has every boy panting wildly---as do the other, plain at best, Pink Ladies.C) That anyone could buy any of the pushing 30 actors in this thing as \"teens\".But past that, it's strangely compelling--and fun to watch in a heinous, \"Saved by the Bell\" kind of way..",

            "content": "Four years after the phenomenally successful musical \"Grease\" was released, this follow-up appeared, with a rather similar format, but with mostly new, unknown, leads, and an indifferent audience reception.The venerable Eve Arden, at age 74, leaves her staple sarcastic remarks behind, and again plays the high school principal. Like Olivia Newton John, Michelle Pfeiffer, as greaser Pink Lady Stephanie, was a knockout blonde, but was not known as a singer. Nonetheless, she sings 3 of the major songs. Maxwell Caulfield, as Brit immigrant, Michaeal, simply lacked John Travolta's physical charisma, film notoriety, and musical talent. He comes across as a class 'brain', not the type of cool motorcycle rider that Stephanie wants. T bird greaser Johnny(Adrian ZMed) has been Stephanie's partner, but they have been fighting recently. He will continue to be the main competitor to Mike for Steph's romantic attachment. Paulette is the other blonde Pink Lady, who spends much of the film trying to displace Steph as Johnny's moll.The plot features the inverse of that of \"Grease\", in that Mike is the Brit clean-cut new square kid, while Steph is a bubble gum bubble-blowing, smoking, Pink Lady greaser moll. However, one look at Steph, and the aristocratic Mike ignores her low-class habits and greaser's moll status, and is determined to pursue her. However, she makes it clear that she only goes out with 'cool' riders. Mike hasn't any money for a cycle, so takes advantage of various requests by academic lightweights to write their term paper for them for cash. Amazingly, this eventually adds up to enable him to buy a cycle. Now, he practices becoming an expert cycle rider.Finally, Mike feels ready to announce himself as a 'Cool Rider' candidate(Well, actually, his stunt double).. Wearing large gaggles to hide his identity, he makes a dramatic entrance in front of the menacing Cycle Lords cycle gang, when they are harassing students in front of the bowling alley. Cool Rider immediately, rides off, and, fortunately, the Cycle Lords follow him. Steph is intrigued. Later, Cool Rider stops by the gas station where she works. Before he has a chance to reveal his identity, the jealous T-Birds arrive, and he motors off.Mike and Steph have lunch and agree to meet at the talent show. However, Mike arrives as Cool Rider. And when the T-Birds soon arrive, he motors off, they chasing him, until he disappears in the dark over an apparent cliff. Steph is broken-hearted at his apparent demise, and sings her heart out about this as her performance at the talent show. She is named queen of the show, and Johnny, representing the T-Birds, is named king. At the subsequent luau graduation celebration, the menacing Cycle Lords show up, creating pandemonium and wrecking things. In the midst, Cool Rider shows up, and, like the pied piper, this gang again chases him, restoring order. He loses them, and motors back, landing in a pool, where he reveals his identity. Shockingly, Johnny awards him with a T-Bird jacket. Now, there is no official impediment to pairing with Steph, and they take turns singing a love song, for a happy ending.Sure, it's shot full of implausibility holes and other cheesy aspects, and is inferior to \"Grease 1\". But! I still find it sufficiently entertaining to recommend it, rating it somewhere between 'garbage' and 'a masterpiece'. Michielle largely saves it from ignomy.",

I dislike both movies, and was reluctant to see the musical but when my cousin took me to see a recent revival for my birthday I truly appreciated the experience. And in that, I had more respect for the first Grease movie, which stared John Travolta (pre Saturday Night Fever) and Olivia Newton-John (Post \"Have you never been mellow?\") It was a good career jump-start for both of them, and aside form incorporating cheesy disco numbers into the soundtrack, it stayed relatively the same as the musical. And, it was a huge success.Not so for Grease 2. Whose great idea was this?Let's make the guy a shy, prissy wallflower and make the girl a gang member? Normally, I'd be all for the gender-swapping, but the way they went about it was horrible. The supporting cast--everyone from the T-bird leader (adrian zmed) to the blonde bombshell (Lorna Luft) was just off. Lorna, well being a member of a talented family, never got to prove herself playing such an out of place Marilyn Monroe Wannabe. And casting another disco king as another greaser did not give Zmed the same success as Travolta. Because face it, acting just isn't Zmed's thing. the rest of the T-birds are annoying. The Pink Ladies all tried to be carbon copies of the original characters, with horrifying results. The music is dreadful. I'm hearing a critique of every number by Simon Cowell in my head, as I think of it. The bomb shelter scene had no point...except for sexual innuendo hidden in a stupid song. The reproduction class had no point...except for sexual innuendo hidden in an even stupider song. Remember the cool dance scene? Well we got a bowling alley and some lame motorcycle stunts. Lucky us! What could have been the one bright spot in this black whole of silliness was the cameo appearance of Didi Con as Frenchie! But it's obvious that Didi is far too old at this point to play a high school student, and you wonder exactly how many years this \"beauty school drop out\" had to repeat her senior year at Rydell High. People actually walked out of the theater during it's short run. My friend and I stayed only because she thought Adrian Zmed was hot. I felt sorry for her, and even sorrier for me that I had to sit through it without even being amazed by the looks of Caulfield or any of the other male actors. I give this stinker a 1/10. if I could give it a 0/10 I would.",

On the music side, I was blown away by the songs. If you're saying they are bad, you probably haven't even bothered to listen to them in full. Straight after watching I have ordered the CD. It may have not generated so many hits like the Grease \"One\"... maybe because of the short time-frame between these two movies. Like the other reviewers already said.

I don't think so, it's OK, if you take it as it's own movie and not compare it to the original. And that's where I think the movie fails, by having several characters from the first movie return such as Frenchie (Didi Conn) Eugene (Eddie Deezan) and \"Crater Face\" that they didn't need, you can't help but be reminded of the first movie. The only characters needed to return is the Prinicipal McGee (Eve Arden) her receptionist Blanche (Doody Goodman) and Coach Calhoon (Sid Ceasar) and even then Ceasar doesn't contribute much. It's has a lot of catchy songs and some fairly decent choreography most of the time.

Problem is his not her type and he develops this alter ego where he dons a leather jacket and a motorbike and makes his voice deeper so that Steph would have NO idea who the mysterious motorcyclist is?

            "content": "Following in the footsteps of the box office success that was 'Grease', this less ostentatious sequel was almost destined to open to negative reviews. Some of the criticisms are admittedly on the mark. In particular, Didi Conn reprising her role as a post-graduation Frenchy never quite works; the attempt to link to the first 'Grease' film by making the male protagonist Sandy's cousin is also forced. 'Grease 2' is, however, a better film than one might expect from its reputation, and its reversal of the original movie's formula makes for a more engaging story. Whereas the first film was about an out-of-place teenage girl giving in to peer pressure and conforming to impress a guy, here it is the guy who has to conform to impress the girl. In both films, the message offered (conformity is good) is hard to swallow, however, as the transformation this time is more gradual (not all of a sudden at the end), it is easier to get under the skin of the protagonist here and feel for his mixed emotions. A refined Maxwell Caulfield also makes for a more appealing lead actor than John Travolta, who acted pretty smug throughout the whole of the first film, and while Michelle Pfeiffer is no better than Olivia Newton-John, she is certainly no worse on the acting front; singing is another matter. That said, the film has some pretty decent songs, even if they are nowhere near as iconic as the original's tunes; \"Turn Back the Hands of Time\" is a particularly beautiful tune. The film is surprisingly funny too with the school's kooky administration team given twice as much screen time here.",

She's, what, five, give or take a year? And this is one of her favorite movies. I pity her. This movie is a piece of junk, no two ways about it! That's where the disappointment came in.Now, you may be wondering about the \"appalled\" part of my summary line. That's easily enough to explain. You see, the little girl I babysat has two older siblings--one about 8, and the other 10. They really like the movie too, and that bothers me. Some of the lines in the songs are very frank in their sexuality. That's not so bad for a five year old who simply won't understand them, or the equally suggestive dance moves that accompany them. A ten-year-old, however, will. I'll be the first to admit that I am literally one of the most liberal, open-minded people you'll ever meet, so it isn't the content itself that I object to. What bothers me is that it's contained within a musical that people let their kids sit down in watch without thinking to worry (since the parents themselves probably wouldn't be able to stomach much more than the first 10 minutes). What I'm basically saying is this: the movie might amuse very small children that aren't paying attention to the lyrics. The tunes themselves aren't too bad, and the dancing can be amusing, especially when you *aren't* paying attention to the lyrics. Older children--about ages 7/8 to, oh, 11, probably don't need to watch this.

Sometimes it doesn't work, as Adrian Zmed is a little too polished and smug to totally convince as Johnny and Eugene's role has been beefed up a little too much to the point where his perpetual nerdiness is irritating.It is still good fun, but the original was simply so much better and this film's mere existence only proves this.",

Before I die, I may teach some film classes. One exercise would be for us to take some stock Mac software and with that alone take some horrid movie like this and fix it. Only a few are likely candidates. This is because the editing and music is so very bad that if the thing was edited expertly, with energy, and the songs were completely redone, it could work.The editing first. Why this is such a good case is that the story never matters much in things like this if it has other charms. So knocking as much as a third or even a half out of it would be okay. The actors are completely without interest, which could be a plus: we can just make them all part of the background blizzard. You couldn't just pick among the shots, you'd have to zoom, crop and pan among what you had. You'd probably have to mix some sequences and present some others as flashbacks, forwards or sides. Maybe you could mix in some footage from other films \u0097 or even new custom footage \u0097 just as rhythmic filler. You'd have to noodle with the color. Its nothing here, nothing at all. Once one team of students built a cinematic pulse with enough long form arcs to matter, and maybe even some new dialog, they'd pass it to the sound team. I imagine all sorts of solutions here with woven genres that continue from beginning to end, to a simple redoing of the existing songs but competently and engagingly. To a sonic \"What's New, Pussycat?\"I'll bet we'd get at least ten movies better than this, and one or two that would be worth watching.I guess we should mention one man in connection with this. Lives do get judged, especially public lives. And most especially lives that carry artistic responsibility. So I don't in the least mind trashing one of the most damaging men in film and music, Robert Stigwood. I think its possible to be vulgar, tasteless and exploitative in the business and still have a justified life. I celebrate some in these comments. Its possible to make a simple movie designed to sell records \u0097 where the big money was in those days. I liked \"Flashdance,\" even on a recent viewing.But when contempt for the audience, lack of art, plain inability to live and rough handling of hired talent combine, its worth actively condemning, in the hopes that it may deter future manhandlers of our most precious gift: imagination in love.

            "content": "Hollywood's misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits. For every \"Godfather II,\" there are dozens of \"More American Graffiti's,\" \"Stayin' Alives,\" and \"Grease 2's.\" While the original \"Grease\" is not a great film, the 1977 adaptation of the long-running Broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960's, energetic choreography, and an appealing cast. When Paramount began work on a follow-up, the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster.Fortunately for moviegoers, Michelle Pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts. Her talent and beauty were already evident herein, and Pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform. Maxwell Caulfield, however, lacks even the skill to express embarrassment, and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic. What romantic interest, beyond hormones, could the cool sassy Pfeiffer have in the deadpan Caulfield? That dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory. Only cameos by veterans such as Eve Arden, Connie Stevens, and Sid Caesar have any wit, although Lorna Luft does rise slightly above the lame material.Reviewers have complained that, because \"Grease 2\" is always compared to the original, the movie comes up lacking. However, even taken on its own terms, the film is a clunker. After a frenetic opening number, which evidently exhausted the entire cast, the energy dissipates. With few exceptions, the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960's, and the only nostalgia evoked is for \"Our Miss Brooks\" and \"Sid Caesar's Comedy Hour.\" The jokes fall flat, and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer Patricia Birch is clumsy to be polite. However, worse films have been inflicted on audiences, and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters. Unfortunately, \"Grease 2\" is not even unintentionally funny. Instead, the film holds the viewer's attention like a bad train wreck. Just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered, the next scene plunges into even worse carnage.",

While the original is a fun, young adult's musical, providing some historically accurate moderate sexual undertones, fantastic songs, iconic one-liners delivered by charismatic actors and characters, Grease 2 I think is attempting more a comedic vibe - not that it's my particular type of humour. The songs are just not that well written, the actors for the most part are not at all charismatic and most are quite weak. Something is very lacking, I still can't figure out just what, it's just missing alot... it just doesn't hold my interest, like... at all.

            "content": "When I found out there was a sequel to the highly successful Grease, and the leading actress starring in it, I was certainly most intrigued to see what it would be like, especially reading the many negative reviews. Basically it is 1961, two years after the original T-Birds and Pink Ladies graduated, there's a new crop of senior students at Rydell High. The Pink Ladies are now led by Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer), her boyfriend is arrogant and rather immature new T-Birds leader Johnny Nogerelli (Adrian Zmed), their relationship is going sour. Clean-cut British student Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield), he is the cousin of Sandy Olsson (from the previous film), she asked Frenchy (Didi Conn) to show him around and introduce him, Frenchy has returned to get her diploma and hopes to start a cosmetics company. Michael is quickly smitten when he meets Stephanie, she goes to a bowling game with Johnny, there is animosity between them, Stephanie retaliates by kissing the next man who walks through the door, who happens to be Michael. Bemused by the kiss, Michael asks Stephanie out, but she has specifics on her ideal man, she wants a \"cool rider\", he realises he will only win her affection turning himself into a cool rider, so to pay for a motorcycle he is paid by the T-Birds to write papers for them. At the bowling alley, the T-Birds are surprised by a gang of rival motorcyclists called the Cycle Lords, most of whom are members of the defunct Scorpions, led by Leo Balmudo (Dennis C. Stewart), before a fight starts, a lone anonymous biker appears, it is Michael in disguise, he defeats the enemy gang and disappears, Stephanie is fascinated by the stranger. Stephanie is surprised again at the garage when the Cool Rider appears, they enjoy a romantic twilight motorcycle ride, the T-Birds and Pink Ladies interrupt Michael as he is about to reveal his identity, before he leaves Michael says he will see Stephanie again at the talent show, Johnny is enraged and says he will fight the Cool Rider if he see him again. Stephanie gets poor grades, and Michael offers to help, Johnny sees them in discussion and demands Stephanie to quit the Pink Ladies for his \"rep\", she is still head over heels for the Cool Rider, but she has become smitten with Michael as he is, he ponders whether to continue his secret identity. Stephanie and the Cool Rider meet at the talent show, but the T- Birds ambush and pursue him, with Stephanie and the Pink Ladies following in a car, the chase takes them to a construction site with a concealed deadly drop, with his disappearance the biker is assumed to have perished, Stephanie is left heartbroken and inconsolable, later at the talent show she has a dreamlike fantasy, where she reunites with the mystery biker. The school year ends with a luau, Stephanie won the talent contest and is crowned queen, Johnny is hailed as king, the Cycle Lords show up and destroying celebrations, the Cool Rider reappears and defeats the gang, and reveals himself as Michael. Johnny is initially shocked but welcomes him into the gang, Stephanie accepts she can be with him, all couples happily pair off at the seniors' graduation, and sing and dance together. Also starring Eve Arden as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun, Christopher McDonald as Goose McKenzie, Lorna Luft, Judy Garland's daughter as Paulette Rebchuck, Peter Frechette as Louis DiMucci, Leif Green as Davey Jaworski, Maureen Teefy as Sharon Cooper, Alison Price as Rhonda Ritter and Dody Goodman as Blanche. Pfeiffer, who made her breakthrough in Scarface a year later, is reasonable as the short-skirted minx, Caulfield is only slightly interesting as the nice British guy and his cool motorcycle alter-ego, original cast members returning hardly adds anything to proceedings. I will admit I liked the opening song \"Back to School Again\" by the Four Tops, some of the other song and dance numbers are reasonable, but the love story is almost a repeat, with the roles reversed, it is essentially just reusing the elements of the original Broadway adaptation film, and the result is a tired and nearly boring to watch, I didn't hate all of it, but is is a terrible musical sequel.

Those are the key factors in Grease 2 where after the first song \"Back to School\", we are introduced to Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield) an exchange student from England who happens to be the cousin of Sandy (Olivia Newton John from the original) where he doesn't fit quite yet with Rydell High while being pushed around by a new pack of T-Birds with leader Johnny (Adrian Zmed) and his guys giving him a hard time. Michael falls for a girl named Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer in her film debut) in which she likes him but it'll be against the \"code\" since she's a pink lady (just like in the original) and don't go out with anybody but T-birds. What will Michael have to do to win Stephanie's heart? Grease 2 manages to bring back a couple of recognized faces from Didi Conn, who played Frenchy in the original, with just a few lines to Eddie Deezen whose known to fans as the geek Eugene. Sid Ceasar is the coach; Dody Goodman is Blanche; Eva Arden is Miss McGee and Dennis Stewart returns as the bully to Rydall.

The only saving grace for it was that Maxwell Caulfield was absolutely gorgeous, the epitome of the word in fact. What a backside in those running shorts and leather trousers! Phew! So it was a shame that he couldn't act without it seeming corny and his accent seemed fake, even though he is British.As for the story, it was a crap rewrite of the first, with the roles reversed and sadly it was not the fun film I remembered from my younger days. All I could actually remember was the song \"Reproduction\", because, as a pre pubescent, it seemed hilarious that they were singing about it like that, but on this occasion I couldn't believe just how out of tune they were and how cringeable the song was. I expected better of Tab Hunter.And it wasn't the only one. Let's put it this way, I wouldn't rush out to buy the soundtrack.It seems the lyricists could only come up with enough good songs for the one previous film. I'm not sure why they didn't reuse some of them actually. Certainly \"We Go Together\" would have been a better song to finish on.All of the songs and singing were poor and sometimes just downright shrill and I think that they were really what let the whole thing down, although Max wasn't the only one who could have used some acting lessons. They songs just didn't gel the story together properly. They were cheesey and irrelevant.It seemed even more superficial than the first, but they got away with it, this one didn't.It feels like the younger sibling of 'Grease', a childish copy written by a fan that didn't want the story to end and with a smaller budget.I think I've seen it enough now to remember not to bother again.329.31/1000.",

            "content": "\"Grease 2\" is an example of how bad products (in this case, very bad products) can win market laws, gain momentum, and eventually carve a niche for themselves in the big wall of fame.The reasons for this movie's success are, and will always be, mysterious to me. It obviously carried on the success of the original \"Grease\" (fun music, fan atmosphere, cool actors, and so on). But, besides the first word of the title, the two movies have nothing in common.\"Grease 2\" is the story of a total loser who, for some reason that still beats me, falls in love with a total bitch. Just to make the point: The girl is the leader of some gang of sassy high-school idiots who call themselves \"pink ladies\". They think cool, they act cool, and so on. The girl has only one thing that stands up for her: She's Michelle Pfeiffer. Sadly, that's the end.The total loser is Maxwell Caulfield. If his name does not ring a bell, there is more than a good reason for it. Somehow, this guy manages to hide is nerdy loser identity and turn into a night biker (ops... \"cool rider\") and impress the girl. The cool rider dresses like the Village People, but the audience is supposed to think he looks really, really badass. Somehow, his Village People leathergear is enough to make the girl fall for him---and even make other badass bikers jealous (the other bikers are similarly into the Village People). In the very end, the cool biker is revealed to be the loser guy. The girl falls in love with him and he even manages to gain the trust and respect of the other biker dudes.In case you did not get it, the storyline is a boy-meets-girls as braindead as it can be. Still, a screenwriter who actually finished high school could had made something fun out of it. Here, the fun and lighthearted atmosphere comes only from the music (which is still fun), and is used as a patch to cover the absolute lack of writing and directing skills.The direction is embarrassing. The camera simply follows the actors while they move around and sing. Sometimes they have some interesting choreography (the \"cool rider\" song) that the director manages to kill with a plain and unoriginal vision that makes everything look fake. Somebody might think it's intentionally camp. I still think the overall effects is that of a girl, with an expensive camcorder, who is trying to make a costume movie, with her friends, in her garage. The editing gives me the creeps, and is similarly unoriginal everywhere. The most stylish moment is the first time you see the loser guy acting as the cool rider. He appears out of nothing and lights up the girl's cigarette. The scence is a basic and plain alternation of the close-ups of the two. Most of the different movies scenes are lined up without any transition, giving the idea that the movie reels were simply cut after the director says \"action!\", and glued together. In summary, \"Grease 2\" is an astonishing example of how a bad move can gain following. There is no way to save it in name of the \"so bad that it's good\" taste. The reason is that this was not a bad, unskillful, B-movie. This was a reasonably priced production that just happened to gather together some of the worst crew around at that time, who just rushed to finish the movie in time. The only things that still makes it worth is Michelle Pfeiffer. But you have to watch the movie on mute, otherwise you would just want to kill her for the entire time.",

            "content": "Grease 2 is yet another sequel that completely fails to live up to its predecessor.  Whereas 1978's Grease was fun and energetic, the word that springs to mind in association with Grease 2 is \"forced\".  The director has tried to fit too much colour, too many plot elements, and too many (largely unfunny) humorous interludes into 115 minutes of film.  These teenagers aren't just a little bit naughty and likeably rude, rather they are all-out hussies and juvenile delinquents.The plot is a carbon copy of the original film.  A foreign student enrolls at Rydell High, immediately develops a crush on the leader of the school's socially elite clique, and spends the rest of the movie trying to make themselves cool enough to be dateable material.  One of the movie's few successes is the casting of Michelle Pfeiffer as the head of the Pink Ladies.  She is both real and charismatic.  Unfortunately the same can't be said of her opposite, Michael (Maxwell Caulfield), who never really gets into the feel of the film.  Additionally, his voice is too light for his character, and at times he appears to have difficulty holding a tune. \nSong-wise the best of the bunch are the first and last tracks (Back To School Again and We'll Be Together).  They are catchy and snappily choreographed chorus numbers, worthy of inclusion in the Grease franchise. The rest of the soundtrack wavers between mediocre, appallingly sentimental and plain ridiculous.  Whoever decided that a neat scenario for a song would be to have a biology class singing about the pollination of plants (with the mandatory sexual undertones of course) should have been fired on the spot. Don't sully your 'Grease experience' by watching this.",

            "review_title": "The original \"Grease\" (1978) is the greatest musical film of all-time. But, the excuse for the existence of this \"film\" is.....?",
            "content": "\"Grease 2\" (1982), the only reason for this \"movie\" to be made is all because the film makers saw dollar signs in front of their eyes and greed took over. Because of greed, we get crappy film, after crappy film, after crappy film! This is one of the most pointless sequels of all-time. It has a dumb and cliched story, overall terrible acting and a boring predictable soundtrack. The story, or lack thereof, is pretty much the same thing as in \"Grease\" (1978). I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of that lazy cliched trope! The only difference is that most of the characters are different, but they just mirror the same plot line as the original. Film Making 101: if you're going to make a sequel, try to make the story it's own unique idea without looking back on the first story. You can have some references to the first film. But, if you're going to follow a similar plot line, then you better know what you're doing! Here's a little history about the making of this \"movie\". The original script was incomplete when they started filming. Whose bright idea was that? That totally goes against film protocol! You cannot start production of a movie unless the script is complete. Otherwise, your film will just be a jumbled mess! All this \"film\" does is recycle the original movie. Only without the energy and charm! As for the acting, it's overall disappointing from all of the actors and actresses. However, the only ones that seem to be trying are the actors and actresses from the first movie that are included in this \"film\". Yes, a few of the original cast members from the first movie were somehow bribed to take part in this atrocity. The cast members that returned are: Didi Conn as Frenchy, Eve Arden as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun, Dody Goodman as Secretary Blanche Hodel, Eddie Deezen as Eugene Felsnick, Dennis C. Stewart as Leo Balmudo and Dick Patterson as Mr. Spears (who had actually appeared as Mr. Rudie in the previous film). Those cameos are the only performances that are worth watching. I don't know how they were talked into reprising their roles. Props to the casting agents! The sad thing is that this was Eve Arden's final theatrical role. What a terrible last movie for her to appear in. Such a crying shame, talk about going out on a low! Film Making 101: if you're going to make a sequel, make sure that the whole original cast is able to return. If they can't, just cancel the \"movie\"! They didn't want to appear in this dumb \"film\" and I don't blame them! What they should have done was have the original cast in college. Then, this \"film\" would actually have some relevance for existing! Finally, the soundtrack is just boring and predictable. However, there is only one song in this \"movie\" that isn't that bad, honestly. The opening song, \"Back to School Again\", is actually a pretty catchy and well choreographed piece of music. Unfortunately, the rest of the music sucks. They started out promising, but then the \"film\" just takes a nose dive for the worst after that. They built me up, and then just kicked me in the nuts! Now for the positives, yes, there are a couple of positives in this \"film\". The sets/locations are nice and give a decent atmosphere. All of the special effects were well-done and still hold up today. Sadly, good sets/locations and special effects are no excuses for a bad story and horrible acting. \"Grease 2\" is a waste of a \"movie\" and it always will be. Thankfully, I'll never have to watch it again. I give this \"movie\" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 stars. The first \"Grease\" movie is my all-time favorite musical film. \"Grease 2\" is an insult to the first movie! Just stick with the original film and try to forget that this sequel exists. I know I will! \"Grease\" is the word, not \"Grease 2\"!",

However, the iconic songs from the first film are gone, replaced by forgettable fluff pieces of music clearly written to recall former glory days. None of them has the same zing or vibrancy that made the ones in the first film such a hit.The acting just isn't of the same calibre either. As a British viewer, I found Maxwell Caulfield's performance wooden, and Michelle Pfeiffer's little better. In fact, Pfeiffer usually seems to disappoint, only seeming to snap out of average-ness on occasion, SCARFACE and STARDUST being two of the times she seems to be making an effort. While I appreciate the attention that has been made to period detail and enthusiasm, but GREASE 2 is a waste of everyone's time.",

Adrian Zmed and Lorna Luft are among the other teens, looking closer to that age but lacking in decent material.So it's up to Eve Arden, Dody Goodman and Sid Caesar as the faculty and staff, joined by a campy Connie Stevens who looks like she came back in time from a future production of \"Hairspray\" and laughably Tab Hunter as her love interest.A great opening number (\"Back to School\") sets the tone for what never comes. Each musical number seems like it could be removed and make no impact, with the luau number at the end just wretched.

It's pitched at such an infantile level one wonders who the target audience is.

But, to be honest, although it has it's good bits, \"Grease\" get's boring very quickly - I couldn't stand the cheerleading scene and it is very cheesy. But Stockard Channing and John Travolta were probably the only good things about this movie; and 'You're The One That I Want' is pretty catchy, too.What I can't understand, is why people can't stand Grease 2, and they haven't even seen it. Being a big fan of sequels, I think that it's harsh to label them 'pathetic' without viewing them. I can think of 3 sequels right now that are better or as good as the originals - Scream 2, Return To Oz and Batman Returns, and I must say, Grease 2 also fits in there.Michelle Pfieffer is nothing short of brilliant as her role of Stephanie Zinone - the hot chick of the school who's been sought after by 'cute' nerdy boy, Michael Carrington (fairly weak Maxwell Caulfield) She has the best lines (like in that Hamburger restaurant) and to my surprise, she can actually sing. Everyone who's seen it says that \"Cool Rider\" is the BEST song on this movie - and it is!(Superman II's) Maureen Beefy, (Judy Garland's daughter) Lorna Luft, and (Grease's) Didi Conn also feature here, and give notable performances. Cast originals Eve Arden, Dody Goodman and Coach Calhoun return, too.Along with Cool Rider, there are also some other good songs. \"Reproduction\" is one of the funniest songs written, \"(Love Will) Turn Back The Hands Of Time\" is pretty nice and \"Score Tonight\" is lively and fun.Altogether - this as good as sequels come (baring in mind, I've never watched any of the Godafther films and don't care to) and I give a wicked 7/10 - plus \u00bd extra for Michelle!!",

Sadly, it is hard to watch this as an independent film OR a sequel, as it follows the same mold too closely - it is a blatant rip off. All the characters are the exact same stereotypes and half the one-liners are even identical. There's the leader of the T-birds, the cool side kick, the two ditsy followers, likewise with the Pink Ladies. Then of course there is the teachers, crater face etc, all the same characters but with different names and played by different actors. The only thing different about this movie is that their \"cool wheels\" are motorbikes not cars, and the roles of the two lead characters are reversed (i.e the female is the cool chick and the male tries to change so that he can win her heart).

Good GUY falls in love with the sultry bad GIRL by totally changing his image and abandoning his sense of individuality. See? Totally different movie. Not at all a lackluster attempt to rehash the original and cash in on the American public's love for it. I'm reminded of Vanilla Ice's classic interview where he tried to explain how the main melody from his hit single Ice, Ice, Baby was totally different from the melody everyone accused him of copying. \"Yeah, see, their tune goes, 'ding ding ding ding ding ding. Ding ding ding ding ding ding.' And ours goes, 'ding ding ding ding ding ding. Diga-ding ding ding ding ding ding.' See? Totally different.\" Anyway, back to Grease 2. I liked the opening song, much like everyone else here, because it opened the film with a bang and was lightning quick and even a tad catchy. But then the song ended and Frenchie came back and the kids started singing about sex using really awful innuendo. And why did Frenchie come back, you may ask? Maybe because the filmmakers knew that without someone from the original everyone would realize how crappy their movie was even quicker than usual. I'm reminded of how they brought Screech back to Saved By the Bell: The New Class. Yeah, that gimmick didn't save the overall project, either. Unless you want to see a couple in a bomb shelter singing about how they should 'do it' for America, I suggest you ditch Grease 2 and stay with the first one, which I also have a few problems with. Mainly, why did Sandy have to change her appearance and personality to make John Travolta like her? What kind of message is that to send to the kids who watch this movie so much and love it with all their hearts? That if you want people to date you you should refuse to have your own life and create brand new ones to satisfy them? Sorry, but that's not my philosophy on how the world works. Well, at least how it should work. I give Grease 2 1.5/4 stars, if only for the decent opener and the hilarious fact that Catwoman (Michelle) is in this big cornfest. If you watch this coming from the viewpoint of Bad Movie Night, be sure to throw in a couple of harsh comments about her Xmas Tree outfit during the big school play. HA! Look at her! She's a tree!

Going in to watching Grease 2 and expecting to see a musical sequel live up to the strong likes of Grease will certainly cause you to breakdown sobbing uncontrollably calling for your mommy all within a first few minutes of the film, but it's really NOT, all that bad well ya it is but still, it's a forgivable bad. Grease 2 is very ingratiating, just like Grease, but in a different vibe. The sequel just never has any chance at being as good as Grease, but still Grease 2 is such a guilty pleasure of mine. It's really not that bad. It's playful, very decent mild-mannered merriment. The songs are...so worse than the songs of Grease...let's not say that, let's say they're catchy good. I love the songs of Grease 2 even though they're not all that good, or on second thought, maybe they are good, I dunno, I do love them, I mean.....no...no they're definitely, definitely not that good. My favorite Grease 2 tunes are \"Back To School Again\", \"Score Tonight\", and \"Cool Rider\". I love, love, love Michelle Pfeiffer starring and singing and performing in Grease 2. Without the worthwhile Michelle Pfeiffer there's really no telling how bad it might have got. Grease 2 is enjoyable at times though it is consistently bad, but it isn't too unsavory and it tries so good. It earns a good 5 rating wholly on its fun, lighthearted goodness, and for the presence of Pfeiffer. If I love Grease 2 this much, please understand just how much it is that I love Grease......sooooooooo, so very much.",

            "content": "Patrica Birch, the choreographer from the original Grease, tried her hand at directing in this sequel to one of the biggest box office hits of the 1970's. It was the first and last feature film she would direct to date. The film had a troubled production history from the get go, as John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John were rejected after opening talks to resume their roles from the original film. I would guess they probably wanted too much money. After that, it was all down hill as actresses and actors rejected the film left and right. Michelle Pfeiffer finally took the role of Stephanie Zinone and Maxwell Caulfield the role of Michael Carrington. The film has many of the familiar faces of the original, including Didi Conn as Frenchy, Eve Arden as Principal McGee, Dody Goodman as Blanche Hodel, Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun, and Eddie Deezen as Eugene Felnic. Tab Hunter and Connie Stevens are on hand as teachers.What the film doesn't have is the infectious energy of the original and star power. After the opening number \"Back To School Again\", the musical numbers fall flat and are less inventive. Maxwell Caulfield, although good-looking, has zero charisma. Michelle Pfeiffer's character is annoying after a while, and her T-bird boyfriend (played by Adrian Zmed in his film debut) is just obnoxious. The film has several production errors which are obvious to even some casual observers, such as the motorcycles dated ten years or more after the time of the film (1961) and the multi-colored basketballs from the ABA several years before they were introduced. This film actually almost broke even in the end, despite its poor reputation, but its lack of mega-success put the kibosh on more planned sequels and a television series. *1/2 of 4 stars.",

            "content": "I do like to review each film on it's own merit whether it is a sequel, part of a franchise or remake rather than just comparing it to the original, but in the case of Grease 2 it's complicated seeing how the original Grease is so beloved, a perfect confection of a movie and is firmly in my top 5 films of all time. That is probably why I couldn't face watching Grease 2 after all the flack it had received in the intervening years and, before you know it, almost 40 years have passed but at least now I can come at it with fresh eyes and be more objective.I was ready to really enjoy this film, clear my mind of all negativity and hope it would recapture all the energy and exuberance of the first film. It tries, it really tries, but it tries so hard it sorely misses the mark on every level. Broadly speaking original choreographer turned director Patricia Birch falls into all the cliched traps that Randal Kleiser was able to avoid the first time around.The problem starts with the whole role reversal idea where fiesty Michelle Pfeiffer is the one wooing shy Aussie Maxwell Caulfield. It probably looked great on paper but in reality, especially set in 1961, it never rings true. Pfeiffer does her best in her first big starring role but Caulfield is woefully miscast and lacks the charisma needed. The other major problem are the songs. Grease was always a stand alone musical which ran on broadway for years before it made it to the big screen. I came away from Grease 2 not being able to hum one song from the entire movie, and for a musical that is not a good sign. The musical numbers seemed forced at times rather than being organic to the story. It's almost like they came up with the songs first and built a script around it.To be fair to Birch the staging of the dance sequences are great and that is what she is good at but that is all we have here. Everything looks familar but, like starting a new school year, it is also unfamiliar. The approach here was to try to make it more contemporary with a ramping up of sexual innuendo and risque songs but this is it's major downfall. Audiences loved the charm and innocence of the original, Grease 2 denies us of that and tries to be more sassy but it falls flat.A few of the original supporting cast members make a welcome return like Didi Conn, Sid Caesar and Eddie Deezen but have little effect on the overall outcome of falling well short of the original, not being able to carve out an identity of it's own and ultimately disappointing audiences.",

The songs are cheesy (the real low point being 'Cool Rider'), the acting is diabolical (as stated, Pfieffer looks embarrassed to be on the screen) and the plot line is, at best, weak. Maxwell Caulfield does a reasonable job and, in my opinion, pulls off his role as the stiff English student, but the rest of them (except Didi Conn who is shamefully under-used) - forget it.The writers and actors in Grease 2 had huge shoes to fill, as Grease is a classic, however where Grease had a really cute charm to it, Grease 2 just stinks of money grabbing producers cashing in on the name. There is nothing likable about it and whereas the T-Birds and Pink Ladies were cool and funny in the original, in this vile production they are just horrible, nasty and obnoxious.I've given this a 3 purely on the basis that I think Pfieffer should be given some credit for pulling back her career after starring in this car-crash.",

Instead of the T-birds being the central characters we a have a charming British boy called Micheal who falls for Pink Ladies leader Stephanie who does not notice him because he is not a hard core rider. Plot is pretty good, the T-birds look amazing on their bikes however the things that let the film down are some of the songs (Reproduction) and the rest of the pink ladies are really stupid.

            "content": "Some people will say to watch this film as a separate entity to fully appreciate it. This would be fine if it was a stand-alone release, however this was released as a direct sequel to Grease (and the marketing matches that claim). It's an insult to the intelligence of the viewer to expect them to forget the previous film in order to enjoy this one; if you're going to branch out the Grease name, it needs to be done in a way that compliments (or, at least, satisfactorily exists in the same universe as) the original.This film drastically cuts down on the star power and is a victim of what I affectionately call \"The Final Destination Effect,\" wherein you have an astounding leading film with one or more sequels that proceed to do almost the exact same thing. This film is nothing more than Grease without the flawless soundtrack, Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta.So, what happened?Other reviewers call for second viewings of the film, which IS a fair request for viewers. Perhaps, in the very unlikely chance that a second viewing is desired, this review will be amended to make it more favourable. However, as it stands, it's simply an inferior film in every way.It has twice the budget of the original, yet none of the fan favorite stars could be budgeted in. Sure, the money shows in the set design, costuming, music and post-production but, again, as a sequel to the incredible Grease, it's totally fair to demand more in the quality department. Had this been released with its own title away from its predecessor, it would've been viewed as a \"knockoff Grease\" in the same way a film like The Burning is a poor man's Friday the 13th... but that film is endlessly entertaining despite this fact.This is what it boils down to, ultimately: sure, you could jam out to and enjoy such hits as \"Back to School\" or \"Cool Rider,\" but the question remains the same: Why WOULD you when you could have \"Summer Nights,\" \"Greased Lightning\" and \"You're the One That I Want?\"Given that this film is simply a different slab of flesh on the same skeleton of the original, it's difficult to see where this film has relevance outside of offering the edgier people of society an inferior sequel to dote on as their \"favorite\" simply because preference of the original is too mainstream for them.I ask again, and will until the end of time: what went wrong? This could've been a really fantastic film. They chose, instead, to copy the original and it had a detrimental effect, both on quality and at the box office.",

Of course owned the VHS, and the Special Edition DVD with cast interviews and the like. Seen it numerous more times. It was THE movie I cherished more than even the great Star Wars.But, this is about Grease 2. I didn't want to watch Grease 2 when it came out. It didn't have John Travolta and Olivia Newton- John in it, therefore it seemed like a cheap imitation or at the time a shoddy low budget Broadway production. Why didn't they invest more money in it? Probably, just the passage of time. Silly Hollywood always moving at the speed of light. They were probably already bored with Grease and moving in new and other directions.So I always shunned this movie. Let's jump a lot of time and come to the year 2021. Wow, we just went to hell and back in 2020 with the Covid-19 pandemic and the political darkness storm that plagued the great USA. A new day has come, the storms are passing as I write this, America is being shaken up, and we are being freed now. There is just so a great peace now that is moving all over the country. People are starting sense it. I have been 100% liberated from every storm and just been experiencing total peacefulness all around. So I see Grease and Grease 2 are coming on TV this day. After all the mess 2020, and a new beginning 2021, I say to myself, maybe, I should finally watch Grease 2. So I come here to IMDB and read a few reviews. They movie is rated horribly at 4.4 stars. But, the reviews, a lot of them, they say something different. And I decide, yes, today is the day that I will finally watch Grease 2.Immediately, I was drawn right in this movie. The movie moves well, sometimes really fast, other times slower. Great balance. I was always into what was happening in 1961 and really I just ended up loving this great flick.Grease 2 isn't really a simple film, Grease is a little simpler, in my opinion. Grease 2 comes out crazier than the original, but yet, it has it's tender moments as well. I think 2 has a lot things happen in it, but so does 1. 2 has a huge cast, 500, great music (I was really surprised), because the music from 1 was so great. The music styles are little different, I guess mainly the year differential. Kind of Rock and Roll High School versus Rock and Roll college.",

When the rival Cycle Lords confront the T-Birds, Michael comes to the rescue hidden under a helmet and Stephanie falls for the mystery rider.This is a campy return to Rydell High. There are a couple of good songs and some bad ones. I like Cool Rider for the chorus. This is much more like a high school musical production. Michelle Pfeiffer is one of the sexiest woman in movie history but there is something very campy about her doing song and dance. She's way too cool to do this. Meanwhile, Maxwell Caulfield is way too much of a pretty boy. He's literally drawing hearts in his notebook. They made him too sappy. I don't mind the story but the British guy could have been James Bond. The story is mostly functional. Michelle and Maxwell are pretty people but there isn't enough heat.

At the time I was young and didn't know any better.\"The total budget for the production was $11.2 million, almost double the budget of the original, but hardly anyone* was coming back other than producer Allan Carr. He was getting $5 million for the sequel and it was three years since Grease was a success. Composers Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, director Randal Kleiser and actors John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John weren't coming back. So Carr got Patricia Birch - who choreographed the first movie - to direct and choreograph this. It's the only theatrical movie she'd ever direct, but she did make Cyndi Lauper's videos for \"Money Changes Everything\" and \"True Colors.\" Sadly for her, she'd also been pulled into another movie that co-producer Robert Stigwood made, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. I hope she got paid enough.You know who else was in a bad spot? Ken Finkleman. He was writing this movie and Airplane 2 while also directing that movie, all at the same time. Two hits whose original creative teams refused to come back for the bigger budgeted sequel. This, as you may guess, is usually a recipe for disaster. Speaking of projects after this with 80s singers, he'd go on to write the Madonna vehicle Who's That Girl.There was an idea to get Travolta and Newton-John to be a married couple that ran a gas station. Thankfully, they refused and I could keep the morbid fantasy in my head that they both drowned in Grease and the entire movie is the fantasy they have while the oxygen leaves their brains. There was also the idea to base the sequel around Jeff Conaway and Stockard Channing, who would be playing a 37-year-old - and still fabulous - teenager. They also turned it down.While Pfeiffer was an unknown, Maxwell Caulfield was already a Broadway star. And also unlike her, his career paid the price for this movie bombing. He told MovieTome, \"Before Grease 2 came out I was being hailed as the next Richard Gere or John Travolta. But when Grease 2 flopped nobody would touch me. It felt like a bucket of cold water had been thrown in my face. It took me 10 years to get over Grease 2.\"It's 1961, school at Rydell is n session and The Pink Ladies - Sharon Cooper (Maureen Teefy, who was also Lucy Lane in another bomb we need to get to, Supergirl), Paulette Rebchuck (Lorna Luft, half-sister of Liza and one of the girls in Where the Boys Are '84), Rhonda Ritter (Alison Price, who is also in the aforementioned Airplane 2), Dolores Rebchuck (Pamela Segall, the voice of Bobby Hill) and their leader Stephanie Zinone (Pfeiffer) - and The T-Birds - Goose McKenzie (Christopher McDonald, who most people would say is Shooter McGavin but he's also in The Black Room), Louis DiMucci (Peter Frechette, The Hills Have Eyes Part II), Davey Jaworski (Leif Green, Joysticks) and their leader Johnny Nogerelli (Adrian Zmed from TJ Hooker!) - are battling over the fact that Stephanie just dumped Johnny.Frenchy** (Didi Cohn) has come back to school to get her diploma and gives Michael Carrington (Caulfield) a quick tour of the school. He's an English exchange student who coincidentally happens to be a cousin of Sandy because the UK and Australia are the same thing. He falls for Stephanie, who ends up kissing him accidentally at a bowling alley, but she'll only date a motorcycle-riding man. Michael is smart enough to do the T-Birds homework, earning the money and the cred to get a bike of his own and becoming the mysterious Cool Rider who saves them from the Cycle Lords - formerly the Scorpions - and gets Stephanie all hot and bothered.So yeah - mistaken identity, dudes trying to date rape their ladies by pretending a nuclear war is happening, Tab Hunter as a teacher, Olivia Newton-John's first husband Matt Lattanzi as one of the Prep-Tones (they got married after being meeting on the set of Xanadu), Katey Segal's twin sisters Jean and Liz, Andy Tennant (whose career somehow survived being in this, Sgt. Pepper's and 1941), Connie Stevens as Miss Yvette Mason, Mrs. Gretzky Janet Jones as a girl who missed her last two periods and Ninja 3 and Breakin' star Lucinda Dickie as a female greaser.There were going to be four Grease movies*** and a TV series and everything was going to be great. Of course, it didn't work out that way.Except in Kannada (South India), where the script was turned into the 1987 blockbuster Premaloka.*That's not exactly true. Frenchy (Didi Conn), Principal McGee (Eve Arden), Coach Calhoun (Sid Caesar), Blanche Hodel (Dody Goodman), Eugene Felsnick (Eddie Deezen), Craterface (Dennis C. Stewart) and Mr. Spears (Dick Patterson) all came back for another helping.**Frenchy disappears halfway through the movie, never to be seen again.***The rumors that Disney made the third script as High School Musical are just that.

The actors themselves were fine (I'm shocked Phieffer was able to make something of her career after this). The movies that bad. It's a musical. So the songs have to be GREAT. Something memorable. They are mostly melodic and not snappy. Few solos and if there are, horrible. Maxwell and Michele are the only bright spots. Zmed tries too hard to be Zuko.The musics to enhanced for a better word. To many background instruments. To much voice enhancement. Doesn't feel fresh at all.If i could say one more thing, every single song in the original Grease is memorable. Every character. The singing felt comfortable and didn't require a lot except the great voices. Grease 2 is just the opposite. No song will sound familiar because non was a hit or done well. This movie should never ever have been made. I'm ashamed at Stigwood!!!",

The songs were contrived and meaningless, and lacked any charm whatsoever.

Instead of cool Danny and prim Sandy we have Micheal and Stephanie. He's a nerdy brainbox she's the pretty cool leader of the pink ladies. Its love at first sight for him, but in order to win her heart he has to become a \"cool rider\" so shallow.The critics may bash it, the dialogue may be laughable the songs weak.

            "review_title": "In a Musical the Music Writer is Everything",
            "content": "The single greatest pains I have suffered in my life of watching movies has been watching Grease 2. It pains me deeply to watch a poorly cast main actor, whose name is so forgettable, unlike John Travolta, and a memorable Michelle Pfieffer whose role is doesn't even hold water - the chewing gum girl. However the single greatest mistake in this movie is the Producer's decision to forget the importance that in a musical, musical writers are the ticket to a great movie. The second mistake they made was to change the director from Randal Kleiser to a Patricia Birch. The formula of successes for Robert Stigwood in Saturday Night Live was the Bee Gees, and for Grease 1, it was John Farrar, Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. However, it was John Farrar's music that stole the show for Grease 1. In Grease 2 the only great music that comes from the entire sad movie was Reproduction, which turns out to be a comedy than a real musical. Assuming the relative interesting music, I believe just only one to be unique for Grease 2, while for Grease 1, you got \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\", \"Summer Nights\", \"Grease\", \"You're the One that I want\", and \"Grease Lightning\". Grease 1 had 5 great hits, while only one not so great \"Reproduction\", from then on the value of musical is not even any interesting. With poor scripts, bad casting, and a forgotten talented music writers, the movie is painful for me to watch. Way back in the 1950s, they proudly promoted their musical writers, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, and the hits were consistent with the talent of the musical writer, such as Oklahoma!, King and I, The Sound of Music, South Pacific, and then some. Then we have the enduring Henry Mancini, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Pink Panther, and other memorable movies just by the weight of the musicians. The producers such as Robert Stigwood basically got lucky, but didn't learn from any of their success, which I think was fluke, despite bad scripts from Saturday Night Fever, but didn't seem to learn from their success, and seems to go downhill. So in case I am wondering why Grease 2 failed, it failed in most every aspect that it is still a pain to watch that forgettable what's his face, British Actor, and somewhat uninteresting Michelle Pfieffer miscast and the lack of any chemistry between the two. Still it can be salvaged and become a hit, if the producers simply didn't toss away John Farrar, Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey like feminine napkins. If anyone thinks Grease 2 was poorly budgeted, its budget was 13,000,000 compared to Grease 1 where its budget is halved that at 6,000,000. So it is likely that they didn't care about the quality of music in a musical. If you want to watch a good musical, I think Grease 1, Chicago, Hairspay, Saturday Night Fever and Sound of Music would be it. But if you just wanted to see the movie without the need for any music and a Michelle Pfieffer fans, or what's his face main actor, then Grease 2 is better. All in all, I would like to give a 1, but decided to give 2 out of 10 for this because the title Grease 2 is a good one, other than that, there is no redeeming likeness Grease 1 other than the fact that it was done by the same Producers, who short-sightedness barely made any money from this mistake.",

It's not the worst film overall I've seen, but definitely the one of the worst musical films (out of the very few musical films I've seen).A vast majority of the cast are obscure actors/actresses and the acting is cheesy, very average, uncool and nothing special. Quite a lot of the actors just went over the top in trying to act cool, especially the T-Birds. They went WAY over the top in trying to act cool but it really just came out in such an unimpressive and pathetic way it was almost funny. Although having said that, they did do a bit more than the G1 T-Birds, and they did do one or two things they did that were funny, but of course I laughing at their pitiful expense. They are a bit like 1950's chavs in leather coats. And The Pink Ladies were just way too humble and were a bit bland. Even Michelle Pfeiffer's performance lacked spark albeit pretty good, and Maxwell Caufield was OK from what I remember(it's been a fair few years since I saw this film), and the people who returned from G1. Those twins have to be the most irritating characters of the film. Ugh! Thinking about them almost makes me want to throw up. They also have to be at least two of the most irritating characters in film history. And that song they do. Yuck! Sweet sugary gooey puke! And the music. God help me, the music! Most of the songs are cheesy, irritating, stupid, cringe-worthy, easily forgettable, tasteless, lack charm/emotional power/likable element, and no or pretty much no meaning to them whatsoever.The storyline is cheesy, fairly weak , it's typical, nothing special a bit sleazy and very unoriginal; they switched personalities with genders with the characters. It tried to do better than the original, but failed rather miserably. Grease and musical film fans who haven't seen this, rent this first because you might be disappointed.",

He is met by \"Frenchy\" (Didi Conn), the \"Beauty School Dropout\" who is returning to start her career in cosmetology by learning high school chemistry.Soon after arriving, he bumps into the beautiful \"Stephanie\" (Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first starring role), who is the leader of the girls gang the \"Pink Ladies,\" and the latest girl of \"Johnny\" (Adrian Zmed), the leader of the \"T-Birds\", a gang once lead by \"Danny\" in the original movie.It is love at first sight for the well-mannered young man, but he quickly learns that he has to be a \"T-Bird\" to date her. But, he will do anything to get close to her.Now, \"Michael\" pursues his crush by turning into what \"Stephanie\" wants -- a \"cool rider\" who will sweep her off her feet.Let me say right off the bat, this is a very weak followup to one of the greatest musicals of all time. It just completely lacks the magic of the original film.First of all, there is the music. If you ask me, only two of the 13 songs are memorable. The rest, though having the sound of early-60's music, is just terrible and uninspired. To me, most of the tunes sounded as if they were just thrown together just before production starts. As for the choreography in these scenes, it's hit or miss. In the original, we get an energetic dance number in the school gym, which is one of the most memorable moments in the movie. In Grease 2, we get an out-of-nowhere number in the local bowling alley that the cast appeared to enjoy doing. However, I would not want to go back to learn these steps (and I am in a wheelchair). I also felt, with some exceptions, that the cast was taught the choreography the day before filming the dance scenes.One of the biggest problems is character development. To me, the characters seemed to have been written as if we are expected to know the new faces. Most of the main characters appear to be loosely based on specific characters from the first film (most notably \"Michael,\" a male version of \"Sandy\" with a bit of \"Danny\" thrown in, and \"Stephanie\", a female version of \"Danny\" with a bit of \"Sandy\" thrown in). There are also many supporting characters with their own, minor story lines which barely moves the story along. We get only minor basics of these characters, and the audience mostly ignores them due to not being presented well.As for performances from the main cast, they are fairly good, but not perfect. Pfeiffer is near perfect in her first major role on the silver screen, and carries the weaker members of the cast fairly well in their scenes together -- and she can actually carry a tune pretty well (especially in \"Cool Rider,\" one of the only two songs you will most likely remember after the closing credits end. Caulfield was pretty good as \"Michael\", even in his invented alter-ego to swoon \"Stephanie\". However, there was something lacking in their romantic chemistry most of the time.The supporting cast, all around, is quite weak. Like I said, these characters are horribly written. We only get the most basic information. The \"T-Birds\" lacked the feel of being a unit, as did the \"Pink Ladies.\" We even get some of the original cast in this film, but they are only on-screen to deliver a line or two as the movie progresses.As for the wardrobes, nothing real special here. The gym shirts the men wear in one scene appear to have the school name ironed onto it, and not in a quality a school district would spend the money on. I found the wardrobe pretty boring actually. The \"Pink Ladies\" and \"T-Birds\" iconic jackets don't look that great on the cast members wearing them. And, especially with certain male members of the cast, the hairdos look too much teased. It looked as if they cut some corners on the wardrobes and hairdos to me.The story just feels rushed, especially the part where \"Michael\" creates his alter-ego. It appears that he became an expert in riding rather quickly, as there was no way to tell how much time had past.I really can't recommend this one. If you already own the first movie, I would suggest that you get this film just so you can have both movies. And that's the only reason to purchase it. It's just not able to live up to the icon that is the original.",

            "content": "Grease 2 is one of the most ridiculed sequels of all time, and though it pales to the original, its certainly better than the rating would imply. The film is just more musical numbers and hijinks from the kids at Rydell High. Only this time, the new kid on the block is a guy trying to impress a cool chick. As opposed to a goody-two-shoes girl trying to win over a cool guy like we saw in the original. There are some cute songs and funny moments, but the two leads (Caulfield and Pfeiffer) just cannot live up to Olivia Newton-John or John Travolta. Not even close. First of all, neither can sing terribly well, and generally you'd like your leads in a musical to be able to sing. It really helps. Caulfield is somewhat more likable in the underdog role, but Pfeiffer's acting is really poor. She was a pretty face and little more at that point of her career. Her song \"Cool Rider\" is one of the film's worst. While singing it, she does look kind of sexy while climbing up to the top of a ladder and then straddling it. But then when she gets down she starts doing something resembling the Elaine dance from Seinfeld. Thumbs in the air and all! Weird. Director/choreographer Pat Birch should have fixed that.There are some good performances from some of the folks playing the T-Birds and Pink Ladies. Adrian Zmed provides some chuckles with his false bravado in many scenes. Chris McDonald who plays the Goose has been a solid performer in movies and TV for years. And you're telling me Lorna Luft is a daughter of Judy Garland? Who new? Its good to see some of the faculty members are back from the original, but Didi Conn doesn't seem to belong. It seems like the producers agreed and just kind of wrote her out of the movie by the third act.It's really kind of odd how this movie has been aired seemingly more than the popular original over the years. It didn't hurt Pfeiffer's career (nor did marrying producer David E. Kelly), but this movie destroyed Caulfield's before it even began. He has kept somewhat busy, and was even considered at one point for the James Bond role. But he's never been the star he perhaps could have been. Grease 2 isn't all bad. It's worth about 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

            "content": "When you take into consideration that the original \"Grease\" movie was such a phenomenal success with movie-going audiences the world over, is it any surprise that the sequel to one of the highest grossing musicals in cinematic history, fell short of matching or -heaven forbid- even surpassing the achievement of it's predecessor? Of course it wasn't a surprise, and I'm sure that upon it's general release, there were one or two executives at Paramount Pictures that wished they hadn't even bothered making the movie in the first place - and the reason for that being is simply: some movies should be left to bask in their own glory without being bastardised and diluted with one or more sequels. \"Grease 2\" is one such example.Whether you want to compare \"Grease 2\" with the original or take an unbiased view and appraise it on it's own, nothing can hide the fact this really is a terrible movie. So where did \"Grease 2\" go wrong? For one, the entire movie script is more or less a rehash of the original (albeit in some instances, the male/female roles have been reversed to disassociate this from being a straight remake). Take the main love angles in both movies for example: in the first movie, you had the cool kid (Travolta) falling for the \"square\" new-kid-in-town girl (Newton-John), and in the sequel, it's the same, but the roles are gender reversed. Originality seemed lost on the script-writers, and this was further evident during the whole movie, especially during the end-of-school-year carnival where the 'square' kid (Michael) is finally accepted - a scene that's blatantly ripped off from the original \"Grease\".The original \"Grease\" cast never won awards for their acting abilities, but compared to those relative unknowns (back in 1982) who secured the leading roles in the sequel, they make John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John seem like Oscar winners because their acting abilities ranged from 'acceptable' to 'dire', with the latter description perfectly summing up the majority of the cast of \"Grease 2\". Moreover, the injection of old, supporting actors from the first movie (Frenchy and Eugene especially) seemed questionable too. Granted, \"teachers\" were understandable returnees, but Frenchy returning to Rydell High two years after she left to supposedly enter 'beauty school' (and dropped out almost immediately as her character explained in the first movie) and, like the Eugene character, had already graduated. Why were they even in the movie, other than to make an association between the two films? To give the casting people credit, at least for the second movie they hired actors who, at least, looked like teenagers which couldn't be said about the first \"Grease\".Whereas the soundtrack is what the original will be best remembered for, the songs used in \"Grease 2\" were a lot to be desired. With the exception of the terrific opening number (\"Back To School Again\" performed by the Four Tops) and \"Who's That Guy?\" (with the former being the best song from both movies IMO), the quality of the songs matched the acting ability on show. \"Prowlin'\", \"Do It For Our Country\" and \"Reproduction\" were all appalling and the worst on offer; \"Cool Rider\" and the sexual innuendo laced, \"Score Tonight\" were passable as songs (even if the accompanying dance scenes were so bad, they were actually hilarious - see Ms Pfeiffer strut to \"Cool Rider\" and you'll see what I mean); \"Charades\" is actually a lovely ballad, or it would've been if someone other than Mr Caulfield had sung it, yet it was quite 'dark' and featured in something of a noir-ish scene that didn't really belong in the movie. The rest of this rather short soundtrack is made up with what can only be described as uninteresting fillers.As for the characters themselves, it seems the 'Pink Ladies' have become the most dominant gang at Rydell High because those characters are the most strongest, especially the roles of Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Paulette (Lorna Luft). Despite the fact that the 'T-Birds' epitomised everything \"cool\" in the original, they seem to have turned into a group of geeks in this movie. Adrian Zmed (\"Johnny\") and Christopher McDonald (\"Goose\") are certainly no John Travolta and Jeff Conaway, neither were their characters. Didi Conn reprised the exact same role she had in the first movie as Frenchy, someone present in the movie to introduce the \"new kid\" to the ways of the school and what it took to be 'cool'. Unfortunately, in \"Grease 2\", we'd seen it all before and her character seemed 'tired'. To their credit, Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield played their characters well, and unlike the majority of the cast, they did seem 'believable'. Pfeiffer, in the role of the street smart, hard-as-nails head of the 'Pink Ladies' and Caulfield, the stereotypical upper class British teenager (of 1961) did have something of an on-screen chemistry, but were sadly let down by their supporting actors.It really is unfair to compare this movie with the original, but it is a sequel after all - a movie with more than just a few connections to the first, so it's understandable that's the view people will have. In fact, there's no comparison at all. The original was great\u0085. this movie isn't. It really is as simple as that.",

If Grease 2 is such a disaster, why is it that I first watched it in second grade when it was released and can now watch it over and over again at age 34 when it appears on the Sky movie channels? I love watching the male leads, I love the cheesy songs, particularly the dream sequence during the talent show, and I love seeing Michelle in what I think is the role in which she looked most beautiful, save maybe Scarface. Today it was on again for the thousandth time, and yes, I did wonder how they allowed for the fact that Michael wasn't playing the piano during the talent show, but then I just pretended that he was only needed for the auditions as they could have had someone professional play for the real show. OK, OK, indulge me. The point is, considering that my favourite movies are more serious films like Deerhunter, Scarface and Cool Hand Luke, there's no way you can argue that I simply have no taste. It's probably more appealing to women anyway who like watching hotties like Maxwell Caulfield and who appreciate singing and dancing in films. Even if the singers are far from good. Who cares about 18 wheelers in the background and Maxwell's bad voice and Michelle's bad acting? Clearly some of you are those people who watch your movies with fingers poised on the pause and rewind buttons anxiously waiting for the director to screw up. Loosen up people.

There was absolutely no reason that this film was made, except to try and grab a few dollars from the fans of the wonderful original \"Grease,\" who stayed away from this sequel in droves. \"Grease 2\" is not just bad; it seems to bask in its own badness. The \"plot\" is what sinks this film. \"Grease 2\" begins with a new year at Rydell High, and I must say that Eve Arden and Dody Goodman (\"Miss Mcgee\" and \"Blanche\") are hilarious. The extremely dull Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield) shows up at Rydell as a foreign exchange student, greeted by Frenchy (Didi Conn), who is back at Rydell to get her chemistry credit. Michael then tells Frenchy that his cousin \"Sandy\" (Olivia Newton-John, from the original) told him that Frenchy was the one who \"knew the ropes around here.\" Frenchy replies, \"Oh, ropes are my specialty.\" (????) Michael gets the hots for Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer, who has come a long way) but she informs him that she'll only date a \"cool rider,\" which means a guy with a motorycle. Michelle Pfeiffer actually sings a solo, \"Cool Rider\", which sounds like a cross between Belinda Carlisle and Pat Benetar, even though this is supposedly set in the 60's. What happens next in the story is ludicrous, ridiculous, implausible, and EXTREMELY contrived. Michael drives up on a motorcycle, wearing all black leather and GOGGLES on his eyes, kisses Stephanie, drives away, and then Stephanie whines the rest of the movie about her mystery love. Pfeiffer exclaims, \"Just when I found you, I lost you!\" I must say that I enjoy this film for its cult status and its absolute awfulness. The closing number, \"We'll Be Together,\" becomes jaw-droppingly hilarious in its final choreographed moment...a wacky girl and a guy spinning around, wrapped up in bright strands of Christmas tree lights.

I am not taking anything away from that. But G2, to me, has more meaning.  I was graduating 8th grade when this movie came out (Oh God, I just dated myself).  I saw this movie 3 times in the movie theaters upon release.  2ndly, I think the movie is compared TOO much to the first one.  If it was named anything else and didn't have a \"2\" tacked on to the name, it might not be reviewed so harshly.  If it was called BACK TO RYDELL or something along those lines, who knows how it would have been viewed.  Yes, I will admit it that G2 DOES have it's flaws and faults.  I LUV Michelle Pfeiffer ever since this movie, but at times she DOES look like she wants to be somewhere else.  LOL!!  And personally, they could have given Michael and Stephanie a little more time together to get to know each other.  It might have made the ending a little more believable. Some of the acting is not great, but alot of the acting in the first one wasn't great either.All in all, this movie ROCKS!!  I know alot of people who LOVE this movie. It didn't make as much at the box office compared to G1, but I think it might have hit the 20 million mark after all was said and done. Obviously, not EVERYONE hates this movie.Another criticism about this movie was that it didn't have any of the original cast in it (with the exception of a handful).  It's funny, because Grease 3 is in the works, with ALOT of the original cast members (including ONJ and JT).  If this movie tanks, I wonder what critics are going to say then?Like I said...GREASE 2 is a great musical and should NOT be compared to the first one.  The music is upbeat and funny at times and it is a feel good movie.  My only complaint (from Paramount) is that the DVD should have had some of those deleted scenes and maybe an audio commentary by some of the cast members and perhaps a trailer.",

            "content": "The original Grease really is a classic, this is not. Here's my list of things that took the movie down some notches from the original:The unnecessary high levels of crudeness compared to the original, especially with that innaproprietly dirty song in the classroom \"Reproduction\". The original Grease may have dealt with a character who spent part of the movie thinking she may be pregnant and a car scene showing the implication of her having sex with her boyfriend and him suddenly exclaiming that his condom ripped. In Grease 2 though, we get a song where everyone is so happily and loudly singing such dirty lyrics which make up most of the song. There's also the suggestive songs \"We're gonna score tonight\" and \"Let's do it for our country\". Way more sexual implementations than the first film, and the Grease movies have supposed to have been semi family films with many fans of the first being youths.Next, the ham acting, like it seems like they're copying the first movie's attitudes and then exaggerating them in an overly goofy way. The way the T birds act in this film is a good example. Also, the way they treat new English student Michael, harrasing him even before finding out he fancies one of the T bird's crushes Stephanie (Michelle Phiefer). Then the overly stereo typical way the movie portrayed nerds. Just like in the \"Revenge of the nerds\" films, they make them talk in that shrill voice wearing those goofy glasses and pocket protectors. Hear the nerd's jokingly shrill voice near the beginning when asking Michael \"how long have you been in America?\", or where they trip him outside the bus during the opening number, or during \"Reproduction\" one nerdy guy says in a ridiculous sounding voice \"ohh, I think I'm gonna throw up\".The songs in this film break out without reason too much, where in the first film, there's a reason for each song. And there were more better songs in the first.Here are the few things in the movie I liked which kept me from giving the film a rating lower than 5:There were a few good songs. I kinda liked the girls with Stephanie singing \"A girl for all seasons\", a nice catchy tune, the T birds' song \"Prowling\", and the song \"Who's that guy?\" while Michael is kickin it up on the motorcycle. The rest of the songs were either sub par or inappropriate.Even though some reviewers don't agree, I kinda liked Phiefer as Stephanie. She was cute, and I always found Phiefer beautiful, even like 12 years later as teacher in \"Dangerous minds\". I know she had those clothes, those shades, and that bubble gum popping, but that was sorta early 1980s style. Michael was an alright character too, he played his role straight, and was only wanting people to like him. And he wanted to start riding motorcycles, nothing wrong with that.This movie had some good, and definitely had some bad.",

Don't get me wrong, I loved the original Grease, but Grease 2 is not as bad as people make it out to be.The songs may not be as catchy as songs from the first film, but ones like \"Score Tonight\" and \"Reproduction\" were certainly fun. The vehicles, motorcycles in this film, do not play as much of an important part to the film as the cars did in the original either, which is neither good nor bad in my opinion.The cast are a mixed-bag too. Hottie Maxwell Caulfield is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but while I normally like Michelle Pfeiffer, she seemed terribly distracted in this film, like she wanted to be somewhere else. Adrian Zmed was good as the leader of the T-Birds, but the others, particularly the guy that played Goose, were annoying, as was Lorna Luft who played Paulette. Alison Price and Pamela Segall were great to watch, though they didn't get a lot of screen time. Didi Conn was rather wasted as Frenchy however, and Eve Arden and Dody Goodman both graciously returned as the school principal and her assistant, and both gave terrific performances.So when watching Grease 2, try not to think of the original Grease, and maybe you will like it a little bit more.",

Not-just-a-pretty-face Caulfield actually put in a decent performance, Pfeiffer's Zinone was remarkably accurate for such a novice actress and Luft could certainly bust a note or two. 'Score Tonight' is undeniably catchy, 'Reproduction' could carry the whole film itself, and the lovely Frechette's 'Do It For Our Country' was inspired. Since time has gone by the film has become somewhat of a classic. Since probably everyone you know probably knows at least one of the tunes, they can't really have been so terrible, can they? Basically, all I'm trying to say is, don't look too deep, don't compare, just laugh, sing along and I dare you to not be crooning 'Cool Rider' in the shower tomorrow.

            "content": "Set in 1961 Grease 2 picks up four years after where the first movie left off. It sees newcomer Michael Carrington, who just recently arrived at Rydell as an exchange student from England falling for the beautiful Stephanie Zinone. However she shows no interest in him romantically as being the leader of the Pink Ladies, rules dictate that she and her friends can only date gang members of the T-Birds. Undeterred Michael formulates a plan to win her affection much to the ire of T-Bird leader Johnny Nogrelli.Given the phenomenal commercial success and its cult status it would have seemed inevitable that a sequel would be on the cards. Allan Carr, who was co-producer had made a deal with Paramount Pictures to be paid $5 million to produce a sequel within three years of its predecessors' theatrical release, and he delivered on that promise. Bringing in professional dance choreographer Patricia Birch, who had worked on the original's choreography to direct, she undoubtedly had a lot to live up to given its reputation. An almost entirely new team of actors was cast, and the overall result although not completely utterly awful, still to this day leaves something to be desired.To it's credit the majority of the songs are very catchy and dare I go so far as say, memorable with some energetic, well-choreographed dance routines. It's certainly not boring and you get the distinct feeling that there is at least some attempt to do right by the fans by doing justice to what came before. However, the major flaw is with its uneven script which relies a bit too much on toilet humour, some of which at the time wouldn't have been enough to justify its PG certificate. That said there are some genuinely funny and inspired moments where I found myself laughing a bit more than I should have been. There are attempts as well to be larger than life, too larger than life in fact as are most of its characters. The only members of the cast who seem at all restrained are its two leads although Maxwell Caulfield with his smoldering good looks which would no doubt have sent female cinemagoers' pulses racing is a poor substitute for John Travolta. He just lacks Travolta's charisma, and there's definitely something lacking in terms of chemistry between him and co-star Michelle Pfieffer, who incidentally comes off significantly better. Actually, hers is one of the best performances of the movie with her portrayal of the gutsy Stephanie. Her high-octane performance of the super-fueled Cool Rider puts the Power in Girl Power long before the term had been invented, and you can see the early signs that she had what it took to be a star.Besides the lack of spark between them the plot involving Michael adopting a mysterious, masked biker alter ego in an attempt to woo the girl that he adores undermines the validity of any feelings that Stephanie has for him. Her \"love\" for him comes across as mere infatuation which is purely superficial. This is the girl who after all sang that she wants a Cool Rider with a motorcycle, \"No ordinary boy is gonna do. I want a rider that's cool\". It doesn't make her look good and she comes off as an immature young woman with a shallow schoolgirl crush. The flipping of each side of the high school cliques that two lead protagonists come from, an obvious attempt to put a new spin on what made the first movie successful does little to alter the fact that this is still a retread over the same story, with an unconvincing main plot development thrown in.The overall quality of the acting from the new kids is decidedly patchy, with Adrian Zmed amusingly cocky without becoming overly obnoxious. Any reservations about them there may be, he manages to be likable although indications may point to the contrary early on. Lorna Luft as the blonde bimbo Paulette pouts and overdoes the breathy voice in an attempt to channel Marilyn Monroe, but it merely grates although she does come into her own more in a later scene when she dials it down. And while it is great to see the returning cast members make an appearance, with the glorious Eve Arden reprising her role as, school principal, Miss McGee, it's pretty unforgivable to see Didi Conn as Frenchy largely wasted with little screen time she is given and with a contrived explanation as to her presence.In the end Grease 2 is something of an admirable failure that misses more than it hits but when it does hit it does with considerable impact. The kitsch cheesiness of it however has meant that it has gained something of a minor cult status, perhaps by those who find it so bad to be good (although it's not even bad enough by my personal estimations to gain such dubious an honour) or those with lower expectations than others. It has made its mark and whether you choose to embrace it or not, if you go for the former then I suppose it doesn't matter why it is if you can find something to enjoy.",

            "review_title": "Second-rate rehash",
            "content": "\"Grease 2\" isn't a sequel to \"Grease\", but rather a less-than-stellar rehash set two years later with different characters.Michael Carrington (played by Maxwell Caulfield, who has struggled in his big screen career since this bullet) is new to Rydell, transferring from England (one of the only ways this movie is related to the first film is that he's Sandy's cousin). Within the first week of school, he's fallen for the head of the Pink Ladies, Stephanie Zinone (played by then newbie, Michelle Pfeiffer. Wow, I guess when they say you have to start from the bottom and work your way up, they really meant it, eh Michelle?) But Stephanie isn't looking for a nerd like Michael, she's looking for a cool rider! One that rides motorcycles in skin tight leather! So basically, the movie is a simple gender-switch of the first movie, following Michael's quest to change his image and win over Stephanie.One thing that is disappointing is that this movie had so much potential, but never lived up to it. They could have given us a bit of history about the T-Birds and Pink Ladies. But do we get it? No. They could have given us some exciting new types of music that could have made this installment just as good as the last. Did we get it? No. There are plot holes throughout, and lacks a lot of originality. Did we need another mushy love story? No, we already saw that in the first movie. The original stars didn't come back, so I think the last thing they should have done was repeat the story! They could have shown us how one becomes a member of the T-Birds or The Pink Ladies, other than looking hot. But did they tell us? No. Their was just suddenly a new batch of Pink Ladies and T-Birds, and I suppose there's a new batch every year, but leave it to \"Grease 2\" to never explain it to us.How are the new T-Birds and Pink Ladies selected? We'll never know now. This movie had so much potential, could have had new clothes, new music, new everything, but no. We basically get a gender switch of the original \"Grease\", with the same music, same clothes, just different people, proving the producers and director were lazy and just looking for money, like they threw this whole movie together in 6 months.The acting is nothing great. The only people who shine in this movie are Adrian Zmed as the corky Johnny Nogorelli, Michelle Pfeiffer (who would obviously go on to do bigger and better things), and the famous Lorna Luft (Judy Garland's daughter), who plays Johnny's desperate stalker. However, leading man Maxwell Caulfield looks like he's trying to hard and comes off as annoying, unlike Olivia Newton-John was in the original version. Even Adrian Zmed looks like he's trying to copy John Travolta, but fails. As for the other T-Birds and Pink Ladies, they weren't memorable at all.The characters themselves aren't that great. They aren't very likable, and act like they just got out of juvee. The script is definitely lacking, and much of the dialogue is pretty bad and annoying.The songs? Well, some of them are somewhat catchy, but for the most part, fail at keeping your attention. The singing is also extremely;y second rate as well. Maxwell Caulfield sounds like he's struggling to hold a tune (wow how the hell did this kid get cast in this movie?!?) and the more professional singers such as Lorna Luft maybe get one solo throughout the movie, which brings me to another huge mistake in the movie. Who the hell decided to cast a bunch of unknowns in a big movie musical?!? And in a sequel to the highest grossing movies musical of all time?!? Bad move, very bad move.The film opens with \"Back To School Again\", which is the best song on the soundtrack, mainly because none of the kids from the cast sing it. 15 minutes later, the gang bursts into a song about bowling called \"Score Tonight\", which I guess was meant to be a big dance number/group ensemble, like \"Summer Nights\" was in the original. The song is catchy, except how does bowling relate to the movie's plot? It was a pointless song, and it was obviously just thrown into the movie for the sake of it. Were the filmmakers that lazy? Then Michelle Pfeiffer bursts into a song called \"Cool Rider\". It's a good song, actually, except the dance she does is pretty goofy and distracting in a bad way. Also, the song doesn't sound very 60s, it screams 1982. Time warp, anyone? Then there's a song about \"Reproduction\". See what I said about \"Score Tonight\". Same thing applies here. And then there's a string of unmemorable songs in the movie as well.The movie lacks the magic the original movie had. It has no energy, and in the original the songs just exploded into your face, but in \"Grease 2\", it doesn't lift off the screen. The characters aren't likable for the most part and it doesn't have any energy, motivation, and most of all, it doesn't have any effort. This movie claims to take place in 1961 when most of it screams 1982. Everyone who made this movie seemed to just be looking for money and not even caring about the movie itself. Hence, the laziness. I'm glad this movie flopped at the box office, because it proves you can't make it in Hollywood if you're lazy. So why did I give it a 4 out of 10? Because, even amidst all of it's terribleness, there are a few (and when I mean \"few\", I mean \"few\") good songs, a few exceptional performances (Adrian, Lorna, and Michelle), and there's a little bit of chemistry between the two leads, Michelle and Michael, most noticeable in the diner scene. Skip this turkey, only for the die-hard \"Grease\" fans.",

But in Grease 2, Lorna Luft seemed young enough to play a character like that. Sure John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John were good looking people, but they weren't as hot as Maxwell Caulfield (SO CUTE) and Michelle Pfeiffer. Plus, I even thought some of the songs from this movie were better than the ones in the first. \"Hopelessly Devoted To You,\" \"Beauty School Dropout,\" and \"Sandy\" were incredibly cheesy songs. But in the sequel, I can't think one song that was cheesy. But, I will say the intro and closing song in the first were a lot better than ones in the sequel.

It is sporadically entertaining, and it does have a few things going for it. The early screen appearance of Michelle Pfeiffer is interesting to watch, and I enjoyed her performance. Almost all of the actors are quite likable, actually, giving energetic and engaging performances. And the film boasts the welcome return of Dody Goodman, Eve Arden and Sid Caesar from the original \"Grease.\"So what is the problem? First of all, the storyline is rather far-fetched. \"Nerdy\" English student (Sandy's cousin...yeah, right) falls for Pink Lady who wants nothing to do with him, so he learns to ride a motorcycle amazingly quickly and becomes this mysterious \"cool rider\" while the other characters don't even recognize him. I guess it's a Clark Kent/Superman kind of thing. Secondly, the songs are nothing to write home about...actually, the songs from the ORIGINAL film weren't that terrific either, but at least they became hits. Most of the cast members aren't particularly strong singers, but their dedication and energy almost makes up for it. The direction is sluggish, and the editing is poor. But the biggest failure here is the blandly-handsome Maxwell Caulfield in the lead role of straight-A/cool rider Michael Carrington. His performance is dull, his diction is poor, his screen presence is non-existent and his singing is pathetic. And he hasn't done anything noteworthy since.But honestly, the film isn't all bad. Stupid and forgettable, but not necessarily painful. But it is far from a must-see. Watch only if you are too tired to get up and change the channel and the remote isn't working.",

Other actors who have risen above this are Chistopher MacDonald (who played the T-Bird Goose), who starred in \"SLC PUNK,\" \"Thelma and Louise,\" and many other movies, and Pamela Segall, who played Dolores Rebchuck (Paulette's little sister who's always trying to hang out with the Pink Ladies) has done a lot of voiceover work (though she does occasionally make an acting appearance, such as in HBO's \"Breast Men\") and most of you probably know her as the voice of Bobby Hill in \"King of the Hill\". As for the songs being hideous, well, you have Louis St. Louis to thank for that, the man who did the original music for \"Grease\" (or at least a good part of it).  Notice the similarities between the melodies of \"Girl for All Seasons\" and \"Beauty School Dropout\" from the original \"Grease.\" Musical lightning doesn't always strike twice, just ask Richard O'Brien, who did the music for \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and then also did the music for the awful sequel \"Shock Treatment.\" However, I have to admit that \"Grease 2\" has one of the funniest lines I've ever heard onscreen: \"I'm going to die and I'm wearing my mother's underwear!\" See this if you're in the mood for a bad movie, or if you just have to see it to believe it.

Reproduction was quite funny, Score Tonight was great, and very catchy, as was Cool Rider. Still, since Cool rider was Michelle Pfeiffers only solo song, it ranks up there anyway. Love her dance number to it as well.Anyway, I think for a sequel, this movie ruled. I think, however,...grease 1 should have been the sequel. I hope you agree.a cool rider, a cooooooool rider if he's cool enough, he can burn me through and through whoooa if it takes forever, then I'll wait forever. No ordinary boy, no ordinary boy is gonna do, I want a rider that's cool...............",

In this version, the people look better.The thing that is bad about this movie is that the acting was terrible. Especially to part where Stephanie is on stage and tunes out into a type of heaven with 'biker-guy' aka Michael. All the songs were absolutely cheesy. The worst were 'Who's Thay Guy?', 'Reproduction', 'Let's do it For Our Country' and even 'Cool Rider'. But Michelle Pfieffer saved 'Cool Rider'.I think this movie shows how desperate guys can be to get the girl of their dreams. I was amazed to see how low Michael would go for Stephanie.Pat Birch should stick to Dance Choreography and only choreography. No directing. Just choreography. She should have let the original director do this movie even if she had to force them. What was she thinking putting Frenchie back and almost putting Kenickie in the movie? Frenchie in Grease 2 was a pathetic attempt to save the movie. I don't know about everyone else, but it's a very good thing that they didn't do 2 more movies and a TV show. What would the TV show have? Singing in every episode? This movie is just as bad as From Justin to Kelly, but what saved the movie was Michelle Pfiffer's 'Cool Rider' song and dancing, and that most people think Michael is 'Hot'.If I was bored out of my mind, I'd consider going back to watch this movie. But for now, I am sticking with Napoleon Dynamite and Elf. Movies that actually did *WELL*.",

The big problem with this movie, is that none of the music had the feel of the sixties to it. It had some good, but generic music. Although I admit to loving two of the movies songs, \"Cool Rider\" was my absolute favorite. So many girls I know have expressed how they saw themselves as Stephanie Zinone, climbing that ladder, lamenting for her Cool Rider fantasy lover. The second is the \"Girl For All Seasons\" number, I just wished they had finished it, before launching into the laughable \"Biker Heaven\" sequence.Michelle Pfeiffer may be embarrassed by this movie. But this fan isn't embarrassed to say how much she loves it and how much pleasure it brought to me as a child. Go Grease 2! You rock!",

Maybe it was because of my semi-dislike for the original, but I just thought this one shined in comparison.  The songs were much more fun, Stephanie wasn't lame, like Sandy, she was cool.  Sandy was a wimp.  I also liked the message of 'cool girl can still go out with semi-geeky guy and still be cool.'  Much more positive than the message of 'girl changing herself to be liked again by guy.'  If you love Grease, you won't like Grease 2 simply because it's not Grease.  And if you're older than 16, you'll probably think it's stupid.  But, as a 12 year old, I loved this kitschy and fun movie and still think it's pretty great today.

            "content": "Grease was a great musical for three reasons. One, the cast could sing. Two, the songs were memorable. Three, the choreography was great (Born to Hand Jive, anyone?). Unfortunately, when making Grease 2 no-one seemed to think that these elements were particularly important.I never normally feel compelled to write comments on here about the films I have seen. However, just having sat through the monstrosity that is Grease 2 I simply had to act. From start to pathetic end, this musical is terrible. It's meant to be set in 1961, but a lot of the songs (\"Cool Rider\" especially) seem to have been influenced by 1970s guitar rock like Meatloaf, so they seem completely out of place. The singing is appalling - why did no-one think to cast actors who could sing? Or just dub them with singers who could?! The music is even badly edited - take for instance \"Charade\", where you can't make out a single lyric thanks to terrible diction combined with a vocal laid far too quiet on the mix. Most of the songs are multi-tracked for some strange reason too - so those weak voices come at you 4-strong at a time, making the overall sound very 80s. Some songs seem horribly out of place...why sing a really chirpy song when Michael (aka the Cool Rider) is presumed dead, then finish with a slow ballad for the finale when it's discovered he's alive and his identity is revealed?! Rama- dama-ding-a-long it ain't.As for the choreography - look at the song set in the bowling alley if you don't get what I'm talking about. It's supposed to be a big set number, so why is the dancing so unimaginative? Most of it just involves twirling around (a lot!) and throwing the suddenly miraculously light bowling balls!As for the cast, they all look incredibly old - the leader of the rival gang (also in the first film - forgive me not knowing the character's name but he's the one who dates Cha Cha) could easily pass for 45. Pfeiffer, here in an early role, is grumpy and petulant for most of the film, leaving you to wonder why Michael goes to all the bother of wooing her in the first place. Her singing is dreadful, her face inexpressive, and she gets the frumpiest outfits of all the Pink Ladies.Finally, numerous plot points are unexplained: Why are the T-birds, so cool in the first film, now bothered about a stupid talent contest? Why do they all now ride bikes instead of cool cars? What happens to Frenchie - she just disappears halfway through the film?! Why is Sandy's cousin Michael English, when she is Australian? What happened to the end of year funfair in the first Grease film...we now get a cheap Lu-ow (sic) instead...run out of budget did we?I suppose if you want to have a quick look, it has a certain\"It's so bad it's good\" quality, which is why I suppose some people have voted this film a ten, but in reality it's painful to sit through it all. Fans of Grease would be better off imagining and writing a Grease 2 of their own - frankly a trained monkey couldn't do worse.",

I love it when guys kiss like that.OK, IMDb forces me to write 10 lines, so this is going to get really cheesy because it's all going to be about Maxwell Caulfield. First of all, he did a great job, quietly emoting throughout the whole movie. I mean, he had a shallow script to work with, but he made it heartfelt. Without wincing or puckering or sighing or vogueing, his deadpan face screamed heartache. Ouch! And Michelle Pfeiffer was good, too, for a start up.Yeah, back to Caulfield...so where the heck did he end up? He did TV shows for years.

None of the performers have any chemistry with one another, and only Michelle Pfeiffer can hold the audiences attention.

Really this film isn't all that much worse than the original, it just isn't quite as engaging and happy.

Geez folks lighten up! This takes me back to the \"Welcome Back Cotter\" days. Perhaps I made the mistake of seeing this one first in theaters as a small boy, before I saw the original?... I don't know... Anyhow, the soundtrack's far superior to the original, w/ \"Coooolll Rider\" and the \"Mistress for all Seasons\" tune. IMHO motorbikes are far cooler than cars. High testosterone powered bikers are far cooler than a bunch of pansy mamma's boys as the first film focused on.

The overtly sexual girl (Played by Lorna Luft, the OTHER daughter of Movie icon Judy Garland) is viewed kindly and it shows the period well. The songs are kind of stupid but so are most of the songs in all musicals. You are watching a movie and all of a sudden everybody breaks into song and dance, Okay.

The musicis more or less on par with the script though I don't think there wasany equivalent program for songwriters - perhaps it was acoincidence that they ended up with 'special'  composers ormaybe the writer brought someone in from his day camp.\nThe acting is among Michelle Pfiefer's most compelling work (theCool Rider sequence alone will send tingles down your spine) butthere is simply  no way anyone on this cast can keep up with thealways stellar Christopher McDonald.

This movie not only gave us Michelle Pfeiffer in her first ever starring role, but it also gave us Maxwell Caulfield and some great music. I consider Michelle's \"Cool Rider\" to be one of the greatest pop/rock songs ever written! It may not be a great composition, but its the coolest, slickest piece of movie music since \"Greased Lightnin'\" and \"You're The One That I Want\". This movie marked an end to an era of movie musicals and not since has there been any musicals of its calibur. I don't know where it all went wrong, but Hollywood stopped making musicals. This film is truly underrated. So many people can't see the fun and wonderfulness of this movie and it's a shame. People are so hung up on the sillyness of it, but get a clue, that is what movie musicals are all about. Look at every Elvis movie and look at Grease for goodness sake.

This movie came on Tv awhile back, so for some strange reason I decided to watch it. I'll admit it; I liked the characters in this one better than the original. Thats about all I liked about this movie, besides the fact that at some times in it I would start laughing for no apparent reason. Grease is supposed to be a musical, right? This one is a musical, but all the musical scores are horrible. I guarantee you will start laughing when you see a bunch of high school kids in a classroom singing about reproduction. Thats how bad it is. Overall, just avoid Grease 2. I watched it for lack of nothing better to do, but if you could be doing something more important or more worthwhile, I highly recommend doing that instead.",

We all know the story by now and Michelle realizes that if he wants to become a T - Bird he has to own a motorcycle. So how does he get the money ? They pay him to do their homework. Get real. They probably spent most of their money on cigarettes than on malt shakes. As for the music there wasn't much. Back to School was ok , since it was the end of summer and it was the first day of school. That one made sense. But I still can't get over that reproduction song and why they put it in. That was terrible ,  especially when he had to say ' our country , the red white and blue. ' I feel sorry for the person that wrote that. Now the acting. I'll give them credit for the time and practice. But nothing fit. How could Michelle jump over a car in the parking lot without a ramp ? And the book he was reading before he entered the bowling alley. I believe that was a slang book or something ? As for the Pink Ladies , they were actually someone's 'property' ?

Michelle Pfeiffer would have to sneak up behind you in a darkened room, while you were just dropping off to sleep and scream BAD at the top of her castrated-chicken singing voice right in your ear for the word to convey any sort of sense of how campily dire this movie is....  First of all, this was directed (nominally) by one Patricia Birch. Why did nobody tell Ms. Birch that you can do this thing with the camera that's called \"panning\"? To her, this word seems to be nothing more than a description of what the critics did to her movie, and she seems completely unaware that it's also a form of camera movement. Hence she moves around scenes with cuts. All. The. Time. Which. Makes. Things. Kind. Of. Choppy. The result is that the movie looks like it was shot with a $12 polaroid instamatic camera and the pictures were then taped together. And Pat, sweetie, I LOVE that close-up shot of the back of Michelle Pfeiffer's head... Secondly; come on guys, you can tell us now. Was there actually a script? Or did you make it all up on the spot?Thirdly; Maxwell Caulfield. Sooooooo pretty. Sooooooo much prettier than Michelle Pfeiffer. Soooooooo unable to carry the movie. Or sing. Or, apparently, act. To be fair to Max, he does put in a decent performance in \"The Boys Next Door\", and the storyline here doesn't exactly help (It seems like he gets about 5 scenes in the whole movie, Michelle gets 7 and Adrian Zmed gets the rest to himself) OK, so the guy's singing is fairly horrible, but he's supposed to be the hero. And given that there was supposedly a massive search for the leads, shouldn't they have thought about that earlier? Pfeiffer is screechy enough to scare off Celine Dion. Zmed can sing a bit. (He does in \"Bachelor Party\" too). BTW, in real life, Max is married to Tabitha Lennox off \"Passions\". And Adrian Zmed has also been on \"Passions\". And Matt Lattanzi, who plays Brad here, was married to Olivia Newton John in real life. But I digress.  Fourthly, fifthly and sixthly: Oh God, the music is so awful! And yet I can't get \"Score Tonight\" out of my head. Continuity: If Michael's dead, who's playing the talent show music? And check out the 1980s cars driving past in the background when Max and Michelle are in the diner. T-Birds: Hello, these guys are a bunch of wussies. They should turn their bikes over to the girls and start using the pink Studebaker...\nSeventhly: When climbing all over the dead motorbikes and singing about turning back time, wearing spangled jumpsuits, running in slow motion through dry-ice and cheap fades, didn't Max and Michelle get even the TINIEST inkling that this was not going to be a very good film at all?And in spite of all this, I watched the whole thing to the end of the credits. And past the Paramount logo. And I just spent five whole minutes writing this review (longer than was spent writing the script). It's that kind of film. Bad.",

But I remember when my family first got HBO, I musta been 8 or so (seeing as it came out in '82 that seems about right) and I fell in love!!! I was a kid that actually \"played\" this movie. I based my whole coolness on that of the pink ladies. I wore satin jackets and even got one from my parents with my name on it. (Although it was purple) I didn't f-in care. I am sure if I had seen the \"OG\" first I would feel differently, but I didn't, so I love Grease 2 more.... And I know a lot of people my age that feel the same way. I know every word by heart as well as every song by heart!! The songs, Johnny Nogerelli, Goose, Louis Damuchi, Rhonda, Sharon, Paulette Rebchuck, The talent show, the Luau, the motorcycles, the leather, Michael Carrington and of course Stephanie Zanoni.

I was too young to remember the original Grease - yes, my older sister played the record constantly, but I saw the sequel as a 9-year old and bought the cassette that I played nonstop that summer of '82.You don't have to afraid to admit that you enjoy the sequel. I agree w/ other reviewers here that it's its own separate movie. They CAN stand alone.Yes, there are some carry-over cast from the original, but really just some dancers and faculty (well, I guess Eugene and Craterface return).Overall, yes, this story doesn't hold up well almost 40 years later, but how much have you and I changed during those years. I'm sure if you show this movie to the younger generation now and don't tell them that it's a \"sequel\" to the original, then they'll appreciate it for what it really is - good, (sort of) clean fun!",

I mean, come on, Stephanie can't tell Michael from his geek personality and his greaser personality. How can she not know it's the same man?!? Almost all the actors in Grease 2 never made it beyond that movie. However, a year later, Michelle Pfeiffer would make up for Grease 2 by playing in Scarface with Al Pacino.

Sure, it has its weak spots, including some real cheesy scenes, and maxwell caulfield is no John Travolta (He hardly dances in the picture), he is supposed to look like a \"Cool Rider\" but looks instead like a Villain from the old \"Batman\" show with his \"Cool Rider outfit\". still, do not take this movie too seriously, Grease 2 sure don't deserve all the bad rep it got, and it sure deserves a much higher rating on IMDB. It's a fun little musical, with some great performances, inspired choreography and some really really great songs (And some not so great, but these are in the minority). Michell Pfeiffer is great in this picture and shouldn't be ashamed of it at all. To fully enjoy this, just try to forget that it's a sequel to the most succesful musical of all time (a heavy burden on any film), just call is \"Brilliantine\" or something instead of \"Grease 2\", because as a stand alone musical comedy, this flick delivers the goods.",

I have watched it more than 10 times in my life and each time i'm having great fun watching it.I am very picky when it comes to movies. Most movies that i enjoy usually end up with an Oscar for best movie picture or something.Grease 2 is one of the few rare movies that i enjoy watching but didn't get any award.The way i see this is that Grease 2 is meant for a different type of audience.Back when i was in college, we (guys) had to impress girls in order to get them. We had to be cool, we had to be unreal (almost fake), we were creating an image to impress the girls. Of course, i don't do that anymore, (not as much. I'm married, got kids, and still got my motorcycle etc. But one thing that has changed since my college days is that i am more connected to reality now than i was in college.Grease 2 is about a nerds (maxwell) that wants THE Chix (pfeiffer ) but to do that he can't stay natural, he can't be himself so he has to impersonate an image. You see, this is exactly the daily reality for many teenagers. Observe how our teenagers behave today. No different than in Grease 2 (minus the music).I must admit, i was also a Geek guy trying to be cool, dreaming about some (impossible to get girl), when i was in college...and there was. Girls that (20 years later) i wish i had got even if my current wife is a very cute and sexy slim woman...Watching Grease 2 reminds me how i was in college. (like maxwell actually). To be more exact, i wished i was like maxwell. Because in Grease 2 he made it, he succeed getting pfeiffer. But in really it is much more complicated almost impossible for a Geek guy to get the most beautiful girl because the most beautiful girl usually can pick any guy she want.Being an educator in a high school, i can tell you that sex is probably to most spoken subject in our teenagers conversation and concern.To summarize: Grease 2 (from a guy point of view) is a movie for anyone who felt at one point in their college year in love with an (impossible to get girl). A guy who likes to dream and do crazy things just to impress someone, a good guy in nature.Grease 2 is a masterpiece (atleast) for some audience...I give it a 10/10 to re-balance that thrash reviews this movie has got but the real score should be around 8/10 objectively.",

Stephanie's struggle is outlined beautifully, as she fights to escape the clutches of the menacing Johnny, to find freedom in the wind on the back of Michael's motorcycle.  Her drop in class and status is simultaneous with her spiritual awakening found in Michael.To properly examine the acting acting, the cinematography, the set design, the directing, could take a lifetime.

The biggest problem, as I see it, is that neither of the two leads is much involved in any good numbers. I don't see a shred of chemistry between the leads, either. Maybe if someone else was in the role of Stefanie it might have improved things, but Michele Pfeiffer just isn't believable as a tough Italian girl (or a singer or dancer).I think Lorna Luft, although a bit old to play a high school student, did a very good job, although I wish there had been a number that showed off her voice. Another standout, in my opinion, was Leif Green, as Davey. I don't know why they would have him in a side car, rather than his own motorcycle. That was silly, but I think he did a great job with the role. If only the film had been stronger, it might have led to more of a career, for him. It was apparently expected to establish a career for Maxwell Caulfield, as well as Michele Pfeiffer. Although he was definitely very cute, I didn't really see much in the way of solid talent, there. While Michele Pfeiffer, although miscast in this film, in my opinion, did demonstrate some solid acting talent and later got the roles to prove it.",

It's not that the movie was bad it is just that it is not relative to the original. A better sequel would be having Sandy and Danny get married and them going to a high school reunion. But that is not what happened it had something to with Frenchies cousin from England and how hes in love with a girl who is out of his league.

But, then there are the bad points like the song when Stephanie (Pfeiffer) thinks that the Cool Rider (Caulfield) has died and the reappearance of villian from the original.

The gang members of the T-Birds are about as cool as Eugene the local nerd and most of the Pink Ladies seem to have room for rent upstairs (and downstairs, if you listen to some of the songs). Michael (Maxwell Caulfield) doesn't seem to realize the Catch-Of-The-Day Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer) is possibly less of a catch than little Dolores (Pamela Adlon) who isn't even old enough to be dating any of the T-Birds. Oh well, at least she's genuinely interested in being Michael's friend. Not enough screen time for her or for Frenchy (Didi Conn) who is seen messing with mysterious chemicals in several of her cameos. They're cameos, not an actual role: not enough screen time for an actual role.The songs are less than memorable but some of them make you laugh if only because of their obvious sexual innuendos. I'm not an expert on singing but at least the characters in Grease 2 beat out currently-popular Hannah Montana and most of the Jonas Brothers' songs.One last thing: Why can't the nerds in my school be studs?",

Seriously! This song is so much fun! Try playing it loudly and singing along sometime. It's great.I think that the Grease 2 soundtrack is quite special because it features one of the best movie songs ever (Prowlin') followed by the all-time worst (Reproduction). Both songs are kind of funny, but \"Reproduction\" is only funny because it's so bad. \"Prowlin\" is funny because it perfectly captures the ridiculous characterizations that were written for those T-Birds.

I was laughing all through the movie and singing along and that is a movie that holds up over years. Grease 2 just didn't capture the spirit of the first Grease.

Anyway, we're talking about Grease 2 now!I give Grease (9/10) but i give Greae 2 (10/10), i'd give it more if i could. Every actor deserved their part and it was nice to see Blanche and Miss McGee (the dynamic duo) again in this film, Frenchy's appearance showed it as a follow on from Grease but it shouldn't be told as a sequel (although it's the best sequel ever), they should be treated as two separate films as they have different story lines and only a few of the same characters (i think it may not have been AS good without these characters). Grease 2 is a treat and i love it, although one main reason may be because the leading lady has my name but i also love the actors, the humour, the music and just the plain simplicity of it. Maxwell Caulfield (Michael), Adrian Zmed (Johnny) are gorgeous, Peter Frechette (Louis) is soooooo cute and Christopher McDonald (Goose) and Leif Green (Davey) are just plain hilarious. All the pink ladies make great pink ladies and the ending couldn't be more perfect; everyone has someone and it's so romantic. THIS FILM SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARDED!!!I even love Leo 'Craterface' Balmudo in this one, although he is the villain he is funny. (Although i don't get why he's the leader of the Scorpions in Grease and Cycle Lords in Grease 2!?)",

Excellent actors especially Maxwell Caulfield, what a great guy. A roller coaster of fun and excitement from start to finish. The way that the 80's actors portrayed the 60's genre is incredible. The sort of film to be watched over and over again. I particularly loved the way that the comedy and romance were combined together. I would recommend this film to anyone, and because of the way it has been made, it would appeal to male or female viewers of any age, in my household I love the film to bits as does my Daughter 16 and Son 7, it is a definite 10 out of 10 for us.",

Indeed, it is they who appear to be the 'nerds' as unlike the 1st movie, the T-Birds in Grease 2 really have no credibility and are scared whenever Balmudo's gang show up.Plus, there is some very cynical re-casting of some of the old faces from Grease, such as the Mr. Spears character and Coach Calhoun, etc, but they really have no role in the movie and you feel they are only there to lend some weight and collect a pay check.However, that said, Maxwell Caulfield really is excellent in the role of Michael, making his character believable and sympathetic, although despite the fact that he is the leading actor of the movie, he has curiously few scenes and it leads one to suspect that quite a few of his scenes hit the cutting room floor.I really found his scenes with Michelle Pfeiffer endearing, particularly at the burger-joint and during his 'Charades' song. What a talent he was and should really have gone on to become a major film star. What a waste, but at least we have his sincere performance in this movie to enjoy.",

However, I do like these songs from Grease: Summer Nights, Sandy & We Go Together. Anybody that says Grease 2 movie & music was & is no good, knows nothing about music or movies.

The only noticeable flaw was the lack of period music that filled up the first films soundtrack. There are times when it doesn't have the feel of the early 60's and that could have been fixed with more backround music typical of the era. I think most people missed the way too subtle comedy touches such as the T-BIRDS smoking and chewing bubble gum at the same time. They are trying to look older and very cool, yet they are not willing to give up the bubblegum of their youth. Clever! The staging of its musical numbers is great in that it utilizes unusual settings such as a bowling alley, bomb shelter and a boys v.s. girls sex education classroom song. Maxwell Caulfield sings beautifully and and more than pulls his share of the weight of this picture, Adrian Zmed is less lucky and almost sinks the whiny but bouncy \"SCORE TONIGHT\" number.But then we come back to the very subtle comic antics of having included NUNS in the bowling alley production, singing and dancing with the rest of the gang! Inspired! Will any one forget the image of Michelle Pfeiffer straddling the ladder during \"COOL RIDER\"? Then to show her independence, turning her reversable pink ladies jacket inside out to show a shiny black jacket?Great images! The ending could have had a few more twists and turns ,but over all GREASE 2 is a lot of fun and in many mays surpasses the original in its creativity and boundless energy.",

Not academy award performances by any means, but I could watch it again.",

Michele Pfieffer is awesome in this movie. she has no much energy, and she looks damn good in a pink ladies jacket. Every song in the entire movie is so much fun, except the one that michael sings in the cafeteria and the one in biker heavan, but even those are really corny and funny. I get these songs stuck in my head all the time. Tad Hunter (the substitute teacher) has a small part, and leads the song \"reproduction\". In fact, I love these songs so much, that i want to cover them with my band. i could almost compare this movie to Cry Baby, only it doesn't have the raunch of John Waters. nonetheless, Grease 2, I find, is more entertaining that the original, and the mass choreography is much more impressive, Grease was more centered around the few key character's dancing, as Grease 2 had dozens of people involved, which is more difficult to orchestrate.

I Think that this one is way better than the first one, I mean the first one was cool, but it bored me alot, some of it was interesting, but the whole plot and story just didn't catch my attention like \"Grease 2\" did!!! I just wish they would show it on T.V more so I could watch or get it in some stores around here so I could buy it, I would watch it all day everyday and never get tired of it!!! I guess all I'm trying to say is that \"Grease 2\" is favorite movie of all time!!!P.S. Anybody who hasn't watched this movie needs to run out right now and rent, I promise you'll fall in love with it just like i did!!!",

I first saw this movie as a child and it brings back some happy memories for me, so I may be looking at it through rose colored glasses. However, I feel that this is a campy film that is just meant to be a fun musical, not a serious film. If you go into it looking for that type of movie, you will not be disappointed. The songs are catchy and enjoyable and it is interesting to see Michelle so young (and singing!). The story is basic, but watchable (musicals are normally not known for their deep story lines). Check out an older Maxwell Caufield in Empire Records as a semi washed-up star (that's his character, not a personal comment!). All in all, this movie can be a good time if you are looking for a fun, campy musical, or if you just happen to be flipping the channels at 3AM.",

Had it not been called Grease 2, it would have been rated much higher. The songs are fairly catchy, and it was Michelle Pfeiffer's first screen role and she does fairly well at it.Maxwell Caulfield makes a fair lead, although somehow lacks the \"zazz\" that Danny (Travolta) Zucco had in the first film, I know the final scenes where he is dressed in leather definitely appeals to many ladies (and men!).It's fair... good Sunday afternoon or Boxing day fodder.",

The songs are pretty catchy & if you try and detach yourself from the 'outstanding' original you might actually enjoy the film. The first time I watched Grease 2 I was about 12, I am now 23 years old, and whenever I go bowling the image that always sticks in my head is the one of Goose running down the opposite bowling ally hitting a strike. It's a silly, fun, harmless film that if all else fails, will make you cringe with laughter. Hay it's not a patch on the original but give the film a break. 'Gentleman, Start Your Engines!'",

Michelle Pfeiffer who plays Stephanie Zinone sing the song as she trying to tell Maxwell Caulfield who plays Michael Carrington what she wants in a guy.Then in 2009 I took really bad with pancreatitis (gallstones) which was 5 years yesterday when I ended up in hospital. I also ended up on a life support machine when I came around on life support I can always remember my sister bringing grease 2 in and when cool rider come on I was bobbing away to it even though I was really ill with pancreatitis (gallstones) out of all the songs in grease 2 cool rider is my favourite just as bring lots of good and bad memories I can't explain why.",

The story follows the same Grease plot, but with a little twist that's a nice change. All of the actors/actresses are magnificent, very believable. There is also that truth to the era/decade that the movie takes place. It is captured very well. If you loved the first movie, you will love the second.

I won't say that this is one of the best movies/musicals I have ever seen but it is a far cry from the worst. Some of the songs were more than cheesy but overall it got the point across...

The director, writers, and producers gave enough background information in the beginning of the movie to orient new watchers that if you hadn't seen Grease (which I love) you weren't completely lost. They included the T-Birds, Pink Ladies, the principals, and even \"Crater Face\"-you have to give them credit for putting together an excellent sequel.
