            "review_title": "An eccentric visionary brings opera to the jungle",
            "content": "Based on a historic figure, this is the story of Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski), known as \"Fitzcarraldo\", an eccentric visionary living in Amazonia. He first tried building a Trans-Andean Railroad, but went bankrupt. When we meet him, he's trying to make a living by selling ice to Amazonia natives, although we first see him on a small boat with his sometimes significant other, Molly (Claudia Cardinale). They've traveled 1200 miles down the Amazon to an opera house to hear Enrico Caruso sing, because Fitzcarraldo is an opera fanatic who especially loves Caruso. He loves opera so much that he dreams of building an opera house in the relatively remote outpost of Iquitos, Peru, where he's been living. Understandably unable to find backers for such a venture among Iquitos' wealthy rubber industry leaders, Fitzcarraldo hits upon a scheme for making a bundle of money, and which would eventually enable him to fund the opera house himself. Unfortunately, not all goes as planned.Fitzcarraldo was a notoriously difficult film to make. Documentarian Les Blank even made his own film detailing some of the difficulties and apparent ironies, The Burden of Dreams (1982). Director Werner Herzog hauled his cast and crew to Amazonia for the shoot, where they ended up trapped in the rain forest for months. At one point the filmmakers' camp was set fire by Indians who objected to the production, there was an air crash in which some of the crew died, and a couple outrageous \"stunts\" in the film--including the main plot device of the climax--actually were outrageous, dangerous tasks rather than safe effects/model shots, as we'd expect them to be. Just the idea of pulling off the main stunt caused the Brazilian engineer initially associated with the project to abandon involvement. A number of cast members also backed out, including Mick Jagger and Jason Robards, who were both signed on at different points to play Kinski's role. Knowledge of these kinds of issues makes Fitzcarraldo even more fun to watch, and makes the fact that it was completed at all, not to mention that it is such an elegant masterpiece, more remarkable.The tone of Fitzcarraldo overall closely matches Kinski's depiction of titular character. It is quirky and surreal, but very subtly yet satisfyingly so, with both an almost garish bizarreness (Kinski is quite odd looking in a way) balanced with a sublime beauty. Herzog imbues the film with a lot of gorgeous cinematography, enhanced by his unique sense of pacing. For example, he'll set the mood of a dawn/dusk scene with a lingering shot of a colorful sky, which then functions as symbolic of a night's events without directly showing them. Herzog matches this same technique in his action--he has an ability to say as much with what he doesn't show his actors doing (or saying) as with more conspicuous content.Herzog also shows himself to be a master of selecting music to enhance mood and tell a story, as he balances an atmospheric Brian Eno-ish score from Popol Vuh, native jungle music, and vintage turn or the century recordings of Caruso singing Bellini, Verdi, Puccini and such. Of course opera is an important plot device that enters the film at various critical points. Even if you don't like opera, however, Herzog and Kinski make it (and the motivation for it) attractive in context, and you may just find this film beginning to turn around your feelings for that music.It's interesting to note that even with Herzog's unusual pacing, the flow of the film always seems \"natural\". Fitzcarraldo also has an unusual plot structure, as it almost stream-of-consciously moves from opera in a formal European-seeming setting to a historical dramatic depiction of eccentrics in a native-filled Peruvian town, and then to an exciting adventure tale that is the heart of the film before it finally reaches an irony-filled, beautifully surreal d\u00e9nouement. The constant throughout all of this is Fitzcarraldo, of course, who can't help being eccentric but charming, both to the film's audience and to other characters.Fitzcarraldo is often interpreted as being somewhat critical of western encroachment on other cultures, such as Amazonia. Under this view, Herzog is usually seen as ironically \"guilty\" of the same actions that he's indicting. However, the film does not read as criticism to me. It's much more in line with what is usually considered to be a romantic tendency in Herzog. Fitzcarraldo is not at all a villain in the film, and neither are the European rubber barons. Instead, Fitzcarraldo is lovable and admirable if a bit crazy. The introduction of western culture doesn't end up being a negative. The natives in the film still retain their unique identities, and efforts are made to interact with them in their manner, not to adapt them to Eurocentrism. Cultural change may be inevitable with interaction, but the message of Fitzcarraldo is more that the interaction can produce unique, worthwhile cultures that are amalgamations of their precursors.Another interesting subtext is that of Fitzcarraldo as Orpheus. Just as Orpheus enchanted wild beasts, trees and rocks on Mount Olympus with his lyre, causing them to \"move from their places\", Fitzcarraldo uses opera to enchant the natural world in which he is ensconced, eventually \"moving mountains\".",

            "content": "His films are perfect examples of the European tradition of the 'auteur' film, in which the director is seen as the originating and creative force behind the work\u0085 But there is also a sense that Herzog's visionary monomaniacs function as the director's alter ego, embodying the heroic status of the auteur, always struggling against recalcitrant reality to fulfill his dream\u0085 This seems especially true of \"Fitzcarraldo,\" which, sets a hundred years ago, begins with an Irish colonist who had a passion for opera rowing 1,200 miles down a South American river, accompanied by the madam of a brothel, in order to hear the great Caruso perform\u0085 Inspired by this experience, Fitzcarraldo embarks on a grandiose plan to open up the Amazonian jungle to river transport, providing access to new rubber plantations and thereby making enough money to build an opera house\u0085 Herzog's favorite actor, Klaus Kinski, is as appropriately manic as Fitzcarraldo, eyes glittering madly as he pursues his vision\u0085 In the central sequence he organizes a tribe of Indians to help him pull a steamboat across a mountain in order to by-pass dangerous rapids\u0085 \"Fitcarraldo\" seems by turns admiring of its hero's megalomania and mocking of his hubris, with no illusions about the cynical exploitation of the region's riches by the rubber barons whom Fitzcarraldo tries to defeat by cleverness\u0085 Ultimately though, it is the sheer spectacle which we remember",

            "review_title": "the most operatic documentary-style epic ever made- fearlessly unique",
            "content": "The story of Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, aka Fitzcarraldo, is as much the story of his magnanimous pie in the sky ideal to push a boat over a mountain as it is Werner Herzog's own mission to film it. More than a mission- as anyone who saw Burden of Dreams can report- an obsession that might cost a few lives, a good deal of money, and bring a lot of strange first-hand looks at the lives and mind-sets of the natives, but will still bring the greatest of wonders if it gets pulled off. The boat over the mountain is part metaphor, anyway, though not one that's easily pegged into a corner. Achieving something against the odds is something that has been covered in many great films, a quest through man's indelible need to make the impossible possible, be it in a David Lean picture ala Lawrence of Arabia, or in one of Cecil B. DeMille's pictures (and, at times, I wondered if the spirit of one of those old time epic filmmakers came into his mind, if only in bits).All the while as Herzog is out to map the course of this man who just wants the purity of opera in the jungle, but through a style that is completely all his own, which means that it's not just about one man, but also about the ones around him, the methods to following such delusions of grandeur. Like Aguirre, there's a God complex working in Fitzcarraldo, only this time it's not in the total shroud of madness. There's room for irony, spouts of wild humor (sometimes from Kinski, like when he tries to play an opera record for disinterested party-goers early on in the film), and an overwhelming fascination with what's all around Fitzcarraldo, the jungle, nature, the natives that dwell there and always stick to their indeterminable ways. Watching how Herzog maneuvers through his bulky story is ceaselessly compelling, even in the moments where he just lets the camera take everything in: the waves crashing all around, the boat set against the jungle-scape with the opera singer Caruso in the background, the many faces and poses of the natives and their moments of pure calm versus their unpredictable nature (why do they put on face paint like they're about to go to war, and then nothing happens, don't ask me).And like in many of his best films, Herzog manages to get much more out of his actors/non-actors and his locations than it might have seemed on paper. Poetry gets set into motion with seemingly the greatest of ease, like a scene where a few natives on a small canoe look on, and Fitzcarraldo thinks about stopping, but they just go on as it's not even worth it, or when he and his first-mate and couple other regulars on the ship try to eat, only surrounded by the natives. Or the shocking moments when after victory seems to be achieved, all is in peril as the boat flaps about on the river and the recording still goes on and on, haunting as anything the jungle can compare to. Indeed, the jungle itself becomes another key part of Herzog's metaphor, even more so than in Aguirre, and it's perfectly exploited (or rendered, depending on point of view) for Herzog's own feelings about the jungle. It's an environment dangerous, alluring, and with the capacity to fear its awesome mass as well as beauty (or, as Herzog said in 'Burden', it's lovable against better judgment), so it's not all taken in at a distance- there isn't so much a real sense of escapism via the hand-held shots unlike in the epics of the directors previously mentioned. Fitcarraldo's own quest then is against nature's own ways- nature is objective and always the same- as the simple notion of moving the boat, and then doing it, goes against nature's true nature, if that makes sense. In this sense it's a great film of the objective, to which Herzog goes to lengths to capture, *and* the fantastical and subjective, which comes through the operatic portions, and not be bound by nature's usual ways and common sense. Thus it makes perfect sense as well to have Kinski along for the ride, even if it's not his greatest achievement with his most frequent director. It's all in the eyes, practically every step of the way, that one believes this man even through all of the follies and naive flights of fancy, and it's the closest Kinski probably ever came to playing the romantic lead of an adventure picture. Some of the usual scenes of 'damn he's nuts' come up, like his ringing of the town bell. It's another in the line of outcasts he played in Herzog's films, tormented and always in craving for something more, though this time not in a bleak manner. There is the problem that Kinski's presence would be undermined by the many \"adequate\" images Herzog loves to achieve. Luckily, he stands his ground, and even contributes to the poetry in times of just listening to the Caruso, and gazing on at his dream coming true on the mountainside.Fitzcarraldo isn't perfect by any means, as it ends up by way of the nature of Herzog's storytelling to almost tell of too much in his scenes. And the English language track I heard sometimes dilutes a few of the performances by feeling too dubbed and a little ridiculous in some instances. But these are just tiny mentions that get overlooked when looking at the success of what is done. Only a director as intelligently deranged and confident as Herzog could have dreamed up this film (based on a true character) and make it as real and alive as the greatest of epic adventures.",

But, no one can play an eccentric the way Kinski did in this film. It's not Nosferatu (1979), but the wide, staring eyes are looking at you, all the time, in the same spooky way.And, only an eccentric of the most magnificent kind would dare to take a 340-ton ship up the Amazon and carry it over a mountain down to another river! Isn't that just one of the craziest things you've ever heard of? Well, the truth is Herzog actually did do that and simply used Kinski as his surrogate to prance around the mud and clay, with the local Indians, and generally taking the praise for a job well done. There were no special effects \u0096 the production team actually pushed and pulled that hulk up a slope of hundreds of meters and then down to another river.So, who was really crazy: Herzog or Fitzcarraldo? Never mind that: just see this movie for the lush, primeval jungles of South America; for the rich tones of various opera singers, including Caruso (on a phonograph); for the stunning photography aboard the ill-fated Molly; for the antics of Kinski, as he thrashes around, pushing himself and others to the limits; for the army of local Indians, pulling the ship over the mountain; for the haunting sound-track provided by Popul Vuh, Herzog's perennial musical team of choice; and, of course, for the lovely Claudia Cardinale \u0096 past her prime but still remarkable...I love this movie and I hope you do also.

            "content": "Full of bravura and inspiring sequences the bizarre epic \"Fitzcarraldo\" won Werner Herzog the best director award at Cannes Festival in 1982. This is the film that keeps reminding us the words of Oscar Wilde, \"We are all in the gutter but some of us look at the stars\". Even fewer try to reach the stars and Werner Herzog and his longtime collaborator and frequent adversary Klaus Kinski were certainly the men who have reached them. Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (or Fitzcaralado \u0096 the local Indians' name for Fitzgerald) was a visionary, a man with a beautiful obsession who dreamed of a building an opera house in the Peruvian rain forests and bringing the great singer Enrico Caruso there. Fitzcaralado's plan involved dragging a huge steamship over a small mountain to avoid traveling upstream through rapids. This plan was duplicated by Herzog during the production and involved the real Indians actually hauling the boat over the mountain. The image of the boat floating in the clouds and the small figure of Fitzcarraldo dressed in the white suit looking with his crazy wild eyes at the boat is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking visions at the screen ever. This film is not as perfect as Herzog's and Kinski's previous project, the stunning \"Aguirre, The Wrath of God\" but it is a magnificent and fascinating tale that could only be told by its matchless team of creators.",

At first I hated his pushy, almost maniacal presence, but as we get to know him, we realize that all of us would like to live the dream. The scenes on the river with that big ugly boat, the gramophone sitting atop a pedestal, playing Caruso is superb. The great effort that all make to get the ship over a mountaintop is breathtaking.

This epic speaks volumes about a man who happens to be obsessed with the opera, which is his passion. He is a foreigner in a hostile land at the beginning of the last century where enormous fortunes were made in different parts of the world. For Fitzcarraldo, it is Peru, the land where he is now living.As he is introduced in the story, he is seen arriving at the Manaus opera house, to catch the Great Caruso sing. Since he has no ticket, and the performance is sold out, he impresses on one of the attendants, who lets him, and Molly, his companion, stay at the back of the house. Fitzcarraldo, who returns with Molly back to Iquitos, a desolate locale, figures he will bring opera, and Caruso to the city.Fitzcarraldo, who has no means to support his dream, decides to go into the rubber business. For that, he must go to a remote spot, away from where the other, and wealthier rubber barons, have established claims to the land. It will take only a resolute, and mad person to undertake such a gigantic enterprise.With the help of Molly, he buys a dilapidated boat and modernizes it. He takes along an experienced captain, a great mechanic, Cholo, and the best cook money can buy into a trip down the river to his property. The only thing is he soon realizes how if he continues along the river route, he will be in danger because of the rapids at one particular spot. His decision, to hoist the ship across a mountain to the other side, where another river is more navigable.Fitzcarraldo made a lasting impression on the local Indian population, who saw in this adventurer, somebody larger than life. His inter action with them was instrumental in doing the insurmountable task that had to be done to get to his ultimate goal.This film could only have been done by Werner Herzog, a director who was not afraid to go into an inhospitable part of South America to photograph this magnificent picture. Helped by his cinematographer, Thomas Mauch, he was able to conquer a great obstacle in order to make the film. Popol Vuh's film score mingles with some great music by Bellini, Puccini, Verdi and Strauss that does wonder in the background.No one but Klaus Kinski was born to play Fitzcarraldo, in what might be considered his best screen role. Mr. Kinski was an obsessed actor who bares his soul in getting under the skin of his characters. As Fitzcarraldo, he goes through the whole gamut of emotions to show what this man was really like. We can't take our eyes from him throughout the picture because of his intensity and his honesty in portraying this mad man with a vision for beauty.Claudia Cardinale makes a tremendous contribution to the film as Molly, the woman who loved, understood, and saw the genius of her man. Jose Lewgoy is perfect as Don Aquilino, Fitzcarraldo's rival and mentor. Miguel Angel Fuentes is also excellent as Cholo. Huerequeque Bohorquez plays the cook and Paul Hittscher appears as the captain.The last sequence of the film shows Mr. Herzog's greatness as Mr. Kinski rides with the opera company in a small ship. They sing an aria from \"I Puritani\", an opera that delights his soul as Fitzcarraldo feasts himself into Iquitos in their company.",

Plus, I found the overall experience more interesting and involving than AGUIRRE. About the only drawback is that at times I felt a bit disconnected from the main character, Fitzcarraldo. I was fascinated by his actions but ultimately didn't really care ABOUT him. While this isn't necessary for a film to be good, it did prevent me from giving the film a slightly higher rating.

That, and the intense performance by the lead, Klaus Kinski, is what keeps people watching this movie, which is utterly unique. But Fitzcarraldo is not especially lyrical, original, well-written, or well-acted. It has not worn well. I first saw it sometime in the 1980s and it was somehow mesmerizing, if imperfect. The whole exotic flavor of Peru and these foreigners acting exceedingly foreign was based on a dreamy idea that high culture (opera) can and should rise above all else. It was a triumph of the spirit of the individual. Twenty years later that is tempered by the absolute imperialism, bombast, blindness, and idiocy of it all. No longer swayed by the aura of the plot, the flaws in the way the film was made jump out.For starters, the language. To have some native Spanish speakers talking in German and others, with haphazardness, speaking Spanish or some indigenous language, is inconsistent. Not that they should speak English, no way, but either have them seem to be natives with a knowledge of German, or just use subtitles. Further worrisome are the stereotypes, the \"types\" of people cast as the cook, his lovers, the captain, the natives, and so on, many of whom do not really act so much as play out their cardboard expectations. The camera-work is interesting because it is not notable--and maybe this is intentional, because too much lyricism would distract from the facts. But the facts, you notice, are not really convincing. We have a fictional movie no matter how painstaking the famous scenes with the boat toward the end. It falters too often into clich\u00e9 and, actually, mediocrity (I see this even in the last scene, the crowd on the shore, there they are, nothing more is said).Maybe I take it to literally, and I should blur out the details. Because as a metaphor of possibility, and of the huge price you have to pay to succeed, or to fail beautifully, it still holds up. In some weird way, because it dared to be different, the movie is still remarkable. But something different than I once thought.",

In a social context, he's an outsider. But he has a bold vision. His romantic sidekick is a woman named Molly (Claudia Cardinale). As a compliment to Fitz, she speaks the film's theme: \"It's only the dreamers who move mountains\".After some preparation early in the film, Fitz and crew set sail up the Amazon on a huge boat, to stake out a claim for their business that will bring in the money to advance Fitzcarraldo's dream. The boat is equipped with all the necessities, which include, naturally, a gramophone to play the operatic music of Enrico Caruso. And the best sequences of the film are those set in the remote jungle, as the boat moves through a large tributary of the Amazon, into headhunter territory. With the gramophone blaring out opera amid the sound of Indian war drums, it's the unusual contrast between the primitive and the cultural that makes this film interesting.Filmed entirely in South America, the story is set in the early years of the twentieth century, long before the advent of television or automobiles.Color cinematography is quite good. This is a very physical story. Most scenes take place outdoors. And the remoteness of the setting conveys a sense of doom, a sense of unknown terror and foreboding.While the visuals are stunning, some aspects of the story I'm just not sure about. I never did figure out the significance of the ice. Is that a reward for Indian cooperation? If so, how can ice be preserved in a land without electricity? And without electricity, isn't the whole idea of an opera house in the wilderness a tad ludicrous? Maybe these questions are all answered and I just missed them. Even so, these issues could have been better addressed in the script.Not as deeply thematic as \"Aguirre: The Wrath Of God\" (1972), Werner Herzog's \"Fitzcarraldo\" nevertheless is an unusual film, one that is worth watching for its stunning visuals and thematic contrasts, its physicality, and the eccentric character of Fitzcarraldo, the dreamer who can move mountains.",

It's very hard to like the man as a businessman and as a character. Klaus Kinski is overplaying the craziness. Of course, Werner Herzog has him ringing the bell like Quasimodo.Herzog is almost as crazy. Moving the boat is very impressive. So is the use of real jungle locations. However not all of it is cinematic. The use of real locations does not automatically make it compelling. There is a scene where the characters are on a platform overlooking both rivers. That and the boat moving are compelling but the rest is not so compelling.",

            "content": "Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald is an Irish industrialist who lives in Iquitos in north-east Peru in the early twentieth-century and is passionate about one thing - opera. He has a crazy dream to build an opera-house in one of the most remote places in the world, and embarks on a dangerous voyage up the Pachitea River to raise the necessary funds ...Confession time here - I like Fitzcarraldo a lot, but I actually like Les Blank's Burden Of Dreams, a documentary about the making of the movie, quite a bit more. The reason for this is that whilst it is a truly original and fascinating film, the knowledge that none of it was faked - Herzog really did hire the indigenous Machiguenga tribe to pull the 320-ton steamship over a hill, with no model-shots or special effects - makes it more amazing as a physical accomplishment than a cinematic experience. This forty-five minute sequence is astonishing but then so is the whole movie, a visually arresting fable of folly for the sake of it. Kinski is terrific here; iconic in his white suit and panama hat against the greens and browns of the jungle, and it's great to see him for once playing a nice guy, ably supported by the gorgeous Cardinale, who adds glamour and humour to the piece. Where it falls down in my view is that it's a tough movie to get animated about - very languid, with a protagonist who is almost impossible to identify with and a plot which seems to derive directly from Herzog's ambition rather than any kind of storytelling style. Made by many of the same crew as the superior Aguirre, Zorn Des Gottes (cameraman Thomas Mauch, composers Popol Vuh, editor Beate Mainka-Jellinghaus) and even shot in some of the same Peruvian locations, this is Herzog's most famous and acclaimed film - he won Best Director at Cannes - though for my money not his best one. If nothing else however, it is a remarkable achievement and a truly original piece of film craft.",

Oh, there's another problem. Rapids block access to the rubber trees, so Klaus must take another river parallel to the rapids, and then at a narrow point of land, must drag a steamship over a mountain. Unbelievable, the film crew took three years in the jungle to duplicate the feat, a engineering marvel, or a stunning duplication. My hat is off to Werner Herzog.

The second is that it stars Klaus Kinski, a commanding, larger than life and quite great if notoriously volatile actor who could be seen at his best in his collaborations with Herzog.Its setting, that it features operatic music sung by great voices including one of the greatest and most influential singers to ever live in Enrico Caruso (speaking as a huge lifelong opera fan) and the unforgettable images of the boat are further interests. To me, while perhaps not as ground-breaking or influential as 'Aguirre Wrath of God' (a crowning achievement of German cinema) as far as Herzog's films go, 'Fitzcarraldo' is his masterpiece. It may be lengthy and paced at a deliberately slow pace, but neither are bad things here. There are so many memorable things to captivate and the pacing proved necessary.Of all Herzog's films, 'Fitzcarraldo' is one of his most visually beautiful. It's exquisitely photographed with Amazonian scenery to take the breath away, while there are some unforgettably striking images here like with the boat. The music is an ideal fit and works very well on its own too, standing out in particular is the grandiose and beautiful use of operatic excerpts with Caruso's singing especially enough to take one's breath away and make even the most cynical tear up.As ever, Herzog delivers on the substance as well as the style, while the script is cohesive and works well, with a surprising subtle quirkiness too, and the story is both uplifting and inspiring with an eccentric central character that one roots for.Klaus Kinski gives an as ever imperious performance that is among his best, the intensity burning on the screen while also allowing some poignant subtlety. Claudia Cardinale is similarly tremendous.In conclusion, masterful film and Herzog's masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Behind which lies the reality of dreams.\" Kinski as \"Fitz\" placates his contemplative captors and together they hew their way through the lush tropical forest. \"It's only the dreamers who ever move mountains.\" Like AGUIRRE: THE WRATH OF GOD, FITZCARRALDO is a journey deep into Conrad's heart of darkness. Fitz, his \"white whale\" in tow, is striking in his white suit with his shock of reddish-yellow hair and his wide, staring blue eyes. When he first makes contact with the natives, they are in awe of him- partially because the coming of his white ship is the stuff of local legend, but perhaps, too, because he is as white and as ethereal as his vessel. (And Kinski's turn as the title character in Herzog's brilliant remake of NOSFERATU has to be seen to be believed: I saw it in an art house when it opened and, despite my lifelong love of fright films, was creeped out by it.) \"I am the spectacle in the jungle,\" he says. Indeed, and his journey is, as stated in the film, \"a soul-stirring experience.\" No mythological god ever undertook a more monumental task. That the solution to the problem of being abandoned by the natives is arrived at by \"the finest drunkard ever to stagger over this earth\" is not a little ironic. It fits in, somehow, with the craziness of a dream being realized. When the camera literally rises to meet the Molly as she reaches the top of the mountain, it's the most glorious moment in a movie chock full of glorious moments. FITZCARRALDO is one of the greatest of the grand epics, and the movie's final denouement is an absolutely brilliant testament to the will (and willfulness) of Man. Fantastic film-making.",

Basically Brian Sweeney 'Fitzcarraldo' Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski) lives in South America and has a great passion for the opera, and he has a dream to build his own opera house in the exotic wilderness so that singers like Caruso, and Pucinni, and Wagner can be enjoyed in these parts. One night Fitcarraldo and his top brothel madam girlfriend Molly (Claudia Cardinale) arrive a little late for a local opera performance, and he manages to catch the attention of Don Aquilino (Jos\u00e9 Lewgoy), who is interested in financing this plan that the opera enthusiast has. The plan starts with Fitzcarraldo buying a boat with Molly's money, gathering together a small crew, and travelling up the Amazon River where they will head for an area of the jungle where Indiana inhabit, those who kill any white men who enter. They eventually reach the halfway point of the journey, and the tribe accept Fitcarraldo as some kind of God after hearing the music of Caruso, and they are happy to take the commands from the entrepreneur so he can realise his dream. The biggest test in the journey comes when there is a separation on the river to where the boat is heading, this is due to a set of small mountain hills, meaning that the Indians and crew members are forced to drag the one hundred and eighty pound barge over the leg. After this tiring task and the Indians have finished their slavery, the journey on the river continues, and soon runs into another dilemma where the rapids nearly damage the boat, but it ultimately survives the ordeal. In the end, after these hills are conquered, trees are cut down, and perilous waters, the boat reaches its destinations, and becomes the opera house that Fitzcarraldo had imagines, with the stars he loves so much performing their small show, and those that watch admire the wonderful performance, with the entrepreneur standing proud. Also starring Paul Hittscher as Paul the Captain, Miguel \u00c1ngel Fuentes as Cholo and Enrique Bohorquez as Huerequeque (The Cook). Kinski gives a great performance as the eccentric and very obsessive man with the love for opera and having his own opera house, the direction by Herzog is well paced, the most exciting scene is certainly the boat being pulled by the ropes up and down the muddy hill, but there is a lot to be enjoyed in this compelling period drama.

            "content": "I have to admit I'm ten times more interested in Werner Herzog himself than in the movies he's made. This is rare for me because I pretty much don't concern myself with creator's lives unless something that happens affects their work, which is oftentimes difficult to ascertain. Herzog, though, is a madman, a likable and engaging madman, who makes movies about madmen that make me think about what a madman Herzog is, not what madmen the people Herzog portrays are.For instance, this movie. Fitzcarraldo, as represented by Herzog, is insane. He's not even falling into insanity or slowly going insane, he just starts from the beginning completely out of his mind. His obsession with opera and his imposing, frazzled-haired quality make great iconographic representations of people driven too much by their impulses and not enough by reason. And the fact that he ultimately succeeds gives this movie more of a surprise ending than you'd expect.However, Herzog isn't content to merely say, \"He was insane,\" and leave it at that, he has to take it to the next level. He not only actually goes through all the trouble of showing how Fitzcarraldo managed to pull a steamboat over the mountain, he one-ups the character by increasing its circumstances: higher grade slope, not pulling the ship over in pieces, using only natural materials of the time, etc. (See Burden of Dreams. It's a good documentary and very revealing). Herzog did this \"to make it more dramatic\", you know, in a movie about a dramatically insane person obsessed with melodrama (the opera, the type of drama of which we compare to soap operas or really really melodramatic drama). So what does that say about Herzog? This movie also is a companion piece of sorts to Aguirre, the Wrath of God. It's sort of like the Kurtz perspective, the initial investor who penetrates further into the jungle than ever before and manages to maneuver himself into the favor of the local population as a god-like or at least spiritual figure (somehow). But then again, as a token to the perseverance, the opera house the historical figure built still exists. So not all madness is tragic, and it's certainly kept one peculiar filmmaker going for several years.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.The invention of modern drama was the birth of twins, and they have been spatting ever since. One of these is the Shakespearean tradition: characters transform, sometimes even extending beyond the constraints of the movie to create themselves or some reality. Situations are complex, sometimes unresolved. An amazing number of films (most bad of course) are part of this geneology.Contrast that with Kit Marlowe whose work can be equally abstract and complex. But here, dramatic excess is the rule. Characters come upon the scene made whole, never transforming. Situations operate according to a clockmaker outside the cosmos of the drama. Sometimes cartoony, sometimes posturing. Sometimes richly dramatic and stylish. The other half of films (and all opera) come under this gene pool.Most filmgoers have intercourse with each of these seductive types, but designing a life is pretty much about which of these you have children with. `Fitz' is Marlovian, possibly one of the most delicious. To my mind, it is better than the superficially similar Scorsese stuff that styles bombast. Herzog seems to style the restraint of bombast.By now you know key elements of the story, and those key elements are all there is: this film as opera; a grand obsession of one man seen as enhanced destiny by the masses; stage as temple -- temple as ship -- ship as god -- god as song -- song as sex and each of these wound to a compulsive maximum. That maximum is held -- barely -- by Kinski, who sometimes really impresses with the way he moves as if fortune were tickling him uncomfortably. But energy is not intelligence; being stoned is not meditation; prancing is not dance.I actually use this as white space to help me see other films of this general type better because it has such pure energy:`Apocalypse Now,' though earlier, some parts of `Mosquito Coast,' though Ford isn't in the same class (or even the same building) and `Oscar and Lucinda,' whose floating glass church as an object of obsession is directly overlain on this.It is a charming visit to a Peruvian whorehouse where one of our twins awaits.

It's a slow and lengthy production that nonetheless grips thanks to it being so well made. The photography is excellent, the performances similarly so (Kinski has never been so involved in his materia, or as convincing), the atmosphere one of brooding and mystery and the human spirit. FITZCARRALDO is an immersive cinematic experience that celebrates the very joy of the medium and gives Herzog a chance to explore all of his usual obsessions: madness, obsession, colonialism, inhospitable terrain, myth and legend, the nature of reality, man's attempts to master his world, and indigenous societies.

He just wanted to see if he could do it.  \nFilmmaking is a personal and social process for him, not a finished product. It's an extreme version of method acting.  Like Fitzcarraldo's lifting of the boat, grand gestures go far for Herzog, if only to show the world that you're great and visionary enough to try.  Most of his characters are done in by their obsessive drive (Fitzcarraldo's boat crashing into the rapids, Aguirre madly pacing about on his raft), but leave behind something beautiful.  Like a boat being dragged up a mountain in Peru with ropes and pulleys or a gun depot going up like the 4th of July.You can't give Herzog too much credit--he's been more careful not to be done in by his hubris than any of his characters were.  In fact, he's capitalized on it, much the same way Cappola did after Apocalypse Now or Hopper did after Easy Rider.  No doubt, the tales of his misadventures contribute as much to his films' popularity as the stories and images themselves, and he's been quick to market his persona with books, talks, and films about himself, the mad director. But still, Herzog is a great romantic that was born of a time and place (Munich, 1942) with few romantics, which is its own great feat. See Fitzcarraldo for a little bit of that.",

They sounded so inviting: Herzog creates dreamworlds in his fictional... or documentary films (and everything in between).The first thought about this film was... oh dear, why is this film 2,5 hours long! Can't it be one hour shorter!? 20 Minutes in: \"Oh man, this film should never end. This is great!\"And this is basically what is so great about Herzog: he sucks you into a completely new, unseen world with poetic, deep and spectacular images. Opera vs. the jungle - what could be more contrasting? The excentric, expressive Klaus Kinski ties it together... and both, Herzog and Kinski go to extremes to get spectacular scenes on screen. The music (beautiful and well constructed into the film), the acting of Kinki and the images boil down to a well-made composition.I really liked the slow pace of the film and the (mostly) accurate depiction of 1900s colonialism, that is set mostly in the Peruvian jungle. The endless sequences nature's beauty, the native people, the harsh portrait of the rubber industry - it paints a truly heartbreaking picture. For me, this film is about visionary minds (Fitzcarraldo, who wants to bring the ultimate \"beauty\", opera, to the jungle), the collision of cultures, the beauty of nature, the rapture of colonialism ... and a deeper truth beyond all of this.The captain says, while Fitzcarraldo interviews him \"The jungle is full of lies, illusions and demons. (...) I don't see very well. But nobody therefore can mislead me.\"\nThe cook says, being asked if the natives can adapt to the colonial lifestyle \"The young really like this new life. The old... well, it seems nobody can convince them. For them, the jungle and the nature is filled of dreams and mystery.\"Or these endless sequences where human mankind tries to drag a man-made thing (the big ship) over the hill to the other side and try to work against nature. These images are stronger than any words.Things like these go straight to the heart and show the difference between cultures... minds... people. Lifes. Realities. Dreams. I believe, to truly understand the 'meaning' and the 'truth' that Herzog captured... you have to watch this film 3 or 4 times.

I meant, do you find this image enthralling, or -- let's not demand too much -- in any way interesting? It's the turn of the century in South America. There is this mammoth river steamboat, all beaten up and lopsided but still seaworthy. It's huffing along some river that you've never heard of in the upper reaches of the Amazon. A knot of Europeans stands on the muddy shore, waving and cheering, but you could sail up the river for hundreds of miles and encounter nobody but illiterate laborers and indigenous head hunters.Aboard this brave but decrepit boat an opera, \"The Carmelites,\" is being performed with a full orchestra and the entire cast. The only audience aboard the boat is a handful of silent, motionless Amazonian aborigines with their faces painted scarlet, who don't know what a drinking glass is, let alone what the champagne within it is supposed to be.On the upper deck, towards the stern, stands Klaus Kinski with a footlong cigar in his mouth, smiling proudly as he brings opera to the remoter regions of the earth. The aria rings out from the Italian orchestra and the tenor and is damped down and lost in the surrounding jungle.I only ask because that is the climactic scene in this outlandish and perplexing movie. And it's a happy ending, too.But, as you can see, it's not what anyone would call a typically Hollywood happy ending.Kinski is Fitzcarraldo -- the closest the native Amazonians can get to his real name, Fitzgerald -- and he's obsessed with Enrico Caruso and with opera in general. He's mad for opera in the most literal sense. And it's his responsibility, he feels, to bring opera to the unenlightened masses of \"bare asses\" who labor in the mud of isolated rubber plantations or spend their time shrinking heads.To do it, he develops a plan to bring his steamboat to one of the most isolated rivers and schlepp rubber from one point to another, saving enough time and labor to make the scheme profitable. I don't want to have to draw a map here, so you'll have to take my word for it that the big boat must be sailed up one river, hauled by hand over a mountain, and deposited in the river on the other side so that it can be deployed.He borrows money for the boat from a reckless rubber baron and from his own girl friend, an older but still succulent Claudia Cardinale, who runs a whorehouse in a minuscule port on the Amazon. The job gets done -- including the hefting of the huge boat over the mountain -- just as it was done by Werner Herzog and his crew while filming the scene. For complex reasons, the sweating red-faced natives set the boat free in the new river, it bumps and bangs its way down through impassable rapids, and winds up back where it started, a failure.Except that Kinski doesn't really seem to care that much about the collapse of his would-be logistical enterprise. He sells the boat and somehow comes into enough money to hire the opera company for this sail into nowhere. And there Kinski stands at the stern, about to sit in his plush upholstered chair, as pleased as punch, looking around at the passing wilderness as if expecting applause, enjoying every note of \"The Carmelites.\" I didn't think much of \"The Carmelites\" myself. I saw it performed in San Francisco and fell asleep halfway through. So did my companero, who began to snore loudly enough to begin attracting attention. A quick nudge brought him out of it. But neither of us were opera buffs or, to the extent that we enjoyed it, it was at about the same level as the red-faced bare asses, certainly not Fitcarraldo's.You may or may not like this movie but I can practically guarantee that you won't forget it easily. If you find that it piques your interest, take a whack at Herzog's \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God.\" Both are set in the Amazon basin of history and both star Klaus Kinski as a lunatic. In \"Fitzcarraldo\", he's a happy madman. In \"Aguirre\", he's angry.",

            "content": "\"Fitzcarraldo\" is an extraordinary vision of what two warriors believe its their mission to conquer, their dreams to make it real and that is to fight for the art, no matter what it takes.The first warrior is the main character played effortlessly by Klaus Kinski, an adventure and wannabe rubber baron named Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, nicknamed by the Indians as Fitzcarraldo and a lover of Enrico Caruso's opera performances. His mission is to build an opera house in the middle of the South American jungle in the early days of the 20th Century, and to be able to do that he must get money from the extraction of rubber in dangerous jungles, crossing rivers through rapids with his steamship and the most risky and ungrateful mission of all: to pull that same giant ship over a hill in order to reach the rubber and avoid some complications.The second warrior is behind cameras and it is director Werner Herzog, who entered in a almost disastrous adventure to make this film, filming in several locations such as in Peru and Brazil; and went through a lot of trouble while making it during four endless years. Problems with casting the actors; letting go two of the main stars (Jason Robards and Mick Jagger) when 40% of the film was made, then he had to start over again with Kinski in the main role; troubles in finding locations; and the most disastrous of all the events was planning for a real steamship being pulled up the hill (and this ship was bigger than the one used in the real event that happened in 1890's); countless of troubles, all presented in the fascinating documentary \"Burden of Dreams\" (I strongly advise you to watch both films).In the end, \"Fitzcarraldo\" is a metaphor about fighting against everything and everyone in order to fulfill a wish, a dream even that this dream might and will become a nightmare. I believe that Herzog was foreseeing lots of trouble to make this film, perhaps not the ones he had while shooting, because he and Fitzcarraldo are almost the same person, and it's difficult to not see an enormous similarity between both men. He fought for this film until the last moment and he managed to put the boat over the hill, just like Fitzcarraldo, who puts the boat in the same place on his way to built his opera house. They're in a long battle wanting to show the world something that would last, something beautiful and powerful, art at its best form as they believe. It's also a metaphor for obsessions too, everything must be perfect for these two: Herzog would wait long hours at the end of the day to find the perfect light to be captured in his film and he succeed it in that, you'll see beautiful images all around; and Fitzcarraldo's obsession in playing Caruso at almost all moments, reaching a high state of mind, and like the director, visualizing beauty.Both men might have been called as \"Conquistadores of the Useless\" but they really conquered something in me, lots of reactions, emotions and sensations, a bright sense of accomplish; this film really fulfilled my expectations. I was excited before and during the adventure; terrified with the steamship being pulled over the hill, one of those moments when you feel a real panic in seeing how crazy those Indians, Fitzcarraldo and crew were by performing this task; and the ending moved me a lot as well. \"Fitzcarraldo\" translates like an unforgettable poetry into the screen with its themes, images, metaphors, music (the opera is perfect, but the original score is quite inappropriate in some scenes).Many films were made about defeating obstacles and winning challenges and things never done before, dreams becoming reality, but how many achieved the level of greatness and beauty than this one? This is a truly cinematic experience with amazing performances by the cast, including Claudia Cardinale, Jos\u00e9 Lewgoy, Grande Otelo and others. This is an adventure! 10/10.",

After failing in a couple of his other business endeavors in the Amazon in the early 20th century, the title character (Klaus Kinski) tries to enter the rubber business by going down a river known for its hostile natives. Without having spent a lot of time thinking about it, he has this idea that by doing so, he can haul his boat overland to an otherwise inaccessible bit of another river.As you might expect, the journey is harrowing, and it's clear that this man and his crew have no business being in this place, attempting this foolish thing, a point that's effectively made. The footage that Herzog captured in the Amazon is extraordinary; the images of the opera playing on the turntable in this place, the wild look in Kinski's eyes, and the boat being hauled up a steep hill are indelible. The film feels raw and, at times, simply breathtaking.As for criticism, the dubbing doesn't do the film any favors, and relative to the narrative, I wish that Claudia Cardinale's character had gone on the journey, or that we had gone at least a glimpse into the perspective of the natives. Despite those quibbles (and yes, this was 1982), I would have rated it even higher, but was letdown by its ending, which felt like a vindication of sorts, undercutting what I thought was a powerful message. It's also a little disturbing that Herzog himself, like the title character, was a bit maniacal in how he went about making this film, and how he exploited the natives. The irony there is incredibly bitter.",

            "content": "Can there be many films as seemingly maddening as this one? Fitzcarraldo is probably the best film about a middle aged European male ice-maker whom is based in Peru and has a fondness for opera so much so that he tries to construct his own opera house, that you're ever likely to see; a two and a half hour tale of one man and his eccentric dream to venture into the unknown so as to achieve the nigh-on impossible. The crux of the man's plight is highlighted in a simple exchange between he and someone else: \"Do you have any idea what you're doing?\" snorts the individual. \"Something no one ever has\" our lead retorts. We ask the question the initial character asks, we ask the question to both the lead character and even to those working on the film; their respective replies are in the undertakings of such missions, and it is a reply well worth seeing.The titular character is a certain businessman of Irish descent named Brian Fitzgerald; his surname of which is the origin of his nickname and film title Fitzcarraldo, he is played by Klaus Kinski and lives with his wife Molly (Cardinale) in a small, down trodden hut in a Peruvian village at around about the start of the 20th Century. The first time we see him and his wife, they have just arrived at a large opera house on the continent of South America after having rowed down the Amazon River for two days by themselves in a small boat, only to then struggle through the general opera area as they strive to catch a glimpse of an ongoing performance. The sequence is the first instance in which our lead goes to extraordinary lengths purely for the opera, the linkage being the travelling under somewhat extreme circumstances in a boat down a stretch of water so as to get closer to this medium of high art. After leaving the place somewhat disgruntled, Fitzcarraldo claims that he himself will one day run an opera house of his own.Fitzcarraldo is surrounded in squalor and generally low level living conditions; his hut surrounded by local Peruvian people whom mingle in with local farming wildlife meshing into one big, third world level of existence. His home and existence humbling; his spirit, boldness and levels of aspiration sky high; his target: a patch of land deep within the jungles under-looking the Andes mountains, a patch that is, according to those whom live in and around there, \"unfinished by God.\" The film is ultimately a tale about the plight of a man attempting to bring a piece of high culture to a zone of low level and dishevelled living, further still encompassing a battle between man and nature. The items of entertainment and things you do to kill time when granted spare time of your own in and around Fitz's existence comes in the form of gambling and card playing; the film allowing both us and Fitz to observe the sorts that indulge in this activity as being less than desirable and not particularly bothered by just sitting around and loosing money if it means a good time with a bunch of guys.His coming into contact with such living conditions, the world around him and the fact he must accept this is where he is in the world with what he really likes a two day row away down a perilous river spurns him into action. Upon hearing of this untouched patch of jungle land, located deep within the dense rural wilderness and amongst dangerous local natives he sets out to attain his dream. A prior coming together of both director Werner Herzog and lead actor Klaus Kinski in the jungle saw them produce 1972's Aguirre, The Wrath of God; with said film culminating in Kinski's own character on a boat and in the middle of the dense, rural wilderness that was a large jungle dreaming or aspiring to greater things which appeared impossible. Fitzcarraldo sees Kinski pick up where he left off, so to speak, as he takes to the waters of South America once again with a vision in his head of greater; larger; more expansive targets that at first appear fruitless in the attempting of said feats.Fitz sets off after having got a hold of, and consequently touched up to the best of his ability, an old steam boat with which he places an ex-seaman from the Netherlands as the captain of complete with a makeshift crew. There's something ominous about the trip from the beginning, initially they take off and venture away into the opposite direction from whence they were supposed to go as downcast music perhaps more associated with a funeral procession is played over these images. Later on down the line, a trip to what looks like a train depot yard that has seen its constructors attempt to carve a building plus train tracks into this dense jungle sees a past dream or experimentation in construction and business enterprising in this locale on Fitz's behalf spectacularly fail. The employee whom has seemingly been left behind so as to 'watch' whatever remained of the expedition is happy to see his former employer, but the sense of our lead perhaps disregarding those that worked for him becomes prominent more than anything else. As this huge task of going to where they're going is half way done, ominous seeds born out of past events are planted. Herzog brings the film down to a near complete stop when it transpires lugging this steamer over the mountain and into the adjacent river is Fitz's answer to a speedy process, a shift which works rather well than bog the film down. Fitzcarraldo is a remarkable film, neatly taking its place on the mantle beside other esteemed works from the director and providing a blistering descent into the mind of a man with dreams seemingly larger than the jungle he finds himself inhabiting.",

Like both of those visionaries, Herzog dreams large, and although there are sometimes gaps in logic or narrative flow, the mad scope of the vision is inimitable.In telling the tale of a man obsessed with bringing European culture to the dark mud of South America, director Herzog challenges himself to do the impossible--and, perhaps at the cost of human lives and daily sanity, lets himself and his lead, Klaus Kinski, succeed. The mysterious and spectacular images captured by photographer Thomas Mauch will linger in your brain, and the weird obsession that drives wild-eyed Kinski will, if you're willing to flow with him in that creaky steamer down the Amazon, take you on a trip you will long recall",

            "content": "\"Fitzcarraldo\" is above all a film about a maniacal drive.Main character Brian Sweeeney Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski), pronounced in Souh America as Fitzcarraldo, wants to get rich in order to build an opera house in the middle of the jungle.In order to get rich he buys a piece of land with rubber trees. Up till now this piece of land has been regarded as inaccessible. Fitzcarraldo hopes he can reach it by dragging a steamship over a hill.This sounds like a strange story, but it has its roots (with respect to the exploitation of rubber trees, not with respect to the building of an opera house) in the historical person of Carlos Fitzcarrald (1862 - 1897). Carlos Fitzcarrald however was wise enough to dismantle his boat and drag it across the mountain in parts.The maniacal drive I referred to at the beginning of this review permeates all aspects of the movie.It is embodied very well by lead actor Klaus Kinski.The movie itself contains some memorable images reflecting this maniacal drive. These images do give power to a movie that plotwise is a little bit too long. Examples of memorable scenes are Fitscaraldo arriving by rowing boat in a hurry to attend the opera at the beginning of the film. Or the scene in which Fitzcarraldo respond to the drum roll of the invisible Indians by putting a gramophone on top of his steamboat and playing a Caruso record.The most famous is undoubtedly the sequence in which the steamboat is dragged over the hill. Herzog did not use any tricks to film this scene. No computer generated images and no small model of the ship combined with editing. The crew really dragged the ship over the hill. In so doing the director proved that he was as maniacal as his main character and his lead actor.\"Fitzcarraldo\" has become a film as well known for the resulting film as for the production proces. In this respect it resembles \"Apocalypse now\" (1979, Francis Ford Coppola). Moreover the two films also share the same theme, an odyssey across a river, although in different continents. \"Fitzcarraldo\" is situated in South America, \"Apocalypse now\" in Asia while \"Heart of Darkness\" (the novel by Joseph Conrad on which \"Apocalypse now\" is loosely based) plays in Africa.Ten years before \"Fitzcarraldo\" Werner Herzog made \"Aguirre, the wrath of God\". Also a film about an odyssey across a river. Also situated in South America. Also with Klaus Kinski as leading actor.",

            "content": "In Fitzcarraldo the eponymous hero dreams of bringing opera to an Amazonian backwater. To raise the money he must drag a huge river steamer from one river to another over a hill in the depths of the jungle thereby avoiding dangerous rapids and giving him access to untapped rubber trees. The Important Fact about this film is that Herzog (the director), his crew and a few hundred Amazonian tribespeople (apparently hunter gatherers with a traditional way of life) actually dragged that boat across the jungle for real. They really did it and this changes how the viewer feels about the film.For much of its running time Fitzcarraldo comes across as an old colonial spectacular in the mould of Hollywood of the 1950s, with the merest sprinkling of Heart of Darkness, but not so you can really taste it. Fitzgerald (Kinski improbable as the likable dreamer) is thrilled by opera and he realises that if he can only get a transport ship to a remote part of the jungle cut off by dangerous rapids and collect the rubber there he can make a killing and build an opera house. He buys a ship, hires a crew and heads off into uncharted waters. Soon they encounter Amazonian \"headhunters\" and, terrified, most of the crew desert, leaving Fitzgerald to persuade the native people to aid him in his grand scheme. Up to this point the film seems clumsy. It's badly put together and acted, not particularly good to look at, even dull. But, then they begin to drag this huge ship out of the water and over a jungle covered hill, and it is immediately obvious that they are doing this for real. It's jaw dropping stuff.Trees are hacked down to whoops from the native people, cuttings are blasted and they recoil in terror, stones are passed from hand to hand, winding equipment is built from great trees, an immense pulley is carried by people gasping under its weight, and then miraculously the ship begins to inch its way out of the water in scenes reminiscent of Salgado's photographs of silver miners. The cast (professional and amateur) swarm around the ship covered head to foot in red mud. The physical strain and exhilaration are all real. Kinski, suddenly perfect with his grubby linen suit and shock of blond hair, is almost dwarfed by a spectacle equal to his mad persona. It's akin to seeing Buster Keaton at play with a steam locomotive. It's amazing and entertaining - but surely someone is going to get hurt? Once the ship hits the water again sadly the power of these scenes begins to dissipate and the film floats on bumpily to its ridiculous conclusion. The role of the Amazonian tribespeople in Fitzcarraldo is troubling. They are heralded in the time honoured fashion of safari movies. Before we meet them we hear tales of murdered missionaries and shrunken heads. We hear strange drumming and chanting from the forest. Ominous figures stand in wooden canoes. Finally we see dozens of little boats and mysterious visitors fill the ship. They are baffled by Fitzgerald's extreme blond, whiteness. None of these characters have a name, none get to utter dialogue comprehensible to the audience, and none are differentiated individuals except one apparent leader. They are just a conglomeration, a collective entity, an alien otherness. This is a shame because they bring some much needed gravity and screen presence to the film. Herzog makes ineffectual attempts to counter this colonial taint through the script. The native people have their own agenda for engaging in this task (appeasement of river gods) and the film concludes happily for them having sent the ship over the rapids Fitzgerald has been at such pains to avoid. For once colonialism has been co-opted to someone else's ends and thwarted in the process. This is not enough to restore the film's balance.In Fitzcarraldo we are offered a rather tired colonial yarn that seems thrown together, but which culminates in a spectacle worthy of Cecil B. DeMille. The film does flip from clumsy fiction to electrifying reality and back again, but the sight of this huge ship being dragged over the red mud using ropes and muscle power makes compelling viewing. However the viewer is left to question the film's attitude to colonialism and whether doing it for real really turns this mostly leaden film into gold?",

The inimitable Klaus Kinski delivers one of his most inspired performances as the eccentric Irishman who strikes out into a cloying world of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez-ian lushness and magic. The Jivero Indians believe that \"everyday life is only an illusion behind which lies the reality of dreams.\" They see Fitzcarraldo's gigantic steamboat as the means to soothe the angry gods who have chosen to leave their world unfinished. For Herzog's script to remain true to his personal vision, he actually had to drag the ship over a mountain. The painstaking process encountered every disaster possible, including tribal and cast revolts, droughts, and floods. Herzog somehow pulled the boat and everyone else along with his own dream, to create one of the truest representations of the primordial and one of finest examples of the transcendent nature of film. Greater ordeals were in store with the making of the formidable Fitzcarraldo, about a man soobsessed with bringing opera to the backwaters of the Amazon that he pulls a 340-ton ship over the mountains. The film was plagued with disasters of all sorts including two plane crashes, a border war between Peru and Ecuador, and two crew members shot with arrows, necessitating kitchen-table surgery. The film, which took three years of preparation and nine months of shooting, featured 5,000 extras, required building a jungle camp, and had a crew of only 14 or 16, which Herzog claimed to be his largest crew yet. Jason Robards, originally cast in the title role, became so ill he was flown out of the jungle and forbidden by doctors to return. The volatile Kinski was recruited to replace him. \"The Indians were scared of this mad man. At the end of shooting one day, one came up to me and said, 'Shall we shoot him for you?' They said they weren't afraid of this screaming mad man, they were afraid of me because I was so silent.\" His experiences making the film prompted the exasperated Herzog to say in a documentary, Burden of Dreams, \"I shouldn't make movies anymore. I should go to a lunatic asylum.\" Linking all his films, he said, is the desire to understand the human condition, to look deep inside the unexplained mysteries of our existence and ask who we are. \"A deep glimpse inside of our heart is important. At the same time I try to articulate new images. We are surrounded by worn out images. We need to develop a language of images adequate to our civilization.

In order to achieve his dream, though, he must first make a fortune in the area's biggest industry: rubber. The scheme he conjures up involves sailing a boat down one branch of the Amazon, carrying it over a mountain, and sailing up the other side. This feat comprises a large bulk of the film, and was shot without the aid of any special effects.One wonders why Herzog ever bothers to make fiction films at all, since even the ones he does make feel like documentaries. This isn't the first film of his in which the actual narrative storytelling feels obligatory, and is almost lost amid Herzog's detached observation. This marred my enjoyment of \"Fitzcarraldo\" somewhat, as Kinski's objective and the developments of the plot are somewhat difficult to follow. It's as if Herzog has to wrench himself away from simply filming unscripted action when someone on his crew reminds him that he's actually trying to tell a story. However, the viewer is compensated by beautiful, authentic location shooting in the Amazon and fascinating exposure to the native Peruvian tribes. If these were actors and not actual natives, Herzog does a hell of a good job of convincing us otherwise.Grade: A",

I myself found \"Fitzcarraldo\" a watch that was pretty absurd yet entertaining at the same time and I preferred it over \"Aguirre\". I think that one all came down to Kinski portraying a schemer, who was truly insane and emotionally unstable. There are more layers to his performance here. it is actually one of these rare films where Kinski's character is actually quite likable, even if there is once again a touch of insanity to it. Or is there really? After all his dream of opera in the jungle did come true in the end.While it is probably not among my very favorite Herzog movies, it was still a decent watch. The female lead is the famous Italian beauty Claudia Cardinale. I think this film does have some lengths and they certainly could have kept it under 2 hours while still making a convincing work. This way, it would have been more essential as well. However, this one was Golden Globe nominated and BAFTA nominated, so I guess Herzog didn't make a lot wrong. And he won Best Director at Cannes for his work here. There is a German version out there and also an English one. It does not really matter which one you pick as basically almost all of the actors in here were dubbed anyway later on. As a whole, this was a pretty decent watch and I recommend \"Fitzcarraldo\".",

A man and his dream. He doesn't have money enough, so he has to get into the rubber businness: he buys a plantation situated in a remote zone of the Amazonas, but there's a problem: he and the workers cannot reach that plantation going up by the river with their big steamship, 'cause the plantation is in a parallel river, surrounded by rapids. No problem: he'll take a short cut through the jungle itself, he'll make the ship go up a hill and he'll take it to the other side, the side where the plantation is.\nThat's the story Werner Herzog gives us. All the troubles Fitzcarraldo's gotta get through. The will-power, that's what Fitzcarraldo is about. Herzog perfectly recreates what it means to live in the Amazonas, you can almost feel the sweat, the humidity, the stifling heat. With a calm and slow rhythm (just like that ship climbing that hill) he takes pleasure filming all the corners of that astonishing river while the voice of Enrico Caruso goes out from Fitzarraldo's record player. He came off well of a rather difficult job, adn made his best film (for me -though I love Aguirre or Nosferatu as well-). Klaus Kinski, one the more excessive and intense actor ever, plays one of his best performances (due to his bad temper and his complicated personality it wasn't easy to work with this man) and brings Fitzcarraldo to life as no one could possibly have done. Risky, epic, poetic, emotive, exciting... I'd have to use so many adjectives to define this movie and what it made me feel. \nPS: The filming of Fitzcarraldo was almost as difficult as Fitcarraldo's enterprise: Werner Herzog took all the crew (cast included, of course) to Per\u00fa, he recruited a whole cast of native people; they suffered all kind of diseases, that infernal-humid weather, storms, mosquitos, snakes, and all kind of jungle creatures, they knew the meaning of the \"jungle\". Sure it was a ruinous business; but who cares? Money does not mean anything. Fitzcarraldo means a lot of things.My rate: 9/10",

            "content": "I think that it is always going to be a mistake to analyze this film using the known chaos of the actual making of the project. It is well known and written about but in my view is equally a distraction to the strengths of the art. If you did not know a thing about this movie, what would be your impressions? Given that innocent point of view, my impressions were that it was like watching the dream of an obsessed madman come to life. According to http://www.iquitosnews.com/page14a.html the Herzog story is very loosely based on a true story. Disregarding this, the film has great merits on its own. Kinski, a man renowned for being a living volcano, when he IS on camera is perfectly poised and generally calm. His madcap dream does not come across as mentally deranged but rather as a romantic extravagance that hearkens more to the 19'th century than to the 20'th. That he had the means to indulge his passion is all the story needs: the spark and fuel of the combustion evolve as the story unfolds. What does this film look like? I was drawn to compare the film to Terrence Malick's \"The Thin Red Line\" and \"The New World\". Herzog's film had many of those qualities: many moments when there is no dialog, the boat drifts down the river and the piercing chirp of strange sounding birds is all you hear. The focus on the natives who again are often shot with them gathered around, looking still and meditative but remote...is both hypnotic and strange The efforts to lift the boat are so outrageous, suggested as they were in the film by a drunken cook, that when we see it occur all you can do is gasp out-loud and laugh. The movie is much discussed (I'm sure) in film schools. For me it was simply a delightful and totally crazy dream, a journey not through the heart of darkness, but into the unknown veins of natures backwoods; the anxiety of the journey offset by the phenomenal beauty of the rain forest and the wild encounter with savage natives. That Fitzcaraldo was able to pursue his goals in peace reminded me again of Captain John Smith making arrangements with the Powhattan. I loved it.",

Small problems like grainy picture and sub-par sound are not that big of a deal (unless you are fussy). The problem comes down to a couple of weaknesses in the script, which could probably have been avoided, but knowing how hard Werner Herzog worked on this (and there are many famous production stories) I am impressed enough to call this great filmaking. It requires patience to watch, but if you have it, I guarantee you'll find this fascinating.The story is about a very very obsessed man. Brian Fitzgerald was a wealthy opera loving business man who wants to build an opera house in the Peruvian jungle near the village where he lives. To get the funding for this he comes up with a very elaborate plan which involves rigging a steamboat and pulling it over a mountain!! Well, not exactly a mountain, a hundred meter high piece of rock which divided the river in two in one place. The reason why he attempts this insanity I am not gonna say. You have to see the film for yourself (or read someone else's review). The bottom line, he does it.Werner Herzog moves his film very slowly, and during the large middle section, it gets a bit too slow perhaps. There are also a couple of scenes which make don't make much sense and should probably have been cut. The ending feels a little rushed. Maybe there was more in it, and Herzog had to cut it because the rest of the Fitzcarraldo is so long. Things like that happen sometimes. I think all film goers should see Fitzcarraldo, it is epic, unique, and among other things, it's insane.",

            "content": "I have to confess that this is the first Werner Herzog movie I've seen; I am no expert, and cannot comment on his oeuvre. Based on this film alone, I admit that Herzog is definitely a bold director who makes no compromises to complete his vision---just like the protagonist of this film.Herzog paints an intriguing picture of a wealthy entrepreneur in early-20th century Peru who is unique among his peers. He is a genuine aesthete, and has a vision far beyond the mere accumulation and enjoyment of wealth. The film portrays the nouveau-riche rubber barons, who are Fitzcarraldo's friends and acquaintances, as vulgar, money-driven people who have accumulated so much wealth that throwing some money away means nothing to them. They mock Fitz for his failed ventures as a railroad builder and an ice maker, already setting him apart from his peers. He only decides to exploit a new area for its rubber not simply to become a fat and happy baron, but as a means to an end: he wants to bring culture and beauty in the form of an opera house in his frontier settlement. This dream drives his dangerous adventure into the jungle, with a single-mindedness that puts other rubber barons to shame. Herzog does not shirk from depicting Fitzcarraldo as mad and irrational, but also also treats him sympathetically. He is mad, but he is a determined dreamer, willing to do what it takes against overwhelming odds to make his strange dream come true. From this film alone, it seems Herzog places value on the individual with powerful dreams and ambition, and, while not above criticizing the individual for his recklessness, also treats him with unabashed admiration. This movie is a bit troubling in its depiction of a white protagonist who ventures into the jungle and \"tames\" the natives. Fitzcarraldo is apparently considered by the natives as some sort of superhuman who fulfills a prophecy, and they risk their lives to complete the Herculean task of lifting his immense riverboat up a hill using only primitive winches and their muscle power. Granted, the lifting of the boat is a visually amazing scene, one of the best set pieces in cinema I've seen; still, the implications of what this scene depicts is troubling. While Fitzcarraldo may be a nicer white man than the other rubber barons living in the Peruvian jungle, he is nevertheless just as exploitative of the native peoples who live there: they consider Fitzcarraldo as some sort of \"special\" person they need to work for, and they work for him without compensation of any sort. This movie does not engage enough with the troubling issues of colonialism and the exploitation of native peoples around the world; the film's focus is primarily on Fitzcarraldo and his state of mind. I wish the film would have explored the themes of colonialism more acutely than it does. As it stands, the movie seems a bit too Eurocentric and treats European exploration and exploitation with a triumphal tone.In all, this was a fascinating movie. It is, so far as I can tell, the only movie to depict the Amazon Rubber Boom. I would have liked this film to have focused more on the plight of the Indians rather than just on Fitzcarraldo and his vision; I suppose that will have have to await another filmmaker. The film makes great use of special effects and lush tropical scenery to depict the story of a driven man. There are some \"Apocalypse Now/Heart of Darkness\" tones to the riverboat voyage, but \"Fitzcarraldo\" is a much *much* less dark movie, though of no less quality than Coppola's work. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "I first watched Werner Herzog's 1982 film Fitzcarraldo back in the late 1980s, on PBS, and found it to be a great film. All these years later I still find it to be a great film, if not quite in a league with Herzog and Klaus Kinski's other most famed filmic pairing, Aguirre: The Wrath Of God. The earlier film, made a decade before, shares other elements with Fitzcarraldo, which was written and directed by Herzog. The most obvious is that both involve river journeys in the Amazon, and both films have scenes of troublemakers being left in the jungle to fend for themselves. In Aguirre it's a horse, in Fitzcarraldo it's four humans. A less obvious commonality is that both films were shot in English, then dubbed into German. Thus, when one chooses the English language option on the DVD one is watching the film as it was originally made. This is how I watched it, and how all foreign language or foreign made DVDs should be packaged. In a visual medium there is absolutely no excuse for foreign films to not have available English dubbed soundtracks, for the reading of words necessarily diminishes the visual impact of the film on first watching.However, this film would still be great even were it only available with subtitles. Yet, if a viewer is expecting another vintage over the top performance by Kinski, he will be disappointed, for Kinski's titular character, whose real name is Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Fitzcarraldo is a local nickname based on a mispronunciation), is far more understated a role than in his other collaborations with Herzog. It's a great performance, nonetheless, which proves a) that Kinski was one of the Twentieth Century's greatest actors and b) how felicitous it was for Herzog that his original choice for the role, Jason Robards, dropped out due to illness. While I think Robards was a fine actor, he was not near the pure acting talent that Kinski was. Another fact gleaned from the DVD commentary is that Herzog had a sidekick role for Robards' version of Fitzcarraldo, with rock star Mick Jagger in the lead role. A few scenes of this pairing appear in Herzog's acclaimed documentary on Kinski called My Best Fiend, and they are absolutely terrible. That Jack Nicholson was also considering taking the lead role, but declined it, is another instance of fortuity's role in great art. There are many little moments in the film, that are the realism in the 'eye level realism', which make the film seem less like a film and more as if a camera had been snuck aboard a real life adventure. This is where the film's greatness really comes into focus, for so few other directors ever have such moments in their films. Herzog often calls these moments ecstatic truths, but they are great because they are not really ecstatic, merely ordinary, but displaced in narrative space and time so that they take on a meaning and metaphor that is not immanent. As example, there are the young children who stare at the jail Fitz is held in after an incident at a rubber baron's party. The police chief lets him out because the children will not flee, and one child plays a fiddle for days on end. Why? There is no explanation, but oddities like this occur in life far more often than they ever appear in film. There's the tiny black employee of Fitz's, who has guarded his railroad property from Indians, not knowing it's another project he has returned on. His odd but endearing behavior seems real precisely because only an oddball would defend another man's property without pay for months on end. There is the black umbrella that floats toward the boat as a seeming warning from the local Indians. There is the celebration by the Indians after the boat has made it over the mountain, where native women squirt their breast milk into bowls to be drunk.Then, at film's end, there is a close moment between Fitz and Captain Paul. Yet, Fitz whispers it into the Captain's ear, so the viewer never knows what is said. Having seen the more recent Lost In Translation, where what was whispered between that film's two lead characters was taken as a 'stroke of genius' by tyro director Sofia Coppola, it does not surprise me that she stole that idea from Herzog. In this film, since it is a greater film, and the two characters have gone through far more, the gesture is even more powerful and moving. The very fact that a moment like that goes uncommented upon by all the major critics of the film- then and now, yet when it appears in a film like Coppola's is lauded without surcease, shows how far much more a film like Fitzcarraldo has to offer than a rather light piece of fluff like Lost In Translation. This is because such moments are in surfeit in Fitzcarraldo, whereas they are the centerpieces of Hollywood tripe. But, as Captain Paul mentions to Fitz, there are two kinds of silences- the good and the bad. Oddly, the lack of praise for such a great moment is one of the good silences. Enjoy the gilt.",

He dreams of bringing the opera to the Amazon Jungle, but first he must venture in the rubber business. With the aid of his rich wife, Molly (Claudia Cardinale), he purchases a steamboat and heads against the current to develop a seemingly impossible task of acquiring untouched rubber from a parallel river. During his journey, Fitzcarraldo and his wayward crew encounter a large tribe of Amazon Indians, who are entranced by the opera recording on the ship. Unsure of the Indians' agenda, Fitzcarraldo forms an alliance with them in order to achieve the seemingly impossible; drag a steamboat over the land to the other side.This is first Werner Herzog film I've seen, and although it started off slowly, I was entranced by the journey itself. The cinematography of the Amazonian landscape is breath-taking in parts, as well as the tension created throughout the story. You really do get an idea of the facets of this vessel from the various camera-angles, as well as the humidity, and the tension created in the story. Like Fitzcarraldo, the viewer never really knows where he stands with the natives of the jungle. This is less a story about the opera, and more a story about humanity, and the coming together of different types of people and culture.Klaus Kinski is excellent as the manic-haired lead character. Fitzcarraldo is truly the odd one out amongst his crew, and later in the film. Kinski has quite a screen presence, and I look forward to seeing more of Herzog/Kinski collaborations. Although, the film takes its time in the beginning, it literally takes off along with the steamboat and the journey becomes a rhythmic and visual feast. 'Fitzcarraldo', as a film, is a great introduction to Werner Herzog and as a film about humanity, triumph over the land, as well as the spirituality of the people who are part of that land.**** out of *****!",

            "content": "This two and a half hour German film released in 1982 is one of Werner Herzog's best movies. It reads mostly as a homage to crazy visionaries, people whom Herzog clearly identifies with. Based on a true story, but taking considerable liberties with the truth, this film tells the story of one Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski, who is terrific), an opera mad Irish entrepreneur living in Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon in the late 19th century. Fitzgerald was called Fitzcarraldo by the locals, who found his original name difficult to pronounce. A plan by him to build a railway crossing the Andes had failed, and his next project of making ice wasn't going anywhere. After a talk with a rubber baron, he came up with a new plan: to exploit rubber in a very remote part of the Amazon rain forest and with the profits made from the venture build an opera house in Iquitos. For that purpose, he buys a river boat with money from the madam of a brothel (played by Claudia Cardinale) who sympathizes with him. He hires a rowdy crew to accompany him in his boat to his jungle tract, including a nearsighted captain, a drunken cook and a giant Indian called Cholo. Now, the area where he had the concession to exploit rubber trees could only be accessed through a river with impossible rapids to cross. But a navigable river ran nearby, and he came up with the idea of carrying the whole boat between the rivers with the help of nearby Indians. Only problem, those Indians were hostile head hunters, known to kill previous trespassers in the area. And to make things worse, the terrain where the portage of the boat took place was not plain but was rather a steep hill (apparently, the real Fitzcarraldo did carry a boat through a hill, only he disassemble first into pieces, and later assemble it back in the nearby river).In a superb extender scene, Fitzcarraldo manages to get the Indians to carry the boat to the other river, but after wards, things start unraveling badly. But just when the film looks like is going to have a downbeat ending, Herzog pulls out a surprisingly heartwarming finale, which I won't reveal here but in which Fitzcarraldo partly fulfills his dreams - though some reviewers find it anticlimactic compared with the scene of the boat going up the hill.Originally Jason Robards was going to play Fitzcarraldo, with Mick Jagger playing his sidekick. Eventually, Robards got a tropical disease during the filming and had to bow out on medical advice, and Jagger also abandoned the shooting due to his musical commitments with the Rolling Stones (by the way, there is some footage around the Internet showing Robards and Jagger playing their characters and is clear that they would have been dreadful in the movie). Herzog decided to call Kinski, who doesn't look Irish at all, but had the right crazy intensity for the character, while writing off Jagger's role. By casting Kisnki, the movie turn into a German speaking film, which looks incongruous in a film set in the Peruvian Amazon, though you will eventually suspend your disbelief.",

One of the true cinematic visionaries, Herzog outdid himself here in terms of pure crazed intent. An eccentric visionary called Fitzcarraldo dreams of building an opera house in the middle of the Amazonian jungle. To do this he needs money and in this part of the world this meant rubber trees. He realises that there is a large section of untapped jungle ripe for exploitation. The only problem is that it is completely inaccessible because of rapids. Well, not completely inaccessible, as Fitzcarraldo plans to drag his steamboat over a small mountain in order to get there.This is a fairly strange story to begin with. But really, what takes things to a whole new level is the fact that Herzog actually dragged this steamboat over the hill for real with primitive means. It takes a borderline madman to even consider this. This is the one Herzog film where the mercurial Klaus Kinski seems relatively sane. This is only because the monumentally crazy enterprise overshadows everything else. Of course, the result is an astonishing film.The imagery is often breathtaking. Aside from the extraordinary scenes of the boat being hauled over the hill, there is the intense rapid sequence and, best of all, the quite menacing section where the steamboat glides through the Amazon while the chants and drums of unseen Indians roar from the hidden depths of the jungle. Fitzcarraldo is truly a visual spectacle. But it is also about what happens when cultures clash. The Indians assist the plan to drag the boat over the hill quite willingly but Fitzcarraldo only discovers much too late that their motivations are entirely different to his.Ultimately though, this is a truly one-of-a-kind film.

            "content": "What a fantastic movie. I saw Aguirre: Wrath of God at the cinema a few years ago and decided I never wanted to see it on the small screen, but haven't foreseen a chance to see Fitzcarraldo so, so I submitted to seeing it on DVD. I watched it twice that day! Like Aguirre, it's visually a beautiful film, which makes far better use of the landscape than similar \"white man goes nuts in the Jungle\" movies. It's also far less patronising than \"Mosquito Coast\" and not as portentious as \"Apocalypse Now\".Herzog can escape the tired jungle-as-Id clich\u00e9 (one which he himself may have set the template for in Aguirre) because his and Fitzcarraldo's real dreamscapes are opera. It also has a far more honest approach to the jungle than those movies. Rather than setting it up as a primeval Conradian hell (a comparison which the interviewer sets up but Herzog seems to ignore in the DVD commentary) in which the basest instincts of man are unleashed, it is a strange but beautiful world which offers potential for banal business exploitation. The natives are not the virtual extraterrestrials of old but simply another social organisation with different values and ways of comprehending the World. Unlike Kurtz, it is not the Jungle that defeats Fitzcarraldo but the rather more modest natives who simply and innocently exploit Fitzcarraldo even as he is selfishly exploiting them.At 2hrs 30m, it probably is too long for such a simple story but this has more to do with a very leisurely first act, establishing Fitzcarraldo's love of opera, the time and society of the rubber barons, and Fitzcarraldo's touching relationship with his Madame wife. It takes Fitzcarraldo an hour to actually set out up the river. And anyway, is that really such a harsh criticism in a world that can tolerate 3:15 hours of the trite Titanic and over 9 hours of the overblown Lord of the Rings. The film is packed with detail and incident but Herzog needs to present this as a slow painstaking endeavour. Cutting it down to 100 minutes (Herzog's usual running time, he's not known for making long films) would have diminished the difficulty of Fitzcarraldo's enterprise. The viewer needs to share at least some of that effort.There's not much to choose between the English soundtrack and the German, though admittedly some of Kinski's line readings sound a little more stilled in English (mainly in a couple of admittedly redundant exposition scenes), but then the lip movements match better as the film was shot in English.",

The attempted introduction of Christianity, resulting as it did, in the extinction of almost all indigenous cultures in the new world, should be viewed in the same light as the current/contemporary drive to destroy any individual and separatist subculture.Look at Fitzcarraldo and see it for what it is: a document of the insanity which was the introduction of Christianity to the New World.

The film introduce to us a man in love with something, with the opera, since always he had one clear goal, one clear dream, something that will make him look like a complete insane man, like a visionary and always like a dreamer. Again we have the encounter of different worlds. Here is clear that the people from the old continent are having all the success however Brian \"Fitzcarraldo\" Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski) is still looking out for that road to the success. He is in the ice business, he left incomplete another visionary project and basically at one point he is seen as a complete madman when he tries to share what the opera makes with him. He is an eccentric character, he is a businessman and a visionary who will do what nobody ever imagine if there is a hope to get what he wants to get what he needs for that dream, for that opera house. On that way his dream will stay intact but the way to get what he needs will change until the mission is clear, not clear in ways of how successful it will be but clear in the mind of Fitzcarraldo. Everything seems great for the team that will join our main character in his journey however not a long time after they began to have questions, actually the first questions began right after the steamer took its way. The fear is the only thing Fitzcarraldo can represent to his team and not because he is an evil man or something but because he is doing something that nobody has done. He will be alone at one point with only three men from the original crew. The fear was always there thanks to the natives but they were something different. The opera was a reason to see Fitzcarraldo as a different man for those successful men but maybe it was one of the reasons of why Fitzcarraldo and his team were still alive. Is hard to know how the natives were thinking, for sure they wanted to find a place of peace. Is fascinating because at one point Fitzcarraldo's plan became something that, even if it was just something almost impossible and without a clear conclusion if they succeed, was a real mission not only for Fitzcarraldo but now for his team too, it became something for what they were really fighting and when the success looked at least possible the happiness was there, at least for a couple of minutes. Now they were a true team not only men carrying out with their jobs for other man who's real intentions were basically unknown. Fitzcarraldo felt the glory just to see how his plan was failing but another man, now \"infected\" with the dream, came with the final plan, the one that delivered a moment of true happiness. Fitzcarraldo and his team could return, they did something impossible with the help of who knows what and the film ends with a moment of true happiness for the dreamer, the visionary, the madman\u0085Kinski created another complex character, now based on the real life Peruvian Carlos Ferm\u00edn Fitzcarrald. He is great as the film (the film-making values of it are impressive) however this is not my favourite performance of Kinski and not my favourite film of Herzog, of course from the ones I have seen that are: For A Few Dollars More (Kinski), Aguirre, the Wrath of God (both), Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (both), Woyzeck (both), Les Fruits de la Passion (Kinski), Grizzly Man (Herzog) and Rescue Dawn (Herzog). For the record, I saw this film after midnight so in the first minutes of this day (15 September 2008) not knowing for sure if I was going to stay awake. It was amazingly interesting and fascinating that I do stay awake even that its runtime is 158 minutes or so. Still is not an accessible film or at least not as accessible as others of Herzog, in my opinion the clearest example of an accessible film of Herzog is Rescue Dawn. Absolutely worth watching and I feel that I will be watching it again soon, not extremely soon but soon.",

I guess this is why Fitzcarraldo is called conquistador of the useless at a party. The madness of human endeavor and the dreams of a romantic man are shown to be more important than people who simply exist. It does show the other side - exploitation of the tribal people. But there are too many scenes of the tribal s going around doing their jobs like zombies. And they are not portrayed in very good light. They are easily exploited and also very violent. There is an emptiness in their eyes. They are not romanticized.Klaus Kinski is an interesting actor. I cannot think of anyone else like him - maybe Dean Stockwell. Jack Nicholson was supposed to play the title role but apparently he asked for too much money.Actually pulling the boat up that incline to make it look real on film was very commendable. Films like this do not get made anymore. Some of the long shots were simply spectacular.The crazed background score seems to exemplify the madness of the lead character.It is a slow burn adventure film that could be compared to APOCALYPSE NOW/DELIVERANCE/SORCERER.

            "content": "Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo is one of the most remarkable stories ever committed to celluloid. The off-screen story is every bit as incredible as the on-screen one \u2013 Herzog's exhausting quest to bring the film to life, shooting on location under the most taxing conditions, is the stuff of film-making folklore\u0085 every bit as extraordinary as the much- publicised tribulations experienced by Coppola when shooting Apocalypse Now. An artists' indomitable spirit in pursuit of his art occasionally throws up masterworks of this kind and, while the process of getting the film made very nearly tips these passionate individuals over the edge, the end results can be truly astounding. So it was with Apocalypse Now and so it is with Fitzcarraldo.Idealistic wannabe tycoon Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski) is an ambitious Irishman living in turn-of-the-century South America. He is an \"ideas-man\", but all too often his ideas come to nothing\u0085 such as his recent, aborted dream of building a Trans-Andean railway. Fitzgerald winds up in the ramshackle Amazonian city of Iquitos, where he earns the nickname 'Fitzcarraldo' as the locals are unable to correctly pronounce his name. One evening he makes the long and difficult journey downriver to the thriving city of Manaus to watch an opera featuring his idol, the great operatic legend Caruso. He is overwhelmed by the experience, and it makes him more determined than ever to pursue his long-held dream of building an opera house in Iquitos. To achieve the dream he needs money. The way to make money in turn-of-the-century Amazonia is to get involved in the lucrative rubber industry, but this is not an easy thing to do as virtually every area where rubber trees can be found has been snapped up by wealthy plantation owners. Fitzgerald discovers that there is one region still available for purchase further downstream, left alone by the wealthy tycoons as it lies beyond some dangerous and un-navigable rapids. Fitzgerald's incredible plan is to sail a steamboat down a parallel river, then drag the entire vessel over the dividing mountains at a point beyond the rapids. The quest takes him into hostile native territory, where he must somehow make contact with the untrusting Indians and persuade them to help him hoist the 300-ton ship over the slopes.Herzog's dynamic direction \u2013 working from his own script \u2013 really drives the film. He gets a masterful performance from Kinski as Fitzgerald, plus stunning visuals from his cinematographer Thomas Mauch. Reports suggest that Herzog and Kinski almost came to blows during the difficult shoot (one of the native extras allegedly offered to murder Kinski on Herzog's behalf!) but their fractious relationship has been cleverly channelled to bring out the best in both of them. Kinski's obsessed, wide-eyed dreamer is a mesmerising character, one of cinema's all-time greats, providing the actor with arguably the finest role of his career. Similarly, Herzog takes his art to a new level here \u2013 already a brilliant film-maker with a mightily impressive oeuvre to his name, he somehow goes a step farther with Fitzcarraldo \u2013 this is his masterpiece. Inspiring, fascinating, visually stunning and emotionally intense, Fitzcarraldo encapsulates everything that is great about cinema. One cannot fail to be stirred by Herzog's story of a man's unbridled determination to fulfil a dream\u0085 nor can one feel any less stirred by Herzog's own unbridled determination to complete his film against overwhelming odds. It is a marvel of a movie, a genuine must-see for anyone and everyone who loves the art of film.",

Based on a true story (albeit involving a smaller ship that was transported in pieces), the film is an outstanding depiction of dedication and drive. Jason Robards was the original lead but I find it hard to imagine the film without Klaus Kinski, who is perfect as the driven, obsessive yet charming Fitzcarraldo. Much has been written about the production, including the tension between Herzog and the incendiary Kinski, which may have contributed to the intensity Kinski brings to his character. While the movie is primarily a one-man show, Claudia Cardinale is beautiful as Fitzcarraldo's lover who bankrolls the venture and the actors playing the captain, cook and engineer on the steamboat (Paul Hittscher, Huerequeque Enrique Boh\u00f3rquez, and Miguel \u00c1ngel Fuentes respectively) are quite good. The cinematography is outstanding: endless beautiful images of South American waterways and jungles juxtaposed with the surreal sight of the immense steamer, black smoke pouring out of its funnels, being dragged over the mountain.",

            "content": "There's definitely something odd about seeing Klaus Kinski play a character that smiles and a character that is in love with another human being. After all, virtually every other character Kinski played was a frothing madman. But here he plays Fitzcarraldo, a man of passion and warmth, a man who loves opera instead of fear and death.The opening scenes set the character up superbly. Fitzcarraldo emerges from the darkness as he struggles to get to the opera on time. He's rowed two days and two nights to see the show (after the motor on his boat broke down) but once he gets there the show has already started and he's denied entry. Meanwhile horses are fed expensive champagne and there's a large group of locals congregated outside the front of the house. It's obvious that Fitzcarraldo, like the indigenous population, doesn't belong in such opulent surroundings. He's an outsider. However, after some gentle persuasion he gains entry and gets to watch the rest of the show while standing at the back of the theatre.But Fitzcarraldo isn't content to stand at the back forever. Inspired by his love of opera and the way the wealthy claim this form of artistic expression entirely as their own, he decides that he's going to build his own opera house. He's going to do it for the local children that listen to his records and for the pig that listens to them, too.One of my favourite scenes in the film is when Fitzcarraldo climbs to the top of a church and screams from the belfry that he wants his opera house. He's like a big kid demanding French fries and ketchup for dinner. But it's endearing too, and I love the manic way that Kinski starts ringing the bell as he demands his opera house and as he says that he wont let anyone come into the church until he's got it.Well, his church siege doesn't last, but his passion doesn't die. He's going to make the money required to build his opera house come hell or high water. But it isn't an easy task and he has to put up with rich businessmen flashing their wealth in his face \u0096 one man feeds money to his fish just to illustrate how much he has. But all the doubting and the all the taunts just make him more determined. When he buys a piece of land rich with rubber trees, and when the local businessmen start placing bets on when he'll fail, he says that he'll move a mountain, and because it's Kinski, and because Kinski is intense to an absurd degree, you believe him.But you also believe him because Herzog is directing the film. If anyone can move a mountain, it's him. And the scene where Fitzcarraldo and a tribe of Indians drag a steamboat up a mountain really has to be seen to be believed. It's surreal, it's beautiful and it's a fantastic way of illustrating what an uphill struggle we have when we try and make our dreams real. It's a difficult process, and a painful one too, but it's also incredibly worthwhile.Another scene I like is when Fitzcarraldo surveys the land he's bought from a gantry high up in the trees. He looks down upon the land he wants to exploit (money from the rubber trees are going to pay for his opera house) like a god. Again he's like the kid demanding his opera house.But there are plenty of other great moments in the film as well. I love the bit when Fitzcarraldo and his crew first encounter the natives. They can't see them, but they can hear their drums coming from the jungle. So then Fitzcarraldo plays Caruso and everything goes quiet. And then again Fitzcarraldo surveys the jungle like a god quietly passing through. But then to bring him back down to earth there's the subtly threatening way that an umbrella appears in the river. If he makes a mistake or acts in the wrong way, he's a dead man.But what I like most about the film is the ending. All through the second half of the film, Fitzcarraldo gets distracted by this insane goal of pulling a boat up a hill so that he can get the rubber trees and make money enough to build an opera house. You kind of feel like he's losing his way \u0096 Indians get killed pulling the boat up and he plays up to the Indian's idea of him being some sort of god. But then just as he's got the boat over the hill and he's in sight of achieving his goal, everything goes wrong. After a celebration, and in the dead of night, the boat is cut loose and it flows down the river and into the rapids with him sound asleep in it. What follows is an insane piece of film-making \u0096 Herzog actually filmed Kinski and his crew on the boat while going through a treacherous stretch of river \u0096 and the boat crashes into cliff walls and spirals totally out of control. It seems like all hope is lost; they might die and they have no rubber. But somehow they survive unscathed (unlike the film crew who got injured filming the scene). And then Herzog pulls something of a masterstroke. Instead of having a despairing ending with a man defeated, he has Fitzcarraldo fulfil his dream, albeit on a smaller scale. He has Fitzcarraldo load up his battered boat with opera singers and musicians and he then has them take their music up river. It's a beautiful scene, and Kinski's large smile as he puffs on a massive cigar, and as he waves to the local children and the pig, is the icing on the cake. He climbed a mountain, he fulfilled his dream of bringing opera to the jungle and he didn't lose himself in the process.",

It's the early 1900s and there's a rubber boom. To fund his dream he decides to exploit a considerable area of rubber trees growing beyond the impassable Ucayali Falls. To get to this remote area he incredibly has his steamboat lifted over a hill from another branch of the Amazon with the assistance of notorious headhunters. Claudia Cardinale plays his girlfriend, a successful brothel owner.Werner Herzog's \"Fitzcarraldo\" (1982) is superior to his \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\" (1972), which was shot in the same general area, the Amazon basin east of the Andes Mountains. It's longer by just over an hour, but it has a more compelling story. \"Aguirre\" influenced Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979) but \"Apocalypse Now\" likely influenced \"Fitzcarraldo.\" The difference is that \"Apocalypse Now\" took advantage of its infamous setting, the Vietnam War, whereas few people know of the rubber boom of the early 20th century in the Iquitos area.There's also less thrills in \"Fitzcarraldo.\" It's more impenetrable and all-around curious, a cinematic oddity. Yet it has its highlights, including the core cast, i.e. the burly captain, the impressively hulking indigenous engineer and the drunkard cook. What's it all about?

This is only the second Herzog film I've ever seen, and my impressions of the first (\"Aguirre...\") definitely coloured my expectations for this, the penultimate Herzog/Kinski collaboration. I was wondering when the crew of the Molly Aida would start succumbing to dysentery and hallucinating, when the captain would catch a spear to the chest and when the drunkard cook would unceremoniously drown. Nothing like this happens. Ultimately, when the steamboat returns to great fanfare, triumphant and battered, to the point of its launch, I realised that \"Fitzcarraldo\" is the better film for this positivity.That Klaus Kinski is wonderful in this film cannot be overstated. He is constantly the centrepiece, and when he is off screen (which is rarely), the viewer is always anticipating his arrival in shot. His character, Brian Fitzgerald, is one of the most charismatic leads I've ever seen. His supreme confidence and authority never wavers, despite the warmth and fragility we see in the earlier scenes. He is always played with a strong, sympathetic humanity that never boils over into madness, despite the madness of the task itself - to hoist a steamboat over the Amazonian hillside and back down into a parallel river.Herzog assembled a film with many emblematic visual features, presumably for the purposes of enhancing the aesthetics. It works wonders, frankly, as I'm sitting here struggling to think of a gramophone, a white suit or a steamboat in any other context than in \"Fitzcarraldo\". It is set in the tropical heart of Brazil, and the crux of the plot is a daring and rather reckless plan to harvest the natural rubber from a region considered completely inaccessible. The profits from this would then go towards building a venue in the Amazon for the performance of Fitzgerald's favourite music - opera. Bizarre concept for a movie, right?Despite some clunky dubbing and a few supporting performances that look about fifteen years behind (stopping me from awarding it a 9), this strange premise is very successfully realised by Herzog's full-scale immersion into the daunting, endless and unreal rainforest. As soon as the boat sets off, the film kicks into gear. We are treated to a long succession of very beautifully composed shots as Fitzgerald and company plunge through the jungle in their majestic white 19th Century vessel.I don't want to reveal too much to those who have not yet seen this film, so I'll spare this review any further plot points. \"Fitzcarraldo\" should be seen for Kinski's defining performance, the superb visual touches that colour its best scenes, and for the sheer spectacle. It is undoubtedly a fine, grand movie in which all events orbit around, and gravitate towards, the central character himself.",

Herzog took a snippet of a true story and fictionalized it. Because of this it fails as it unfolds, unless I've missed something--they cross the mountain for the purpose of being below the rapids and in his section of land that he can harvest rubber on. But instead he ends up set going through those very rapids. Why would that be? Were there MORE rapids? Another failure of the film was Herzog's complete ignorance of opera. This could have been beautifully incorporated by using operatic segments (complete with subtitles) that paralleled the events unfolding or contrasted them. Our main character's story could have played out like an opera story, but Herzog didn't do his research. Dreary!",

            "content": "If there was ever a film that captured the madness of one filmmaker and summed up his notorious obsession with translating crazy stories onto the big screen, that film would be Fitzcarraldo, and that director would be Werner Herzog. Made in 1982, and competed at Cannes, where Herzog was awarded Best Director for this incredible endeavor, Fitzcarraldo tells the tale of one man who dreams of building an opera house in the middle of the jungle. That man is Brian Fitzgerald, played by the enigmatic and screen-stealing Klaus Kinski.In order to fund his opera house, Fitzgerald buys a steamship so that he could sail upstream along the Amazon River to reach a forested area that has been inaccessible to Man for centuries. That area contains millions of rubber trees that could be tapped, which could earn him a fortune. Fitzcarraldo follows Fitzgerald as he journeys deep into the heart of nature, chasing a dream that is just as wild as the environment he has thrust himself in. He encounters a hundred odd native Indians along the way, piquing their curiosity with his large steamship, and later enlisting their labour to carry out an absolutely crazy plan.Fitzgerald's plan is to drag his steamship, all thirty tones of it, over a steep hill from one river to another. Very remarkably, Herzog filmed this entire sequence without the aid of visual effects. As a result, it remains to be one of cinema's most jaw-dropping scenes, a technical achievement rarely equaled and almost impossible to emulate by anyone whose sanity is still intact. Herzog's camera captures this incredible sequence with documentary-like realism; one can hear the rumbling and creaking, and feel the tension in the ropes as they pull the massive man-made beast over difficult terrain.Another sequence that is every bit just as suspenseful shows the steamship colliding with rocks, as rapids force it to float dangerously fast downstream. Herzog's mastery of his environment, in this case, the natural environment, is his strongest attribute. Despite shooting in a hostile location, facing insurmountable physical challenges, and being notoriously over-demanding on the cast and crew, he manages to complete the film, which is already a feat in itself. In Fitzcarraldo, Kinski grounds his character in reality with a performance that is much less exaggerated (and powerful) than his starring role in Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972), but with more subtlety to match his character's eccentricity.Filled with absurdist situational humor \u2013 one bizarre moment sees Fitzgerald playing Italian opera on his Victrola on top of his floating ship as he tries to drown the sounds of tribal drumming and chanting during the journey upstream, Fitzcarraldo however feels slightly uneven in terms of pacing. There are uninteresting, sporadic moments with the natives on board the ship that drag along, stagnating the narrative. But fortunately, for most parts, Herzog's film is quite engaging, and at times, the stunning visuals grip you and become etched in your mind.Fitzcarraldo is not Herzog's greatest film, but it is arguably his greatest feat as a filmmaker. There is no single non-CGI image as awe-inspiring in 80s cinema as the dragging of a steamship across steep land. And to the sounds of Caruso playing on the Victrola.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",

            "content": "This film has a prologue about the jungle. The main part of the film starts with the opera house in Manaus, where to Fitzcarraldo, played by Klaus Kinski, and his girl friend Molly, played by Claudia Cardinale, hurry in a small boat. Fitzcarraldo wears an impressive hat. Bytheway, in this film the hats add a certain playful element to the whole story. It's also an interesting detail that Fitzcarraldo always wears a white suit, an old one probably but always recognizably white. Though they are late and have no tickets they are allowed to go inside after Molly's comment: \"He has no ticket, but he has a right.\" The opera performed is \"Ernani\" by Verdi. The last scene of the film is also a scene from the opera \"I Puritani\" by Bellini, performed on a big boat (a steamboat)with Fitzcarraldo as a director of this performance. The question is: why has the director (also the writer and the producer) Werner Herzog chosen these two operas? Without a better explanation i assume that the development of the story plot goes toward the happy end (in \"Ernani\" the main hero dies, in \"I Puritani\" he survives). At the beginning of the film the fate of a passionate opera lover, an inventor and an adventurer is uncertain, he may go right to perdition with all his dreams, plans and obsessions. Yet he survives and even wins at the end of the film. Some commentators call Fitzcarraldo \"a madman\". But he is just a man with a dream. Let's have a dream, this makes life much more exciting. There is a remark on the IMDb site that Werner Herzog likes to show animals in his films. I found this quite interesting and watched the film from this point of view. There are following animals in the order of appearance: horses, drinking Champagne in front of the opera house, a parrot, a pig that is promised a seat the future opera house, a fish that swallows money, a white turkey in the jungle (appears when the rubber baron says to Fitzcarraldo: \"You are a strange bird, but somehow i like you.\", a young white cat at Molly's house and two snakes in the jungle. The best moments in the film are: Fitcarraldo comes into the opera with Molly, Fitzcarraldo shouting \"I want my opera house!\" on the top of the bell tower, Fitzcarraldo with his pals on the top of the tree in the jungle, Caruso's voice pacifying the Indians and the last scene when the opera is performed on the steamboat. This is an excellent cinema experience, one of my favorite films. Somehow it reminds me of Tarkovski's films, maybe because of the slow pace and a loving eye for the nature. Please, take your time and watch this film! I am sure you'll enjoy it.",

The story of a more-than-half-mad opera fanatic (played to perfection by Klaus Kinski) who's dream is to build an opera house in the Amazonian jungle. His plan is to exploit the only unclaimed region of rubber trees to get his venture capital. The only problem is the territory is unreachable by boat because of trecherous rapids. Fitzcarraldo has a blue-sky plan to get his ship to those trees, but when his crew deserts him, a stroke of native lore-based luck allows him to enlist a tribe of headhunters to haul his immense riverboat up and over a cliff between two rivers. Fitzcarraldo, his captain, engineer, and cook are particularly engaging characters of some idiosyncracy; actually all of the characters seem pretty idiosynchratic in this film. I found the incidental music to be well chosen and the cinematography to be first rate. My only complaint is that the film is 157 minutes in length and there were a number of  opportunities to trim the running time without sacrificing content.",

It's the story of an Irishman in the late nineteenth century who wants to share his passion for opera with the denizens of the Amazon by building them an Opera House to host the great Enrico Caruso. Because the film is incongruously dubbed in German, some of the natives can be jarringly heard speaking the language of Goethe and Mozart when presumably they should have been speaking Spanish or their own dialects.In the film's famous set piece, Fitzcarraldo, as played by Klaus Kinski, has to drag a steamboat from one river to another over a mountain. Wearing a white suit which remains remarkably clean despite the ubiquitous mud, he employs a tribe of natives who are so primitive they have no word in their language for ice. Nevertheless, under his supervision, they succeed in clearing a path through the thick trees and dense brush of the impenetrable jungle on the slopes of a mountain with nothing more than machetes, and then to haul the ship, they rig a system of winches, ropes, cables and pulleys so complex, the US Army Corps of Engineers could not have completed the project in a month. Yet Fitzcarraldo and his band of face-painted savages seemingly do so in a few days, if not overnight.Once back in the water, the boat barely survives a run of what looks like Class 4 rapids, and in the end is met by a gaggle of canoes, which suddenly materialize carrying no less than a formally dressed full orchestra, all their musical instruments (including kettledrums), huge stage props and elaborately costumed singers, who without further ado perform an opera on the deck of his steamboat for the titular ecstatic audience of one.Like I said, the dumbest movie ever made.",

There is a documentary by Herzog about his relationship with his screen nemesis and alter ego Klaus Kinzki, who plays the lead. He apparently got so cheesed off with Kinski's prima donna behaviour that he paid many of the local indians to assassinate him. Thankfully this didn't happen.

Keeping in mind how long this movie is, once it ended I felt like I just wasted 2 hours of life.And don't get me wrong. I am a fan of long and slow movies. My favorite movies is even A Ghost Story, a movie that has a 5 minute long pie eating scene. The difference though is that other slow movies usually make up for the slow pacing by being atmospheric and hitting you with very emotional scenes. This movie has none of that which mostly comes down to the directing.I like Werner Herzog, but this was not a well made movie. There were some great visuals and landscape shots. But that's the only thing I enjoyed. Other than that the filmmaking felt rather dull and lifeless.Last but not least, we need to talk about Klaus Kinski. He's a mad man and totally miscast. I know that he is a crazy person and a cultural phenomenon. And I always knew he could act. But his performance in this movie feels so out of place. There is no real change in his character or performance. Fitzcarraldo goes from a crazy sad person to a crazy happy person. How exciting! There is not a single moment of intimacy where the audience gets to know this character and to feel what he feels. Instead this character feels very distant which is why ended up not caring about his fate. An actor similar to Joaquin Phoenix could have given this character his much needed complexity.All in all, I don't understand why people like this movie.

Probably not nearly as far as Fitzcarraldo, or for that matter, Werner Herzog, but then again your dream probably isn't nearly as big as theirs.Fitzcarraldo thinks he is a God, and in order to do what he does, he needs to. He also thinks he is a good man, but unfortunately he is neither of those things. He has once before tried to build a railroad through the amazon, but was unsuccessful, showing that he couldn't overcome nature before. But he now has the dream of building an opera house in the jungle, since he seems to think that the opera is the key to happiness. He was in the ice business, showing he thinks he is a visionary, but in order to get the money to build his opera house, he needs to sell rubber, which would give him the most profit. How does he decide to do this? Well, he must pull a steamboat full of rubber over a mountain, of course.Fitzcarraldo is so obsessed with the idea of his opera house that he builds a pulley system in order to pull his steamboat up the mountain and uses Indians for his personal labor, as Werner Herzog did in the actual making of the film. This caused the death of several Indians, but Fitzcarraldo kept using the Indians, even after they left inexplicably and suddenly all came back at once and worked just as they did before. Of course, Fitzcarraldo pays when they end up going into the wrong part of the river because of the Indians (\"the ship must take the evil spirits out of the river\") and the ship gets smashed up. Fitzcarraldo manages to accomplish his dream of having an opera in the jungle on his beloved boat as his wife watches. But at what cost?It's a testament to the drive and ambition humans can possess, but also our selfishness, and complete disregard for others so we can accomplish our personal goals. We think we can do anything, that we have dominion over nature, but of course the river throws the boat around as if it's nothing, just after his accomplishment. But that doesn't stop us. The fact that Herzog actually did what we see in the film proves the film's point even more, and just as Fitzcarraldo reached his dreams, so did Herzog. And luckily, they were both recognized for their accomplishments, but the true reason they did all of this is for themselves. If it weren't for themselves they wouldn't have been able to do it in the first place.",

I loved it from the first time I saw it in its entirety, and I could understand the reasons that move Kinski to drag that ship up a mountain. The guy is bonkers, sure, but he is a lovable nut. The film is the story of a man with an inexhaustible willpower and a capacity for romantic dreams like no one else ever had and which move him to try to achieve the impossible. Fitzcarraldo is Herzog's alter-ego. When the director told his idea of actually dragging the ship up the mountain for real, many potential investors laughed at him and pulled out of the film, foreseeing only disaster. But the man got his way and made the film just the way he wanted to. I would have loved being there in the set just for the fun and the excitement of seeing a 300-ton boat being dragged over a mountain entirely by brute force. No one was killed in freak accidents during the entire shooting. The ship was dragged up the mountain and then let down again just like we see it in the film, and then it was let loose down the rapids as well. Three identical ships were used. Kinski's psychopathic behaviour reached such extremes that the Indian extras hired by Herzog, shocked by the sight of Kinski's schizophrenic explosions, offered Herzog to kill that raving maniac. Herzog turned the offer down, and he and Kinski would go to make one last film together after this one -Cobra verde. Fitzcarraldo is, undoubtedly, Herzog's greatest and craziest film, and probably Kinski's most famous role.",

That film is the highly rated \"Nosferatu The Vampyre\". I had heard about that film, and read some good and rave reviews about how great of an actor Kinski was/is, and what an amazing visionary and imaginative director that Herzog was/is. So, I was excited to watch the movie and be wowed, awed, and entertained. OMG, that vampyre film is atrocious, awful! It was not only one of the worst and boring vampire movies I've ever seen, but the acting was not worthy even of a good high school theater student. The cinematography had some nice scenes, but photography type images do not a motion movie make, nor can it save an overall very badly created film. And, the horrible audio must be some highly loved Herzog quirk as it rears it's awful sonic disaster coupled with being out of sync with the actors lips. That audio mess lives in both Herzog's vampyre movie as well as in Fitzcarraldo.Fitzcarraldo starts out slow and boring and remains slow and boring while adding viewer frustration at it's uneven pacing, complete lack of character building, and of course that atrocious audio. As with Herzog's awful vampyre movie, I found myself astounded and amazed that there are so many people out there who actually think Kinski is a \"great\" actor after seeing him in this movie. Just as bad and astounding is that those same people are so astounded and amazed and in love with Herzog's quite amateur and boorish movie making. I approached both of these movies with a VERY open mind that was initially salted by some glowing commentary and reviews about how wonderful, amazing, and awesome both Kinski and Herzog are/were at their craft. So I was open to enjoying their films and potentially becoming a fan. Well, that's never going to happen.NO WAY! What in the world are all of these fans of Kinski and Herzog talking about? Where is this amazing acting? Where is this astounding, excellent director and movie maker? The only thing that has any interest what so ever in either of these films is some decent scenes that would be better served in the photograph medium. Kinski's \"acting\" in Fitzcarraldo is only every so slightly \"better\", if that word can even apply to such horrid acting, than Kinski's acting in Nosferatu The Vampyre. Very much like Kinski's vampyre his portrayal of fitzcarraldo is also quite weak, meek, inconsistent, and given with semi whispery speech and tone. The spoken audio delivery is made all the worse by the AWFUL out-of- sync audio recording. The full blame on that can be put right on and rightfully so on the director, Herzog is his name. How in the world would any director with a modicum of self respect for himself and his audience ever allow such awful audio work to masquerade as professional in a film that people pay real money to see.BTW, also I watched \"Stroszek\" last night just to double check my opinion about Herzog. The movie \"Stroszek\" is actually rated a bit higher than either his vampyre and Fitzcarraldo movies. \"Stroszek\" held a bit more of my interest as the main characters were at least somewhat interesting and amusing. Yet still, if you have nothing better to do on a cold, gray, and snowing Saturday morning, DO NOT watch any of these 3 movies. Do yourselves a favor and perhaps cut your nails, darn some old socks, pick lint from your belly button, or anything else so mundane as it will be more rewarding and your time better spent than watching any of those Herzog movies.After having watched 3 of Herzog's highly acclaimed and rated moview, I have NO IDEA how Herzog and Kinski ever attained the high praise they have been given.
