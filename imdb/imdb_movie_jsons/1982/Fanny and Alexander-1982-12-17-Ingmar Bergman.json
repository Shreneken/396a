            "review_title": "(review of the 5-hour cut) A total, un-abashed work of art that you'll love or hate. I loved it, and it's likely one of the great epics I'll ever see",
            "content": "As Ingmar Bergman's \"swan song\" (which wasn't necessarily the case once After the Rehearsal and the recent Saraband were released), Fanny and Alexander was a film I saw many months ago, in its truncated, 3-hour version. I knew I had witnessed something special, something life-affirming, and above all a work that contained enough poetry, passion, and humanity for two movies. But I also felt as if there was something missing here and there. So, once the complete TV version was released, as with Scenes from a Marriage, I jumped at the opportunity to view it in its entirety. Broken up here into 5 Acts, Bergman takes another semi-autobiographical approach to his storytelling, and it's a sumptuous tale of a turn of the 20th Century family (the Ekdahls, comprising of Oscar and Emilie, the parents, Fanny and Alexander, the kids- Alexander being mostly the driving force behind the story- and also the other relatives Carl and Gustov Adolf, brothers of Oscar, Helena, Alma, Lydia, and also the housemaid Maj) who own a theater company.What makes Fanny and Alexander work as a major achievement, if anything else for my money is that all the elements seem balanced out over the acts, with story and characters, each sharply defined. The first act unfolds with attention to the little details and the more prevalent ones in a family gathering. A key speech made by Oscar is a haunting bit of foreshadowing before they set off for the family dinner. This scene, involving more or less two dozen people, is sometimes very funny, sometimes a little unnerving, and towards the end depressing. But scenes such as these reveal how wonderful and exciting Bergman can be with his material and actors- despite it taking place in 1907, you can see these people in modern settings just as easily. There's also the scene involving Oscar with his children before they go to sleep, in which he tells them a story, which ranks as one of the more memorable, touching scenes of the film - from here, we can understand how this brings to Alexander (Bertil Guve, in a performance that is touching by being so straightforward with the innocence of child-hood) to the state he's in for much of the rest of the picture.Then the second and third acts come around, and the tragedy unfolds as penetrating as I've seen in any film, much less from Bergman. It wouldn't spoil it to say that Oscar succumbs to an illness, and passes away. From here, Emilie (Ewa Fr\u00f6ling, a performance meant for Liv Ullman, which she fits just as well) tries to go on as usual, and it just doesn't feel the same. She seeks counsel from the village bishop, Edvard Vergerus (Jan Malmsjo, previously in Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage), and subsequently falls in love with him, or at least thinks she does. They get married, and the children are forced into leaving (almost) everything behind to live at his dreary, caged residence, a far cry from where they once lived, a place lush with colors and life in the rooms. Both of these assets are provided by an Oscar winning production design team, and the foundations of how these two, including as well the theater, display how period-perfect some of this can be.The last two acts are when things get rough, which is a standard Bergman is known for. This kind of standard, if I could call it such, includes his personal connection to the Christian church, in particular with his father being a Lutheran priest. I'm not guessing on how fact based Bishop Vergerus is to Bergman's life, and I really don't want to either. One of the things I loved about the film (than some likely hated on it's original release- I know, for example, that my father was devastated after watching this film) is how the good and the bad, or what could be seen as good and bad, are paired off, and how the middle-ground is just as clear or un-clear. Emilie is a good person, wanting the best for her children and for herself, but she doesn't know how to do that without someone to bring guidance when she cannot after grieving for her dead husband (who appears sometimes to Alexander, which is another matter). Alexander, who is a child raised with all the enthusiasm to express himself as such by his uncles and particularly his theatrical father Oscar, is good but lending himself to not being too firm on what's real and what is not. The Bishop, on the other hand, is one who, as he says at one point \"has only one mask\". His is a puritanical approach, who sees imagination in only one strict aspect, and has terms of love that are by his code of living and understanding of people. Veregus, along with his family that live in fear and suffering (Harriet Andersson's character, and with the character of the heavy, ill aunt), know little is anything about how the Ekdahls have lived. What ends up happening, even from the get-go of the third act, in the fourth and fifth acts Bergman reveals Bishop Veregus to be an immense antagonist, one that allows just enough sympathy in one or two spots to not throw something at the TV, but with the kind of language that only the most terrifying of movie characters possess. Bottom line, this character, whether you like the film or not, is one of Bergman's greatest creations, and is pulled off by Malmjso with icy, disturbing perfection; it's one of the most memorable of the kind in film I can think of, right up there with Nurse Ratched, HAL 9000, and Darth Vader.But what torment and anguish the characters, as well as much of the audience, seem to endure in the fourth/fifth acts; there also comes revelatory moments of sheer beauty and enchantment. A couple of scenes involving Alexander in the puppet shop, for example, display a level of artistry that goes between Bunuel and Disney. And a particular, long soliloquy by Isak (Erland Josephsson, not under-used at all) to the children is a poem unto itself that gives me an idea that Bergman had he not gone into theater and film, would've been one of the great poets of the 20th century. As the catharsis comes, it comes with a kind of justice that works in the only way it satisfyingly could have. With the fates of the Bishop, Emilie, and Alexander and Fanny brought to a close, as with the Grandmother, the uncles and aunts, and so on, it's all very symbolic, metaphorical, and real, and it gels together.One last note- Sven Nykvist, who one his second Oscar with Bergman for this film, creates the kinds of shots that some could only have in their dreams. When he visualizes something for Bergman with the forces of light and dark, with the subtlety and nuance, it's all the better. To put this all in another way, I could go on and on about this huge, heart-rendering work, but it all comes down to this- as an emotional, intellectual, and spiritual (surprisingly for me, who sees religion as a kind of fantasy) sort of film-viewing experience, Fanny and Alexander is one of the most profound I've ever had. Some may feel the same; some may want to forget they ever experienced it. But one thing the film does is stick with you, if only for a little while, and that's really what a film can and should do....by the way, the 5-hour version, at least in America, is only available on a high-priced special edition DVD pack from Criterion, but for the viewer who's already a fan of the film, it makes for a great holiday gift.

            "review_title": "A Real masterpiece",
            "content": "SPOILER: Most of the ideas revealed through mystery by Bergman in Fanny och Alexander have already been addressed by others. The first time I saw this film was in 1984, on tv and with a much shorter version than the one released in England in 2002, which is the full 300-plus minute original.That day I was scared -really scared- watching the scene where Alexander is been helped to let out his most evil thoughts by Ishmael, a completely mysterious character with supernatural insight. And then, a blackout. You can imagine: if I was truly scared this left me breathless.Then, almost twenty years passed until I found this remarkable jewel, in its full version, perfectly digitised and audio-enhanced in dvd. I bought a dlp projector and used a previewing room to show it to my students. I didn't know what was going to happen. But that doubt was worth the waiting.I think it's very difficult to say any other thing than breathtaking to underline what this film accomplishes. It's the reflected work of years of understanding and hard work between Bergman and Nyvqvist. One of the most powerful, beautiful, fearful and perfect films of all times. An exaggeration, like. Yes, but I think that there are no words to explain how plainly perfect this work is. The way it was written. The way it was directed. The way it was lighted. The way it was designed. The way each and every character plays his or her role. The details -not a Bergman's new- to which they paid the most dedicated attention to. The luxurious use of available light. The setting of the story. The amazing locations. Everything in this film was perfectly studied, down to the colour shifts that would take place in every shot!, forget about whole scenes!The troubling minds of all those characters whose lives are at crossroads. The powerful and eventful lives of just one familiy. The small and big affairs that affect them. Gratitude and hate. Honour and shame. Guilt and love. Fear and joy. Selfishness and generosity. Every long scene exudes with tension, pure fun or pleasure; with increasing uneasiness and abrupt changes of demeanor. With a richness that could only be found where a very skillful eye -trained to see what most disregard as common- finds beauty and harmony. And a sound that is as exhilarating as the narrative depiction.When the maxim of making \"every frame a Rembrandt\" comes to my mind, this film makes me think Bergman pushed the envelope a little further: he gives (or I'd rather say, Nyvqyst) the tratment of Van Der Meer or Bosch or Cezanne or Michelangelo to some scenes. (Think the kids playing at the nursery, the housemaidens sewing socks, the meadow and the boat, the transfixing scene of Alexander in the attic with his mother).And a story told from the eyes of two kids worth a ton of gold. Alexander's (Bertil Guve, when he was twelve-thirteen) enormously powerful and convincing role can certainly be compared to any big-theatre-role actor.Superb. Don't think you've seen the whole thing until you get the 5  hour full-story.",

            "content": "Fanny and Alexander (1982) **** (out of 4) The first two words that popped into my mind as the end credits rolled was masterpiece and epic but in some ways I think both of those words are too small to give proper credit to this film. Originally this was meant to be Bergman's swan song and while I would have been a great film to go out on, I'm glad he eventually returned to the director's chair a couple times. This film, running nearly five hours in its complete form, is certainly one of the most beautiful movies that I've ever seen. The technical side of things are downright brilliant but the incredible screenplay and performances make this one of the greatest achievements ever captured on film. The screenplay offers up so much detail and so much thought on so many topics that it's hard to really make your mind up about the film but I'm sure this is the type of movie that a hundred people could watch and they'd all walk away with different feelings and emotions about what it all meant.For me personally, I think the film is about everything possible, from life to death to love to religion and most importantly to imagination. The movie tackles all sorts of subjects, which were very familiar to Bergman and that's why I'd call this a greatest hits type of packaging from the director. We have issues dealing with death, which we saw in Cries and Whispers. We have the ideas of religion and what it means via his trilogy including Winter Lights. We have ideas of the theater, which the director hit upon in many of his overlooked gems from the 1970's. We also have the beauty of life and love, which we've seen several times from the master.On the technical side of things there's a lot to admire here. The visual look is quite striking and breathtaking especially the early sequences with the frozen river. The love how the first third of the movie, with the family together, is shown in very rich and vivid colors that really brings out a warm feeling of family and comfort. The middle stuff with the bishop changes to pale colors, which really brings out the coldness of all the characters during this time. We then shift to the grandmother's house, which is full of spring like colors, which offer up a sense of safety. The cinematography by Sven Nykvist really is something to watch as he perfectly captures every mood, feeling and thought going on within the film. He, like the director, was already considered a master by the time this film was released and this movie just adds to his legendary status.The performances are among some of the greatest I've ever seen. I think the standout performance of the film belongs to Jan Malmsjo as the evil bishop. If this isn't one of the greatest villains in film history then I'm not sure how you would define the term villain. What really impressed me about Malmsjo is his utter coldness whenever he talks, walks or whenever we simply see him thinking. The boy-faced nature on the outside also makes us, at times, feel for him and want to like him but that coldness and evilness is always right there to remind us what a snake he is. Jarl Kulle is also worth pointing out as the loverboy/brother who has a terrific scene where he squares off against Malmsjo in an attempt to get the children back. The outright anger and frustration the actor shows in this scene is very chilling and one can't help but understand and feel everything he's doing. Ewa Froling is also terrific as Emile and the strength she brings to her character ranks this as one of the greatest performances I've seen from any actress. Bertil Guve is also worth mentioning as Alexander. He doesn't have too much to say but it's rather amazing how much Bergman got out of the young actor just by his facial gestures and body movements.The screenplay is another thing as beauty as, for the most part, we get all dialogue but the dialogue is so well written that all of the heart, sadness and fear comes from it. There are some rather hard to watch scenes including one involving a cane, which is used to beat on of the children. I couldn't help but jump every time the cane hit the body because the screenplay sets up the evilness of the bishop so well that this scene contains alternate emotions. We also have great talk about the meaning of fact and an illusion, which includes talk of actors and how they react to real situations. There's also a great conversation about the Jewish family, being magicians and what effect this has on their theories of God. Then, there's the religious aspect, which Bergman once again attacks with questions and thoughts about the truth behind a higher being. In reality, I believe this film is about the two kids but mainly everything is seen through the eyes of Alexander. All of the subjects hinted at and talked about throughout the film are from a child's eyes and this is something brave to try from Bergman. The honesty and wild wonder of a child's questions are really, to me, what this film is all about and it's brilliantly done by the great director. There are even sequences with Alexander seeing ghosts with a running theme of if he is really seeing them or if they are just in his head.What's most amazing is that the film runs five hours yet there isn't a single second of the film where the viewer can get bored. There's so much drama, pain, laughter and fears that this carries the film the entire running time and I really wish the film had gone on another five hours.",

            "content": "\"Fanny and Alexander\" (1982) was announced at the time of its release as Ingmar Bergman's swan song, his last film for the big screen. It is his most optimistic and enchanting blend of romance, tragedy, comedy, fantasy, and mysticism. Set in Sweden in the beginning of the 20th century, the film follows the lives and adventures of two children, brother and sister Fanny and Alexander Edkahl.I love Bergman in every mood and in every genre - I love him dark, bleak, harrowing (\"Shame\"), mysterious (\"Persona\"), merciless and devastating (\"Scenes from a Marriage, \"Face to Face\", \"Autumn Sonata). I love his lighter, smiling side (\"Wild Strawberries\", \"Smiles of a Summer Night). Even for a master of Bergman's powerful talent, \"Fanny and Alexander\" is extraordinary - a profound film which is also one of his most accessible works.Pablo Picasso said once, \"When I was 9 years old, I could paint like Rafael; as an adult, all my life I tried to learn how to paint like a child\". In his final film, one of the greatest masters of dark and sometimes morose psychological studies looks at the world with a child's eye. The words he chose to finish his film with reflect the hope, the happiness and the magic that can be fully felt only in one's childhood: \"...Anything can happen, anything is possible. Time and space do not exist. ..On a flimsy ground of reality, imagination spins out and waves new patterns.\" --- August Strindberg's introductory notes for A Dream Play.",

But Fanny och Alexander is a splendid production, beautifully made, so superb it even evokes feelings of having come from a novel. Excellent characterization throughout, all the way down the cast, lending that magic touch to the costuming of the early 1900s. Mesmerising throughout, the film is not a single minute too long. The development of the story-line is superbly handled in an absorbing and coherent manner, manifesting the great empathy between director and actors. If the cinematography is visual poetry, the script is philosophical and full of awareness or consciousness of things in life, but not at a pretentious, abstract and theoretical level, but at a real human dimension.If you only have 10 videos in your collection, Fanny och Alexander should be one of them. My vote is a bit higher than the IMDb average.\nThese comments refer to the 3-hour version.",

            "review_title": "Bergman's ultimate best",
            "content": "Swedish director Ingmar Bergman has a reputation for dark, intellectual and introspective dramas, which is only partly justified because many of his early movies were rather light-hearted. Here is the longest movie he did (three hours), and the theatrical version is only half of the original which was twice as long. But length should not stop you from watching this jewel of a film, which is both complex and accessible. After all, \"Gone with the Wind\" is just as long.\"Fanny and Alexander \"isn't exactly a family movie, but it is a movie about family. Family seen in all its different facets through the eyes of two children. The film is divided into three very different parts, each of them showing a different aspect of family life. It is set in Uppsala, Sweden (Bergman's native city), at the turn of the twentieth century. The story begins on Christmas Eve, and we are plunged right away into a fairytale atmosphere.Fanny and Alexander\"s family seems a happy one, actually a family of theatre actors. During the Christmas Eve party held at the grandmother's heavily-furnished house, the atmosphere is joyful at first glance, especially for the children who obviously feel very much at home. But reality is not just what it seems. The children's father is seriously ill. One of the uncles is manic-depressive, and the other is a skirt-chaser who has an affair with the young maid while his wife shows a lot of comprehension. Even the grandmother keeps a secret affair with a Jewish banker (played by Erland Josephson, a Bergman regular) that has lasted for many years.The children's world collapse as their father dies. Soon after, their still young and beautiful mother marries the bishop, whose name is Vergerus (that's the name of the villain in all Bergman's movies, don't ask me why). The atmosphere in the bishop's house could not be more different from the children's first home. It is bare, silent, freezing. Alexander and the bishop hate each other from the start. This hate culminates when the bishop flogs Alexander to punish him, during a suffocating scene. War is declared from then on. Although the children's mother is pregnant, she already regrets her second marriage and seeks help from her former family.The grandma's Jewish friend, who is also sort of a magician, manages to kidnap the children by a clever stratagem. They are sheltered in his house, which is full of puppets and mysterious objects. There, a strange nephew of his lives in seclusion (the role is played by a woman). From then on, reality and fantasy get blurred, but what is certain is that the evil bishop meets a cruel fate, and the children's mother finally makes it back to her former home.The film ends as it began, with a party. Two new babies are just born : the mother's baby she had from the wicked bishop, and the maid's baby with the luscious uncle. The two of them are accepted immediately as part of the family, which is a rather precocious sign of Scandinavian open-mindedness (in 1900, illegitimate children were generally rejected as bastards).Despite the title, attention is focused much more on Alexander than on Fanny. She is there all the time but speaks little, while showing unconditional solidarity with her brother. A possible reason is that the movie seems to have strong autobiographical elements, more than any other Bergman, and if so, Alexander seems to incarnate Bergman himself as a child. Bergman's father happened to be a minister, and the director confessed that he was raised in a very oppressive manner. Thus, it is quite possible that Alexander's step family is a representation of Bergman's real family, while Alexander's real family is the family Bergman had dreamed of, unsurprisingly a family of actors.This film also displays the most accomplished use that Bergman's renowned photographer Sven Nykvist ever made of color. He was a long time reluctant to color and kept shooting in black and white well into the sixties. Bergman's first color movies had nothing special, until \"Cries and whispers\" where an obsessive use of red started to appear. The color contrasts are very strong in \"Fanny and Alexander\", and are especially used to underline the difference between the grandmother's colorful home and the bishop's house which is mostly all black and white.There are many characters in this story, and all the major adult roles are played by actors who are all very famous in Sweden. There is a special appearance by Harriet Andersson, who played the female lead in many Bergmans of the fifties, especially well remembered as the whimsical \"Monika\". Here, she is ungratefully cast as the bishop's elderly tormented servant who likes scaring the children with horror stories. As for the young maid, she is played Pernilla Wallgren, who married Danish director Bille August and became later famous as Pernilla August. She played the lead in \"The best intentions\" directed by Bille August but based on a script by Bergman, and also taking place in Uppsala at the turn of the twentieth century...",

Ingmar Bergman with his cinematographer Sven Nyqvist has made a gorgeous looking film, the art and set direction is exemplary.The film is set in a Swedish town in the early years of the 20th Century. The focus is on the Ekdahl household, a theatrical and gregarious family, there is warmth and bawdiness.Fanny and Alexander have a seemingly idyllic family life but things change when their father Oscar dies from a stroke. Now the children become more important in the film, almost soon their mother Emilie marries the Bishop Edvard, who lives an austere lifestyle with his family. The children are not happy under this stern household which is a contrast to the warmth and love that had previously existed.In its kernel, the film is not that far departed from David Copperfield. The priest is really Mr Murdstone, who has charmed the beautiful widow but has a heart of darkness that Alexander immediately senses. As Edvard cannot gain the children's respect he becomes a brute. The film also borrows from magical realism especially in the latter part as a Jewish family comes to the rescue of the children and revenge is taken against Edvard who refuses to let their mother go.The film is leisurely paced, the second half is more interesting plot wise, although you end up shouting at the screen at Emilie. Why does she want to marry so soon and accepts Edvard's conditions. She really did not care for her children's well being at all and puts them all at risk.In some ways this is Bergman's most accessible film, light and darkness but it is also too long, even self indulgent.",

            "content": "The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Persona and Cries and Whispers are all wonderful films(The Magic Flute is also very interesting), and Fanny and Alexander is up there as one of Ingmar Bergman's best films. As ever with Bergman it is incredibly well-made, the scenery is sumptuous and you can see just looking at the film why Sven Nykvist's cinematography won an Oscar, every frame is beautifully and atmospherically composed. The sparsely-used score is likewise effective, pleasant to listen to as well as fitting well with each scene. The direction as you'd expect with Bergman is superb, even if Fanny and Alexander is perhaps different from Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries in the themes it explores and with not as much visual imagery, it all feels well-paced that I never felt myself getting bored throughout the three-hour running time. The script is thought-provoking, and the acting makes the most of their sharply defined characters, Allan Edvall's Oscar and Bertil Guve's Alexander in particular are very moving. The atmosphere Fanny and Alexander also compels you in, right from the fairy-tale cosy like feel of the start of the film at Christmas to the scary and frightening scenes with Ishmael. The story, told through the eyes of Alexander as he encounters his oppressive father, his god-fearing mother and the loving family he has, is powerful, touching and sometimes frightening. Bergman even includes some autobiographical elements that makes Fanny and Alexander all the more fascinating. In conclusion, a wonderful captivating film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Fanny and Alexander isn't utterly terrible. I enjoined parts of the film very much and thought I'd gotten the hang of it on several occasions. However, the film has several peculiarities that make me question Bergmans talent for composing a unity. The whole film seems to be merely a series of loosely connected scenes. Is Bergmans ambition to make a realistic portrayal of the times (the beginning), a lascivious farce (the erotic adventures of Gustav Adolf), an artistic endeavour to portray children's odd fantasies and views of the illogical adult world (the end)? For me, Bergman seems to fail completely in composing a cohesive film.The big interest in the film lies on the personalities of the characters, and Bergman does succeed in portraying the bigger part of them credibly (Alexander, Carl, Oscar, the bishop). However, illogical characteristics of other characters make me doubt Bergmans understanding of the human nature. For example: Gustavs wife lets Gustav play around with other women without feeling jealousy. This could work if only the film in the whole would aim on being a farce or allegory of sexual oppression of women. In the context of the rest of the film, however, these details spoil the credibility of the film as a character study.In the case of the bishop Bergman seems to rely on insufficient reasons for making him appear as such a beast of a man. Why does Emelie suddenly start hating her husband so passionately? He is slimy and idealistic but nonetheless the same man with whom she originally fell in love. Bergman doesn't motivate these feelings, and for me, paradoxically, the bishop appears to be the true victim - haunted by an ignorant director. As far as the bishop's injustice is concerned I take it that spanking wasn't uncommon in those days. Nevertheless, Emilies hate becomes known already before the punishing.Also, I couldn't really comprehend the poetic and incredible ending. Later, I read on the internet how to interpret the scene where Isak comes to save the children. Putting this scene in the context of the rather realistic earlier parts of the film, it seems to me far-fetched that Isak should have conjured the children in the chest invisible and at the same time made their bodies show up in their room to convince the bishop he wasn't taking them anywhere.Considering these confusing aspects of the film I wonder how much was cut from the original five-hour film. On the other hand, it is self-evident that skillful cutting and planning plays an important part when rating a film. Fanny and Alexander should be understandable without having to see any edited scenes. Regardless of what is said above, I refuse to believe that the whole film-loving world could have been fooled to like Fanny and Alexander. I must have missed the point somewhere on the way. Maybe the film needs a second chance.",

I also found Emilie, the mother, not very admirable. Alexander is spoiled and cynical, and then all those pompous, amoral relatives. Then it dawned on me. Bergman is just showing us a slice of life. We don't need to admire them, but rather be entertained by their woven tapestry. It is a big, powerful, haunting film, with some of the most wonderful cinematography I've seen, Nyquist at his best. The story delves into the supernatural and leaves many questions unanswered. The decadence continues and the family remains, but so do the ghosts. After viewing the trilogy: the Bergman angst-athon, this was refreshing, though many of the same themes are there. They are just presented in a different way.",

            "content": "This is Ingmar Bergman's semi-autobiographical Life and Times of wealthy theater family Ekdahl in 1907 Uppsala, mainly told from the eyes of young Alexander as his mother is widowed, remarries a harsh bishop, and moves into his church estate with both the children. A fairly gripping saga, gorgeously photographed and sumptuously produced, with marvelous performances from Malmsj\u00f6 and W\u00e5llgren... but mostly a more artistic gem to admirably behold rather than be moved by and involved in. Considered a masterpiece by many, not by me. Why?Well, I caught the 188 min' version, and many bits - although enjoyable on their own, such as Kulle's monologues and erotic shenanigans - seem to be from completely different films altogether in tone, patched up to a big quilt with unfitting seams, in contrasting the children's ghastly torment of their stepfather (Alexander's head-to-head battles of will with him IS a highlight), with the unrelated, more easy-going content from the family's head estate. The relatives fates from the first act are unresolved and completely detached from the remaining main story: Emilie, her failed re-marriage and the children's struggle. They all honestly don't evoke terribly much emotional sympathy because we don't really get to know them; for example, Alexander misses his dead father and hates his stepfather... and that's basically all. And we also really have no other sign of the family's togetherness than their spoken confirmations, which contribute to this film's most disjointed, highly inconsistent feel with quite a few leaps in the storyline. Perhaps the TV-series version is more cohesive?Bergman's love for the theater is of course ubiquitous, both in establishing the family's relation to it, as well as much of the overly theatrical acting/line delivery, heavily metaphysical & religious symbolism and solemn theme presentation (with a nod to August Strindberg at the end). That style blend is of course a matter of preference, and I'm not a huge fan of it, presented this way (NOTE: this is my third Bergman altogether). And one major question truly arises: where the hell is Fanny in this movie? A character with her name in the title, has no impact on anything whatsoever in a story spanning 3 hours... how can that be? 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",

After all, the fans will always stick by you.Fanny and Alexander, Bergman's farewell to the cinema (in more ways than one since it was made for television) is a problematic film - it is a well crafted work, but undistinguished, not nearly as great as some of his past achievements. Can one blame him? Not really - nobody hits a home run every time at bat.Fanny and Alexander is a long (over 3 hours) Dickensian period piece that lacks much of the trademark Bergman touches. It's well made, but not significantly different from many historical melodramas and made-for-TV mini-series' that were the hallmark of U.S. broadcast television in the 1980s. The story primarily deals with two young siblings and their trials and tribulations following the death of their father. Really it's mostly about the boy, Alexander, as his sister, Fanny is pretty much an ominpresent non-entity in the proceedings. There are also a lot of dead-end subplots featuring the children's aunts, uncles, and other relatives. And, save for a few detours into the metaphysical (mostly in the last 10 minutes), there is little to distinguish it from a run-of-the-mill Victorian soap opera.The cast - all of them - turn in fine performances, and while I can't really recommend this film whole-heartedly, I really can't knock it either.

            "content": "Perhaps the most impressive feature of this wonderful film is the humility with which its creator presents it to the world, as if it were no grander than the old-fashioned Nativity-play shown in the early scenes at the Theatre.     At the end of this experience - to term it with any mere technical tag, like 'movie', would be inadequate - Bergman's profoundly grown-up disillusionment has transformed into the pure spirituality of abnegation and acceptance. His intellectual pilgrimage, through possibly the greatest career in films, finds the director arriving back where he began, with the great simplicities of life. But there is a difference with his return, which is that his prodigality over the years has burnt the rage out of him, and finally allowed him to 'enjoy what may be enjoyed' (as one of the Ekdahls says), without further fretting over the puzzle of human existence. From all this human folly (he clearly feels) comes the only wisdom, which is - simply - to be human.     It is, indeed, a film like no other for allowing the pieces of experience to settle into their appointed places. There is a beautiful quality of selfless resignation, in this last of his works for cinema, which finally and forever excels the sadistic disciplines of The Bishop.\n     This perverted creature confesses, to the new wife whom he has lost, how it is impossible to 'tear off the mask' as it is 'burned into my face': He is become an authoritarian '... a rite, a law, a custom - not a man'. [Shelley] Having put the notional love of God before that of humankind, there is nowhere for his personality to be re-enacted in the bosom of any kindly recollections that will survive him. Except in that of Alexander/Bergman, where his two, each-in-their-own-way terrifying, fathers, both the White and the Black opposites of an imagination flickering with the director's haunted vision, will project forever onto his Cinematic arena of stark absolutes the inner strife where each of us is locked away, struggling to endure the turmoil of these eternally irreconcilable truths.\n     The White Knight and The Black Bishop: These are phantom moves in our great game with Death, and pieces that will be returned into play for as long as humanity continues. How like Chess Life is: Just a game we play, with arbitrary rules, and yet whose progress is of supreme and abiding concern to each and every one of us.     This great work is a monument to play, in all its senses, not least the play of light and the play of ideas, both equally insubstantial and yet the essence of reality, eloquent as the silence of a great, roofless Cathedral. Out of the Ruin of Faith, Bergman has wrought a Peace that passeth understanding. And it is in this ultimate by-passing of the relentless structures of intellect that Bergman finally achieves the resolution of his productive neuroses, in a truly magical film whose every phase is as inevitable as breathing, or the changeable and unimpeded weather.     As the grandmother reflects. at last, 'I don't want to put Life together anymore. I just leave it broken. Strangely, it seems better that way.'     Death, in the end, is not a calamity, but the choice of all who have truly known Life. In other words, to choose Life is to accept its Dark partner, Death. And to accept each as part of the family group, even though they seem complete misfits there.     The old lady, with Strindberg's Dream-play in her lap, knows at last that the whole history of her family is only a personal reverie. And yet how much more real it seems than her son Carl's immature and somewhat absurd, angst-ridden railings against 'cruel Fate'!     Had he only accepted his patient wife's gently sympathetic injunction to 'Never mind' the Professor would have been both wiser and happier, enduring with patient fortitude the oceanic inconsequentialities of life's real Mystery, and attending far less to the trivial pseudo-mysteries of his solipsistic men's club. All his morbid rationalising is precisely as much use in real life as the usual state of alcoholic befuddlement which is the only serious pursuit of this club.      Reason as befuddlement; The sleep of reason as deliverance. With saint-like humility, Bergman gives us back our ordinary human life, as he surrenders his exceptional life in films. But he knows that the ghost of this life will always be with us. His anguished worldliness will haunt us - as the Ghost of Hamlet's father must haunt Alexander - forever.",

Her use of expression and manners made me believe she was real and I wanted her to be MY grandmother. Her sons, daughter-in-laws and servants were also excellent. On the other hand, Fanny was practically absent from the movie and Alexander, at times, seemed like a zombie. I suspect it must be hard to direct and write for children, as their parts just didn't feel real to me. The evil Bishop and his family were well presented and I had no problems here. The only REAL problem I had was with the bizarre son of the Jewish man who rescued the children. He was kept locked away and was either some sort of psychopath or pedophile or witch--his part was so brief and poorly presented he was just a confusion. I know that Bergman likes occasional surreal touches but to me this just looks more like an omission versus a real attempt to challenge the viewer. I THINK Bergman was trying to imply that this man molested Alexander but whether or not this occurred it just didn't fit the film.One other gripe I had is that the film seemed a little too black and white in its presentation and seems to show a real bias on Bergman's part concerning traditional morality. The Ekdahl family is rather worldly (with son Carl's MANY sexual escapades and his family's tacit approval) and sweet AND the Bishop's family is stern, wicked and visually frightening.",

I saw the director's-cut version, over five hours. A little long, yes, and there is not much music, but it's not slow, like Tarkovsky's films can be. The opening is great, and the first act, the first one and a half hour, was the part I liked the very most. The realism is utter, so is the casting; the best acting I have seen in a Swedish film, it's amazing. I can't complain about any actor, they were all extremely good. So is the dialog. Alexander had a typical upper class look, so did his grandmother, who looked extremely fresh and healthy and beautiful, for her age. All together, the language and milieus are very credible. No over-colorful costumes and silly dialogs, that is such a frequent element nowadays in historical plays, especially from America. Bergman succeeds to capture the customs and behavior that were used (and to some extent still is used) within the Swedish upper class, as well as general Swedish customs and behavior. I know this, because I am familiar with it and have partly experienced it myself. The result is sometimes amazing. Bergman succeeds to capture the atmosphere of the old times, through language and decoration. The photo is at time dazzling; some scenes are identical to 19th century Swedish painting, and I get the thought that Bergman turned to these in search for the right setting of the film.\nUnlike early works by Bergman, which tend to be somewhat theatrical, the keyword here is realism, which I appreciate greatly. The actors manage, like I said, to speak and play in a way that I feel was customary at that period of time. It might be too much to claim this work to be a Swedish Tarkovsky film, but I sensed it had some philosophical material, and it is definitely thoughtful. Otherwise, I think it is worth watching for the acting and dialog alone.One of the best Swedish films ever made, and Bergman's best, in my opinion. (9/10)",

The attention to detail is gorgeous in the opulent scenes of the affluent family, though to be honest I would have been more interested in the story of one of the servants than these boorish wealthy people, each of whom is crude in their own way. The film makes comments about class in subtle and direct ways, and we're always aware of the emotional gulf that separates the rich and their help, even though some have been with them for 40+ years. It also makes comments about the patriarchy and men, as the male characters have a wide display of less than admirable characteristics - cruel, philandering, drunken, and lacking dignity or simple humanism. As one takes advantage of a young maid whose only protest is to naively ask him to not put her \"in the family way\", he comes after a single thrust and then seems to believe himself when he says \"lovely, wasn't it?\" Bergman is merciless in deflating the male ego.I liked the reflections on aging from the grandmother and matriarch (Gunn W\u00e5llgren) which were poignant, but my favorite part of the film was when young Fanny and Alexander must move into an austere household with their new stepfather. The environment is the polar opposite, and the emotional intensity is high when he proceeds to torture them mentally and physically, all in the name of a good, stern, proper upbringing. (And as an aside, how nice it was to see Harriet Andersson playing a maid in that household) The film also has a few moments of fantasy and the ghosts that inhabit Alexander's mind which are nice touches, and the scene he has with the locked away Ismael Retzinsky is fascinating. \"Perhaps we are the same person. Maybe there are no boundaries. Maybe we all flow into each other, boundlessly and magnificently,\" Ismael says.The overall message of the film, however, seems to be put in the hands of one of Alexander's uncles, who in a rambling soliloquy towards the end says \"Therefore, let us be happy while we are happy. Let us be kind, affectionate and good. It is necessary, and not in the least shameful to take pleasure in the joys of the little world.\" There's wisdom there, but I found it a little less interesting than some of the elements that had come before it, and kind of wish Bergman had pared this film down even more than what he did to squeeze it into 188 minutes.

The benevolent grandmother of the theatrical family who presided over this extravaganza was a reassuring presence. She possessed compassion and wisdom. The transition to the stark parsonage of the clergyman who became the stepfather was jarring. The narrow minded and suffocating atmosphere was a shock for the children and their mother. They hardly expected to be transported to such a dark place. The punishment the clergyman administered to Alexander was very powerful. It was clear that the boy had to come to terms with the presence of evil in the person of this man who represented a harsh and repressive form of Christianity. This film did not deliver in the way that Bergman's other movies did-using shorter stories, well defined characters, and crisp dialogue. Ultimately it is too overblown and lacking in focus.

It has glory and pain, close to perfect in most respects, all the ones that matter theatrically.It is ambiguous in its gloom, which removes it from the relentlessly depressing stuff that preceded it. It is richly constructed, with lots of folded levels with: plays about plays in several different ways.So why do I not rate it a \"must view?\" My glib answer, one I actually gave once, is that 1982 was a very good year for film and I only allow myself two from each year at the supreme level. Technically, those two I selected aren't as gloriously balanced in the dimensions this is.But they instead take us somewhere that is useful, that challenges. This is a ride to the moon in a comfortable tour bus. Those other two visit less sophisticated theatrical landscapes, but they do it on foot, engaged in the hot, sweaty and dangerous transport of ourselves.So I will tell you it is sublime in many ways and not very useful to building a real life in film.Bergman himself is in three characters here: the boy (as widely known), the magical Jew who makes the illusions that we believe to be real as the film, and the stern stepfather. There's too much of this last, too much of the bitterness he forces us to swallow by surrounding it with sweetness.So instead this comment is on the Jew's perspective, the kabbalistic folding of the thing.The Jew is a master puppeteer in two young guises, Aron and (female) Ismael who we learn have created all that proceeds or follows, perhaps. That is roughly framed as Hamlet's play within the play, during a rehearsal for which we witness the father play the ghost, then become the ghost. Later, he is replaced by the stepfather through a similar channel.(Remember Hamlet's qualms about killing his stepfather without allowing him to confess his sins.) The thing begins with young Hamlet (Alex) as the stagemaster, and at night the filmmaker, showing slides and illustrating the ghost story. Then life at grandma's house as theater. In fact, at all three houses as theater.If it were just the Jew Isak behind the illusions, weaving the structure, we'd have something with emotional kinematics.

            "content": "Scenes from the Ekdahl Saga. The last time I tried this epic I must have abandoned it after the prologue, because all I remember was the off- putting flatulence, which had stayed with me ever since. This time I made it through the full five hours, spread over two evenings, and I'm sad to say the result is an unsatisfied sense of emptiness.This is a very peculiar, confessional sort of performance, and I wish I could compare it with the three hour version. I should like to know what was cut out. It gives an impression of having been put together in a haphazard, arbitrary manner, as if the auteur couldn't decide what he wanted to say. A collection of family photographs dis-arranged in half a dozen old albums.The unfolding events are loaned some significance by the marked Shakespearian backbone. In what is evidently a semi-autobiographical account, Bergman/Alexander is given two, if not three, fathers: his actor-manager Hamlet-type ghost father, and his odious Claudius-type ersatz father, presumably modelled on his real, Puritanical father. This person's malignant ghost was also still around after his convenient demise by fire, plot-wise, apparently arranged by witchcraft. An Oedipal twist. The faded pageant of the Ekdahl theatrical family is definitely insubstantial, occasionally full of sound and fury, but basically of negligible meaning in the wider world. Could that be the film's message ? Its nearest Bergman relative is The Face (aka the Magician), a mysteriously underrated effort which was rejected for its Oscar nomination, but is one of the Swede's best, at least as good as The Seventh Seal. There is a lot of talk about masks in Fanny and Alexander, reminiscent of William's opinion that all the world is a stage. But Greek to many of us. After Shakespeare come Ibsen and Strindberg. Another kettle of fish.Two episodes puzzled me more than the rest, and I wonder if they were cut out of the three-hour version, or at least cut down. One is that in the Epilogue we are shown two babies, looking as if they were identical twins, side by side in closely juxtaposed cots, and identical baby trappings. Looked at from the other side, however, the cots are shown as distinctly separated, and Jarl Kulle, in his barmy emotional speech, only addresses his by-blow with his lame maid, whom for some reason he wants to set up in a coffee-shop, whereas she wants to run a milliner's of sorts. The other baby, nameless, must be Emilie's, by the bishop. Query ? It's a complete riddle to me why we are told any of this.The second peculiar event is the hysterical anti-semitic spasm, and most of the fifth act, which affects the repellent bishop, who parades as Fanny and Alexander's uncle/father, and then gets his just deserts. We learn that time and space do not exist, the universe is expanding, and there is obviously no method in the madness of the gloomy Scandinavian, in spite of the usurper's death.I can't say it was tedious, since I watched it all the way through, wondering what was going to happen next, but just felt disappointed at the end. The answer was that there was no answer to any of the mysteries. Why did Alexander have such unusually large ears ? How does a bishop accumulate debts great enough to bring him to bankruptcy ? Why was Ismael a woman ?",

            "content": "There are so many things I want to say about this film that I don't even know where to begin. I guess I'll start by saying that this has been the shortest 5 hours I've spent watching a film. At first I had planned to watch it in parts as the film is divided in acts, but I was so instantly taken, engrossed and fascinated, that I just felt like watching the whole thing in one sitting. I know that a 5-hour long film can sound very intimidating and exhausting, but the film is specifically divided in 5 distinguishable acts that make it more digestible, and believe me, it's so absorbing that you will barely notice you spent all that time watching it; it's that good. I've skimmed through the 3-hour theatrical version, and while it is a great film, some of my favorite parts are either shortened or completely cut from the film, which for me, lessens the impact the whole 5-hour extended TV version has. Both versions work, of course, but if you want to get a greater understanding of Bergman's vision, I totally recommend the extended version.Now onto the film itself. What can I say? It's magnificent. A grand, rich and glorious tapestry of life, family, love, hate, imagination, art, fantasy, reality, religion, magic, death, faith, spirituality, God, despair, redemption, youth, innocence, maturity, old age and the supernatural. Fanny and Alexander is all of these things and even more. I don't want to go into much plot detail, but point out what I liked so much about the film by mentioning some of my favorite scenes and commenting on them. And in this film there are plenty. Rarely I've felt the sense of familial warmth and love in a film or elsewhere as I have with Fanny and Alexander. The first act shows us a Christmas dinner family celebration, and it is instantly intoxicating and beguiling, and you're instantly drawn to these flawed-yet-loving and caring characters that constitute this large, happy family and Bergman's direction is so vivid that you totally feel the joy in sharing and the affection and love. One of my favorite scenes in this part is Oscar's (the family patriarch and owner of the family theater) heartfelt and candid speech about the importance of the theater, this \"little world\" as it is referred to, and how art can reflect the \"big world\" and help us have a greater endurance during bad times. This theme is more thoroughly explored in an enchanting and beautiful scene in which Oscar explains to Fanny and Alexander through the simple story of a chair how art is connected to life, how important and essential art is in enriching our lives, helping us have a deeper awareness and appreciation of the world at large, and how there is more to what meets the eye, an inner life lying underneath the surface of things. Bergman was raised within a very strict and oppressive family, and I'm pretty sure that the Ekdahls is the kind of family (Loving, supportive, encouraging, freethinkers) he would've liked to be raised in. I echo his (likely) sentiment. Likewise, if I got a profound sense of love and family in the first act, when tragedy strikes in the second act, I got a great sense of suffering and despair. One of the most strikingly moving scenes in the film involves Oscar's wife, Emilie, giving these primal, animal cries of grief over her dead husband; the scene is simply heart-wrenching. Similarly engrossing, is the open and penetrating conversation between Emilie and the bishop about her faith and her spiritual confusion and longing. But in the third and fourth acts is when the characters' resilience are really put to the test. None of the pain, humiliation and the frailty of the human heart throughout the film is better illustrated in a scene of tremendous impact in which Alexander is severely punished by the bishop and Fanny has no other option but to stand and watch as her brother is being physically abused, only moments later to see her defiantly turn down the bishop's affections. Another favorite scene during this act is Helena's - the family matriarch - beautiful and eloquent soliloquy to her son Oscar about the joys and pains in life, the futility of fighting against its forces and just living it as it comes. It is what it is. Another standout is Isak Jacobi's (a family friend and magician) metaphorical story that encapsulates the importance and at the same time the futility of searching for meaning in life. Some of the film's most intriguing, revealing and fantastical moments are in this act. In what's probably the greatest moment in a film full of great moments, is Alexander's encounter with a mysterious character named Ismael. I think this scene is the climax of the film as it brings closure to Alexander's arch. There's also a deep sense of the supernatural as it is suggested that everything, fantasy and reality, the logical and unexplainable, the material and the ethereal, the good and even the bad, is a manifestation of God. I feel that with those statements, Bergman is telling us that he probably managed to finally exorcise the demons that had been haunting him throughout his life, or at least come to terms with them, as his on screen alter ego Alexander has as well. All of this told, detailed and presented with the skill of a master storyteller.I was fully enraptured by this film. I love the way it beautifully conveyed the relevance of art and imagination and how they're actually essential for humanity. I loved how it showed life in all its joyful, fantastical, realistic, tragic, resigned and ultimately hopeful glory. I loved its sense of completeness yet also leaving the viewer with an air of mystery that implies the endless possibilities of life. A masterpiece and easily one of my favorite films ever.",

All this of course happens through the eyes of two small children though mainly Alexander. It contains so many moments of sheer emotion, my favourites being the confrontation between the two brothers and the bishop, the appearance of God and the father to the boy and the end scene. A great deal of symbolism peppers the film and Bergman takes hold of the material with such expertise that one cannot turn away at any point. This film is a real treasure and I advise anyone to watch it and love it as the latter comes very easily. I know that Bergman has a reputation for being heavy handed (is this a crime?) but this film is a lyrical song to the family and should be compulsive viewing. The fact that this film is over four hours is irrelevant, as this is often the first thing people comment on when the title is mentioned. Go and see this film today as it is quite remarkable.",

            "content": "Released in 1982, 'Fanny and Alexander' was created in two formats, as some of the other later work of Ingmar Bergman - as a TV series and as a big screen feature film. I have seen this later version yesterday at our local cinematheque and I was simply overwhelmed. It is one of those creations that make us love film as an art and we go to the cinema for. A story on screen that is at the same time complex and told in very simple and clear ways, a world where reality and imagination, history and ghosts live together. A masterpiece.The time and the landscape are the ones we are familiar with from the plays of Ibsen and Strindberg - Scandinavia at the crossroads of the 19th and 20th century. A frozen land and a social landscape in which strict moral and social rules conflict with the liberal thinking and the progress which comes with its own risks, were passions and innocence are often crushed under the family and social pressure. The Eckdahls - a rich widowed mother and her three sons - are bourgeois and liberal. We never learn how the wealth is accumulated, but it is enough to allow for the Christmas 1907 party described in the formidable opening scene look somehow like the ball scene in the Luchino Visconti's The Leopard. The fate and the success of the three sons are mixed. One of them is in debt, the other is more interested by the young au pair of his kids than by his allowing wife, and the third owns a theater and is married to a beautiful actress. When the last suddenly dies (on stage, playing the ghost father in Hamlet) and his wife decides to re-marry the local bishop his two children (Alexander and Fanny) will risk to become victims of a Dickensian fate.A whole world is created and exposed under our eyes. Houses become labyrinths were we wander and get lost together with the characters and the film cameras. Images of nature outside pace the time and seasons. The family fights for economic and social survival and for the defense of a way of life that conflicts with the rigid and hypocritical morality imposed by the bishop. Characters never leave this world even after their death, the ghosts in Bergman's film materialize, watch, touch and threaten. Theater, the other passion of Bergman, occupies an important role in the life of the heroes. The best friend of the family and the character that plays a key role in the most important moment of the story is an old Jew, an antiquarian and a puppeteer. Quite interesting to see this character of a Jew, constructed to represent an exotic counterpoint of the established rules of the society, not without some social comments about prejudice about Jews in the Scandinavian world. At some point in the action God himself is mistaken for a puppet. By the end, somehow, life seems to come back to its previous patterns, and the two children who are the intermediates by which the story is told return to the comfort of their previous lives. Danger however waits in the future. The solution of the story gave birth to new ghosts.It's quite difficult to analyze the tools of the master. I can do it, of course, but no words can do good service to what we see on screen. This film must be seen and lived.",

Bergman paints the lives of his characters in simple brushstrokes but still sprinkles the central storyline with mystical elements that add more layers to an otherwise straightforward narrative.The splendid locations, detailed set pieces, fluid camerawork, beautiful lighting play their part to help uplift the imagery and the ensemble cast embrace their respective roles so well that the familial bonding between them has a genuine & authentic feel to it. Ewa Fr\u00f6ling is a definite standout but contributions from the rest are almost as impressive. The film's 188 mins runtime however is strongly felt on more occasions than one.Overall, Fanny & Alexander is amongst Ingmar Bergman's more accessible works, and is sure to delight his fans & followers with its sumptuous production & graceful storytelling. Through this saga of a single family, it captures life, tragedy, love, loss, magic, reality, ghosts, memory, miracles & religion. Though I found the first hour to be a slog, the drama does get better with the change in scenery & the clashes that ensue. Still, for me, this film is more a tick mark on the checklist than anything else.",

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman's 1983 classic has been heralded by many as one of the greatest films of all time, and definitely the best to come out of Sweden. The sets and overall theatricality of the film are mesmerizing to look at and the direction is second to none. However, Fanny and Alexander is a film that is beautiful to look at, but almost a bore to listen and think about as it trudges its way through so many different stories that it becomes hypnotizing to watch. While titled Fanny and Alexander, the film mainly centers on the large and wealthy Ekdahl family. The family comprises of the matriarch, Helena, and her three sons, Gustav Adolf, Carl, and Oscar. All three have wives, but Oscar has the most beautiful, Emilie, and two children, Fanny and Alexander. We watch, mostly through the children, as their lives unfold and how they interact with each other as they experience both joy and tragedy.The film is very slow and meticulous with its 188-minute runtime (312 if you watch the miniseries), drawing out every detail and giving us a look at each individual family members personal life. While this does allow for great character development and chemistry, it hurts the film overall as too many details are covered for you to remember or end up caring about by the end. There is also a wild plot shift by the end of the film where spirits and different realities come into play. Bergman is famous for included mystical elements into what seem normal films, but here he should have abandoned that idea as it confuses the audience about what is really going on. For what it lacks in writing, Fanny and Alexander redeems itself in directing and production. This is by far one of the best decorated and positioned films ever made. The sets are all grand in scale and everything is put in exactly the right spot. The elegance of the house shines brightly and makes you want to pause multiple times just to look at everything in the frame. Bergman guides us through his film with such ease that it makes you wonder how a single man could plan and execute all of this. With this being his final feature film, it feels fitting for him to end here by doing what he does best. \nThe cinematography is astounding as we see the beauty of Sweden during all seasons. The winter landscapes, while cold and dreary, still produce a sense of wonder. The summer months give off the essence of life as the frame is filled with lush trees and the occasional sighting of wildlife.Complimenting the production is great acting by the adults, especially Gunn Wallgren as Helena. She plays her character with such warmth and caring and is the best part of the film. The interactions she shares with her family will surely make you remember someone in your life just like her.Another great performance comes from Ewa Fr\u00f6ling as Emilie. She plays one of the most important and well-developed characters in the film. She goes through a roller coaster of emotions as events play out that change her life as well as her children's futures. Near the very end of the film, she shares a passionate scene with Wallgren that perfectly caps off her journey as a mother. The child actors that play the titular leads don't fare so well when it comes to making their characters interesting. They mostly act dormant in most scenes and make you wonder if they will ever do something worth noticing. For a film titled Fanny and Alexander, the characters of Fanny and Alexander are the least compelling to watch or care about.Fanny and Alexander is a film that should be watched by film lovers purely because of its amazing production, cinematography, and directing. But for the casual fan who is looking to see an epic tale, be ready for a long sit for a payoff that never gets close to reaching its potential.",

            "content": "\"Fanny and Alexander\" starts with a lavish Christmas reunion of the same epic scale and narrative value as the wedding party in \"The Godfather\". It then proceeds to an untimely death that put all the family in shock. When mourning time is over, the widow resigns to find a stronger role model for her children, she marries a rigid bishop and then life flies over the darkest and toughest pages of the Family book, punctuated with strange supernatural encounters and deep metaphysical wanderings. Eventually, death shows up again, natural or not, and the movie concludes with another family reunion, celebrating two births, and through them, life with its share of joy, sadness, silences, cries, whispers\u0085 and wild strawberries. It is a credit to Ingmar Bergman's visionary practicality to make a film about a bourgeois family, spanning a relatively short lapse of time, yet containing a plot whose existential implications could cover countless pages of philosophical essays. Life and death, their meanings or meaninglessness, have never been as fully approached without ever exuding \"intellectual\" vibes. It is indeed extraordinary that such a film would also manage to tell an entertaining and captivating family drama's story. And no less extraordinary that the film, deprived from more than one-hour and half, would still manage to maintain its relevance and style (almost) intact and be such a universally praised masterpiece. But who said Ingmar Bergman was an ordinary director? This is the work of a lifetime and if Bergman really decided to make it his testimony film, he couldn't have found a better way to conclude his body of work. There's more than a story about children in \"Fanny and Alexander\", the title is rather misleading on that level, the film, set at the dawn of the 20th century, circa Bergman's childhood, shows the very world that shaped the tormented mind of the soon-to-be cinematic genius, a world of contradictions where lust is forbidden but temptation everywhere. There is this eternal presence of God, from the joyful Christmas celebration to the grim discipline of an overzealous Bishop; but the ultimate paradox of Bergman's movie is that it's less God's nonexistence than his silence that calls for doubt and anger. God is Bergman's most defining antagonist.And in this lost battle, each one finds his way. Like \"The Godfather\", the central Family, the Ekdahls, is a fascinating mix of personalities: from a gentle matriarch who keeps on her respectable facade, to her sons, they all have a different approach to life. Gustav Adolf, a baker and hedonistic man, seizes the day and enjoys flirting and partying with maids, with the surprisingly progressive consent of his wife. Carl is the second son, a failed professor who's responsible for perhaps the most heart-wrenching loser's monologue I've ever seen in a film. He's disgusted by his failure and even the consolations' attempts of his well-meaning German wife are welcomed by hatred and disdain, this is a well-educated man who've lost his faith on life and goes through it, chained to the certitude of his own mediocrity.The third son is Oscar, he manages a theatrical troop with his beautiful wife Emilie (Ewa Fr\u00f6ling), also an actress along with their children, Fanny and Alexander. The man is worn down by the weight of stress and after Christmas, he's victim of a fatal stroke. Alexander can't stand the sight of his father dying, he hides under a table and utters curse words during the funeral; this is a child desperately hanging on his childhood with a rather adult tenacity. But his greatest challenge comes when the existentially lost Emilie, chooses the austere yet handsome Bishop (Jan Malmsj\u00f6)\u0085 as a husband, finding in this man the serene connection to reality she felt lacking in her life. Then starts the soul-wrestling relationship between the Bishop and Alexander, confronted to the tyranny of God's rules, and their punishments. You could think Bergman, as a son of a rigid Lutherian, took his autobiographical revenge, but the Bishop is less a villain than a tragic man, lost in the illusion of his own authority being endorsed by God. Indeed, from the chess game in \"The Seventh Seal\" to the agony in \"Cries and Whispers\", God is never as present as during painful moments\u0085 and ironically, life is never as exhilarated as when Death is coming. But there's a different tone in this film, actually more serene, there's a sort of consensus regarding the whole illusion of life, no one is fooled. Even the dead ones aren't of any help. Only the grandmother's Jewish lover (Erland Josephson) has a foot in each world and connects mysticism and reality, as if they finally could reconcile, as if illusion was either the lesser of two evils or a survival game. And this might be why the film, for all its complexity and dramatic undertones, solved its two crucial plot points with \"lousy\" Deus Ex Machina, what an ironic but so well-put nose thumbs to us, purist and cinematic rigorists. Maybe it is a way to show that God stopped to be an antagonist, and he would always have the final word, but finally, with Bergman's consent. And here's the genius closing the arc of his religious torments like \"Scenes from a Marriage\" did for the theme of infidelity. And on that level, the best advice I could give is: do yourself a favor and watch the full version just like for the \"Marriage\" masterpiece. Surely, one hundred extra minutes of Bergman's epitaph movie is an offer a fan wouldn't refuse. And as a fan, I'll conclude the review by saying that Begman is certainly the most original and compelling director, too unfairly associated with black and white intellectual movies while there was more than that, there was human condition with style \u00e0 la Da Vinci and Shakespearean intensity, he's perhaps the greatest artist of Cinema, a cinematic God with God as a centerpiece.",

Viewing this film for the first time left me with the feeling that I would never again experience the world in quite the same way. The second time only deepened my appreciation for the simplicity of the story and the depth and precision of every detail. The third time I viewed the five hour Swedish Television version and realized that I was watching the equivalent of a Tolstoy novel on film. The highest compliment I can pay to this movie is that in being a child of the eighties, an adolescent and young adult in the 90's, and well, now venturing towards middle age in this young century, few works of media or \"art\" escape my mind's deconstruction of them, or my generation's greatest blessing (or greatest curse:) a very well developed sense of irony. Fanny and Alexander (along with a few of Bergman's other films including 'The Virgin Spring\" and \"Wild Strawberries\") is the exception to this rule. There is no way to simply break down how Bergman casts the spell he does. His work gathers you in, completely envelopes you, and at the same time is utterly impenetrable to any form of rational criticism. In the end you are left with a pure emotional response to what you just experienced with little idea of how Bergman took you to that place. You believe television, media, advertising, the constant bombardment of images into your brain has desensitized you to pain, agony, regret, violence, disappointment, dreams, longings and questions of God and death, and then Bergman gets a hold of you. I can only say this work is what one would call truly \"spiritual\" art, and Bergman's films are the only place I have ever experienced this phenomena.If cinema is the closest we have to a truly \"magical\" experience, then Bergman is and perhaps forever will be the greatest magician of them all. Fanny and Alexander should be preserved along with the works of the greatest masters of art in any medium. Every time I see this film, no matter what state of mind I'm in, it somehow makes me fall in love with movies and life all over again.Thank you, Mr. Bergman, for spending your life sharing your dreams, visions and nightmares with us.

It was as if you were an observer at a family holiday dinner without participating in the meal. It was simply boring beyond reason, and if I weren't steadfast about watching a film in it's entirety in order to review it, I would have given up at the half way point.And then something interesting happened. Unlikely as it was that the widow Emilie (Ewa Froling) would have married that skunk, the Bishop (Jan Malmsj\u00f6), that's exactly what happened, setting up a nasty little adventure between the Bishop and the title characters. There was a point in the story I would have gladly handed Emilie or Alexander (Bertil Guve) a bottle of rat poison to take out that monster. Not to mention that maid Justina (Harriet Andersson) who couldn't help herself snitching on the young siblings. Couldn't you have just strangled her?So it wasn't entirely a waste of three hours, but quite honestly, the best thing about this picture for me were the lavish and ornate sets, and the cinematography that brought that richness out in detail to the audience. Reflecting on the title of the movie, I had to wonder why it wasn't simply called 'Alexander' since he turned out to be the principal player. Little Fanny was cute enough but without a whole lot to do and wasn't on screen very much. My best recommendation - start watching the film about half way into the story and you'll get most everything you need to know about in the young life of Fanny and Alexander.",

The first half of the movie was very good, in that it seemed historically accurate about life in 1907 Uppsala. Fanny and Alexander were the children of an upper class father. It is so refreshing to see movies from the best, because nowadays filmmakers jazz movies up so much that in the end the movie is ahistorical .My biggest disappointment was after the father, a successful actor, passed away. This is claimed to be Bergman's most autobiographical film. If so, he comes off as a self indulgent whiner. The movie turned into a Swedish version of Jane Eyre. I liked Bronte's book, but I thought she went overboard in caricturizing the male priest who ran the school Jane Eyre went to. In the zeal to indict all religion and all authority in the 19th and early 20th Century, authors often went too far.This was the problem with the bishop that the mother married right after her husband passed away. She remarried literally days after his passing, and then claimed that she was ready for a committed relationship. The bishop was portrayed as a psychopath for merely wanting to remove stuffed toys from eight or nine year old kids, Fanny and Alexander. Then, Bergman engages in surrealistic fantasy. It would have been okay if that was what the movie was presented as from the beginning. It got very confusing towards the end, and I think that a better endung would have been not so dramatic as that the bishop dies under intricate circumstances. Show the boy at Age 30 still torn and confused about what to feel about his step father. Was his step father too strict, because he was teaching his step children how to survive as adults, or was he just a self centered sadist. That would have made this an outstanding movie.",

            "content": "I've seen a good amount of Bergman's films - I love Persona, Cries and Whispers, Scenes From A Marriage, and the Virgin Spring in particular - but this is the first one I've watched where I kind of reacted with a shrug upon finishing it. I didn't dislike it exactly, but the whole thing seemed to evaporate from memory afterwards and didn't leave a lasting impression on me like some of his other films.This seems to be one of those films where I can appreciate and admire many things about it: the performances, the elaborate production design, costumes, the ambition and scope ... but without any of it having any great effect.I suppose part of my problem with it was that I felt it was somewhat uneven and lacking in focus. It's supposed to be from the point of view of a young boy, but I never felt like we were ever following him - his character only really becomes of importance in the second act ... the rest of the time, he seems to only wander into the narrative from time to time as if he were a secondary character. Because of this, I never felt like I knew him as a character or the nature of his relationship with the father before he died ... as a result, Alexander's pain and preoccupation with death/ghosts/visions never felt earned and just seemed contrived and out of place.The first act reminded of the first third of the Deer Hunter where it's sort of a panoramic portrait of a close-knit group of people - this was interesting to me and I enjoyed the interaction between many of the characters ... but these relationships become minor subplots of little consequence or are left by the wayside altogether. So it's kind of like what's the point of introducing these narrative strands if they are not going to be developed any further? Basically, the film felt like Bergman had bitten off more than he could chew and wanted to throw everything he could into this story of a family (which was intended as his swan song), with several narrative strands that lack pay off or development - they're of little consequence and end up distracting from the subsequent focus of the narrative (the mother's marriage to the bishop).The second act of the film was the most compelling for me: the conflict between the bishop and Alexander ... but this shift of focus was jarring because after the first act, I felt like we get very little of the rest of the family. It's as if Bergman really didn't know what he wanted this movie to be: a tapestry of a family that chronicles each member, a coming of age story focusing on the child, a smaller domestic melodrama with an authoritarian bishop parental figure ...Overall, I suppose my main problem with the film was how Bergman chose to structure the narrative, which I felt was too broadly outlined ... which resulted in something very bloated and ponderous. Still enjoyed much of it, but not something I see myself revisiting anytime soon.",

His experiences at 12 (also the age of actor Bertil Guve, who sadly did not continue in the trade) are wildly stimulating and deathly chilling at times, which I guess makes it pretty realistic for being a boy before everything became regimented and Disneyfied. Bergman's talent for portraying both male and female multi-faceted characters in the depth and texture of their messy humanity is brilliantly manifest throughout this film, and what makes it gratifying and enriching. Nevertheless, though I know it was pieced together from a TV miniseries, at times I still thought it was rather slow and could have benefited from further editing. Finally, I guess I must have missed something because no one else on IMDb seems to have questioned the disappearance of the other two siblings, a younger boy and girl, without trace or comment.",

            "content": "Why Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman's 1982 final 'filmic film', Fanny & Alexander (Fanny Och Alexander), bears the appellation it does is a mystery- one of many in the film, since the first titular character, Fanny (Pernilla Allwin) is a third or fourth level supporting character at best, and in the three hour theatrical version of the film she is not even mentioned by name for nearly an hour into the film. The film really should be called Alexander & Fanny, or simply Alexander, since it most closely follows two years in the life of young, handsome, brown-haired Alexander Ekdahl (Bertil Guve)- the original 'boy who sees dead people,' from 1907 to 1909. Better yet, it should really be called The Ekdahls, for it is that whole family that is central to the film, especially Fanny and Alexander's beautiful blond mother Emilie (Ewa Fr\u00f6ling- a more intellectual, sensuous, and earth motherish version of Denise Richards, who bears a remarkable facial resemblance to Guve; especially in the cheekbones and puffy lips). Her deep, gorgeous blue eyes hold a viewer's attention, as do the eyes of Liv Ullman, who was originally offered the part, but turned it down. Yes, there are many things that do not make sense in this film- both in the internal narrative and the external aspects of the tale, but this is not necessarily a bad thing.The theatrical version did win four Academy Awards; for Best Foreign Film, Costume Design (Marik Vos), Art Direction-Set Decoration (Anna Asp), and for the cinematography of Sven Nykvist. This triumph is best illustrated in the scenes of the death of Oscar Ekdahl (Allan Edwall), where beautiful and ornate clocks and shiny accoutrements are contrasted with a bucket of vomit. But it is the 312 minute television series is unquestionably a great film, although it does not have the unadorned greatness of earlier Bergman classics, like Wild Strawberries, Winter Light, nor, most cogently, Scenes From A Marriage- Bergman's earlier TV miniseries that was also released theatrically in a truncated form, but which is a better film, especially in the comparative shorter versions. The shorter version of this film feels chopped up, has too many plot holes, due to some questionable editing by Bergman, especially when compared to the longer television version of the film. Why, as example, does Bergman retain any of the stand alone scenes of Carl Ekdahl and his marital woes in the shorter version, since they go nowhere and contribute nothing to the denouement, and where the best scene that character has is of farting out a burning candlestick to entertain the children? here is an example where leaving a bit of a plot does no good and it should have been wholly excised. By contrast, there are a number of scenes from the longer version that should never have been removed- such as Alexander's run-in with the ghosts of the daughters of the evil Bishop Edvard Vergerus (Jan Malmsj\u00f6- who was Peter, the feckless friend to Erland Josephson's Johan, in Scenes From A Marriage)- who torment and puke on him, or the dramatic showdown between Carl and Gustav Adolf and the Bishop, after they have engineered the rescue of the children from the Bishop's home, and revealed the Bishop as a philanderer who owes 110,000 kronor in debts.Yet, Fanny & Alexander deserves its place in the Bergman and filmic canons, even if it does occasionally suffer from some of what can be labeled 'old artist's syndrome'- i.e.- the tendency to over-sentimentalize the past. Bergman was 64 by the film's release\u0085. Fanny & Alexander, while a great film- especially in its longer version, is not all that its greatest boosters claim\u0085.Oddly, it is the shorter theatrical version of the film- with its many narrative gaps and unresolved issues, which feels a bit too long, not the significantly longer television version. Yet, despite the above named divergent themes, and the presence of 'the other' in the film, the inexplicable works, and works superbly- especially in the deeper, longer, and richer television version, where we get glimpses of the Bishop and his evil clan far earlier in the film, as well as more depth on important characters like Carl Ekdahl and Isak Jacobi. Perhaps it is because most of the film is told from a child's eye point of view, which always warps reality to its own psychological needs, or maybe the whole film is just a child's dream, for early on Alexander Ekdahl falls asleep. Does he ever really wake up?Whatever interpretation one wants to apply to this film, it is essential to the canon of Ingmar Bergman, and captures an essential bit of humanity past, just as superb films like Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story or Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver do. It will be relevant for as long as humanity exists, just as those other great works are, for despite its setting, we all know people like the Ekdahls and Vergeruses. That it lets us know a bit more about ourselves is merely icing on a damned tasty cake, one that remains tempting even as eaten, and gets better with each viewing. Having seen it thrice, both versions and the theatrical version with comments, this claim is no mystery. Swallow now.",

On the surface, it looks most like yet another dig, the ultimate dig, at the Protestantism with which Bergman was tortured as a child (his father was a clergyman). But there're also some other things, or so it would seem. I really like all the scenes with the big, extended family and their servants, who are nearly equal to their employers. I don't know what Bergman's point is with this stuff, but it's excellent.Fanny and Alexander begins with this family's Christmas celebration. Soon afterwards, Alexander's father dies. A bishop consoles the mother and eventually proposes to her. When the family moves in with the bishop, they realize all to late that he is a cruel and evil man, a slavedriver whose punishments far exceed the crimes. This part of the film, which is probably the longest, is also the weakest. Edvard, the bishop, is so evil he's reminiscent of the emperor from Return of the Jedi, able to shoot bolts of lightning from his fingertips. I personally despise religion. It's the bane of the world, all religions. However, this wicked bishop seems far too easy. Other religious figures in Bergman films strike me as more interesting. For instance, Gunnar Bjornstrand's role in Winter Light.Finally the children and their mother escape from the bishop. The film's best scenes occur after the local moneylender (played by the excellent Bergman regular Erland Josephson) steals them away from Edvard. He brings them to his home, where he and his son Aaron make marionettes. All of these scenes are extremely frightening, especially when Alexander runs into the moneylender's other son, Ishmael, a hermaphroditic shut-in with supernatural powers.The final act brings the family back together (and kills off Edvard and the rest of his family), but there is an enormously uneasy feeling about the whole situation.Like I said, I don't exactly understand this film. It's in need of a restoration and a DVD release, neither of which I think it'll get anytime soon. MGM owns it, and their business is in dire straits right now. I hope that they'll let Criterion buy it. I'd love to hear a full commentary on the film. Its level of difficulty would benefit from one. Right now I'm giving it an 8/10.",

Every frame exudes aplomb: but it's like every moment, carefully planned beyond the tiniest minutiae, just happened, naturally, without any rehearsal.In the narrative there are all sorts of things happening: there's the theatre and the life of the Ekdahl family that loosely starts to resemble the theatre they're involved in \u2014 at first they play Shakespeare, but when Emily and her children move away, that life begins to rot as well. There's the idea of Shakespeare transposed to the domestic life of the little children, Alexander being the one who sees ghosts. Then there's the magician, Isak Jacobi, who obviously practices Kabbalah. It's his magic that frees the children, that is, Bergman's magic. The scenes in Jacobi's house are appropriate in how they reveal to us \u2014 if we hadn't guessed it already \u2014 the inner workings of this world. Some may see it is superfluously esoteric, but I see it only necessary considering Bergman's fascination with such themes, especially in \"Det Sjunde Inseglet\" (1957). And then there's the vanity of it all, strikingly on display in the scene where the two Ekdahl brothers visit the bishop's house to make their case. This film is also one of the most beautiful examples on how to use color cinematically, and I can't help but feel that somehow Kieslowski's \"Trois couleurs\" (1993\u201394), despite being more painterly and approaching Tarkovsky in its immediate abstractness, treads the same paths.This is a masterwork, so nuanced, so articulate.",

Very smart and deep and philosophical, would give 10/10 and call it a masterpiece because that's definitely what this movie is and not something I'd just use to justify my rating for it and call myself smart for liking it. In a way, this is the predecessor of the movie Boyhood (2014). That movie is known as the most mediocre movie ever made, but also has metascore of 100/100, just like this movie. The main difference between these titles is that Boyhood can even mildly make the viewer identify with the main character's life and his problems there were Fanny and Alexander live their life in completely different type of mediocrity in a different time period, in a different world, which, based to this movie, is so boring I can't help but wonder how these people managed to die off for natural causes and not just kill themselves during their depressive boredom.",

Somehow, in one film, Bergman has managed to combine tragedy, broad and subtle humor, melodrama, philosophy, mystery, magical realism, kitchen sink reality, controlled performances and big bombastic performances, etc. and weave it all into an organic whole with a wonderfully (and shockingly for Bergman) positive message about the joy of life, the importance of savoring family, friends, passions, and the moment itself while we can. Populated by an unforgettable gallery of characters based on Bergman's own familial history, this is an intimate epic that takes us inside the lives of an upper-class, artistic Swedish family soon after the start of the 20th century and the misfortunes and triumphs that befall them. Not quite like any other film I've ever seen \u2013 either by Bergman or anyone else. This is a child's eye view of the world, mixed with the wisdom of an aging man looking back, with a kind eye, on life itself.A personal note: It's strange to say, but I found the feature version slightly stronger than the 4 part TV version it was cut from. For me, there is something a little more focused and impactful about it. Perhaps that's just because I saw it first, but much like Altman's 'Vincent & Theo' (which also was first shown as a European mini-series) I found the extra material took my attention a few too many places, and sometimes answered mysteries I liked as mysteries.Your best bet is to get the beautiful Criterion blu-ray set, and watch both versions for yourself.",

True, these things do, eventually, come to pass, but for the first two hours the father is very much alive and the focus is on the family Ekdahl en masse, who happen to be theatre oriented, so much so that Bergman could, with equal veracity, have called it 'That's Show Business' or even 'borrowed' from Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein and given us 'Life Upon The Wicked Stage'. It's a film of set pieces; Christmas celebrations, family meal times, funerals, etc and there's even a nod to Breughel in one of the early scenes when the frame is filled with figures congregating at chez Ekdahl. Again many of the scenes are shot as if photographing a play with actors and furniture arranged artfully to resemble stage settings. Depending on your point of view and/or boredom threshold the film is 'stately' or 'boring'. I understand it exists in a three hour version but the main story would fit easily into 90 minutes. Christopher Plummer look-alike Jan Malmsjo weighs in with a formulaic villainous stepfather and the acting itself is more than competent. I find it a trifle sad that someone of Bergman's stature finds it necessary to spell everything out as if for kindergarten viewers. Here's what I mean; Oscar and Emilie Ekdahl (the parents of Fanny and Alexander) are both actors in the family-owned theatre. They are rehearsing Hamlet when Oscar suffers the stroke which subsequently kills him. Thereafter his ghost appears to his son, Alexander (and, to be fair, to his mother, i.e. Oscar's mother, also). Alexander is unhappy at his mother's remarriage and she actually TELLS him not to 'play Hamlet'. The new husband did not actually Murder his predecessor but he sure as hell screws up Alexander/Hamlet's life.

Performances were great, but its writing and directing by a legendary filmmaker elevated this movie.Overall, after seeing 3 h 8 min version i can safely say - \"Fanny och Alexander\" (1982) is a great movie. It does not end as strong as its journey was, but i really liked it as a whole.",

            "content": "After having seen many Bergman films, I finally got my hands on this, considered by many to be the master's masterpiece. Not really about the children Fanny and Alexander (as the title would suggest) so much as about the entire Ekdahl family, this film is meticulously detailed and highly autobiographical. It looks absolutely fabulous; cinematographer and Bergman regular Sven Nykvist outdoes himself with his crystal clear compositions. Bergman's directorial style is at times a bit too static; he lets his camera sit motionless far too frequently, fine when focused on a face or tableau, but uninteresting when simply filming a group or room from long shot. But overall, he is in complete mastery of the material.I saw the full-length, five-hour television version, and the first half of this is flawless. Documenting the Ekdahl family Christmas, the death of Oscar (Fanny and Alexander's father) and their subsequent move to the home of their stepfather and religious tyrant, this part of the film is compulsively watchable. The characters (with the exception of little Fanny herself) are painted with detailed strokes by the acting and writing, and Bergman uses his production design to great effect, juxtaposing the sumptuous interiors of the Ekdahl's home with the ascetic house of the stepfather.The movie floundered a bit for me, though, in the second half. Here Bergman indulges his preoccupation with many of the themes that he's visited so often before; because of their familiarity, they came across this time as pretentious and tired. The existential longing, the fear of death, the blurring of personas: how many times can you explore these same themes and keep them interesting? Perhaps if I had not already seen so many Bergman films I would have fared better here. As it was, I found myself checking my watch frequently in the film's final hour or so.But the overall impression I took away from this film was that I had seen an important work by an important film maker. I still think \"Persona\" and \"Cries and Whispers\" are better movies, but \"Fanny and Alexander\" is a must see for any Bergman fan, and really for any fan of cinema, period.Grade: A-",

The portrayal of the cheery family at the beginning has a lively Christmas fairy tale feeling and we get to know the children well. Although the pace is slow and moody as usual, it's not as extreme as Bergman's other films so there's a coherent plot moving alongside the emotional imagery. The plight of the children is a stark contrast with the warmth they were used to (it almost reminded me of Matilda) and the acting performances were great at demonstrating this. The little supernatural touches were a great way to show how the boy Alexander is interpreting everything around him, but it got excessive and confusing near the end. For exampe, how did the bishop see the children upstairs when they were actually hiding in the chest downstairs? Was the Jewish man actually casting a magical illusion? Crossing the line from childhood \"magic\" to literal Dr. Strange magic made me zone out a bit.",

It unfolds like a rich novel, full of multi-dimensional characters, and takes the viewer on a journey of discovery -- of love, loss, laughter, despair, God, truth, and the supernatural.This film is haunting and beautiful, more finely detailed, photographed and acted than any film I have ever seen.These were my thoughts upon seeing the 3-hour theatrical version for the first (and second, and third...) time in the mid-'80s. I was so enthralled by this movie that I was hesitant to see the recent Criterion release of the full 5-hour-plus version originally filmed for Swedish television. I was worried I would be disappointed or that my all-time favourite film would somehow be diminished.I could not have been more wrong. The full 312-minute version of Fanny and Alexander is even more rich, more haunting, more compelling, more insightful and more emotionally impactful than the theatrical version. It is more novelesque, and treats the viewer to the most multi-dimensional characters ever put to film, and with some of the best performances ever captured. It is a great work of film art and storytelling, with intricacies never realized before or since, made with incredible love and determination by the two most talented filmmakers ever to treat us with their skills -- Ingmar Bergman and Sven Nykvist.THE masterpiece.",

In whatever version you choose, \"Fanny och Alexander\" is long; but, the film is worth the time commitment. It is a masterpiece.\"Fanny och Alexander\" starts out being about nothing in particular; an almost cluttered assortment of characters celebrate Christmas 1907. While in evidence, \"Fanny\" (Pernilla Allwin) and \"Alexander\" (Bertil Guve) do not seem to be major characters. By the film's end, young Guve's \"Alexander\" has emerged as the film's leading player; but, each of the other characterizations are memorable. Characters who started out superfluous become funny, scary, poignant, and/or haunting. Yet, everyone seems to belong in the film.There is a main plot, which creeps up on you. There is no way to describe the story without giving too much away; so, let's just say: A Swedish widow (Ewa Fr\u00f6ling), with two children, marries a Bishop from Hell (Jan Malmsj\u00f6). While each performance is remarkable, in its own way, Gun W\u00e5llgren (as the Grandmother Ekdahl) must be mentioned alongside those above. The sequences with Gurv and the antique shop residents, crosscut with the Malmsj\u00f6's Bishop and his Castle entourage, are especially magical. ********** Fanny och Alexander (12/17/82) Ingmar Bergman ~ Bertil Guve, Ewa Fr\u00f6ling, Gunn W\u00e5llgren, Jan Malmsj\u00f6",

Then Alexander's younger sister, Fanny, and their father, Oscar and mother, Emilie. Both their parents are actors (and some of the other family members too), whilst Oscar also works as director of the acting company. A large and generally happy family, as we see in hauntingly beautifully filmed Christmas scenes.Things change for the worse when Oscar suffers a stroke and passes away. Emilie manages the performing company for a year and then decides to withdraw from it. She is lonely and falls in love with the local bishop, Edvard, who conducted Oscar's funeral service. They get married and she moves to his household with the kids. They were in for a rude shock. They had to leave everything 'worldly' behind, no toys, their beloved books, or fancy clothes. The contrast with their previous lavish and luxury lifestyle and their new life behind cold, unadorned thick walls with bars in front of the windows, couldn't be more pronounced. In their new and austere, depressing household they had to follow strict new rules, something the kids were never subjected to. Furthermore they had to share the house with Edvard's vicious spinster sister, meddling mother and bed-ridden aunt. Alexander has a lively imagination and sometimes makes up stories, or tells fibs. He has a rebellious streak, too, and clashes with his stepfather. As a result he is caned and locked up alone in the cold attic. It seems as if Emilie is powerless, not knowing what to do to help the kids, entranced by the charismatic Edvard.The grandmother comes to learn of the kids' hardships; that they were practically being held prison, and decides to do something about it. But it is not going to be easy; the bishop is a very powerful and influential man... I watched the full, uncut and original version (part of the excellent 'The Criterion Collection'), nearly 5 hours long. (I also have the shorter theatrical version, but will leave that for another day.) It's length did not bother me in the least, and that should be a good indication of the quality of the film.The wonderful cinematography, music score, lavish sets and costumes are all out of this world. And particularly so the outstanding cast. All the actors were excellent, but mention must be made of the remarkable performances of Ewa Fr\u00f6hling (Emilie), Gun W\u00e5llgren (the grandmother) and Bertil Guve (Alexander). And then the clever story-line, fluctuating between the real world and the acted world, the make-believe world. \"On a flimsy framework of reality, the imagination spins, weaving new patterns.\"In my view 'Fanny and Alexander' is one of the best films I have ever seen. 10/10.",

            "content": "The first Bergman film I've seen is the director's last: I was excited, his reputation puts him in the upper echelon of directors, as far as I'm concerned, and I thought I could stomach his 'more accessible' film easily- I've seen tougher. This is a review of the 188- minute version, and perhaps that influences some of my opinions.Took in all kinds of things- why does the statue move? What does it say about Alexander? I tried to get a grasp on who's in the family: but then it all- falls- apart. Maybe I'm not yet ready for this type of film, but my god as an objective viewer I was sadly, sadly disappointed. The exposition at the very long Swedish version of the Godfather's opening fails: which bearded man is which? Who is the old lady? Who the hell are Fanny and Alexander's parents? On that note, where's Fanny? The titular character doesn't appear for nearly an hour and never does more than stand around and sometimes stick up for her brother, but she has about as much emotion as Bella from Twilight- yes, that comparison just happened. I didn't know who the father was until he died (that's not a spoiler) and didn't connect with who the mother was until we see her grieving in admittedly an excellent scene, one of the best.The kicker is that the family is interesting but it doesn't come to much. Helena, the grandmother, is a wonderfully warm presence and one of the film's great cheers. Gustav Adolf is very lively, but I am baffled that the whole family is OK with him having impregnated his mistress, one of Helena's housekeepers. His wife is OK with it! Everyone treats it like a normal thing! Carl and his wife are just miserable, but their plot goes nowhere, and finally Isak is cheery and likable. The film's greatest, saving strength is its acting: the performances are sublime, and the chemistry between actors is that of a tight- knit family. The tyrannical Edvard is not even that horrible of a person, only a stark contrast from Oscar, but his portrayal and the way the film plays out leads us to see him as a monster.So after the ridiculously long party, and once Oscar dies, we see what the new home life will be like and then the intermission occurs. After that things change radically and things become surreal. It's captivating, especially with the minimalist piano (fantastic music throughout) but I was never sure where real life ended and fantasy began. In its context, talking to the dead makes sense: but miraculous mirages? That's the best answer even Bergman came up with, miracles. Telepathy? I couldn't buy it after seeing a family drama for 2 hours.So the plot trips all over itself, made extra painful by the aforementioned acting and the exquisite script, with amazing dialogues that translate well to English. That essentially sums up the film: top- caliber everything except for a failure to build initial thoughts on characters, and having a terrible plot rife with holes. I'm reminded of a Shakespearean comedy: I think they get buy just by having his name attached. Midsummer's Night Dream is awful. This is not awful, but not nearly what I expected. This is now the definitive example as to why plot overrules everything. 7.0/10",

I'm thinking of ghostly appearances of a dead dad etc. but despite the length it keeps the viewer on side.From a technical perspective the film seems high spec for a foreign language, non-Hollywood production.\nThe set design, cinematography, screenplay and lighting are all top quality.Three hours of a good film I can cope with but I would not be able to do five!",

Basically, set in the early 20th Century in a Swedish town, for a while the focus is on the exuberant and colourful Ekdahl family and household, with the parents Oscar (Allan Edwall) as director and Emilie (Ewa Fr\u00f6ling) as the leading lady for the local theatre company. Their life with the many relatives visiting over winter and stuff is very happy, and we do not see so much of the children, Fanny (Pernilla Allwin) and Alexander (Bertil Guve). It is after the tragic death of father Oscar from a stroke that the children become much more important to the story, their mother Emilie is now responsible for them. She soon finds a new suitor with Bishop Edvard Vergerus (Jan Malmsj\u00f6), also a widower, and they marry each other, but this also means they are under his strict and stern rule. Alexander is particularly his target who he tries break by any means, especially when he mentions seeing ghosts of people he believes the Bishop knows about, the harshest punishment being a whipping on his behind. Emilie hadn't anticipated her husband's dark side and becoming, along with the children, virtual prisoners, so in secret she gets in touch with the rest of her family, including mother-in-law Helena (Gunn W\u00e5llgren) to intervene and help them out their dire situation. After Emilie is refused a divorce from the Bishop, it is a Jewish antiques dealer and magician friend that pretends to be interested in buying a chest, and obviously Fanny and Alexander are getting inside it to be smuggled out, this plan succeeds. While the children are safe with the Jewish man, and Alexander has met his nephew Ismael Retzinsky (Stina Ekblad), Emilie is pregnant, and she puts sedative in Edvard's drink who is feeling overly sleepy, a fire breaks out, and he is killed in it. In the end, after seeing some more ghosts Aexander, sister Fanny, and their mother with her newly christened daughter are brought back together, it seems to end on a happy note, apart from Alexander seeing the ghost of the Bishop saying \"you'll never be free of me\". Also starring B\u00f6rje Ahlstedt as Professor Carl Ekdahl, Christina Schollin as Lydia Ekdahl, Jarl Kulle as Gustav Adolf Ekdahl, Mona Malm as Alma Ekdahl, Pernilla August as Maj,Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand as Filip Landahl, Erland Josephson as Isak Jacobi, Anna Bergman as Hanna Schwartz and Lena Olin as Rosa. I may not have understood everything going on, but there were plenty of highlights that made me enjoy the film, obviously the whipping scene being to me the most poignant, the costumes, and use of colour is quite vibrant in many of the scenes, and the atmosphere is both pleasant and scary, it is a must see period drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Best Costume Design and Best Foreign Language Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film.

That night, in a fast selection after like an hour of think what i want to see, i pick \"Fanny och Alexander\". In that moment i didn't know that i made an excellent decision.\"Fanny och Alexander\" or its Spanish title \"Fanny y Alexander\" or its English title \"Fanny and Alexander\" told the story about a big Swedish family. There is Fanny and Alexander. Is Christmas and all of the Ekdahl family go to the grandma house to celebrate that beautiful evening. But all have a story to told. Suddenly, Oscar, the father of Fanny and Alexander, die. His wife now is alone, but, in loved of a Bishop, she with her children's go to live to his house. But now how they stepfather, he makes an incredible religious oppression. For other side, not much time after Oscar's death, he appears to his children's... then, Alexander is questioned about lying. And then we are questioned about if we are lying, or if grown ups are lying. And then, the real reality is our real imagination.Is hard to say few things of an extensive work like \"Fanny och Alexander\" because its unique in its kind. This work is a haunting masterpiece of a filmmaker who i don't know much. I only have see \"Smulstront\u00e4llet\" (Another beautiful masterpiece). But i think that with this two works, i can take now an image of Ingmar Bergman, as a creative and sensitive filmmaker. With certain mysterious qualities, \"Fanny och Alexander\" told us a story of questions based in children's and grown ups mentalities, its problems and its pleasures. Minute by minute, the movie, with a ghostly touch, it makes us more sensitive, and, at the same time, we cant despite some moments of complete nostalgia. The film confronts different subjects like family, death, childhood, religion and reality. Its a metaphysical work which explores reality based in that things that we think real and in that things that we think that are just imagination, specially from a kid like Alexander. And the we questioned about the real reality, which doesn't exist. Each one had its reality. I think that the only reality in this moment is Alexander's reality. He cries when he thinks that God go to show to him a face. He wants to live a normal life, a life that the bishop don't wants, just maybe his childhood was horrible and he thinks that if he want that Alexander be a good man, he cant live with any toys, locked with his sister in a room. Then we see its reality confronted with supposed real reality of grown ups. Then, we found Alexander wishes, which are the imagination confronted with the \"real\" reality. He hates the bishop. The bishop don't hate Alexander, its afraid of him. At the end we found to grandma with Alexander in his arms. \"All go on, the time and space don't exist. In the thin mark of the reality the imagination creates new patterns\" As much of you know, \"Fanny och Alexander\" runs with a duration of more of 3 hours, but there is a special version for TV, which runs with more of 5 hours. When i was seeing the theatrical version, i think in a few seconds how can be the TV version. But... well, sometimes i think that its not so important, maybe the theatrical version is more feeling packed, and TV version is more slow and complete. But still, Theatrical version is excellent, maybe exact. \"Fanny och Alexander\" is one of those works that you cant forget... and believe me, i never going to forget it.*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.",

The lavish, beautiful costumes, the heavily detailed and atmospheric sets, the perfect performances, the writing, the masterful cinematography, the writing, and of course the direction -- all working in sync to create a masterpiece of cinema and art.It's obviously a very nostalgic film for Bergman, as much of it is based on his own life experiences in some way. It has moments of pure joy and rejoicing, and moments of cold terror, sadness, and anguish. It's a truly timeless and gripping tale that touches on many aspects of life and our relationships with family and friends, as most Bergman films do. Also like many of his films, it has a surreal, supernatural tone that one must always take into consideration to fully understand the world Bergman has created.This has been called Bergman's \"swan song\", even though it certainly wasn't his final effort or film. But it is, in a way, because it is the culmination of decades of Bergman's personal and artistic developments, an ecnore of his best themes and qualities as a writer and director.

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman was, without question, one of cinema's truly great visionaries. His cerebral experiments with character and narrative in the 1960's with films such as The Silence (1963), Persona (1966) and A Passion (1968) are still as relevant and interesting today as his more conventional art films of the 1950's, of which Smiles of a Summer Night (1955), The Seventh Seal (1957) and Wild Strawberries (1957) are the most iconic and best known. He continued to make staggering films far into the 70's as well, long after many of his closest contemporaries had submitted to self-parody and over indulgence, and was still able to produce great work like Cries and Whispers (1972), Scenes from a Marriage (1973) and Face to Face (1976) even when working within the incredibly limiting confines of Swedish television.With this in mind, Fanny and Alexander (1982) would seem to be the culmination of everything that Bergman had been working towards throughout his entire career; with many of the themes, ideas, ghosts and characters that had appeared and reappeared not only in his work but also in his life and childhood being written into the script and presented on the screen. We also get many of the same narrative and thematic preoccupations here too; with innocence, death, ghosts, dreams, childhood and infidelity all featuring heavily, and with everything further cross-referenced to the films that came before. This isn't particularly surprising, since Bergman's work was always self-referential, but what does impress with this is the bold use of light, sound, design and composition, giving us bold and glowing colour where there was once iconic black and white and an enormous amount of vibrant movement where there was once static, highly rigid examination.Another impressive factor is Bergman's intelligent, self-reflexive use of narrative framing, which not only works in relation to the film and the characters therein, but in the presentation of his own life and the semi-autobiographical allusions made in the script. So, with Fanny and Alexander we have the presentation of a play within a play within a film. One play is created by Alexander, whilst the other play is created by Shakespeare, recreated by the adults and filmed by Bergman. In general, there are a lot of references made to plays and the theatre - which is very much fitting given the fact that it was Bergman's great love - with continual references made towards Hamlet, Macbeth and the work of Charles Dickens. We also have the more clear-cut, autobiographical aspect of Bergman \"as Alexander\", the would-be storyteller and narrator of the film itself, giving us the obvious representation of innocence submitting to adulthood and warm nostalgia.The key scene for me here, the one where the ideas of the film take flight and offer the viewer something truly magical, is the sequence wherein Fanny and Alexander stay with the Jewish money-lender. The imagery here is startling and eases us into the second half of the drama in which the vaguely supernatural elements begin to accumulate, either as a result of Alexander's burgeoning imagination or as a result of the continual meta-textual reference points to the play within a play. Certainly, it may be less concise and iconic than The Seventh Seal, or seemingly less experimental than Persona, but it is still, without question, amongst the very greatest European films of the 20th century; filled to the brim with intelligent ideas, raw emotions, fun and frivolity, grand spectacle, beautiful colours, Gothic melodrama, ghosts and apparitions, music and movement and, as thus, is clearly one of Bergman's most intelligent, imaginative and visually impressive films.Although he would go in to direct numerous projects for television - including the celebrated follow up to Scenes from a Marriage, Sarabande (2003) - Fanny and Alexander remains Bergman's ultimate final word as a filmmaker, and is a wonderful culmination of the themes and ideas that had been slowly gathering and evolving throughout his impressive and distinguished career.",

First, to address my two tiny nitpicks from the previous review. The fart scene... I don't really mind it anymore. I even kind of look forward to it. It gives Carl a mischievous sense of humor, something to take a little bit of the edge off his darker side. I also suggested that Ewa Fr\u00f6ling (Emilie, the mother) isn't quite as good as the rest of the cast. I will revise that: she isn't quite as distinctive as the rest of the cast. With so many grand personalities running around, it's hard for Emilie to leave a strong impression. But this time I realized how good Fr\u00f6ling is, nailing many of the subtle shifts the role demands.Speaking of grand personalities, among an amazingly strong cast, Gunn W\u00e5llgren (Helena, the matriarch) towers above them all. It was her final screen performance, and what a fantastic swan song. I want this woman to be my grandmother. She exudes endless warmth and compassion and patience. I must seek out more of her work, having only seen her in this and one of her earliest films, ORDET (and I can't recall her role in that at all).This is a film that celebrates the creature comforts of life, finding pleasure in \"the little world.\" For as much as Bergman gets saddled with labels like \"austere\", here we see him practically spitting in the face of austerity. The Ekdahl home is joyously lavish, stuffed with artwork and food and precious items. And of course there's also the packed-to-the-rafters shop owned by Jacobi, filled with exotic and supernatural mysteries. Where Fanny and Alexander suffer is in the stifling environment of the barren Vergerus household, forbidden from bringing any of their belongings (the bishop reluctantly allows Alexander to hold on to his battered teddy bear). It's a wholehearted endorsement of material, physical decadence. \"Let us be happy while we are happy.\" Bergman is careful not to completely idealize the world of the Ekdahls, however. We see Carl's unbearable cruelty to his wife, Gustav's endless philandering which is amusingly tolerated by his spouse (two more wonderful casting choices in Jarl Kulle and Mona Malm) and even hints that Oscar is sexually distant towards Emilie. As much as they revel in the joys of life, they haven't quite got the male-female relationships right... after all, it's still Bergman we're dealing with.The director is exceptionally generous with his faith in the audience. In some of the finest examples of magic realism, we are shown impossibilities without explanation, and are trusted to make of them what we will. It is a story that is much concerned with the power of imagination, and of course Bergman's love of the theater and its ability to fire the imagination. As Oscar spins an improvised fairy tale about a common chair to the children, for a moment we believe every word he's saying. With that same magical power of storytelling, Bergman makes us believe in ghosts and mummies and evil forces.It's such a phenomenally beautiful piece of work (thanks especially to Nykvist and the set design) that always offers me something new, and keeps me enthralled throughout the entirety of its 5+ hour running time (okay, the \"Hamlet\" rehearsal drags a bit, but it has such thematic resonance). I think I feel a stronger personal connection to SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, but Fanny is an astonishing film on every level. It may or may not be my \"favorite\" Bergman, but I think it's his most stunning achievement.",

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman's farewell to cinema, being his last feature film. Or rather it got torn down into one as it was originally an over 5 hour TV mini series. The film depicts the lives of its title characters, Fanny and Alexander, and their extended family, the Ekdahls, a wealthy aristocratic family living in the early 20th century Uppsala, Sweden.I've personally only seen the mini series, so I'm a bit unclear as to what was taken out for the 3 hour feature version, but let's talk about the story as a whole. The film is a pretty straightforward period drama, which is a bit surprising, given that Bergman has a reputation for the artistic side of film making. And yes, there are hints of that in this film, but not all that many. It's mainly at the very beginning, and then during the fifth act. I'd even go so far as to say that the second and third acts are downright clich\u00e9d and dull. That's how formulaic they are.That being said, the acting is really good, the sets and costumes are gorgeous, there are some truly touching scenes even in the dullest acts, and the characters, the Ekdahls especially, are remarkably likable. The first act might be some of the finest character and world building I've seen in years. There's a metric ton of characters to introduce, all with their quirks and motivations, yet the film pulls it off flawlessly. Well, at least the mini series.Does the rest of the film meet the expectations laid out by this marvelous first act? Yes and no. As I've said, the second and third act are kind of clich\u00e9d, and the final act gets really bizarre, but I'll give it this: It's memorable. I'll remember this film. I enjoyed watching it, and while it might not be the finest drama I've ever seen, at least I got something out of it. Which is not as common as you'd think.",

Still, I was aware it's Bergman so I didn't wanna give up easily. But hour came and passed and the film was close to half when I finally became agitated and pushed stop button. Settings, costumes, acting, camera work and directing are fantastic. Trouble is that it's beautifully filmed Nothing. For the duration of an average movie, we are looking at a somewhat unusual family that, at the beginning of the twentieth century, lives a boring day-to-day life. No plot, no story, drama, humor, nothing at all.One of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I went to eat something and make a coffee and after a while I got back to my computer to watch the show I started yesterday. But my precious OCD wouldn't let me concentrate. I never leave movies I once started and I simply couldn't do it now. So I got back to Bergman.Literally minutes later things began to happen and form one pretty decent story. Ok, it was still slow and nothing special, but satisfying enough to hold my attention till the end. First half of the movie had no story at all and all the magnificence of other aspects of the film is in vain when they do not have any purpose. Even if everything else is for ten, if story is terrible you get lousy movie. Story in second half of the movie is really nothing special, but it's good enough not to destroy beauty of the rest of the movie. If story was at level with everything else this would be 10/10. If there was no first hour of the movie it would be 8,5/10. But I simply can not forgive the agony first hour put me through. I'm not rating only camera or only directing, only it's soul or just the last hour. I'm rating overall impression of movie as a whole. And for that reason I rate it 7/10. But at the same time I want to recommend it as feat for the eyes of those who cherish aesthetics enough to ignore lack of plot.7/10Movie was nominated for 6 Oscars and it won 4. All 4 well deserved. In my opinion, Bergman also deserved his nomination for directing to win too. But nomination for the best screenplay sounds to me like bad joke.Actress who plays grandmother, and who is maybe even leading character of this movie, irresistibly reminds me of Cameron Diaz. I wonder is this just me or there's more people who see this resemblance.",

And to admire.I like it that it's a little loopy and fantastic, which usually turns me off completely in movies and literature because when the creator trots out fantastic elements I almost always feel like they're over reaching and could have used ordinary life as a vehicle of expression but are too lazy. It's like they want to underline it: big idea folks! Don't miss it. IB takes a bunch of schlocky devices and proves that in the right hands, they all can work: the imagining of the fire, for instance, or the stark face off of good and evil, or the dangerous homosexual, the heavy handed symbolism, the play within a play. All corny elements we've seen too much of but fresh and compelling in this picture, even after 25 years. In fact, I was reminded again and again of my childhood and how I had first encountered many ideas. What did I think of Hamlet when I was forced to read it in the 7th grade? What did I think about life when I was forced to confront it with my developing brain? Have I lived up to my ideals? The best movies change you.

            "content": "This is an utterly captivating film. Those who prefer Bergman more for the light & easy 'Smiles of a Summer Night' instead of the depressing reality of 'Cries & Whispers' will adore this one. Fanny & Alexander Ekdahl are 2 young children of a sprawling well-to-do Swedish family. The late grandpapa ran a theatre company & grandmama was the leading lady. Their sons have moved out of the 'craft', except one. He is Fanny & Alexander's father & the matriarch grandmama's favourite. Alexander has inherited a love for moving pictures from him (he loves watching moving pictures thru a magic lantern in the nursery) & armed with a hyperactive imagination, he goes on to become Ingmar Bergman the film director.Alexander's young days, as portrayed by the director, gives a good indication of 2 of his future obsessions - religion & woman. He is deeply attached to his mother who gets widowed early on in the movie. His Father dies while rehearsing as Hamlet's dead father for their forthcoming production. After that his sister Fanny & he move to a grim, forbidding & frugal quarter by the ocean to live with her & their new step father, who is a Bishop, at a grim, forbidding & frugal quarter by the ocean. Like the place, the Bishop is a cruel, stiff, heartless man. He wants the children to follow his strict regime & when they resist, tension builds up moving the narrative to its horrific climax. A scene with the Bishop terrorising the young Alexander to confess a guilt, under the guise of freeing himself from hell & damnation, is chilling. With the Bishop's spinster sister & harridan mother sitting on either side of him, one of them knitting away, the place could easily have been at Mme Defarge's next to the guillotine in France or Torqemada's court in Spain. I cannot remember a more frightening scene than that of using religion to serve petty personal gains.The whole movie is filled up with such brilliant, stirring, epochal moments. Never do you look at your watch to check how much of the 3 hour long movie is still left. The scenes float, dance & shine. Being an adaptation from a TV miniseries (& that to about a 3 generation family), the film is somewhat episodic & some interesting characters like Uncle Carl & his German wife disappear after an early flourish. But each cameo holds up beautifully & seen through the eyes of a fantasy-filled boy, it is a wholesome entertainment. Some of Bergman's old ensemble - Harriet Anderson, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Erland Josephson appear in the movie, as does Lena Olin in a small role as the maid Rosa. Also brilliant, as always, is Sven Nykvist's photography.The best thing about 'F & A' is that it doesn't matter whether you have heard of Bergman, or seen any of his earlier movies. You will just love this one if you have ever been a kid or lived in a large family. So that covers about everyone.",

And it speak so much about being human.Sven Nykvist's classy photo is, as usual, extremely beautiful and so, the spectacular scenography. Seeing the Swedish actor elite act in front of the camera is magic and Bergman's script and dialogue contribute to the magical atmosphere. This is one of the best Swedish films that has been made, but despite its magnificence, it should not be denied that every ones in a while It becomes quite sprawling and a little incoherent. And the tempo is hardly staggering. When Lydia sings for her husband and the other adults in the fine lounge, we hear the whole song. At that speed level, it is, and continues to be. But fortunately it doesn't matter, because everything is so magnificent.Gustav Adolf's emotionless speech may sum up, perhaps not the whole film, but an approach to the family we have come to know.

Script, personal characters, performance of the actors and so on. In its way its also a movie perfect to see again and again. You always find something new to discuss. Like what is Alexander's dream about, how do they succeed in kidnapping the kids, what really happens between Alexander and Ishmael, and so on? But you can simply forget all about that end enjoy this masterpiece. If I had to pick my favorite scene I think it would be the one when Gustaf-Adolf and Carl Ekdahl is having a meeting with the Bishop, trying to convince him to return Emely. I also heard that this scene is described by Borje Ahlstedt as the best he ever made, and then remember that also Jan Malmsjo and Jarl Kulle is performing at the top and the structure and dialog and the physiological undertones are perfect, what more is there to say?

Then the remaining acts go on to follow the ups and downs of the two siblings, Fanny and Alexander, and their mother Emilie, and how everyone in the Ekdahl family tries to cope with it.Each of the characters in the movie is so uniquely fascinating, and really have something to offer to the combined family as well as the movie. The rich colours and cinematography, the in-depth exploration of the characters' lives, the movie is filled with heartwarming and hilarious moments; there isn't a single dull moment in it.All the actors involved with the movie have done a brilliant job, especially the beautiful and charming Ewa Fr\u00f6ling delights us with her talented performance of Emilie Ekdahl. I wonder why I haven't seen her in many movies; she really has the ability to captivate you with her eyes and emotions. Helena's conversation with his son's soul and Isak Jacobi's monologue with the children were really entrancing.'Fanny och Alexander' is an ornately shot period piece that beautifully studies both childhood and adulthood (not of the same character). As critic Aaron Hillis from 'Village Voice' says so aptly, 'nothing else in his (Bergman) oeuvre addresses so directly his childhood escapes into fantasy as the by-product of a harsh Lutheran upbringing.' It explores many themes like loss, prison-like childhood, polygamy, etc., but the story is essentially about the importance of family. Overall, the movie is quite life-affirming and memorable.

Perhaps more so because the protagonists, Fanny and Alexander, are both children less than ten years old.Bergman laces his characters- an eccentric, hedonistic, passionate and opulent family led by an elegant and radical matriarch- with clever psychological trimmings in an atmosphere combining lassitude and surreal richness. The colors make you swoon, and the house of this family- the Ekdahls- is literally and figuratively a doll house. The children's world is rampant with mischief, lies, loneliness, mortality, and love.The people around him search for worldly salvation but seem to fail miserably, his kind, contemplative father has just died, his young, gorgeous mother marries a \"spiritual\" ascetic-looking string bean whom he treats like the Devil, and to top it all off, the Ekhdahl's theater company is in financial ruin.With deft hands, Bergman trains his slow-moving camera to scenes that evoke wonder, magic, stunning beauty. and eerie apprehension. The children's, particularly Alexander's wild imagination are as fascinating as the rich ornamentations and objects that Bergman wants you to notice. but not for very long, for just when the lush imagery utterly seduces you, you are sucked back to the merciless dirge-like flow of the story.Bergman weaves a story about family love and redemption and turns it into an almost mythical theme through Alexander's troubled hungers and dark imagination.

            "review_title": "Berman's Purpose",
            "content": "I believe Ingmar Bergman's purpose in making this film is to pose two specific questions to the viewer regarding their belief in God: 1). Who is God?\u0097and 2). How do people behave when they interpret who God is? From Bergman's perspective, God is someone who cannot tell a lie and who looks contemptuously upon liars, which is also to say, He only tells the truth and praises truth-tellers. Truth is something very important to Bergman and he establishes this concept through two specific scenes. It is first illustrated when the bishop reproaches Alexander for telling lies in school. Whether or not the viewer knows if Alexander is really lying is irrelevant. The point Bergman is making is that he has established through the bishop's character the evils of telling lies. Therefore, God looks down upon liars\u0097in this case, Alexander (if of course if he is actually lying).Second, when Alexander is accused again by the bishop of lying, he suffers even more severely when beaten with a stick. This leads the viewer to ask the next question: How do people behave when they interpret who God is? Bergman seems to suggest that when people interpret God correctly, they act calm and civil, and contrariwise, they act violent and irrational. I believe he uses Alexander as an example of someone who has interpreted God correctly, and the bishop as an example of someone who has interpreted God incorrectly. I want to focus primarily on the latter.The bishop's irrationality is established in three different ways: 1). When he first hears Alexander's story about essentially killing his former wife and children, the camera dolly's towards his face to reveal how terribly fearful he is. This is also accompanied simultaneously with a dramatic sound of thunder in the background. Both elements (cinematography & sound) suggest that Alexander is actually telling the truth and that the bishop fears exposure. 2). after beating Alexander for supposedly lying, (which of itself renders the bishop's insecurity of having to resort to violence instead of civility) he locks him in the attic. Later when his mother comes to rescue him, the viewer sees positioned in the back of the attic a slanted crucifix. This suggested element of production design opened my mind to a very poignant question and truth: What happens to truth-tellers when they report liar's lies?\u0097the liars become hard-hearted and punish the truth-tellers for telling the truth. Accepting the truth would mean the liars would not be justified in their behavior and would have to change\u0097which is something they'd rather not do. 3). At the end of the story, the bishop confesses to his sister that he fears Alexander. Why would he fear him? Because he is afraid of Alexander's magical powers of somehow knowing the truth of his past. Holding such truth can get the bishop into serious trouble.To summarize, I believe Bergman is showing a social commentary of humanities predilection of what can happen when we misinterpret God. By not fully understanding who God is (one who embodies all truth), there is great danger for intolerance and contention to prevail, and in extreme cases, war and violence. If the audience walks away feeling hatred towards the bishop, then they should also walk away examining how they treat others with beliefs counter to their own. The big question Bergman asks the viewer to consider is this: Am I accepting another's belief with love or anger?",

The film was released twice; first as a 3-hour long feature and second as a 5-hour long feature, which was intended to be shown as a TV-movie. In the 5-hour version characters in the film are explored more in depth. For the sake of understanding my review, I felt it would be appropriate to note that my opinions of the film are based off the 3-hour long feature.\"Fanny and Alexander\" tells the story of a young boy, Alexander, and his family set in a Swedish town representing Uppsala, Sweden between 1907-09. Alexander's family, the Ekdahls, come from a wealthier background and are all gathering for Christmas Eve dinner. During a good first portion of the film we are introduced to a variety of the family members and exposed to their personal, and often troubled backgrounds. We also learn that Alexander's parents are involved with the local theatre. Soon thereafter Alexander's father dies of a stroke while rehearsing on stage for an upcoming play. Distraught from the loss of her husband, Alexander's mother, Emilie, finds comfort in the local bishop, and soon accepts his proposal for marriage. Emilie and the children then move in with the bishop. Quickly the children are forced by the bishop to give up their possessions and live under his strict, unforgiving, and at times, violent, rule. The family, longing for their past life, then becomes prisoners of the bishops house. Luckily, Emilie had been secretly in contact with her mother- in-law, Helena, and the Ekdahl family plans to intervene and save Alexander and his family. Without giving the rest of the film away, the ending explores Alexander's relationship with himself by questioning his faith and his hatred for the bishop.Faith is explored in the film the same way faith is viewed in Swedish culture- with skepticism. Alexander having encountered the ghost of his father and exploring his hatred for the bishop- a religious man- offer Alexander with a conflicted view of humanities goodness and its connection to a god. An example of this in the film is when Alexander meets Ismael. Through this interaction between the two characters Alexander confronts his inner self with the help of Ismael, who can be seen as the 'darker side' of Alexander. Alexander, through this connection, overcomes his fathers death and confronts his hatred for the bishop by imagining the bishops death. Bergman's own childhood comes into play with the use of a clock- used as a symbol of death or of a visit from a ghost. Faith is explored in a very self-oriented way that appears magical and surreal, while questioning human goodness.Man and women in the film is also another important theme in the movie and can be a peak into the taboo subject of 'Swedish Sin.' Men and women are shown throughout the film to be acting off the basic instincts of sexual desire. They first appear to be perfect citizens of society. However, they fall to temptation when the characters begin to lust after, and engage in behavior that 'proper' Swedish society tries to repress. For example, Alexanders uncle Carl's relationship with the nanny girl, May. Carl, who has a wife, runs off to engage in sexual activities with the nanny, which as a result, bares a child. Carl's wife seems to have no reservations against her husband for engaging in an affair. Another example is the abusive sexual relationship that Alexander's mother is put in. Though we don't actually see the acts, Emilie becomes pregnant with the bishops child even though she no longer loves him. She appears weak and bruised as the family lives longer with the bishop. This, among other instances in the film call into question the true nature of humanity and what roles men and women play in society.The artist in the film is Alexander. He is the one who creates and uses his imagination by making up stories, such as the time when he made up the story of how the bishop killed his former wife and children. The bishop tries to rid the artist from Alexander by punishing him, but is unable to do so. The use of a theatrical set in the Jew's household, and the puppets that inhabit it, also create a surreal and magical world that provide an appropriate context for Alexander to explore the question of faith during his confrontations with his father and Ismael. It is no wonder why Bergman, who was not only a playwright for theatre, but also heavily influenced by theatre for film, uses theatrical elements in \"Fanny and Alexander\" in order to express his themes. Bergman use of the 'magic lamp' in the film is also one of Bergman's favorite childhood memories, where it was common for him to make up stories with the 'magic lamp' pictures. The artist in the film enhances the context in which Alexander reflects personally on something as surreal as art- faith.Overall \"Fanny and Alexander\" was a great film, with an engaging storyline that is full of in- depth meaning that can be explored and interpreted in many ways. Between the relationships of faith, men and women, and the artist is society, Bergman offers a peak not only into his personal life, but also that of Swedish society and the relationship of faith in humanity.",

Those two scenes includes brilliant acting and a display of powerful emotions. But Fanny and Alexander is so much more than that. It's humour, tragedy, love, hate, fear, you name it. It's all there.

He touches on all the themes that have dotted his films since the 1950s: love, death, religion, marriage (and infidelity), family, etc. For good measure, he also throws in ghosts, magic, and flatulence into this one. It is little more than a soap opera, and it's in serious need of editing. The director can be forgiven for wanting to make an epic swansong even when he didn't have the material to support such an undertaking. In her final film, Wallgren is terrific as the matriarch.",

            "content": "This film is excellent. It's beyond words. The story is much based on (real, similar and imaginary) experiences of Ingmar Bergman's childhood. The story begins at the grand Christmas celebration of the Ekdahl family in 1907. The Ekdahl family run the local theater in Uppsala, and are a family of both shared and opposite opinions, but a perfect example of blood being thicker than water. They are partly a family of unpleasant experience, yet a joyful and humor group. No cinematography tops this particularly beautiful work by Sven Nykvist, and I couldn't imagine a movie being as warm and beautiful in its raw cleverness as Fanny and Alexander. From the opening of the first scene until the ending of the last, mesmerization is guaranteed. This was Bergman's last work in cinema (although 20+ years of directing and writing for TV and the theater was to come), and he definitely ended on a high note. At the moment the full 5+ hour version is only available on Artificial Eye (DVD), which is a shame, since the representation of the movie (mainly its sound quality) doesn't live up to the standard of the movie itself - furthermore the subtitles aren't optional! Let's all cross our fingers for soon being able to watch this film well-represented on DVD. The movie isn't worth less than the best treatment.",

            "content": "Another masterpiece by Ingmar Bergman. After watching the 5 hour cut, I'm most impressed by Ingmar Bergman's seemingly infinite grasp of the human condition. The dialogue and scenes play out not only as imitations of real life, but artful replications. This is life viewed through an artistic lens. It explores most of what a person will go through in their lifetime--childhood, adulthood, old age, death, sex, sorrow, joy, belonging, alienation, isolation, confusion, oppression, freedom, family, art, business, religion and everything in between. It's a five hour journey through life seen mostly through the eyes of Alexander, a little boy, and it can be sweetly heartwarming or gut-wrenchingly sorrowful. There was one hard to watch scene in particular that was the most raw depiction of grief I've seen in a movie. Some of the events and imagery are mysterious, particularly towards the end, but this only serves to further catalyze intense thought and reflection on the viewer's part. Also the cinematography was absolutely enthralling. Ingmar Bergman shoots the interior of cluttered houses like Francis Ford Coppola shoots the lush jungle in \"Apocalypse Now.\" There's so much in the shot that it should most definitely be too busy to be aesthetically pleasing, and yet Bergman finds the perfect way to show it to the audience. Beautiful. And his use of lighting only accentuates his mastering of the camera, especially when windows are around. And the acting is also magnificent. I can't even think of a performance to point out since they were all air-tight, and a large portion of the Ekdahl family is given even screen time. I'll probably be thinking about this movie for the rest of my life. True, blissful cinema.",

Well known, Bergman is loved by many, but hated by a lot more, due to his maybe too personal or maybe too little entertaining movies.Yet depth and life perspective to the core, are shown in its purest matter.This movies does not just focus on the two young children who loses their father in a early age, but also their big family of higher class. Bergman indulge into all layers of the classes in society, giving everyone time and place to show they point of life and view. Death is a central element here, as in life, the same can be said about love, and love-sickness, jealousy, hatred, falseness, lies, and might-abuse. Bergman self, grew up in a very strict youth with his bishop father, giving real spice to the religious power-surge in the film. Yet also, the unknown, the unspeakable, the mysterious world of spirits and the above, which we can not prove, understand or control is givin a big part in the latter part of the movie, which gives the story another layer, rather unexpected but, also freshness and a lot of confusion if you seek to nail down all answers.

It's headed by grandmother Helena, her three sons and their wives, and the two children of her son, Oscar, and daughter-in-law, Emelie--Alexander about age 10 and his younger sister, Fanny.The film includes all of Bergman's devices, including death, clocks, beautiful cinematography, close-ups (though not as many as usual), and reflections on the meaning of life (though not obsessively).In one sense I would call \"Fanny and Alexander\" Ingmar Bergman's final revenge on his difficult, straight-laced Lutheran pastor father. The Lutheran bishop in \"Fanny and Alexander\" does not present well, and ends badly. Religious folks don't do well in Bergman movies, and this was no exception. As in many Bergman films, the setting includes people of wealth with a casual approach to marital fidelity. Fantasy and/or dreams play a significant role as is the case in many Bergman films.One of Bergman's early actresses has a significant bit part in the movie--Harriet Andersson plays the maid who tattles on Alexander to the Bishop about Alexander's story about the death of the bishop's first wife.There is a prominent Jewish character in the film, which is unusual. There is a much larger cast of characters than in most Bergman films. The theater version was a bit over three hours long; it was also released as a five hour and twenty minute mini-series for which I don't have the stamina.Generally I would say Bergman raised no new issues in \"Fanny and Alexander\" and was more \"Hollywood\" in his approach. It is said to be semi-autobiographical, though I can't speak to that as I have not read his autobiographies and probably will not do so.",

This is a family of real, breathing people - imperfect and colorful. \"Fanny & Alexander\" has it all: love; death; lust; anger; enmity; religious devotion and doubt; ghostly visitations; theater scenes in which you can almost smell the props; opulent dinners; and scenes of spartan ostracism. This movie contains no Hollywood silliness: no fake battles between totally good and totally evil characters; no car chases or crashes; and no gun battles with impossibly high body counts. The first act confidently takes its time to develop, but the film is so poignant and vivid, and it grows and grows on you. Ewa Froling is apt as Emilie, Fanny and Alexander's mother. She is beautiful yet a real person - not a Hollywood bimbo. Bertil Guve, who plays 11-year-old Alexander, is a beautiful child and is very effective in conveying the joys, vexations and terrors of childhood. Jan Malmsjo is superb as the stolid bishop. You can feel the internal turmoil as he strives to govern himself. The cinematography is a joy to behold. The frame is always expertly populated with appointments, props and actors; and the colors are vivid and saturated - check out the reds and greens especially. \"Fanny and Alexander\" is probably the best movie ever made about an extended family.

Having heard of it endlessly throughout my childhood (pretty much unavoidable as a Swede), I was intrigued. After a few minutes, I decided I couldn't stop watching. I was completely mesmerized. I couldn't put my finger on it, but I had never seen anything like it before. I ended up watching the whole three hours (cinematic release, unfortunately) and postponing whatever plans I had. And it stayed with me. Fastforward a few years and last week, I watched this movie again, this time of older age, having seen several other Bergman movies, having read books about him and with an education in film studies. And how I cried. There is something about Ingmar Bergman that has an amazing capacity to mediate and depict feelings and thoughts I never knew how to put word to. This masterpiece, as the climactic final chapter to Ingmar Bergmans magnificent directing career, has everything. It leads you through life and death, through love and hate, through magic and disbelief, through hope and despair. Bergman has a reputation of being difficult and slow, and rightfully so (although many of his other films are fantastic too). But Fanny and Alexander is easier than his others, yet also more graceful and whole. Only once before have I experienced characters in a film resonating profound feelings and emotions of mine, and that was in Persona, another Bergman movie. Seeing so many of his actors once again on screen, this time of old age, many today deceased, join together because \"everything must carry on as usual\". I experienced a chilling encounter with life, mortality but also the hope in spirituality and beauty. Having dived into the great well of beautiful art that is Bergmans life and career, I am of course biased.

I have had F & A fans attack me about this but stand my ground. It is worth remembering that it is Ingmar Bergman who edited the theatrical version and made all the choices - word for word and scene by scene for what we see. Bluntly put, the long version 'explains' too much and in doing so, makes the viewer less intrigued and less involved. I give this a '10' but only for the 'movie' not the Swedish mini-series.",

            "content": "Well, maybe not quite great, but certainly a worthy effort for Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, who directed some great classic films in the '50s and '60s. Fanny and Alexander debuted in 1982 as a three-hour movie that eventually scored an Oscar for foreign film. It follows a young boy named Alexander and his sister and mother coping with the father's death. Eventually the mother marries a bishop, but he is a stern authority figure for Alexander, who soon comes to hate him for that.Why is it three hours? That's long (considerably longer than The Seventh Seal or Persona), and the first hour is kind of a waste. There's much about the Christmas celebrations of the family before the father's death. I guess it's to set up the family as well off and happy to contrast with the rest of the movie, but nothing much happens in the beginning and the farting uncle was a vulgar low point. However, the story picks up after the father dies and it becomes a rather engaging film.Fanny and Alexander can be compared to Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975)- a mother remarries, the son doesn't like his stepfather, the stepfather physically disciplines the boy. This one differs in that there's a minor supernatural element- Bergman's film is more metaphorical. The stepfather isn't necessarily evil (discipline is important), and Alexander told a rather hurtful story about him, saying ghosts told him that the stepfather locked up his prior family and was thus responsible when they died while trying to escape. Alexander had lied before, but given the other supernatural elements of the film, it's possible the story is true. Either way, the stepfather goes a little far in the punishment. There's a sense of injustice when the mother wants a divorce but learns it would mean losing custody of her children. The news of the stepfather's death may consequently be taken with ambivalence. The film itself is harder to be ambivalent about- the bulk of it is wonderful, colourful and engrossing, and should leave the viewer feeling satisfied.",

Fanny and Alexander is life through the eyes of a child. It's a highly autobiographical film that tells the story of young Alexander Ekdahl and his sister Fanny as they live their luxurious life with their mother and father. But unforeseen events strike down in their lives, making drastic changes that change the two children forever. This is an incredibly peculiar film that has an eccentrically offbeat feel to it. It is of a calibre that doesn't seem to fit a story about two children, but it does. This is a wondrous and magnificent tale that keeps you engaged and intrigued for its entire three hour run time.This film shows uncanny amounts of storytelling finesse. It tells its story so clearly and so eloquently that you forget it is just a film about children. You get the feeling that it is so much more, and indeed it is. It is a story about life, love, eternity, magic, mystery, the supernatural. The list goes on. It seems like a lot and that's because it is. This film covers a lot of ground both physical and psychological, even existential. There is so much to take in with this film that I'm not sure it is possible to understand it all after the first watch. It is easy enough to follow the surface storyline, which is excellent and greatly engaging. Underneath is a different story, however. What lies underneath twists and turns and makes you think more than most films do. It's almost overwhelming at times how much subtext is being quietly presented, especially when you don't even notice it until it's too late to decipher it all.I left this film with a lot of unanswered questions, but I certainly felt accomplished after finishing it. There's a certain nuance that causes you to feel something during this film, even if you can't quite place what that something is. For me I felt intellectual and existential as I absorbed everything that takes place in this film. I felt challenged by the depth and complexity of the film's subtextual level and so I greatly enjoyed interpreting the film for myself. But the great thing is that if you don't want to interpret or absorb this film you can still enjoy the fantastic storyline that lies on the surface. The story is told so skillfully and with such eloquence. Subplots weave in and out beautifully and the characters develop into such fascinating human beings as the film moves along. This film feels so real and you can feel all of the personal nuance Bergman inserted into the film, as it is very autobiographical.I'm not sure if the storyline itself is the autobiographical part. I'm sure parts of it reflect his life, but what I really think is the ultimate reflection is the look and feel of the film which Bergman illustrates so well. Fanny and Alexander is a somber film that ambles along quietly. It is subtle and immaculate. Bergman's quiet camera movements give the film its consistently calm yet distressed undertone. The film isn't loud or bustling, but there is a lot of turmoil underneath the quiet that is louder than any Michael Bay film. There is something so beautiful and so elegant about this film that you feel so engrossed in all of it, as well as touched by its somber beauty. This is true artistry at work. Bergman works his magic here to make a film that is so stunning and yet so subdued. It is a contrast that often comes off as too pretentious or too forced, but not in Fanny and Alexander. Here it is done just right.I'm not entirely sure what I've made of this film so far. It is so much to take in and so much to breath out. This is a beautiful film, no doubt, but it is just so difficult to get everything out of it that you know you can and this makes it difficult to truly fall in love with the film. I won't forget this film and I'm sure I'll revisit it one day to further my interpretation of the film. But what I can say for now is that it is a true work of art that deserves all recognition it gets. Few films can achieve the quiet illustriousness that Fanny and Alexander does, and that is something to be amazed by.",

This wasn't only rare for Bergman but it's rare to see a movie made by anyone that shows children, in their viewing of the adult world around them, in such a realistic and interesting way, involving both trauma and joy in these young lives. Yet the children (Alexander being more prominent than Fanny of the titles characters) don't get in the way of showing the great dynamics and complexities of the adult world as well. And these two worlds\u2014those of children and adults\u2014interact in pleasant and somewhat grim ways.From the start with Alexander alone in his grandmother's apartment, through an extravagant Christmas party, to the richness of the theater, to the much darker residence of the next chapter of this family's life, the movie is simply an exquisite piece of artistic beauty of early 20th Century Sweden. On a visual level Bergman has always been a master, but here he showed a more lively and ambitious side than he had before. The performances are all terrific, and I'm particularly fond of Bertil Guv as Alexander, Gun Wallgren as his reserved grandmother, and Jarl Kulle as his boisterous uncle.The movie, in spite of some quite dark elements, is quite a bit more upbeat than typical Bergman film. Those that may have admired his earlier works but felt them a little overbearing and depressing will likely welcome this ride with the great peaks and valleys of this family. Whether Alexander really has some power to see these images or if it's only a child's vivid imagination leaves room for exploration.My rating here is based primarily on the over five hour version. The two separate versions of the movie are both great experiences, with slightly different moods and emphasis, though I prefer the longer television one and that's the one I will look forward to seeing more times in the future. I understand they wanted to get a reasonable length for the theaters, but for me the shortened version lacks a lot of the richness of the other, removing great scenes especially from the back half of the film. Though either way you view it it's very emotionally involving as a work of art. It's a must see.",

Nothing special about her. The movie should have been called Alexander. Fanny has almost no lines and stands as a background in the scenes. Aaron, Ishmael... OK we see the religious names of prophets and etc. Alex do not even believe in God. When he was possessed by Ishmael, he created the fire event in the house. OMG!

Being a \"love it or hate it\" type of movie, only then you can decide whether the longer version is worthy of your time or not.\nI've seen the shorter version first and it left me hungry; it clearly feels rushed and incomplete; there are many moments that don't seem to interconnect very well. I admit, the cutting could have been done better for the shorter version; it feels too abrupt and affects the overall pacing. Nevertheless, it fueled my interest for the four-part miniseries; I wanted more details!\nJust as I anticipated, the longer version is clearly superior because of the extraordinary character development and the inclusion of many key scenes.\nIt really feels that Bergman gave the very best of him and \"squeezed\" all his inspiration into the making of this movie. Everything here is extremely colorful and rich-textured. Indeed, the cinematography and dialogues (especially monologue scenes) are very reminiscent of the works of Andrei Tarkovsky.

All of the typical Bergman ingredients are present, the extensive quiet scenes, the long shots and the metaphores and allegorices, all imvoking a sense of tragedy.With this one however, Bergman set out to give more of a childlike and hopeful feeling, basing parts of it on his own childhood, and it works very well. The actors all do an incredible job and the writing is very expressive and incredible.Overall, it's without a doubt one of Bergman's best and one of the best films of all time.

To say the film is less than a masterpiece would be to insult Mr. Bergman himself - every second of its 3 hour 9 minute run time is contemplative, fascinating moviemaking. The actors, while not as well known in the US - give a broad, effective hand in creating this piece. The imagery that Mr. Bergman gives is superbly composed; every shot is accounted for, every action thought out. The scenery is simply stunning; nothing less.Bergman's story follows two young children in Sweden in the 1900's. He takes us through their struggles, tragedies, warm moments and affectionate times with their family, the Ekdahls.Like his great \"Wild Strawberries\", each character has a story, a meaning, and a use to the story. Whether the film is as haunting as \"Strawberries\" is unquestionable - but both are different in their own, unique and beautiful ways. It is all masterfully produced, like all of Bergman's exhibitions; he takes attention to every detail - the colors, the visuals and the expression. In \"Fanny and Alexander,\" Bergman ultimately contemplated life itself with one of his very best films. Let us hope that Ingmar Bergman will be remembered for as long as he can.Fanny and Alexander (1982)4 STARS (OUT OF 4)Written and directed by Ingmar BergmanStarring Bertil Guve, Pernilla Allwin, Kristina Adolphson and Borge\nAhlstedtRated R189 minutes.",

I was blown away by _The Best Intentions_ and thought it was one of the most thought-provoking, emotionally engaging, and well-acted films I had seen in years. I was disappointed, though, by _Fanny and Alexander_. The story seemed jarring and incomplete at times (to be fair, I saw the 3-hour version, not the 5-hour version). I especially thought that the relationship between the Bishop and Emilie was depicted so sparely as to be nearly inexplicable, particularly in its decline- Emilie goes to the Ekdahl's, declaring her hatred for the Bishop, *at the same time* as we see the Bishop's cruel punishment of Alexander, not *after* the punishment. There is little indication of what has actually been happening prior to Emilie's visit to cause her hatred of her husband.I also found the scene with Ishmael to be so over-the-top that I found myself stepping back from the film to say, \"Oh, come on!\" Many scenes are beautifully filmed, and most of the actors are excellent.

With that in mind, \"Fanny and Alexander\" is Ingmar Bergman's acclaimed chronicle of a well-to-do Swedish family in the early 1900s, seen often from the perspective of two children, Fanny and Alexander.The early 1900s are brought to life with opulent, colorful sets and scenes and appropriate costumes. Stylistically this film blended two major streams. Firstly, it followed a style reminiscent of realist Ibsen-like play where we are presented with an attractive surface situation only to slowly learn of the deep problems and complex relationships of the characters beneath the surface. However, there is also a strong supernatural element to the story. From this angle, it was interesting how Bergman wove \"Hamlet\" into the film both with direct references to the play and with the motif of a recurring ghost.A chief adjective used to describe this film is \"accessible\". I agree with this description in the sense that the film touches profoundly on themes including death, sex, hardship, child punishment, imagination, infidelity, the role of women in marriages and ghosts for a lengthy duration without becoming boring or overwhelming.The first third of the story focuses on developing the adults and their relationships surrounding Fanny and Alexander. At first the film takes its time exploring the film's setting and then becomes increasingly engrossing as it focuses on characterizations and the film's interminably clever dialogue. The last two thirds of the film focus on the title characters, Fanny and Alexander and their touching story. All of the characters are well-developed and the performances are superb all-around from Fanny and Alexander to the adult roles. \"Fanny and Alexander\" is a meticulously constructed and engaging story of a Swedish family in the early 1900s.",

            "content": "Released in 1982 in a 5-hour version for Swedish television and cut to 180 minutes for theatrical release, FANNY AND Alexander was meant to be Ingmar Bergman's last film. Though the great auteur lived on another 25 years and even wrote and directed some smaller projects, FANNY AND Alexander can still be seen as a great capstone to decades of legendary cinema.FANNY AND Alexander deals with the great two preoccupations of Bergman's career, namely the absence of God and the unbridgeable gaps between human beings, but the result is wonderfully life-affirming. Fanny and Alexander are the children of Oscar and Emilie Ekdahl, actors in Uppsala circa 1907, but the film gives a panorama of the extended Ekdahl family, presided over by grandmother Helena, uncles Gustav Adolf (a restaurateur and the film's most comedic presence) and Carl (a professor who has fallen into debt and is trapped in a loveless marriage), their wives and children, and the selfless Jewish shopkeeper Isak Jacobi. This Swedish family lives in an Old World opulence that is hard to believe for audiences today, especially for a country whose class system by and large disappeared after the war. The rigid interaction among people not closely acquainted and the deference of servants to their employers make for gestures as alien to us 21st century viewers as a Noh play.In a way, FANNY AND Alexander is like those big novels of a century ago, by Tolstoy or Galsworthy, dealing with the vicissitudes of a whole family. The vaster family drama, however, is only a backdrop to a more personal one: Fanny and Alexander are soon orphaned, and their widowed mother eventually remarries, this time with a cruel clergyman. The children move from the freedom and comfort of the Ekdahl home to the austere bishop's place, where the children are punished for the slightest infraction by beatings or being locked up in the attic. The Ekdahls' torment living under the bishop is the great crisis of the film, and their unexpected liberation from it presents Alexander with a burden that he will carry into his budding manhood.The original television version is the way to see Bergman's final masterpiece. Don't be daunted by the length: 5 hours should not be a problem in an age when people will watch an entire season of a sitcom on DVD in one sitting. FANNY AND Alexander is not slow, meditative cinema like, say, Andrei Tarkovsky or B\u00e9la Tarr, but rather Bergman is always presenting the viewer with some engaging little drama. The theatrical cut, which Bergman made only with the greatest regret, is a very different (and much weaker film), cutting out much of the film's magical realism, the touching meditations on growing old represented by the character of the grandmother, and some vivid depictions of early 20th-century Sweden.",

Part one sees the Christmas celebration of the Ekdahl family, in a lush and almost choreographed manner, in what is basically a series of \"postcards\" of traditional Christmas fable-imagery. Nevertheless, after the jovial start, the film soon turns to a portrait of family disintegration, with various Ekdahl family members revealed to be in turmoil.Part two is much more typical Bergman fare, with a minimal and austere direction accompanying a tale of religious oppression and suppression. Sadly, while a powerful drama, like most dramas it suffers from a hyperbolic and too-dramatized plot, so that the director gets the point across (in this case the usual Bergman obsessions: the \"silence\" of god, the tyranny of the church).Part three, and perhaps the most impressive, is a galanty show cast across an Ekdahl-family friend's antique-shop and puppet-show.

            "content": "To say that Ingar Bergman is the quintessence of Nordic film\u2014not just Swedish film\u2014is up there on the list aptly titled \"Understatements of the 21st Century\".It can easily be argued that he is one of the most famous Scandinavian figures, among such names as Ibsen, Hamsun, and Kierkegaard.So, what does his legacy leave us with? What does Fanny och Alexander, his last film and gift to his movie-going audience, give us? It gives us a cinematic experience as long, rich, character-driven, and complex as his own directing career. It also tries to be a bit more uplifting than the rest of his works, but joy is apparently relative. Apparently as relative as one's enjoyment of this movie. To begin with, Fanny och Alexander is quite obviously an Ingmar Bergman film. One can very well understand this from the opening scene, in which Alexander, alone, hears a clock chiming in what is very clearly an opulent home. It is three in the afternoon. Then the audience observes with Alexander a naked female statue begin to dance.Weird stuff is in store.From this first scene it is fair to deduce that you're going to be getting a good amount of typical Bergman fair. I f you're familiar with Bergman, there are some themes you'd expect from a product carrying the Bergman label: involvement of the theatre, involvement of artists and jesters, faith and doubt, and an observation of the relationships between men and women. This last theme is not just an exploration of erotic relationships between females and males. Bergman also portrays husband and wife, husband and mistress, clergyman and widow, adulterer and wife, and basic human camaraderie. Above all, the panoply of relationships in Fanny och Alexander goes to show how much Bergman intended for this last film of his to be a portrait of reality. If it does not seem as uplifting as some claim it to be, at the very least the relationships portrayed in it are for the most part not anymore dysfunctional than relationships in the real world.One scene in particular also exemplifies this intended \"realism\": an older man takes a gaggle of children up the stairs, proceeding to amuse them with his prowess at flatulence. For a world-renowned,artistic director such as Bergman, this scene seems childish, inane, and superfluous, among other things. Inane it is, but for a reason\u2014this kind of behaviour is found in real life, even among the more well-to-do classes who are at the centre of this movie. Superfluous it may be too, but it is not the most superfluous bit about this movie. Perhaps it was due to the condensing of this film down from five hours to a mere three, but often times one will find that scenes drag on unnecessarily long, or are too long. Perhaps this is a technique Bergman utilised to add a further dimension of realism. But if this is the case, then Bergman's reasons for choosing which scenes he to drag out are puzzling at best. Christmas parties, especially ones where everyone is enjoying him- or herself, do not last as long in our memories as the Christmas party scenes in Fanny och Alexander.Undoubtedly the strangest and most controversial scene in the movie is the scene with Ismael and Alexander, in which Ismael (who is supposedly a man but actually a woman(?)) wants to become one with Alexander and help him fulfill his wish to end the life of his step-father. Ismael invades(?) Alexander's mind, and narrates the death of his step-father, step by gruesome step. It is not clear if these two actually caused the events which led to the death, or if Ismael has some kind of seeing power, or whether this bizarre narration was how Alexander's young mind choose to rationalise the death. One would presume this is an important bit of information if one wants to understand the story, but it is never clarified. The only thing that we do know is that the step-father really did die due to the events exactly as narrated by Ismael.So, what is reality? Perhaps the events Alexander encounters (talking with ghosts, a nonsensical layout of an apartment he cannot navigate, the bit with Ismael, and an eerie encounter with a puppet of God that at first strikes the audience as a dream sequence) is realism in that this is a realistic rendition of how children experience and rationalise reality. Alexander's family is not exactly \"normal\", either: his family owns a theatre, and is prone to drama. His mother is an actress, and does not behave as most other women would in the early 20th century. She is very much a child herself, and she admits at least once that for the majority of her life has not taken things very seriously.Alexander is a child. Children experience reality in a very fragmentary way, and magic is very much a real thing to them. Alexander also does not have any very good role models or adult figures from which to learn a good perspective of reality. As such, all of the strange things are perhaps Alexander's view of reality. Overall, this is a very Bergman film. It is pretty, complex, artistic, and driven by characters. Initially, too, it's full of whatever Bergman thought he should put into it. It is not clear, however, how much of this was essential to the film, and how much of what was essential to the film was lost when it was abridged. It ends up seeming superfluous and rambling at times. That, however, could very well be Bergman's intention. He was a director who knew what he wanted, and what he wanted made him famous. It is only to be expected that in what he knew was going to be last film, he'd direct whatever pleased him.",

            "content": "When I watched this film the first feeling I get is that it's like reading a great book. That's how comprehensive it is. That's how much depth there is, created by Bergman here. I normally say that films can't compare to books, but this film is something else. This film has characters that are fully formed.Bergman's created a magical, fantasy world that at times tends toward the supernatural, but then throughout the story is fleshed out as realistic as they come. This is what makes the extraordinary scenes even more extraordinary than it already is. I heard that this film is unlike Bergman's others. I'm not so sure about that. It's longer, yes but the longer version is far superior to the theatrical version. I loved the longer scenes that were added to the television release. There Bergman has more time for more magic, and more time to develop some of the secondary characters. The title gives away the two main characters, the two children Fanny and Alexander. However the film is also largely about their parents and relatives. You wonder why Bergman named the film after them then. It's probably to underline the difference in the attitudes of these two characters with Alex rising to the top, and Fanny in the background. I wonder whether this reflects with the realities that Bergman's painting for us. What I enjoyed the most is the relationship between the priest and one of the female characters. I won't give away the details, but some of the acting scenes between them and their family members is quite incredible. As is usual with Bergman, there's also some theatrical scenes but you'd expect that, again, from a family of actors. I love the way Bergman brings in the theatrical world into this family and it certainly rubs that magical touch that we come to love in his films. Fanny and Alexander may not be as fancy as Persona, but I feel that the quality here is much higher.",

            "content": "*****SPOILER ALERT********In first part of this movie, we meet a big family on the Christmas eve. This part is quite beautiful, but also a bit complex meeting all the new people at once. The story isn't a gripping one, but a movie grips you to the screen nonetheless. In the second part, the true plot of the movie begins. The Story of widowed (Oscar the theater man dies) Emma now marrying a bishop. And her 2 children from a previous husband. Fanny and Alexander. The bishop is strict! The movie does have a high watchability witch I did not expect. Still, some scenes are boring. Too long. Dull.. And most problematic of all, not likable! Ghosts? Weird thoughts etc..But I wasn't bored, maybe because I watched it on a DVD , via a VLC player and I adjusted the speed of the movie. Mostly watching it at double speed. Going normal only at very interesting scenes.I like the person to person, up close scenes, with some emotional charge and this movie has some of those.For some reason I really liked watching this movie, although there were quite a lot of things in it I did not like.I must say though, people, this is not a movie you have to love. I know I don't. So often, we fall into a trap where we look through a lens of \"what does the world think\". Even though \"world thinks\" (in this case the IMDb) that this movie is top-notch. If you don't feel that it is, just be honest. Not easy to rate this! Seriously. I just love how it's made. The pretty Swedish girls (Maj and Emma) , the sweet grandma (Eldke) , the kids, the bishop.. very colorful characters and an enjoyable ride. But I can't let go of things which I really did not like and of some \"flaws\" (the way Isaac smuggled those 2 kids is completely impossible, unless he was having a groundhog day, and played it 40 times till he got it right). And some totally not-likable scenes.Also, the kids. Not the best cast. I want to give it a 7 , but there is something almost magically that I just like so much. Just viewing people as they are. This movie is special that way.So, where do I draw the line.At...Real rating: 8.1 = 8/10!",

Yet it never appears episodic: it is all effortlessly contained in this huge, magnificent film.In the end, this is a celebration of the magic of cinema: one comes away exhilarated at the sheer range of what cinema - in the hands of a master - may be capable of.

Not his overall tone, mind you, but rather some of his specifics. Namely, the film was not over 4 hours it was just over 3 hours. Second, congratulations on your superb observation of the extremely obvious: yes, there is much symbolism in this film. It is, after all, a Bergman film. And finally, while the movie does center, at times, around Fanny and Alexander, there is much more to it than that--and much of the movie is NOT from their point of view.I don't mean to nitpick but little things like that bother me.

The question about the meaning of life and death is not interesting subject anymore.

The movie deserves all of the plaudits it has received, as well as its Oscar (Isn't it interesting that one of the major characters is named Oscar) so there is nothing more to add. My only question is that because of the title, it seems that Bergman is holding back something from us about \"Fanny,\" It doesn't seem to make sense that she be part of the title, yet have little consequence in the narrative other than being a foil for her slightly older brother. I wonder if this question had ever been addressed to Bergman before he died.",

Naturally, this title kept coming up.  I thought that it was a gratuity to the famous name who got to claim the film as his own.  Not true.  \"Fanny and Alexander\" is not just one of those art house films you see because it's good for you and it broadens your understanding of cinematic techniques, but that it accomplishes what all great art at least sets out to do:  reveal something pivotal about the world around us while making the most of its medium (the \"little world,\" as the film's actor characters would say).  This movie is personal without being impenetrable and mysterious without being pretentious.  The key visual metaphors in this film are in deed beautiful, but also easy to understand within the contexts of a touching story.  For instance, the people who are important to Alexander persistently appear in the film even after they die.

The acting is extremely good but it is the cinematography that is excellent.  The contrast in colours to match the film is most noticeable (but not in a bad way) mirroring the story, rich deep reds, browns and gold with touches of deep green velvet, for the first two acts, then a change to chrometone with touches of pale blue and pale green for the next two culminating in a return to the warm pallet but lifted with refreshing white, pink and yellow.  The film occasionally highlights everyday objects, which also gives emphasis to particular parts of the story, acting as exclamation marks.I highly recommend this film.

Teenage brothers Alexander and Fanny Ekdahl lead relatively joyful and exuberant lives with their extended and wealthy paternal family, led by the family's matriarch, their grandmother, Helena Ekdahl. The openness of family culture is exemplified by Helena's now deceased husband, who eventually became best friends with one of her lovers, a Jewish doll maker named Isak Jacobi, and her uncle Gustav Adolf's open attachment to one of the family maids, Maj, who everyone in the family loves, even Gustav Adolf's wife, Alma. Among the brothers, Alexander in particular inherited the family's love of storytelling, his parents and grandmother who are actors and who run their own theater. Things change for Alexander and Fanny when their father, Oscar, dies shortly after Christmas 1907. Although she truly believes she loves him, the children's mother, Emilie, decides to marry Bishop Edvard Vergerus, whom she met as an officiant at Oscar's funeral. She also wants a father figure for her children. Going into the wedding, Emilie has inclinations that it will be a very different life from the one she had with the Ekdahls, but she is not prepared for the hard, austere, rigid life that Edvard rules with an iron fist. Emilie, Alexander, and Fanny end up being prisoners in the bishop's harsh, humorless house. While Alexander goes head-to-head with his stepfather and tries to learn how to keep his own principles by obeying Edvard, Emilie tries to figure out a way to regain her children's own destiny, as Edvard will not consent to divorce and his \"desertion\" in the eyes of law means that Alexander and Fanny would become his pupils.",
