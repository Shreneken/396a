            "content": "I've always held a special place in my heart and mind for this second installment in the \"Star Trek\" movie series.  Mostly, because this is a movie that appeals to both places.Not only is this movie loaded with the original characters from the series, it also touches on such subjects as revenge, family, duty, age and, of course, sacrifice.  That was the best thing about the series - that it touched on topics that were (pardon the expression) universal, no matter the species.Everyone is uniformly fine right down the line, especially Montalban's Khan (returned from the \"Space Seed\" episode of the original series); all hatred, vengeance and single-minded of desire to see his enemy laid out before him. Namely, Kirk.Alley is rather fetching as Saavik and it's a shame she wasn't carried over to the next film.  I can't help but, seeing her on TV anymore, to expect her to raise an eyebrow in contemplation.  Buttrick makes a complex character out of David, the son Kirk never knew he had.  Hurt feelings and resentment meld somewhat explosively with a new-found father/son relationship.And what can one say about Spock, Bones, Sulu, Chekov, Uhura and Scotty? They are characters all of us grew up with and, pivotal to the plot at hand or not, it's always good to see them.  For anyone who hasn't seen the movie, I won't discuss it in great detail. The story is simple enough (scientists find way to rejuvenate life on dead planets; Khan finds escape from prison planet, vows revenge on Kirk), but there is one plot point that will, if you are unfamiliar with it, blow you away.  Suffice it to say, never has friendship been elocuted so well in this or any movie before or since.Ten stars and a special Kobuyashi Maru simulation for \"Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan\".  Watch it: it'll make you feel young again.",

            "content": "STAR TREK: THE WRATH OF KHAN was another miracle moment in a franchise that has had more than it's share of such moments. Paramount never intended to make a sequel to STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE (a philosophy it would continue to embrace, after each film!), and, when, after intense lobbying by Gene Roddenberry, a few 'Trekkers' in the studio hierarchy, and a lot of fans, the studio finally caved in, they reduced the budget, dramatically, almost daring the production team to create a film of quality.In an inspired move, Harve Bennett, a television veteran, was brought in to executive produce, and his sensibilities, honed on the budgetary restraints of the small screen, helped to get the most out of the available funds. A director of the stature of Robert Wise was out of the question, but Bennett and Roddenberry were impressed by young Nicholas Meyer, and his one directorial effort, the cult SF favorite, TIME AFTER TIME, and the 37-year old leaped at the opportunity to tackle another SF film. Contrary to popular belief, Meyer was NOT familiar with the series, but he quickly immersed himself with the series' episodes, then looked at Harve Bennett's script outline, and the two of them then hammered out a shooting script. Gone would be the sterile, monochromatic future envisioned in the first film, replaced with warm colors, frequent references to classic literature, and the sense of camaraderie that had made the original series so popular.\nBoth men had been impressed by Ricardo Montalban's charismatic Khan, in the episode, 'Space Seed', and agreed in bringing back the superhuman, yet sympathetic villain for the film. Leonard Nimoy provided the film's theme; with rumors of a possible new TV series still circulating, the actor, not wishing to be subjected to the weekly grind, suggested 'killing off' Spock, in some heroic fashion. Bennett loved the idea, although he wisely left a 'hook' in the script, in case Nimoy changed his mind, and he and Meyer could now address both the passage of time, and death, issues that were relevant, as the original cast were beginning to show their years!William Shatner, after the stinging reviews of his stilted performance in ST:TMP, needed a strong script to provide 'damage control', and he got it. In perhaps his finest performance, he dominates the screen, whether ruminating on his own mortality with McCoy, explaining how he 'beat' the Kobiyashi Maru scenario by cheating (\"I HATE to lose\"), discovering that after years as an interstellar lothario, he is a father (and by the one woman he truly 'loved'), playing 'cat and mouse' with Khan, or facing the death of his best friend, Spock. Both decisive and likable, Shatner's Kirk is the glue that holds ST:TWOK together, and he is brilliant.Leonard Nimoy, getting every actor's dream, a chance to 'die' onscreen, gives Spock a poignancy that is, ultimately, heartbreaking; DeForest Kelley, excellent as Dr. McCoy, not only offers righteous indignation over the implications of the Genesis Project, but projects such an obvious affection for both Kirk and his 'sparring partner', Spock, that, far more than in the first film, you can see the nearly symbiotic link between the three leads. The rest of the original cast, despite small roles, still have far more to do than in the first film, and are obviously enjoying themselves (except, understandably, Walter Koenig's 'Chekov', when the parasite is put into his ear!)Of the other leads, Ricardo Montalban lustily chews up the scenery as an 'Ahab'-influenced older Khan; a pre-'Cheers' Kirstie Alley gives Vulcan Lieutenant Saavik far more sex appeal than did her successor in the role, Robin Curtis; Paul Winfield makes the most of his brief role as Chekov's new boss, the doomed Captain Terrell; and Bibi Besch provides a combination of intellect, toughness, and affection playing Kirk's lost love, Carol Marcus. The only disappointment is Merritt Butrick, as Kirk's newly-revealed son, David; in a poorly-written role, he has little to do but gripe about Kirk, before and after he discovers their relationship.The film score was composed by 29-year old James Horner, who was told not to incorporate any of Jerry Goldsmith's themes from ST:TMP; he later admitted that he sneaked a bit of it in, anyway, along with Alexander Courage's original TV themes. While lacking Goldsmith's grandeur, the music is evocative and sweeping, and Horner would return to score STAR TREK: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK.Despite budget restraints, ST:TWOK had terrific FX (particularly during the Mutaran Nebula sequence), and was able to reuse the space dock and voyage sequences from ST:TMP quite effectively. The space battle scene between the Enterprise and Reliant is one of the best sequences in the entire 'Star Trek' film series.ST:TWOK was a HUGE success, both with critics and fans, vindicating Gene Roddenberry's faith in the franchise, and the decision to use Meyer as the director. And in a twist worthy of Scheherazade in 'The Arabian Nights', Spock's death created such an uproar that Paramount HAD to keep the series alive, just to resolve the issue.From a one-shot film deal, a THIRD film would be produced!",

            "review_title": "Moby Dick in Space",
            "content": "\"The Wrath of Khan\" isn't a science fiction film as much as it's an old-fashioned adventure story dressed up in vintage science fiction tropes. The plot: the crew of the Starship Enterprise, led by the now iconic Captain James T. Kirk, find themselves embroiled in a deadly cat and mouse game with Khan Noonian Singh, a genetically engineered superhuman. The story is pure pulp, but don't be put off. Director Nicholas Meyer's work here is fabulous, and his screenplay beautiful.Meyer, a great writer with a fondness for literary classics, bathes his film with references to everything from \"Moby Dick\" to \"The Sea Hawk\". As a result, the film has a very nautical feel. Spaceships trade massive broadsides, our cast's uniforms, dialogue and behaviour are now informed by that of the 19th century British Navy, and the film's climactic battle feels like a cross between a U-boat suspense film and Herman Melville's famous whale hunt.Meyer has long had a special fondness for 19th century novelists. His first big splash came in 1974 with \"The Seven Percent Solution\", a Sherlock Holmes novel that hit the #1 spot on the New York Times Bestseller list, stayed on the charts for 40 weeks and resurrected the Holmes pastiche craze the way \"Wrath of Khan\" jolted new life into Star Trek.He followed that up with two sequel novels, \"The West End Horror\" and \"The Canary Trainer\". The former had Holmes and Watson brushing shoulders with Bernard Shaw, Gilbert and Sullivan, Bram Stoker, Oscar Wilde, and other Victorian theatre dudes. The latter gave a Holmesian spin to Gaston Leroux's \"Phantom of the Opera\".So Meyer delights in weaving nods to great literature into modern narratives. His first directorial success was the time-travel escapade \"Time After Time\", a fun romp which featured H.G. Wells pursuing Jack the Ripper across modern San Francisco. He takes a similar approach with \"Khan\", retooling Melville's \"Moby Dick\" and placing Ahab's lines on the lips of Khan, the film's larger than life villain. A worn copy of the book even appears on Khan's shelf, alongside King Lear and the Bible. In the movie, a character called Spock also gives Kirk a copy of Dickens' \"A Tale of Two Cities\" for a birthday present.Several years later, when Meyer returned to direct \"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\" (the last featuring the original crew and arguably the second-best film in the franchise) he gave it an Agatha Christie-style \"cosy\" murder mystery, Shakespeare-quoting Klingons (and a Shakespeare influenced title), named a Klingon prison asteroid after the penal colony that held Captain Nemo in Jules Verne's \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\", and had Spock both quote Sherlock Holmes and refer to the coolly logical Great Detective as \"one of my ancestors.\" Meyers sure does love classical literature.But woven into \"Khan's\" cat-and-mouse plot are also meditations that humanise the larger-than-life James T. Kirk. Here, at last, our long-time galactic hero faces the fact that he's not the young space cowboy he used to be.Early in the film we're introduced to the Kobayashi Maru, a \"no win scenario\" in which every star ship captain must face death. Kirk, we learn, is the only person to have ever beat this \"no win scenario\". How? He reprogrammed various computer simulators, thereby changing the rules of the game. As a result, the film has a beautiful tension. On one hand we have the Captain Kirk who repeatedly wins all scenarios, who knows only success, who can't deal with defeat, who always finds a way to break the rules and change the terms of engagement. And on the other hand, we have Kirk's confrontation with his own mortality, his need for glasses, his unscheduled reunion with an ex-lover and his estranged son. This tension, between life and death, immortality and mortality, success and failure, is epitomised by the \"Genesis\" device, a super weapon in the film which has to power to both create and destroy.Shortly after Khan's first attack on the Enterprise, which leaves a new crew-member dead, Kirk swallows the bitter pill that his own failures almost brought about their destruction. He goes on to find a brilliant way out of this particular \"no win scenario\", of course, but the consequences of his escape nevertheless force him to confront the holes in his armour. Our ageing admiral and crew may descend to self-parodying plastic action figures in some later entries, but in this movie they're allowed to be vulnerably human, as themes of pursuit, age, death, and regeneration appear through the phaser fire.On the other side of the fence, we have Khan. Here's one mightily ticked-off arch villain, quoting 19th century literature and Klingon proverbs while slitting throats and placing space bugs in people's brains. Give him an eye-patch and it'd be \"Arrrr! Avast ye!\" all the way. Miraculously, though, Meyer keeps it all under control. Even that moody old bird Pauline Kael devoted extra column inches to praising the way these two classically trained actors chewed scenery and bounced off one another in \"Khan\".If nothing else, \"Khan\" reminds us that sometimes, somehow, a Hollywood picture comes along and proves the creaky old notion that talent counts more than production dollars. There's got to be some moral in the fact that the Star Trek movie with the smallest budget (by far) and fewest resources is still the dominant favourite and the only one that doesn't feel, one way or another, like a factory-line franchise product designed solely to provide money for the stockholders.8.9/10 - \"Khan\" has everything you could ask for in a good adventure film: sympathetic, well-drawn heroes, a terrific villain, exciting outer-space showdowns, wow factor, smart direction, a fine tuned script and a touch of reflective depth (the Enterprise crew finally faces up to age and mortality, and questions about the wisdom and consequences of playing God are hinted at). Oh, and the music is awesome as well.",

The battles between the Enterprise and Reliant are tense and spectacular.  The one thing that sets Star Trek II apart from all the others (which are good in their own way) is the death of Spock.  I can never make it through the end without shedding at least a few tears.  It starts to get you when Bones' voice comes back over the intercom instead of Scotty's, and when Kirk looks over to Spock's empty chair, you know something's wrong. The scene that follows is one of the best acted death scenes of all time, and it is also the saddest.  Spock's final line is the kicker, and with that scene you understand the entire relationship that Kirk and Spock had and you feel Kirk's loss.\"Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most.......human.\"",

            "content": "Wrath is based on one of the best episodes of The Original Series of Star Trek.  The episode, Space Seed, introduced Kahn Noonian Singh, a genetically engineered super-warrior from the 20th century who survived in cryogenic freeze until the crew of the Enterprise found his derelict space ship and revived him.  Alas, his instinct to conquer survived as well, and only after an epic struggle is Kirk able to deposit Kahn and his band of supermen in permanent exile on a garden planet.Fifteen years later, a cataclysm has left that planet barren, and Kahn bitter about his plight, when along comes the Enterprise, not knowing they have returned to Kahn's home planet.  Kahn escapes and the game is on.This is undoubtedly the best of the Star Trek movies, and in fact, the best of everything that was best about Star Trek TOS.  There is heroism, epic conflict, a fully satisfying story, and deliciously over the top acting by Shatner, Nimoy and, the main course, Ricardo Montalban, reprising his original role, with all the menace and drama of, say, Sir Anthony Hopkins' Oscar winning turn as Hannibal Lechter.The writing is great, and why not, it was by Harve Bennett, by way of Melville, and Roddenberry's unforgettable characters, as indelibly etched on our psyches as any fairy tale of our youth, were never brighter, more heroic, more magnificent.  In the genre, there is simply nothing better, and there never will be.  It took decades to hone and refine these characters, for us to come to love them, and for them to reach the point in their palpably real lives to reflect with self-doubt and angst on lives that we accept as being as real as our own.  This isn't a movie, it's a documentary, and a time capsule, and a worthy monument to the best cast in the best Sci-Fi Western ever made.",

            "content": "I'm not a Star Trek fan. I have watched the show a few times, and I don't dislike it; but it's not the sort of thing that I would find myself watching week after week. Basically what I'm saying is: I'm not a Trekkie. I did, however, find lots to enjoy about this movie. The plot revolves around Captain Kirk, who has now been promoted to Admiral Kirk and is going through a mid-life crisis. However, his crisis couldn't have come at a worse time; as it has come on the eve of the testing for a new creation, known as 'Genesis', and not only that but a man named Khan has just been found on a planet that Kirk exiled him on, and he doesn't just want to give Kirk a friendly hug.The acting in the film isn't great, actually, it's about the standard that you would expect from a TV show (which is no coincidence, I'm sure). I'm not sure if all the cast of the shows is present, because I didn't watch it often, but most of the main ones seem to be here; Spock, Kirk, Scottie, Sulu etc. Also joining them is Kirstie Alley, in the role of a young Vulcan commander and Ricardo Montalban who camps it up and dons a silly costume for the title role of Kirk's opposite number; Khan. His performance was the standout of the film for me; he's deliciously over the top, but despite that he comes across as believable as his mannerisms fit the character profile that he is portraying. Unfortunately, non of the show's best known baddies, the Klingons make an appearance. In fact, aside from the Vulcans, there are no aliens in the movie.One thing that surprised me about the film is the meatiness of the characters. As it's a film of a TV show, I wasn't expecting any development or for the characters to step out of their character arks, but they are surprisingly well done. Some characters also go through a change during the movie (some more than others), which is nice to see. The pace is also a good thing about the movie, as it doesn't let up and manages to stay interesting all the way through. One thing that worried me before watching the movie is that I would get bored as I don't know the show, but that didn't become a problem at any point.I am proof that you don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy this movie. There's more than enough for the casual movie fan to enjoy about it, it's an entertaining romp and overall I give this Star Trek film a 'G' for 'good' rating.",

Spock monitor trainees at Starfleet Academy, another vessel from the United Federation of Planets is about to try out the planet-creating Genesis Device in a seemingly deserted portion of space.In the process, two of Kirk's officers are captured by Khan, an enemy Kirk thought he'd never see again.Once more, Kirk takes the Enterprise's helm, where he meets Khan's ship in an intergalactic showdown.......It's easy to see why this is regarded as one of the finest Star Trek films ever made, it's a classy affair, and all the cast know that they are making something rather groundbreaking.Whilst the first film isn't as anywhere near as bad as you may have heard, the makers were basically cashing in on Star Wars, and the film is nothing more than a psychedelic experience featuring the cast spending the majority of the film in awe of special effects.Now this is way darker, and from the moment the credits roll, this is more of an adult orientated affair.Shatner is pretty restraint in this, taking the film and narrative as serious as the writers, but in hindsight, he was no match for Montalban.In his role as Khan, not only is he the most formidable villain in Trek law, he is also one of cinemas most notorious villains to boot.Every syllable he utters is delivered with so much class, so much flamboyance, he absolutely obliterates everybody else on screen, no wonder Shatner doesn't share any scenes with him, other than that of a monitor.It's surprising that Montalban wasn't nominated for an Academy award, prosthetic chest or not, he is the reason why this film works so well.Take away the science fiction elements of the film, you have a classic western, good guy versus bad guy, featuring a wonderful stand off in the final act.The rest of the cast are as good as you'd expect, and the final fifteen minutes of the film are just cinematic gold.",

Longevity, apparently is one of those powers. Exiled on Seti Alpha 5, Khan and his crew were to have a chance at life in a place where they could no longer interfere with Star Fleet and the affairs of man. But Chekov inadvertently stumbles up on the shell of the Botany Bay, Khan's ship, and realizes immediately what a mistake he has made. He attempts to flee, but it is too late.Khan wants to avenge the death of his wife; an event for which he blames Admiral James Tiberius Kirk, and he will not rest until he can extract his revenge. It seems Kirk never checked on Khan and his crew, and sometime after they were deposited there, Seti Alpha 5 became a desolate wasteland with murderous creatures which burrow and move beneath the sands.Meanwhile, Kirk is going through what seems to be a mid-life crisis which is interrupted to deal with the travesties of space, and one of Kirk's many love interests, Dr. Carol Marcus, has developed the \"Genesis Project;\" a device which can create new planets from dead ones, asteroids, and the like. But were this device to be used where life already existed, it would destroy the present life in favor of the new matrix, thereby making it a very devastating and dangerous weapon in the wrong hands.Khan has learned of Genesis, and seeks to lay his hands on it, thus tying the plot to the sub-plot, and making for a very entertaining endeavor.The space battles are extremely well done. The effects are startlingly good, even by today's standards, and the effects of Genesis inside the Genesis Cave, are absolutely brilliant.The new characters; IE: Savik, a Vulcan addition to the crew of the Enterprise creatively and beautifully portrayed by Kirstie Alley; Dr. Carol Marcus and her son; are very well developed without creating long, slow scenes in which to accomplish the task. There is one slow scene in the entire movie, and that comes just before we get to see the Genesis Effect inside the Cave.This is the infamous movie in which Spock gives up his life to save the ship and his friends. I remember picket lines outside Paramount Studios for weeks after this movie was released, protesting Leonard Nimoy's retirement from the series in such a manner.All in all, of the movies in which the original cast stars, I would have to say it is a toss up between 2, 4, & 6 for the title of \"Best\" of these movies.

Of all the Star Trek films it's the only one to have origins directly from the cult television series.And the origin is from the episode Space Seed where the Eneterprise finds a ship floating in space with cryogenically frozen people of all kinds on board. Their leader is Khan Nooriam Singh played by Ricardo Montalban. What they are is a group of genetically enhanced human beings who back in the day tried to take over. Earth justice at the time being what it was, they were not killed, but frozen and were out there in space for several hundred years.William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk had a close run battle with this crowd again and they were sentenced to a different kind of exile, on a barren planet where they would have to struggle to maintain life itself. Fifteen years later Khan is down, but not out. He's out for blood now because the wife he took from the original Enterprise crew is dead and he blames Kirk. Khan's also after bigger game as well, something called the Genesis Project, a thing that scientists Bibi Besch and Paul Winfield have been working on. A method of generating life itself on a dead world.Khan's a genetically enhanced being both physically and mentally which makes him maybe the most dangerous foe Kirk faced on the three year run of the television series. He hasn't lost a step, but even a genius can't think of everything even if he's taken over a starship of his own. With both the television episode Space Seed and the film the Wrath of Khan it could well be argued that Ricardo Montalban got his career role, maybe he's known for playing Khan better because of Trek fans than for being the inscrutable Mr. Roarke on Fantasy Island.

Another sub-par effort would surely have killed the franchise, but this instalment was anything but sub-par, and led to two directly related sequels.The idea was great. Take a popular episode of the TV series (\"Space Seed\") and update it. Use the main guest star from the TV series (Ricardo Montalban) and have him reprise his role as Khan Noonian Singh, the late 20th century warlord who was cryogenically frozen and then \"rescued\" by Captain Kirk and ultimately stranded on Ceti Alpha V after trying to seize control of the Enterprise. Here we see Khan taking his revenge on Kirk for the events of 15 years before.The cast in general is excellent in this one, although - and I find this typical of the movies - both DeForest Kelley (Dr. McCoy) and James Doohan (Scotty) seem to have some trouble reprising their roles. There are some interesting new characters (Saavik, played by a very young Kirstie Alley) and the Drs. Marcus (Bibi Besch as Carol and Merritt Butrick as David - adding some new context to Kirk's life as his ex-lover and son, respectively.) It's a tense movie filled with all the fun stuff that we expect from Star Trek, and a very good climax with the appropriate open-endedness setting us up for the inevitable sequel.It isn't without its problems, mind you. How do Khan and Chekhov know each other? Chekhov wasn't part of the crew in Season 1 when \"Space Seed\" aired (or at least Walter Koenig wasn't part of the cast.) William Shatner (as expected) goes a bit over the top at times (his anguished cry of \"KHAAAAANNNNNNNN!\" while shaking with fury comes to mind.) It seems strange to me that no one would have checked on Khan after his stranding on Ceti Alpha V, that no one seemed to know that Ceti Alpha IV had exploded (when the Reliant came within scanning distance of the system shouldn't someone have said \"uh, Captain Terrell, there's one less planet here than there should be) and that it didn't even seem to have occurred to Chekhov (who apparently and inexplicably knew Khan so well) that this was the system where Khan had been stranded.Still, it's a fun movie that made Star Trek worth watching again.7/10",

But then we got Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan which is one of those movies that I have a hard time calling anything other than perfect.\"And I stand by that. I really like the first Star Trek movie. I kind of wish the series had continued in that vein. However, the return of Khan Noonian Singh is damn near perfect.Perfection isn't really an attainable goal for art. Defining perfection in something that has so much subjectivity towards its measurement is a fool's errand, but Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is so perfectly constructed that it borders on fulfilling the promise of that word.The opening is a training simulation for the new crew of the USS Enterprise. Commanded by Lieutenant Saavik, a young Vulcan, the mission is the first mention of the Kobayashi Maru in Star Trek. It's a purposefully impossible mission with no right answer designed, as Admiral Kirk explains after the simulator has been smashed in the name of education, in order to test the character of the captain in charge. That no-win scenario is a motif that continually comes up both explicitly and implicitly through the movie.At the same time, we get our most literal manifestation of the movie's central theme (rebirth) in the form of the Genesis project. The crew of the Starfleet vessel the USS Reliant are looking for a lifeless planet (supposedly in the Goldilocks Zone around a star) in order to test a device capable or rearranging matter at a subatomic level from lifelessness to vibrancy. There's a single sign of something down below, so Lieutenant Chekov and his captain transport down only to find Khan.I've read complaints about the backstory to what happen to Ceti Alpha Five, the planet Khan was marooned on by Admiral Kirk. The story is that the neighboring planet exploded without explanation, throwing off the axis of the fifth planet and turning it into a desolate wasteland from pole to pole. The idea that a planet would explode and no one would notice is apparently too far for some people. However, one thing that Star Trek is often way too good at is to make space feel small. The implication that something as catastrophic as a planet exploding and no one in Starfleet noticing simply because they weren't looking expands the space between places in the universe.Anyway, Khan takes control of Reliant and starts on a double mission. On the one hand, he wants to simply exact vengeance on the man who marooned him, Admiral James T. Kirk. On the other hand, he wants the Genesis device and the power within it. Khan wants a rebirth in two ways, to reset his own life through an act of revenge and to wield the power of creation in his hand, perhaps creating a new world for him and his people.Refusing to yield to death and defeat comes up in the first confrontation between Kirk and Khan. Khan tricks Kirk to the point of crippling the Enterprise from the Reliant. Given a moment to allow Khan to gloat and demand information on Genesis, Kirk finds a way around his no-win scenario by hacking the Reliant and forcing it to lower its protective shields, giving Enterprise a chance to cripple Reliant in turn. This recurrence of the theme, and the fact that Kirk is constantly able to find ways to cheat around certain defeat, is all setup for the end of the film, which I'll get to in a moment.Before I get to the end, I want to talk about motifs. The movie has a few motifs running through it, and what tickles me most about them is the literary aspect of them. There are two books referenced in the film, A Tale of Two Cities and Moby Dick (we also see a copy of Paradise Lost). Both of them on their own act as motifs to reinforce the central idea of sacrifice. They are about death in the face of either letting others live or in the service of exacting vengeance upon a foe. Carton's final words get repeated by Kirk in the final moments of the film, and Ahab's final words get repeated by Khan in his final moments.The third act of the film, in which the above quotes occur, is one of the finest third acts written and executed in popular entertainment. Everything the movie had been building up to comes to fruition. The relationships between characters (particularly Khan and Kirk, and Kirk and Spock) come to satisfying denouements. The themes come to interesting conclusions. The motifs come to complete fruition. And, on top of it all, the execution of the exciting parts (the splodey parts) are excellent.Roger Ebert, in his review of the movie upon its original release, actually downplayed the movie's special effects, calling them functional but not particularly great. I honestly don't understand the criticism. Here I sit, almost 40 years after the movie's release, and I still feel like the effects look fantastic. The key was the techniques and the special effects team's understanding of the limits of the techniques. The ships are all models (as would be expected from the early 80s), and they honestly look fantastic. The model of the Enterprise was built for the over-budgeted (and underappreciated) Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and its detail is amazing. The Reliant was built to seemingly the same standard and holds up to the camera just as well as the Enterprise. As they models that lack any moving parts lumber through the emptiness of space and then the nebula of the movie's crescendo, they never look fake and they never look small. There's real scale to them. The destruction to the models, the scarring and the lost parts, never looks less than convincing. They're simple but effective.On top of that, the rest of the technical presentation is top notch. The editing keeps the action crisp and moving. The music is one of James Horner's best scores (which he cribbed heavily for Aliens). The acting, even from , is grounded and effective. Ricardo Montalban finds a great spot between campy and dramatic, especially as he spits his last breath at Kirk.The movie's great from beginning to end. The narrative is so perfectly constructed and the execution is so marvelously realized all while finding genuine emotion at the ultimate sacrifice one man makes for his crew. I've always been a bit partial to Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country as my favorite of the entire franchise, but as time goes on, I find myself falling in more and more with the consensus that Khan's quest for vengeance is the best big screen adventure of the Enterprise.",

Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock convince him to take on a mission which sounds simple, but with the appearance of the mysterious Khan, things get a little tricky.After the dreadfully boring original, the franchise decided to step it up, and give us a worthy Star Trek movie. While it's not a classic like fans claim, it's still very enjoyable and a memorable movie that holds up well. Ricardo Montalban gives a performance for the ages of Khan, and some of the scenes he had with Shatner are classical. Star Trek's main fault was that nothing of note ever happened really, here the filmmakers made sure to give us some entertaining things, and things we could pay attention too. The final showdown is great, and it was a fitting follow-up, considering the disappointment I felt with my Star Trek viewing. Performances. William Shatner is great as Kirk. He's focused, likable, and managed to inject charisma this time around. Ricardo Montalban is utterly spellbinding as Khan. His menacing attitude I could never forget, and his actions where we first see him appear on screen I will never forget. DeForest Kelley and Leonard Nimroy both give fine performances as Spock and Dr. McCoy. Kristie Alley is actually pretty good in an early role. Unfamiliar Trekkies might be amused to see her here. Bottom line. It's not the perfect follow-up many claim, but it's certainly great entertainment. For Star-Trek beginners, I would seriously recommend this film as your starting point. 8/10",

            "content": "Having been one of the shows that was part of my childhood and growing up, the original 'Star Trek' still holds up as great and ground-breaking, even if not perfect.'Star Trek: The Motion Picture', to me, is a better film than its reputation but was also a disappointment and could have been much better. Every film franchise has to start somewhere, and 'The Motion Picture' paved the way to better films. Of which the second film 'The Wrath of Khan' is among the best, a strong contender for the best. Much appreciated its darker tone, emotional wallop and that it was much better paced and action-oriented than 'The Motion Picture'.It may not be as visually stunning as 'The Motion Picture' (the production values is one of only two areas that is done better in that film to here), and William Shatner still goes overboard in his acting. Then again Shatner was never known for subtlety and when he was restrained (like 1958's 'The Brothers Karamazov') those instances were rare.'The Wrath of Khan' is hardly cheap-looking though, having better production values generally than the original series. The sets are more elaborate, the photography is moody and stylish and the special effects are hardly hokey. While Jerry Goldsmith's music is missed a little, James Horner is more than up to the plate, not as rousing but typically beautifully orchestrated and high in the thrills factor. The sound effects are suitably eerie.Writing is an improvement, getting to the point more and less talk heavy, it is very intelligent and thought-provoking without being overly serious. The story has no pacing issues, being much tighter and with much more going on. Credit is due too for exploring (beautifully) dark and universal themes. Nicholas Meyer is a more than welcome replacement, showing more of a sense of loyalty to the original series while bringing his own style without being too ambitious.Acting, with the exception of Shatner, is good. Leonard Nimoy has rarely been more moving, with a truly powerful final scene, and Riccardo Montalban rarely so deliciously campy (without ever hurting the film's tone and still being entertaining) and also menacing. No pointless or underwritten characters here.Overall, great and one of the best 'Star Trek' films. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The writing is inspired, so the plot twists and turns are credible and the viewer doesn't get lost.

Spock and Kirk make a classic heroic team in this movie, and use guile more than brute force to engage their enemy, the \"Khan\" of this movie. Ricardo Montalban is delectable in his role as the villain, and is a perfect counterpoint to Kirk as an adversary.This movie, more than any other \"Star Trek\" movie, inspired a multitude of parodies, which ranged from making fun of Montalban's accent to Shatner's over-the-top scream when Kirk is trapped inside of a planet: \"KKKHHHAAANNN!\" To be fair, it's not as over-the-top as Daniel Day-Lewis screaming \"DRAINAGE!\" in \"There Will Be Blood,\" but watching Mr. Shatner's face scrunch in mock-anger is still a classic scene of cinematic melodrama.Fans of science fiction will enjoy \"The Wrath of Khan.\" It's more intelligent than the \"Star Wars\" movies, and the action is more subdued, but the cast's acting and the plot are still engaging and entertaining.",

This film is really 80's, but, hey, every decade has its own style. I've heard that \"The Wrath of Khan\" is MUCH better than any of the other Star Trek movies, so I guess I won't be seeing them, or maybe I will, to see how bad they really are......anyway, if you like sci-fi, space, comedy, and a little bit of tragedy (actually, the saddest part was when Khan died--where is the Star Trek gang gonna get all their good villains now??) then you should definitely see this movie.

More action packed and interesting than the original Star Trek movie, it brings the TV show cast onto the big screen by meeting a villain from the TV show (Khan), obsessively portrayed by Ricardo Montalban. Equally obsessive is William Shatner in his finest role playing Admiral Kirk, an ageing man reluctant to return to command of the USS Enterprise, but a man who finds his first, best destiny is at the helm of his ship. The battle scenes are the most engaging of any movie, and the action only lets up long enough for the audience to catch their breath and to advance the storyline. Witty characters, clever plot devices and ingenious writing and, by late 1990s standards, subdued use of special effects make this movie meet and often exceed the quality of the original show. Even 16 years later, the movie's technoligy does not seem \"dated\" because of the subdued use of Computer \"tricks\"!

            "content": "Whereas \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" revisited a theme from the original TV series (Captain Kirk defeats a threat to the Enterprise by using circular logic), this sequel revisits perhaps Kirk's most outstanding and ferocious antagonist, the villain Khan (Ricardo Montalban). I actually had a problem with the resolution of the TV episode 'Space Seed', in as much as Kirk exiled Khan to a far flung planet instead of dealing with him far more definitively. Having already seen how diabolical and clever Khan was, it wouldn't have been a stretch for Kirk to foresee a day when Khan would come back to haunt him.Come back he does, on a personal mission of revenge against present Admiral Kirk (William Shatner), in addition to his quest to acquire a Genesis device, capable of reorganizing lifeless matter into life generating results. You have to give Ricardo Montalban credit here for his portrayal. Khan was a truly vicious outlaw, though it was an insane desire for personal vengeance that eventually led to his downfall at the hands of the pragmatic, calculating Kirk.Interestingly, the story is framed in a literary context, beginning with an early conversation between Kirk and Spock (Leonard Nimoy). Spock quotes Charles Dickens' \"A Tale of Two Cities\" when he comments on Kirk's unwillingness to confront the matter of growing older - \"It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.\" The historical novel was a tale of dualities, one about two men living in two cities, London and Paris. The literary device of doubles is used throughout the movie repeatedly, with Kirk vs Khan, the Enterprise vs The Reliant, rival sons Joachim (Judson Scott) and David (Merritt Butrick), and one could go on listing other such dualities in the story.The film closes out the Dickensian theme when Kirk laments the loss of his beloved friend Spock, who sacrificed his life for a greater cause - \"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known\". If ever one considered Shatner a mediocre actor, he might have redeemed himself with that one riveting scene. And similarly, before he dies, Spock hints at a Genesis-like revival when he proclaims to Kirk - \"I am and always shall be, your friend\".",

Ricardo Montalban is a memorable villain, full ham, fire, gusto and cold malice. Besch and Butrick are fine. Kirstie Alley makes her memorable debut as the lovely Vulcan babe Saavik and it's a part she plays well (too bad they couldn't hang on to her).

It's probably one of the best Science Fiction movies of all time.People will complain that it's too violent and dark. But that's a part of life. Anytime you deal with the darkest human emotions of hate and revenge; you will have starships being fired at and people dying. To say that in the future humans will be 100% peaceful is silly and naive. Themes of life and death are explored very well in this movie without getting preachy about it. Shatner and Nimoy are allowed to expand their characters and bring more life to them. Shatner turns in his best Trek performance since \"The City on the Edge of Forever\".The special effects are good, but don't overshadow the story like they did in the first movie. Instead they service the story, as special effects should. The score is great; probably the best of all the Star Trek movies. The uniforms have been toned down and no longer look like pajama's from the first movie.

Thank goodness, they (meaning the original cast and new director, Nicholas Meyer) kept with this franchise. I knew, even if part one was the first experience for somebody, there was great potential. And from minute one of 'II,' the explored the possibilities, with the only downfall (like the 'Lethal Weapon' series with Danny Glover's Murtaugh's always pending retirement) being the similar (but reversed) storyline of semi-retired Kirk who always wants back on the bridge of the Enterprise. Here, as he wiggles his way back on, his usual crew member, Chekov, and a captain stumble upon an original series' nemesis, Khan, who has a blind, unstoppable desire for revenge against Kirk, who apparently, inadvertently, imprisoned Khan. All the while, Kirk's former love and a mystery crew member try and start up the \"Genesis\" project that brings life to the lifeless. Again, this film shows true depth to the characters some have grown up on, and in addition, especially to the late Ricardo Montalban as Khan, who sincerely broadcasted the basic emotion of blind revenge, always failing to see the big picture while trying to take down what they mistakenly thought would make them whole. 'Scream 2' spoke about some sequels that lessened the originals (while naming some that improved.) This absolutely improved the junior (at the time) series. A must-see for Sci-fi and trekkie buffs.",

            "content": "When Star Trek The Motion Picture was released, the masses flocked to it. Unfortunately, the first film outing for the crew of the USS Enterprise was about as exciting as watching paint dry.Never underestimate Trekkies!  This Second Star Trek movie was even more greatly anticipated than the first.  Reluctantly, I went to see it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan, in my estimation, is everything the first one should have been, and then some!Captain Kirk, now an admiral, is experiencing some sort of mid life crisis. And of course, he ends up back in the command chair when a routine inspection and review of the rookie crew on the Enterprise runs in to unexpected trouble.  The crew of the USS Enterprise is in fine form in this outing, and much of the camaraderie of the original TV series is recaptured. And when and old adversary of Captain Kirk shows up with revenge in his heart, this movie gets rolling.   It has twists, turns and surprises aplenty.  The ending is truly a surprise.  Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan is a wonderful complement to the original TV series and stands on its own as a very good space adventure film.  I'd rate it a 89.5/100.  If you want to see what all the full about Star Trek is, Star Trek II is a great place to start.",

            "content": "The Wrath of Khan was a complete jump in quality, production and standard from first movie, The Motion Picture.  Ricardo Montauban,  a classic actor best known for his romantic films in his early years, 1950's.  One of the best villains you will ever see in a science fiction movie.The music was good, however not as good as the predecessor movie's music, but still good.  The directing is also very good, great use of focusing techniques, close up's, action sequences well done, the usual high standard that comes from a proficient director like Nicholas Meyer.The lighting, exterior and interior shots, were well done.Its a pity that they haven't made a remastered tape, as the movie picture quality has degraded through the years.William Shatner's acting was extremely real, moving, believable. Among with the other main cast, and unlike the previous movie, this movie brought together that atmosphere that existed in the Original Star trek series.The dramatic plot that happens towards the end of the movie is indeed, one of the best scenes you will ever see in motion picture history.  Proving that Star Trek still has emotion.  I can not be more clearer than this unless by giving away the story.  Watch it yourself, and you'll be moved by the greatest acting, heart touching scene ever made.The special effects composed along with George Lucas were excellent, and in the year 2000, I feel they would come very close to our standard today.  The better warp entering sequences, battle sequences, and the formation of the new Genesis planet are very good effects.  The chase in the nebula, final explosion of the Genesis device are effects for you to watch for.If your like me, you will love the script for its Shakespeare context which Khan uses effectively throughout the film. I highly recommend you to see this movie if you haven't already, it's one of the best.Rating: 9.5/10",

            "content": "This is essentially the 'Trek' franchise's 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Not only because it's the standard bearer for the saga, but there are similarities in tone, the intimacy of their scope and some shared story beats (Loss, albeit temporarily, of main character. A son learning that a man he's had a grudge against is actually his father). I do wonder what Trekkers (If that's the proper term for them now) think of it though. Though there's some debate about the moral implications of the Genesis device, it otherwise lacks any \"big idea\" sci-fi pretensions. It also never embraces the \"big ideal\" aspects that were sort of retroactively grafted onto the original series after Trek morphed into a movement and that were then a part of Next Generation's DNA. It's focus is on aging, mortality, friendship, regret and of course vengeance. It's also deeply steeped in military nomenclature and argot. For those who embrace 'Trek' as a philosophy, its secular humanism, I wonder if they find these things off-putting despite its dramatic excellence? Speaking of excellence, the cast was never better than they were here. Shatner gets a lot of grief for his theatricality, but that's precisely why Kirk is such an iconic character. Shatner is like a giant tidal wave that lifts all boats. But he's also so invested that he always feels real despite being larger than life. Here though Shatner tones it down and allows us to see the man behind the legend. He's aided here, as always, by strong performances from the other 2/3 of the \"big three\"; particularly DeForest Kelley, who might just be the unsung hero of the entire original series saga. But no discussion of Wrath Of Kahn is complete without mentioning Ricardo Montalban. Known at the time mainly for his role as Mr. Roarke on the atrocious 'Fantasy Island', Montalban brought a Shakespearian zest that took great material and made it legendary. He's just exceptional and creates one of the best big screen villains of all-time.As a 'Trek' fan, I'm somewhere north of casual, but certainly south of hardcore. It's not a philosophy for me, I don't embrace most of its ideals, but it does continue to hold a certain sway over me. I first saw 'Wrath Of Khan' as an 8 year old boy and coming out of the theater with my Dad that day I was convinced that it was a perfect movie. 34 years later that opinion hasn't changed.",

            "content": "\"Kirk, my old friend!\" With these words 62 year old Ricardo Montalban, as Kahn Noonien Singh, makes his presence known to the 51 year old James Tiberius Kirk, now an Admiral, in a dramatic performance all will remember for years to come.  This is probably the best of the Star Trek movies because it follows most closely the original concept of the television series.  No fancy or tricky themes like saving whales or resurrecting Spock (If Spock can be resurrected then why does any Vulcan ever die?) Simply, just like Star Wars is in reality a \"Western\" story set in space, so is Star Trek.  A bad guy wants to kill a good guy for money, greed, power, fame, or revenge.  The good guy is always moral like Marshall Dillon and saves the day.But, William Shatner needs an emotional counterpart as his adversary. Klingons are too shallow to meet this requirement.  They only want to kill and capture.  But the veteran actor Mr. Montalban is a favorite and well known to all from his Planet of the Apes and Fantasy Island performances. He is the most intense and challenging opponent for the always emotional James T. Kirk.  For Kahn, \"revenge is a dish best served up cold!\"  Even when the end is obvious, you come away remembering Kahn's final lines as the Genesis Wave builds up for total destruction of the Star Ship Reliant, \"No Kirk, the game's not over.  To the last I will grapple with thee.  No, no...you can not get away.  From Hell's heart I stab at thee.  For hate's sake, I spat my last breath at thee.\"  Outstanding Mr. Montalban, outstanding acting and dying!If the 51 year old Leonard Nimoy can be remembered in this film for one word, it would be \"Remember\" when he implanted his mantra into the brain of Doctor Leonard McCoy (the 71 year old doctor of the USS Enterprise). Jackson DeForest Kelley died in 1999 at the age of 79 years.  As Dr. \"Bones,\" DeForest Kelley plays the alter ego of James Kirk and advises him as his friend and physician to stop growing old and try to revert from being an Admiral back to a star ship Captain, Kirk's best destiny. \nBoth born in 1931, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy are soul-brothers given that the Star Trek television series and movies cannot take place without them both.  They story concept equally requires both these actors because it is through their collective stories that Star Trek takes place.  \nUpon dying, we remember Spock's last words, \"Ship? Out of danger? Don't grieve, Admiral.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or, the one!  I have been and always shall be -- your friend!  Live long and prosper!\"James Montgomery Doohan was a 62 year old Montomery \"Scottie\" Scott. Nichelle Nichols was a 49 year old Cmdr. Nyota Uhura.  Walter Koenig was a 46 year old Cmdr. Pavel Andreievich Chekov.  George Takei was a 41 year old Cmdr. Hikaru Sulu. They all play their familiar roles.  Paul Winfield was a 41 year old Capt. Terrell.  Bibi Besch (Carol Marcus) and Capt. Kirk's old flame and mother is his son was 40 years old. Ms. Besch died in 1996. The young (23 year old) Merritt Butrick played Kirk's son, David Marcus. Mr. Butrick died in 1989.  As the Vulcan, Lt. Saavik, Kirstie Alley was one of the youngest major stars at 31 years old.  Her long hair was most becoming!So, if you are a trekkie (and many secretly are) then you will watch this film time and time again as it keeps getting aired on cable TV. \nStar Trek bridges the qualities of all living beings in the universe regardless of their race, gender, religion, national origin.  This is an integrated show and serves as a role model for decent living with all life forms.We would all do well to remember the eulogy for Spock given by James T. Kirk -- \"Of my friend, I can only say that of all the life forms I have encountered in this universe, his was the most -- human!\"    \n\"Space, the final frontier.\"",

            "content": "In 1979, Gene Roddenberry wanted to revitalize the Star Trek franchise (if you want to call it that, this early in its evolution). To this point, all we had was the original series (1966-1969) and the animated series (1973), which today is considered canon, as the fourth season of the original series. In 1979, they released the first major motion picture, based off of the TV show, showcasing the return of the original Star Trek cast. They tried to capitalize on the success of Star Wars (1977) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Also, Disney's, the Black Hole (1979), was on the horizon, with the same time table for release as The Motion Picture. The idea for The Motion Picture, the money, the technology, everything, was all there and this was the perfect time to bring back Star Trek.Well. They fumbled it a little. The Motion Picture made plenty of money, but not the numbers that Paramount had been hoping for. It was a critical mess in some circles. The need to exploit the expensive, state-of-the-art, special effects, bogged down the pacing in the film. One of the biggest complaints, even today, in the age of pausing the movie at home, is that the film was too long and sat on the extensive special effects scenes too long, all throughout the film. The story also did not invite non-Star Trek people into the fold. It, more or less, alienated the average filmgoer.So, three years went by and Roddenberry and crew tried it again. Maybe THIS was the time to bring Star Trek back. It was. Paramount hired Harve Bennett to take over the reins. They brought in a skilled director, Nicolas Meyer and went back to Star Trek's roots, by making this film a sequel to one of the episodes from the original series. It was a good move, because the character, from that episode, was the driving force of the film. Khan, was also going to be played by the same actor as the TV show. Ricardo Montalban, who played Khan in 1967, returned for his rematch with Shatner's Captain Kirk, capitalizing on Montalban's popularity from the TV show Fantasy Island (1977-1984). They wanted to fix the boredom part that the last movie experienced, make the Star Trek fans happy and create a story that the average filmgoer can enjoy and not feel alienated by the source material or characters.It's not totally explained in the movie itself, but according to some of the Trek novels of the time, The Motion Picture was supposed to take place two years after the end of the five year mission. Once, this film came out in 1982, the idea of the ageing actors, trying to pull off youthful roles would be shelved and the accepted norm would be that the Enterprise and its crew are almost 20 years old. In fact Kirk mentions in this film, that he is being pursued by a man who has been trying to kill him for 15 years, which is the exact time between the \"Space Seed\" episode (1967) and the release of this film, 1982. It actually helps legitimize the characters even more.What this film ends up being is a textbook version of a Star Trek film. For the longest time this one was hailed as the best of Trek. The comradery between the characters and the cementing of family, among the characters, is what makes this one special. It is here that we truly get to see the importance and closeness, that Kirk has with his Enterprise family. Equally powerful is the contrast between Kirk and Khan. The sheer hatred that they both end up having for each other, is real.It is here that the Star Trek creators realized that they can use the age of the actors as a strength, because this film is all about feeling young, no matter how old you are. The film is completely a commentary on age, that is hammered to us all the way through. The main construct of Khan's attack revolves around a device, aptly named \"Genesis\", that can terraform a planet in a day. The film uses the abstract ideas of youth vs old, life vs death. It is actually a pleasure to watch this movie. It is the one that saved the franchise and has been keeping it alive ever since.8.5 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

Montalban as a megalomaniac evil nasty gives an excellent characterization and he's the fundamental reason for seeing the movie .

The screenplay is concentrated about characters more than action-packed and special effects , though there're lots , too . There is also a strong confrontation between Kirk and Khan ; however , they never meet face to face during the movie , all of their interaction is through viewscreens , monitors or communicators . This was because Ricardo Montalban shot his scenes separately from the main production in order to accommodate his schedule of filming the overlong series Fantasy Island (1977) in which he starred for long time . The highlights movie are some creepy and sadist scenes when bugs torture to Zulu (Walter Koenig) , including a little bit of blood and gore . Besides , it has an exciting and climatic ending , taking on the USS Reliant machine war and Enterprise NCC 1701 , similarly to the cold war that will originate a Glasnot theme in \u00a8Star Trek 6 : the Undiscovery country\u00a8.

            "content": "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) *** (out of 4) This sequel is certainly a major step up in terms of quality. This time out Kirk (William Shatner) and Spock (Leonard Nimoy) must lead an inexperienced crew to do battle against Khan (Ricardo Montalban), a man who was forced to exile for fifteen-years but now is seeking revenge. It's easy to see why Robert Wise wasn't invited back and it's also easy to see why they decided to take this one into a new direction. Compared to the original movie I'd go as far as to call this a masterpiece because it's a vast improvement in any stretch of the imagination. The acting, directing, pacing and overall entertaining is so much better here that it really comes across as an entirely new series and it really makes you look back and wonder why the first one went so wrong. I think what I enjoyed most here were the performances by Shatner and Montalban. It really does appear that both actors are really having a blast and I liked how neither one was taking this so serious as if they were appearing in some Stanley Kubrick film. Both actors really appear to just be kicking back and trying to entertain the hell out of the viewer. Nimoy is also extremely good as Spock and we get nice work from Paul Winfield and even Kirstie Alley. Another major plus here is that director Nicholas Meyer manages to keep the story engaging from the opening scene to the last. The characters are so much better here that they too keep you entertained as well as keep you interested in what's going on. The pacing is another major plus as there's really no slow spots to be found anywhere. With that said, I do think there's some flaws to be found here including some of the special effects and I'd also say that the action scenes aren't as dramatic as they should be. Still, STAR TREK II manages to be a highly entertaining film even if you're not a major fan of the series.",

This one is so wonderful because it is absolutely nothing like STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE (known to many of the fans as \"Star Trek I\"). While the movie is based on a TV episode, it manages to carry on from where the episode left off instead of rehashing the same old material.Although I loved so many movies by Robert Wise, he was no sci-fi director. Sure, he was wonderful with THE SOUND OF MUSIC, but under his control the first Star Trek movie could have been entitled \"THE SOUND OF BOREDOM\"! But, in this film, Nicholas Meyer very ably directs and seemed to have a real flare for drama and the characters. Plus, it really seems to have helped having the crew shed their prior monochrome polyester uniforms from the prior film and replace them with cool red uniforms. So, the uniforms AND the characters all were very colorful.The film concerns the only Hollywood actor who is a big enough ham to match Shatner's beloved histrionics--Ricardo Montalban. He and Shatner both emoted and fought and entertained the audience. Sure, it was a whole lot more low-brow than the earlier film, but that is why the original series was so beloved! People didn't expect John Gielgud or Laurence Olivier--they wanted to see Shatner scream \"KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!!!!!\" and they wanted explosions! And, while not necessary for the script, most people appreciated the evil buggers they shoved in Paul Winfield's and Walter Koenig's ears! The film was bigger than life, emotionally involving, entertaining, heart-stopping and a great improvement in the series. Thanks to the success of this film (and an ending that left room for the sequel), there were many more Trek Movies to come (though the less said about STAR TREK V, the better).",

A movie I have grown up with yet still manages to thrill me whenever I occasionally dig it out of my DVD collection. William Shatner, however hammy, simply IS Captain Kirk, a leader of men, a decision maker and a fighter. Khan is a bitter vengeful man determined to kill the man who marooned him (kirk) and is a most worthy villain. Ricardo Montalaban is brilliant in his role as Khan eating up his lines and delivering them with a poetic madness. What is most impressive about this story is that it is simply not just a story about one mans obsession, hate and bid to avenge being marooned on a desolate planet. It allows characters to develop and grow (especially Kirk and Spocks bond) it builds the tension slowly and the showdown is exiting and very well executed by both the director and I also must say by James Horner for a terrific score to compliment the action. Overall Star Trek 2 has great characters, a good story, terrific action and best of all an exiting and ultimately tragic ending.

            "content": "When I first saw Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan, my expectations weren't too high. The first movie had been such a letdown for me, and I knew sequels better than the original to be a very rare thing. So, I was quite surprised when the end credits started to roll; I had just witnessed an entertaining, thrilling, memorable and all- around awesome movie. Most Trek fans seem to consider this to be the best movie in the entire franchise, and while it only reaches fourth place on my list, I do understand why this is the #1 favorite for so many. There is so much that this film does right, and so little to complain about.The movie is a sequel, not only to The Motion Picture, but also to Space Seed, an episode from the original series. It continues the story left open in that episode, as the villain Khan returns - with a plan of vengeance against Captain Kirk and his crew. The film begins with members of the original crew overseeing the Kobayashi Maru test, after which we see some surprisingly deep character development from Kirk's part. With these very moments, the movie establishes that it has an exciting and creative story element in it, as well as good character writing with a sense of humanity - two things very much missing in the first Trek film. As the story progresses, the audience is treated to several iconic scenes: from Khan's epic return, through Kirk's powerful scream of rage, all the way to Spock's heartbreaking death - more on that one later. The movie is extremely well-written, as the story keeps fresh and engaging while offering many sides to the characters and events, as well as avoiding any dull moments.Nicholas Meyer does a great job directing. Everything in the movie, from the sets and lighting all the way to the camera-work and soundtrack, just feels much more natural and well-made than in the previous installment. And I won't just compare this film to its predecessor which I didn't like, as that doesn't say much; I also think that this movie does a far better job as a production and as a work of art than most of the sci-fi films I have seen, certainly most of the other Star Trek films. It's great that they got the original cast to return once again, as the acting is also top notch. But as good as the main Enterprise crew is, the perhaps greatest performance is given by Ricardo Montalban, who plays the character Khan to perfection.To this day, Khan is the best Star Trek villain, in the opinion of me and many others. The battle of wits between him and Kirk remains at the center of the stage for most of the movie, and gets more and more exhilarating as the run time progresses. But the single greatest part of this film, to me at least, is Spock's sacrifice at the end. Not very often do I find an individual scene to be the absolutely best thing in a feature film, but that is the case with The Wrath Of Khan. Everything about that moment is perfect - the pure emotional impact it has on the viewer, the incredible acting from Shatner and Nimoy, the pitch perfect dialogue between Spock and Kirk in his final moments, and the overall effect that is has on the story - not only the story of this movie, but of the franchise in general. Kirk's line about Spock's soul being the most human he ever knew is possibly the most emotionally powerful line I have ever seen in a movie - something that I definitely didn't expect from a Star Trek sequel. The way they bring the movie to an end is absolutely beautiful.All in all, I find this to be one of the best Star Trek films. It definitely deserves its acclaim as a science fiction landmark and a turning point for the franchise. I don't regard it to be the 'best sci-fi film of all time' or 'a flawless masterpiece' like many do, as there are better films in the genre - even in the franchise. But while this movie isn't perfect, it certainly is a groundbreaking and awesome film worth watching quite a few times. I definitely believe that the legacy of this movie will live long and prosper.",

            "content": "Since its release in 1982, STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN has emerged as perhaps the most controversial film in the STAR TREK series, eclipsing even the much-debated first film. To some vocal fans, KHAN is a total violation of what STAR TREK is about, what with its paramilitary atmosphere, its use of revenge as a plot point, and the horrific violence caused by said revenge. Gene Roddenberry's rejection of the film on those same grounds has only intensified the debate between those who hold the film as a desecration of the mythos  and those who regard it as the definitive entry in the saga. Up until a few years ago, I probably would have sided with the naysayers, simply because the violence in the film upset me as a kid. I was 4 when the film came out, and I thought it was the goriest movie ever made. But then I grew up, realized that there've been far bloodier films, and gave KHAN another chance. When I finally saw it again when I was a teenager, I realized that I actually liked the film a lot\u0085and that its violence was actually pretty mild compared to most movies.As written and directed by Nicholas Meyer (the \"screenplay by Jack Sowards\" credit is a misnomer), the film goes like this: Jim Kirk is now a desk-bound admiral suffering a mid-life crisis while the Enterprise is now being turned over to a team of cadets. Unfortunately for him, Khan Noonien Singh, a genetically-enhanced maniac he marooned 15 years ago, has hijacked a Federation starship and is about to (a) steal a terraforming project called Genesis that could be used as a weapon and (b) go after Kirk in a suicidal revenge campaign. (The garden planet Kirk marooned Khan on was ravaged by a cosmic disaster that turned it into a barren desert, and Khan's wife and many of his followers were killed as a result of the devastation.) Once the scientists working on the terraforming project-among them Kirk's son and his mother-are threatened by Khan, Kirk takes command of the Enterprise and proceeds to investigate the matter. Much to Kirk's surprise, Khan is waiting for him, and a series of harrowing encounters ensues, resulting in the controversial death of Spock.The plot is pretty simple, but this works to the film's advantage. Meyer's script (from a story by Sowards and producer Harve Bennett) is tightly constructed, moving at a swift pace and not wasting a moment on useless details. Even though the film deals with such heady matters as old age and death (an unwinnable test scenario called the \"Kobeyashi Maru\" becomes a motif that brackets the film), it still finds time for gentle verbal humor and wordplay. Unlike the first film, which felt uncertain at times, KHAN is confident and relaxed with the characters. The core cast is much more at ease this time out, and their performances are all the better for it. William Shatner especially is at his best in this film; this talented actor finally drops the hammy shtick that has become the target for mockery (or self-mockery, as is the case with Shatner's  recent work) and delivers a subtle, easy performance that hints at what might have been had he not given in to camping it up. Bibi Besch and Merritt Butrick (both of whom have passed on) are engaging as Kirk's estranged family (the death of Kirk's son in the third film is all the more regrettable for this), and Paul Winfield, as the brainwashed captain whose ship is swiped by Khan, is suitably tragic. There's also Kirstie Alley making her debut as Saavik, Spock's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. But let's not kid ourselves; this is Ricardo Montalban's movie all the way. Cool yet insane, murderous yet elegantly charming, Montalban makes Khan one of the most intriguing villains in film history. And despite Khan's limited screen time, Montalban makes the character an imposing presence that dominates the film. Aided by James Horner's bombastic pirate movie-esque score and some of ILM's most dynamic FX work ever (barring one stiff matte painting in the Genesis cave), the film generates an energized feel and mood that refuses to let up until the story has run its course.Which brings me to the accusations made by those who claim this film trashes Roddenberry's vision. \"Too paramilitary\"? Sorry, Roddenberry had always said that STAR TREK was a high-tech Horatio Hornblower saga, and the original series had military underpinnings. \"Violence has no place in TREK\"? Then please explain why the original series was saturated in deaths and near-deaths, why everyone in a red tunic got iced in almost every episode, and why every last one of the crew members was constantly getting into brawls. \"Revenge is not a theme that fits what TREK is all about\"? Excuse me, but I thought STAR TREK was essentially about the human condition, and the nastier, darker aspects of humanity are a part of that condition. To ignore them would be to whitewash humanity and do TREK a disservice. This film is no grimmer than the classic episode \"Wolf in the Fold,\" about Jack the Ripper's soul possessing people in order to carry on his killing spree. Really, KHAN doesn't do anything that wasn't already done on the series. As for Roddenberry's gripes about the film\u0085well, it's been established that he became a control freak whose grip on STAR TREK nearly paralyzed it creatively. His complaints had more to do with Meyer and Bennett being allowed to bring a fresh voice to the series than anything that was actually in the film.It took a while for me to wake up, but now I can see STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN for what it really is: a well-crafted adventure story and a worthy entry in the STAR TREK mythos.",

            "content": "The Star Trek films got off to a pretty lame start with 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' and it was obvious from watching that stiff, silly film that everyone involved had not gotten back into the Trek groove. So for the next film, they slashed the budget and went for a stripped-down, violent and sometimes even gory (by ST standards, anyway) installment that managed to hit almost all the right notes. 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' is also unashamedly sentimental at the end, and even non-Trekkers were known to tear up watching Spock die. None of the Trek films are really like the old TV episodes; this and the next ('Search for Spock') come closest in approach and storytelling. The plot this time out concerns the Genesis device, a sort of bomb that creates life instead of destroying it. It's shot at a lifeless moon or asteroid and soon there are forests, rivers, sky, etc. Khan (played with great flamboyance by the one and only Ricardo Montalban) enters the picture when Chekov and his new commander stumble across the planet where he and his party have been marooned for all these years, making this a sequel to the TV episode 'Space Seed.' Kahn and his people haven't had an easy time of it on the dry, barren planet and now he is thirsting for revenge against Kirk. And to throw in the kitchen sink, the film also features an old flame of Kirk's, Dr. Carol Marcus, inventor of Genesis, and Kirk's son by her, David. There are a number of exciting scenes, and a running verbal duel between Khan and Kirk that is quite entertaining. Providing shock value are brain-eating, mind-controlling worms, native to Ceti Alpha VI where Khan and his party lived in exile, which are quite creepy in an 'Alien' sort of way. The ending, which finds Spock exposing himself to lethal radiation in order to repair the Enterprise, is very touching and would form the bridge of a story arc leading to the next two films. Unfairly or not, Gene Roddenberry was largely blamed for the first Star Trek film's excesses and plodding pace, so he was 'kicked upstairs' for 'Wrath of Khan' and had less and less to do with each succeeding movie. An interesting bit of trivia often cited by Trek fanatics about 'Wrath of Khan' is that Chekov is the first of the old crew that Khan encounters and remembers, yet the character of Chekov had not joined the crew of Star Trek when 'Space Seed' was made and so is not even in the original episode!",

            "content": "A Federation star ship is sent to a deserted planetoid earmarked for the third stage of the life-giving Genesis project, to investigate a detection of life. Chekov and his Captain find out too late that the life detected is none other than Khan and his crew of genetically engineered men. With a way off this barren rock, Khan takes control of the star ship and uses the Genesis project as his way of luring the man he blames for his years of isolation \u0096 one James T. Kirk.After the first film, it was a very smart move to step back to what actually made the TV series successful. After watching this my girlfriend moaned that it was just like an extended version of the show, which of course is correct (although she didn't mean it as a good thing). The connection to the series is most obviously in the narrative but it is also is the humour that is more evident in this film as well as the improved action and characters. The plot is strong by being about the characters rather than anything mystical or heavily sci-fi; it is a revenge story in space and it works well. Of course it isn't the most amazing story ever but it is to the level of the series and fans will enjoy it for that. Additionally the plot allows for more of the warmth and humour in the characters to be drawn out, as well as some of the other aspects. On one hand this can be seen in the banter involving Bones, but in another way is seen in Kirk's touch of midlife crisis which does provide interest and drama (albeit on a TV show level).Meyer's direction is very good and he mixes the humour and drama of the TV show with good action throughout. The cast respond well to this approach and turn in good performances across the board. Shatner is hardly a great actor but he easily holds the screen here. Totally at home within his character he gives very good \"Kirk\" although of course some of his performance is unintentionally funny (you of course know the moment I refer to). Montalban was a good choice to bring back as a ham was needed to conflict with Shatner's ham and that is just what the former delivers. His Khan is a wonderfully cheesy villain and befits the material. Nimoy is engaging and is given the chance for a painfully effective final scene while Kelley, Doohan, Takei, Nichols and Koenig all do what is required of them. Alley is so-so but the weakest link is Butrick, who has little to do and with it delivers little.Overall then, easily one of the best films in the Star Trek franchise. Not a fantastic film in its own right but it does what the series did well and produces human stories, humour, warmth, action and drama all to the level required by the fans and most casual viewers. The cast do what they are capable of and while none of them are brilliant, they all do what is expected and do it pretty well. The effects department and sets all make the film look much better than the budget would suggest.",

Nice pace, good use of Star Trek characters (unlike the first film's superficial plot) and some important moments in Star Trek history.I really enjoyed this film, what can I say? If you like Star Trek, you'll probably like this. I'm not really sure how you couldn't like it. I have heard this is the best in the series, and I wouldn't even be surprised by that.It's the story of Khan (from the original series) whose planet is ruined. He blames Kirk for this and seeks him out to get revenge. This is all you need in a film: a long-haired, super-strong and super-intelligent genetically modified madman hunting Admiral James T. Kirk. You really can't both it.Oh, sure, I could complain it starred Kirstie Alley in her debut role. But to be honest, she wasn't that bad and if she hadn't gone on to do such horrible things I'd even consider watching her in future roles. She's a decent Vulcan (though I thought a bit emotional).And I could complain of the plot hole regarding Khan and Chekhov. How does Khan know who Chekhov is and how does he know that Chekhov and Kirk are connected? This is never explained and is contrary to the series. Maybe they retconned it, I don't know. But it was easy to ignore for the benefit of the film.So yeah, you probably want to see this movie... because where else can you see leeches eating a Russian man's brain?",

And all this for a staggering one-third of the cost of its predecessor.The jury's still out on the legitimacy of Ricardo Montalban's chest but his wonderfully hammy performance as Khan gives us one of the great modern sci-fi villains, countered by William Shatner's heroic, sly Kirk who - along with everyone else on the crew - seems to have been upping their Personality Plus supplements since the last film.It's this twinkle in the eyes of the entire cast and a strong sense of wry humour that makes the film such terrific, old-fashioned fun.

            "content": "Star Trek had been a long-running TV-series before the first motion picture was made, and while that confused entry has its moments, it hardly set people's imaginations ablaze. Paramount revised the formula and found a recipe for part II that would define Star Trek feature films for decades to follow.The Wrath of Khan, commonly thought of as the best of the feature Treks, focuses on what made the series work: strong interpersonal dynamics between the 3 leads and a spirit of adventure. It also adheres more strongly to Hollywood formula with a strong antagonist, this time one bent on vengeance, something the reboots have unimaginatively avoided to stray one iota from.What makes this a great film rather than just a cool treat to Trekkies is the ways in which it turns its would-be flaws into assets: got an aging star too old for action-schlock? Built that into the plot and make it pay off. Got alien technology at play? Limit it through plot choices and make things relatable: the climactic space battle inside a nebula is a submarine duel transposed into space, a brilliant creative choice elevated by its clever execution. The added budget and pretty much undated special effects help this rise above its TV series origin but the screenplay and direction help in a way no effects wizardry could. One very welcome plot twist also helps break the sense of invincibility that undermined the confrontations in the series. Even for casual viewers only passingly familiar with Trek lore, this is compelling stuff and a great entry point into the huge phenomenon that is Star Trek!",

Unlike the others, it's a direct sequel to one of the TV shows (Space Seed, from 1967), with Montalban reprising his role as a shaggy-haired, bare-chested, Herman Melville-quoting nutter, and he's pretty cool. Also good are the other guest-stars; Alley (her first movie), Besch and Winfield, all of whom acquit themselves well, and director Meyer has enough sense to keep the plot jogging along as quickly as possible. The visual effects by Ken Ralston and Jim Veilleux are wonderful, particularly the dogfights between the two starships, and there is a terrific score by James Horner. I also like the fact that the movie is not afraid of going for big dramatic scenes - Kirk's fear of being grounded, the family life he threw away and the big finale when Spock sacrifices himself in the radioactive core of the ship. It's more soap-opera than science-fiction but they play it for all its worth. Shatner's voice-cracking eulogy for the alien Spock - \"Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most human.\" - is either the most moving or the most laughable piece of acting ever, depending on your point of view (personally, I'm not sure). It's all good family fun though, with brain-eating leeches, the universe at stake, and all the usual Star Trek cod-naval banging-on about impulse power, photon torpedoes and the like.

            "content": "(Caution:  This review will discuss in detail themes, plot and characters that may be considered spoilers.  Do not read this review if you do not desire such information about this film.)\"Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan\" is one of the best science fiction films of the past 20 years.  At its core, it is a story of vengeance, rebirth and sacrifice.  Even more admirable is the script's sophistication in combining literary themes found in Charles Dickens' \"A Tale of Two Cities\" and Melville's \"Moby Dick\".The film opens with the administration of the Kobayashi Maru test at Starfleet Academy; the test is known to cadets and Starfleet officers as the \"no-win scenario\".  In the test, an impossibly challenging situation is encountered, where the cadets tested must demonstrate their reaction to their own mortality.  As Admiral Kirk notes to Lt. Savik, after Savik questions the purpose of the test, \"Well, how we deal with death, is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say.\"\nAs part of the test, the instructors who are the former senior staff of the Starship Enterprise fake their own deaths.  This is the first hint in the film that symbolically Admiral Kirk and his crew are dead.  He and his crew accepted promotion to teach at Starfleet Academy, and stopped being the explorers in command of a starship facing the unknown.\nFor his birthday, Spock gives Kirk Dicken's \"A Tale of Two Cities\" and Kirk reads the first line, \"It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.\" This begins Kirk's journey in the film that parallels the themes of the book.  In Dicken's story, Dr. Manette is imprisoned and symbolically dies until word arrives that his daughter, Lucy with brilliant gold hair, resurrects him into the outside world of France, which is disintegrating to social unrest under ruthlessness of the monarchy and royalty.At the same time that Kirk sits in the prison of his own promotion, Khan is buried alive on a barren windy desert planet where Kirk had placed him decades ago.  Khan is resurrected from his \"death\" by the chance landing of Genesis Project terra-formers who are working with Starfleet and the chance to revenge himself upon Kirk.  The Genesis Project is a missile that when detonated will take all matter in an area and recreates it into a planet livable for human life.Similarly to Dickens' story, Kirk is contacted by one of the terra-formers who is the mother of his son, because they face imminent attack from Khan who had taken control of a Starfleet research vessel.  Kirk is given permission to respond with the Enterprise and the trainee crew and to rescue his son.In addition to Kirk's rescue of his son, vengeance at this point becomes the catalytic event that resurrects Kirk and Khan from their symbolic deaths. Khan takes on the obsession of Melville's Captain Ahab in \"Moby Dick\" and relentlessly pursues Kirk for revenge, despite protestations that he could do so much more with his new found freedom.The price of vengeance is death.  After Khan's first devastating attack, a young engineering crewman dies.  Kirk stands at his bedside and as the crewman reaches out for Kirk's tunic, blood smears on Kirk's white bib just before the crewman dies.  In \"A Tale of Two Cities\" red wine or blood foreshadowed death for an aristocrat who killed a baby with his horse drawn coach.Kirk and Khan at the end of the film engage in a battle to the death. However, just prior to Khan's death, Khan engages the Genesis device that will devastate all life and matter in the area, in its effort to reformulate the matter to make it a planet fit for human life.  It appears that Kirk will die in the end as well.  Spock makes the supreme sacrifice and repairs the ship at the cost of his own life, which allows the ship and Kirk to escape the Genesis explosion.Spock's sacrifice mirrors Charles Darnay's and Sidney Carton's sacrifice at the end of \"A Tale of Two Cities\" where one person is hanged in place of the other.Just as the film began with the first line of \"A Tale of Two Cities\", the film ends with the last line of \"A Tale of Two Cities\".  \"It is a far better thing I do, than I have ever done before.  It is a better resting place, than I have ever known.\"To study \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" is to delve into some of the most important human themes in English literature.  It is a \"Star Trek\" film that aspired to be more than the mindless action films that come out every year. It is a study of characters' death and rebirth that one rarely finds in any film.  Each of the characters are well acted and the direction and cinematography are outstanding.  If one studies \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\", understands all that it attempted and succeeded in doing, I think without a doubt it will be considered one of the towering cinematic achievements in science fiction film history.",

            "content": "When Gene Roddenberry still had creative control of Star Trek, some say it contained a great deal of human drama and intrigue. Other say it was just Roddenberry's vision of what he wished the armed forces were really like. There's merit to both schools of thought, but all kidding aside, the second Star Trek film is where everyone involved is really at their best.Part of this can be attributed to creativity, rather than money, being used to solve creative problems. Many of the props not only had to be recycled from the previous film, a lot of them had to be reused throughout the film. That they were able to make the interiors of two starships look so very different when they were the exact same set is a credit to the crew. The other reason why Star Trek: The Wrath Of Khan is so effective is the human drama aspect.Star Trek is most associated with the neat, clean, pristine look of space props, but this is where the characters got really down and dirty. With fleets of warships traveling the cosmos, one really has to wonder how long it is before humans start hunting each other down in such ships as part of a personal vendetta. This is the scenario that Star Trek II is based around. Khan, having been left on a planet during an episode of the original series, has found fate not quite smiling upon him. Given that it was Kirk who left him on the planet, he figures that it's Kirk's fault, and therefore Kirk must suffer. This creates enough dramatic moments between the main two actors that unlike a lot of Star Trek episodes, it keeps the viewer bolted to the screen, waiting to see what happens next.Star Trek II is also the first, and so far only, Star Trek that can be solidly labeled as aimed at adults. Characters do excruciating things to one another, characters die unpleasantly, and characters are forced to face up to some very unpleasant shortcomings. Granted, the heroes still live in a bit of a microverse where the ramifications of their actions never really seem to affect anyone else, but the ramifications within said microverse are so powerful that it makes up for this. Other science fiction films based around a ruthless antagonist trying to taunt the protagonist with something truly horrible have been made, Virtuosity being a recent example, but there is something about this one that just hits a nerve.If there is one criticism I have of the film, it is that sometimes the cost-cutting measures show up. Recycling the footage of the Klingon warships from the original film wasn't such a good idea, for example. Surely there must have been some unused shots that could have worked just as well? Still, this is a minor moment in what is overall a very pleasant visual experience.In all, I gave Star Trek: The Wrath Of Khan a ten out of ten. This is the only time you'll see me give anything Star Trek-related a ten out of ten. Even if you despise Star Trek, this version contains enough substantive material that you'll at least enjoy parts of it. This was the franchise's peak, the high that they could never reach again, and boy what a high it was.",

            "content": "I was a teenager when this movie debuted and it was an exhilarating movie to see in the theater. There were two reasons I loved it. One, because it was a very good movie (especially for its time) and two, the anticipation Trek fans had for a new, quality Trek adventure (after the uninspired first film, but long before TNG and the rest) was nearly palpable. I believe this movie resonates much more with the long-time Trekkers, who waited throughout the 70's for Star Trek to be revived. Twenty years later, the film has aged fairly well and it presents the classic characters as larger-than-life icons, which they really are. I watched this again on the recently released DVD director's cut. This is a still a very taut film.  There's a purpose for each scene, and this is a tribute to director Nicholas Meyer and also to Harve Bennett, the producer. The film is hindered by a lack of CGI technology, which could have made the Genesis Cave (among other things) much more impressive. Those who are thinking of watching this should rent \"Space Seed,\" an episode of the original TV series, before watching this film. The story here, particularly Khan's obsession with destroying Kirk, will then seem like a natural progression. Montalban does great work, but I wish there were one or 2 more scenes with him. Nimoy is excellent as Spock and really has wonderful dialogue written for him. The themes of aging, mortality, obsession, sacrifice and rebirth are all present so this filmhas a very meaningful subtext beyond the Khan-Kirk rivalry. A Tale of Two Cities is used as a literary reference and Khan quotes Shakespeare. Meyerbrings all these threads together beautifully.  As an aside, I should mention TNG (especially the first 2 seasons) borrowed many plots and styles of presentation (including lots of Shakespeare) from the Classic Trek TV show and these early Trek movies. I loved Kirstie Alley as Lt. Saavik. Some of Kirk's best scenes are with her and the first meeting with Khan allows Saavik to show her poise.  Saavik was intended to be a major new character in Trek, but when Alley declined to appear in the third film, Saavik was recast and given much less to do in The Search For Spock. I still wish Kirstie had stayed with Trek. I have to mention the James Horner score is positively brilliant. All of his music underscores the dramatic moments perfectly. He did a great job. All in all, this is still a fine film which, if made today, would have benefited from CGI technology. There is one computer graphic showing how the Genesis project works, but advanced CGI was not available.  Hard-core Trek fans must own the new DVD version of Khan. It  has excellent interviews (past and present) with the cast and 2 commentaries, along with other features.  I give the movie 9 stars out of 10.",

            "content": "Few would disagree that Wrath of Khan is the best Star Trek movie to date. There are some holdouts for IV & VI, but even their proponents only go so far as to rate those \"up there\" with II.  Besides, the fourth Trek gets more dated by the minute, and I think a lot of the good feeling about the sixth movie was just relief that they rebounded from V.  And advocates for the first movie or the Next Generation offerings are just in denial.So if Wrath of Khan is Star Trek's best contribution, the question has to be where Star Trek ranks in the annals of sci-fi.  And the answer has to be \"pretty high.\"  The Star Trek phenomenon is unparalleled in the science fiction genre, or pretty much any other genre for that matter.  When science fiction films suddenly became big business after 1977, this franchise was one of the first offerings made.I wouldn't put Wrath of Khan ahead of seminal works such as Metropolis, Star Wars, or T2, but it's not far behind.  Ironically, one of its strengths is that the story itself has little to do with science fiction.  You can lift out this story about live, death, and consequences and put it in any timeframe.  They just happened to blend it superbly into a 2283 AD setting and create a tale that holds up extremely well.This movie still contains some of the best work ever from ILM, James Horner, Nicholas Meyer, and the entire cast.  And for what it's worth, note that this movie contains a little Genesis short that could well claim to be THE BIRTH OF CGI.",

            "content": "There has been a lot of comment on this being the best of the Trek movies with the original cast and I'm not going to get involved with that discussion.The plot of the story is good but editing of the sub plots leave you wondering what the reaction shots of the characters were about. Who the heck was Peter Preston and why did Scotty seem so proud of him when he introduced him to the Captain during the Engine Room inspection? Think about it. The entire scene is meaningless unless the director wanted you to feel sympathy for the cadet when Scott shows up in sick bay later carrying him after Khan's attack.That's kind of like the series when you're introduced to a 'red shirted' guy at the beginning of an episode and you know he's going to wind up dead by the opening credits. You're meant to feel bad but not as much as if he were a recurring cast member. Most of the time they only had last names like Lt. Rodriguez or Ens. Palmer. Surely no one picked these guys up and tearfully carried them to sick bay.Well, unless you read the novelization of the movie, the only other way to know who Peter Preston was was to have seen the ABC version of the movie. As with their airing of Superman and Superman II, they were able to get their hands on deleted scenes and reinsert them, making some sub plots make sense. To my knowledge, that version hasn't surfaced anywhere, either on VHS or DVD. If so please let me know.To put this sub plot in a nutshell, Peter Preston is Scotty's nephew. His sister's kid to be exact. He is Scott's only family heir since he never had children and this was his sister's only kid. The continuation of his family's bloodline rested with Parker. Part of the scene in the engine room inspection had Scotty introduce him to Kirk and why he was so proud that he took up engineering like his uncle. He was spunky and you couldn't help but like him.That's why Scott's crying when he carries him to sick bay after the attack. In fact, he doesn't even understand what happened until Kirk tells him about Khan. Yep, that's all cut out.There are some other scenes that are expanded but none that changed the story as much as Scott's. My guess is that they may have thought that it distracted from the Kirk/David Marcus story line. Of course, it could have been cut because they didn't want to take away any of the gut wrenching good-bye at the end. That might also be why Scott doesn't seem as effected by Spock's death as much as everyone else. He has his own personal grief to contend with.Another footnote here about that story line; in ST III when Kirk is having Spock's wake, he makes a toast to 'absent friends'. He doesn't mean Spock, he means Scotty because he wasn't there. In fact, when the doorbell chimes, he believes that Mr. Scott has finally arrived when it turns out to be Sarek. Why was Scott missing? He was home in Scotland attending a memorial service for Preston at his sister's side.",

Khan has commandeered the USS Reliant. He is searching for Genesis and revenge on Kirk. Kirk receives a message from the designer of the device, an old flame Dr Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch). Kirk races to save Carol, and face the unknown danger once again.This is the first high point of the Star Trek franchise. After the Luke warm critical reception of the first movie, this brought together all that is best about Star Trek. In the end, it is all about the friendships of these beloved characters. The friendship of these characters is the meat of the story. The sizzle however is the fascinating Ricardo Montalban. He has the most delicious lines in villainy. It's the poetry of cool lines that he lustfully delivers. The action is solid put over the top by the soaring musical cues.

            "content": "\"Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan\" is everyone's favourite Trek film, even if they're not big fans of the show. Nicholas Meyer, the writer/director, is competent in an efficient, workmanlike way, and the movie zips along at a fine pace but with barely an original bone in its body.Khan, from the original series episode \"Space Seed\", hijacks a starship with a plan to kill Captain Kirk. Kirk's having a midlife crisis, and has just met the son he never knew he had, who happens to be a scientist who's created a MacGuffin with limitless destructive potential. Kirk is full of angst, and talks a lot with Spock and McCoy, so some of the feel of the classic series is preserved. Everyone quotes liberally from Shakespeare and \"Moby Dick\", with a little Dickens thrown in, to the point that they might have written the entire script by perusing Cliff's Notes and skimming Horatio Hornblower novels.The redesigned Starfleet uniforms signal a change in the way our heroes will be portrayed in future films. They are no longer exploring representatives of an idealistic utopia, but servants of a futuristic military. The space battles that make up the bulk of the film's action are dazzling, in a modest way, but the main characters spend most of their time on the bridges of their respective ships, pressing buttons and talking. You can plainly see that the budget was not very impressive.This movie might be noteworthy in that it's the only Star Trek film to have no aliens in it, besides Spock. It's got action and excitement, and those timeless themes of loyalty and honor or something equally wishy-washy, but there's nothing in here to really make you think, which is what the TV show always tried to do, even when it was being silly.EDIT: I recently watched \"The Wrath of Khan\" again, and found that I was wrong on a couple points. First, the pacing is leaden. Only James Horner's music creates any sense of excitement while the story slogs along. Second, there is hardly any chemistry among the three leads. In fact, Kirk and Spock only share two or three important scenes, and are separated for the rest of the film. Spock's famous final sacrifice is rendered nearly meaningless. Most of the actors appear lifeless; Shatner's performance in particular is shockingly wooden, and he mumbles his dialog. Was anyone really asking for a subdued, realistic performance from William Shatner?",

In the original series, Kirk always dealt with crazy threats out in space: aliens, robots, etc. In Star Trek II, he's dealing with much more human problems: fear of ageing, dying, becoming useless. This movie grounds itself in common fears of life that anyone can relate to and connect with.Khan is my favorite villain ever, and he really does add a lot to the film. He is the split-version of Kirk, driven solely by ego with no Dr. McCoy or Mr. Spock to guide him. Every time he appears on screen, he has a wonderful quote and he moves the plot forward. Equally terrifying and fun to watch with an electrical performance by Montalban.The performances by all the actors are great, as are the arcs they go through. This movie is much more mature than other entries in the series, and while I love Star Trek as a whole, this may be the very best outing to appear in the franchise.

With his old ship The Enterprise now being used as a Starfleet Academy training ship, his birthday is greeted by the news he's to travel aboard it on a two week cadet improvement course. Something that isn't making the Admiral any happier about his middle age blues. But what starts out as routine becomes far more deadlier when an old foe turns up with the power of creation in his grasp.Released three years after the lukewarm and soulless Star Trek: The Motion Picture, The Wrath of Khan reignited the fans fire and proved that Star Trek had a place on the big screen. Directed knowingly by Nicholas Meyer, Wrath Of Khan is a sequel to the TV Episode \"Space Speed\" that first aired back in Febuary 1967. Where tyrannical villain Khan Noonien Singh first made an appearance. Meyer, perhaps knowing that his take on things could either make or break the fledgling movie franchise, got the two main components right. Firstly the character dynamic was back, interplay on the Enterprise, be it camp, comic or serious, is crucial to making Star Trek work, and Meyer, along with Jack B. Sowards fill the screenplay with magical Trek exchanges. Secondly was perhaps the most important thing, to bring piratical villainy back into the fold. Khan {a superb Ricardo Montalban reprising the role} is back from his exile, with a newly commandeered ship, a band of followers and fuelled by an uncontrollable need for vengeance against all on the Enterprise. Especially Kirk. Thus this shakes not only the franchise from its stupor, but also Kirk from his, forcing him one might say, to boldly go once more.Having got Trek substance right, Meyer then added the other ingredients to make it an appealing blockbuster to those outside of fandom. Funny and tender moments are many and add heart to proceedings, and of course there's explosions and light shows to bring entertainment value to those in need of such with their sci-fi intake. Then there is the finale, a truly bold move in itself. Something that actually now gains more emotional impact if one has viewed J.J. Abrams excellent 2009 prequel reboot, Star Trek. Those after clever sci-fi shenanigans are catered for with the plot instrument that is The Genesis Device. Something our charismatic tyrant is all very keen to utilise of course. While logical Trekkie musings are inserted with care and consideration, none more so than with the brave ending that is as astutely poignant as it is shocking.There's lots of hair and even allowing for it being outer space, the fashion items remain colourfully dubious. But this is a fans favourite for many reasons, and all of them are viable arguments for this being one of the best films of the 11 big screen Star Trek entries thus far. It's nearly two hours long and not a minute is wasted for the discerning observer. 8/10",

            "content": "Watching Abrams' latest tepid outing on the big screen inspired me to re-watch the film from which he stole so much material. And it's better by an even vaster margin than I remembered.The thing about TWOK is that it's not without its minor plot-holes or inconsistencies, but it has the energy and compelling, driving core story to make them seem irrelevant. It's not the sumptuous visual feast modern CGI can turn out either... but again, that's to the good, as it also has none of the tacky, moronic excess that so characterizes the CGI era. Its effects are convincing and restrained, doing what they need to do and otherwise keeping out of the story's way.What brings TWOK to the apex of the Trek universe is that it embodies the basic premise Trek was original built around: the premise of telling great stories that *just happened* to take place in an SF setting. One of the finest episodes of the original series was \"Balance of Terror,\" a tense destroyer-versus-sub duel that could have come out of the Pacific Theatre of WW2 but for its SF trappings. TWOK riffed on this and created probably the best starship duel ever put to film, adding the original series' best-ever bad guy to the mix and putting it all together with masterful pacing and momentum. This is the difference that writing makes between a mediocre film and a great one.It was something of a curse, ironically, on the film franchise that they made it all look so deceptively straightforward and simple in TWOK. The Trek films never recovered this magic, never climbed these heights again, because too many subsequent directors -- Abrams now among them -- just didn't get what made the franchise's greatest instalment work so well. If the Next Generation crew ultimately proved the best in the televised medium, the original cast still owns the silver screen on the strength of this film.",

It is on many levels little more than a well made TV episode, but thats okay since the story is so good that you really don't care about anything else. Its also helped by the performance of Ricardo Montalban who chews scenery like there is no tomorrow and makes it clear why he was a decades long force in the film industry.

I'm not sure this was the most interesting way to go from that particular one, but what they get out of it is good. I'm sure I will take a lot of flack for this, but it does seem a little like Gene having less control proved a positive, at least in this case. The plot is well-written. The themes are another positive. This is, as Star Trek is when at its best, about the characters, and they're consistently and credibly written, and they have something to do this time, if not equal amounts. The acting is great. Notable that they got the same performer. The effects are nice, convincing and well-done, and they never take over. The action isn't bad, ditto the tension and the humor. Not all situations are satisfyingly resolved, going by their potential and/or set-up. There is genuine violence in this, and children should not see this, to a greater degree than earlier. The language is pervasive again, though almost invariably still not overly harsh. Props to this for depicting actual space phenomena. This isn't as exquisite visually as its predecessor, but it is well-shot, and editing and cinematography are well-done. I recommend this to fans of Star Trek and thinking man's science fiction, and would suggest that, if nothing else, Space Seed be watched first. 8/10",

Yes, Kahn is played by Ricardo Montaban and while he did some rather good work here and there, this is the best role I have ever seen him in. His ruthlessness displayed as he puts parasites in the ears of two people to use them in his plan of revenge. However, it is a ruthlessness born out of the death of his beloved wife, a death he places solely on the head of James T. Kirk. Shattner and Nimoy are in top form too as they have many memorable scenes together and the special effects battle sequences are very good and memorable as well. This is just one of those movies where everything came together, the first movie was overdone, others would seem more like television episodes, this one though felt like a very epic, science fiction action movie.",

That's because it is explicitly abstract and we have learned how to accept the abstractions, to scurry the goofy elements into hidy holes, just like we do when seeing romantic movies. That allows the filmmaker greater latitude to impose cinematic expressions, or to bend the story to those streams which exploit the visual imagination.That's why I think Star Trek in all its incarnations is a beast that eats souls, that dulls the mind of whole generations. Its a curse, every element through and through excepting only the score. I saw this only because someone else dragged me to it, and I find it ever so much worse than I recall. That's only in part because the effects are extremely hokey by today's standards.This is essentially a movie about two spaceships fighting, led by two men who pretend to be complex. Ahab and Lear are enlisted in the attempt to add weight to these characters. Its beside the point that the effects are ghastly, and the acting is among the worst ever seen.Its because of how the thing was conceived, the decisions about abstractions that were made.Those decisions were made in the sixties and to support a TeeVee show, about 40 minutes with 20 minutes of obnoxious ads. That means the characters are cartoons and the stories are so simpleminded and the moral so accessible that any dummy would \"get it.\"So we have simple morality plays in the TeeVee show that were grafted onto the chickenwire skeleton. Yes, they dealt with social injustice and should get credit for it. But they dealt with it in such a superficial buzzword brevity that we are now paying for it, with many folks thinking that life really is described in Spock parables. And we have the American political tradition based on similar simples parables.That's carried over to the films, all of them. The fans would have it no other way, and even if they would have allowed some maturity or depth anywhere in the vicinity, you're still be stuck with the same actors, characters and \"spaceship escapes\" setup.I watch a lot of 50's science fiction and marvel that we took much of it seriously at the time.

This was one of my first forays into Star Trek, and it's always been high on my list (and higher still after I learned the history, watched the show, etc.). These characters spring to life and there's familiarity with this crew. And Ricardo Montalban is one of the great movie bad guys; seething rage beneath Shakespearean eloquence.

Instead, it acts as a direct sequel to an episode of 'Star Trek (1966-1969)' called 'Space Seed (1967)', the events of which provide the motivation of this feature film's vengeance-seeking villain. Thankfully, the flick explains the events of the episode it follows in quite a bit of detail; you won't be lost if you haven't seen it. The picture is a major improvement over its predecessor, even if it certainly isn't as epic (likely because it was afforded only a quarter of the first feature's budget). Its story is more straightforward, yet it's also much more effective. It tells the tale of a training crew who get more than they bargained for when the Enterprise is diverted away from its routine trip and comes into contact with the merciless Kahn, whose thirst for revenge is certifiably unquenchable. He risks life and limb in a mad bid for revenge against Kirk, acting as an undeniably dangerous adversary for our heroes. Montalban might as well be considered a thief here because he steals absolutely every scene he's in. His performance expertly walks the line between seriously sinister and sort of silly. It's oddly charming, actually. Despite being undeniably hammy, he's genuinely threatening. He really is a fantastic villain. The picture focuses almost wholly on the conflict between Kahn and Kirk, which makes for a propulsive, well-paced and compelling affair overall. It's just a ton of fun, filled with witty writing and exciting action sequences. It's as often tense and suspenseful as it is lighthearted and fun.

            "content": "While many will hail the 2009 Star Trek reboot as the best ever outing of the franchise, it may have the special effects and the adrenaline rush to even rival Star Wars, but, somehow, it doesn't have the sheer dark moodiness of The Wrath of Khan.The second Trek film is helped by the fact that it follows a not particularly well-received first movie, therefore many considered that anything was a step up. However, the franchise seemed to step too far (where no man has gone before, perhaps?) and created a movie that has yet to be topped. Here we see Kirk up against an old foe from the TV series, genetically-engineers super psycho, Khan. It's a homicidal game of cat and mouse as they constantly chase and elude each other until they come to the ultimate climax - the death of one of the regular cast members (I'm sure you know which one!).Whereas one of the Star Wars franchises main strengths is its sheer 'mass appeal.' It's hard to find anyone who hasn't at least watched (and most likely enjoyed) one of the films. However, Star Trek will always carry more of a stigma about it and there are connotations of nerdy geeks wearing tight-fitting costumes at science-fiction conventions. That's the reason that, no matter how good a Trek film is, it's unlikely to win over many new fans.The Wrath of Khan will always live as the fans' favourite, until you come to the next generation (of us fanboys, not the cast from the eighties) who may well choose the 2009 reboot.If you like your sci-fi a little more moody and intense than simply a little pointy-eared green man talking backwards and then whacking a bloke in a cloak with a glowing stick, then you may just enjoy this, too.",

            "content": "Unlike most viewers of this movie, I have watched \"Space Seed,\" the \"Star Trek\" episode which introduces the character Khan. I highly recommend it. To give a little background to those who have not seen \"Space Seed,\" the Enterprise happens upon a lost spacecraft which holds Khan (Ricardo Montalban) in hibernation. Upon freeing him, Captain Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) learn that Khan was once a dictator on Earth. Facing defeat, he and his closest allies fled to space. That information comes too late, as Khan has already re-routed the ship's controls in an effort to take it over. After beating him in a fistfight, Kirk drops the criminal charges against Khan and his crew. Upon request, Kirk allows them to colonize Ceti Alpha V, but they have no way to leave.Fifteen years later, the USS Reliant approaches Ceti Alpha VI while looking for lifeless planets. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch), a former lover of Kirk, and their son David (Merritt Butrick) have created Genesis, a device meant to create life but also capable of great destruction. While scouting the surface, Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Reliant Captain Terrell (Paul Winfield) encounter Khan. As it turns out, Ceti Alpha VI exploded and altered the orbit of Alpha V, wiping out most of Khan's followers. Khan steals Reliant and sets up an ingenious sting for an unsuspecting Kirk, using Genesis as the bait.Although some later villains come close, none can match Khan, and there never may be one who will. He has changed since we last saw him. Back then he was charming and lively. An Enterprise Lieutenant defected to his side because of the vision and inspiration he offered her. He projected arrogance as he fought Kirk.Only parts of that man remain after fifteen years. Kirk never returned to see their desperate situation, and Khan holds an ocean of bitterness and resentment. Retribution has become his singular focus. When a crew member suggests that he does not need to kill Kirk, he responds, \"He tasks me, and I must have him! I'll chase around the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares Maelstrom and 'round perdition's flames before I give him up!\" Aside from Dr. Soran, Khan is the most intelligent of the Trek villains, and not even Soran matches his passion.Montalban's splendid, inspired acting completes the character. Khan's old personality surfaces only once, when he thinks he has Kirk at his mercy. Montalban embodies it just as well he did in 1967. At the other moments, he is equally adept. We see the pain raking his face and hear it pollute his voice when he must let the Enterprise flee, and when he informs Kirk of his plan to strand him, and again as he catches up with the Enterprise, when he refuses to end his pursuit no matter what the circumstances and when he literally spits his final words of hatred. Montalban works effectively with his eyes and breathing to display Khan's state of mind. Intimately evaluating acting with words alone is nearly impossible. Were I to use a structured grading sheet, Montalban would receive and A.Another critical element is the clashing, but close friendship between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Their differing personalities, which provide the best moments of the series, were mostly absent from \"The Motion Picture.\" Now they return. McCoy can call Spock a \"green-blooded inhuman\" one moment and become roused with concern for his safety another. Kirk and Spock understand each other so well that even Lt. Saavik (a well-casted Kirstie Alley), a fellow Vulcan and student of Spock's, cannot understand what their words mean. It is a fortunate fact that the movie can stand on its characters because the Space Battles, although necessary, are sorely limited by the budget. It is under one-third of the \"The Motion Picture's.\" When the starships attack and evade each other, they are mostly shown up close. They either move in straight lines or slow turns. The final blast, which ILM had to build a new device to capture, likely siphoned a large portion of the money away from action and limited sets. Director Nicholas Meyer compensates by focusing on the strategic aspect, particularly in the final encounter.This movie is all about its dynamic characters and conflicts, which hold it up by themselves. It seals its status as a classic with the ending, which I will not reveal although probably everybody knows it by now. All action needs good conflict, but sometimes conflict alone suffices. An action film without strong action is usually bad, but here is one that not only survives, but thrives.",

            "content": "Despite the fact that the first Star Trek motion picture rekindled an interest in the show, there existed a disconnect between the style/feel of the Original Series TV show and the style/feel of the first movie. In The Wrath of Khan, however, the focus shifts back to what made the show a success in the first place: great acting and character development, subtle humor, action/adventure scenes, and some thought-provoking concepts.In this film, a few members of the U.S.S. Enterprise stumble across an old nemesis from the TV show...Khan, a ruthless dictator who will stop at nothing to get his revenge on Captain Kirk, the man who imprisoned him. At the same time, Kirk is struggling with his advancing age, coming to terms with the fact that he will not be a starship captain forever. The final showdown between Kirk and Kahn will have you on the edge of your seating, rooting for the swashbuckling Kirk more than ever before.The pacing of this movie is just incredible, the biggest departure from the often-stodgy \"Motion Picture\" original. Not a wasted scene here, yet one never feels cheated.This movie also does a great job of showcasing the \"auxiliary\" characters (Uhura, Chekhov, Sulu, Scotty, etc.), who more often than not got the short end of the spool in the TV show. For devoted fans of the show, the final scene is likely the most gut-wrenching of any movie or TV episode, as fan-favorite Spock must make a split-second decision that will alter his life forever.To conclude, this might just be my favorite Trek film of the bunch, as it remains true to the ideals/concepts that made Star Trek such a cultural phenomena in the first place along with providing some great human drama in the process. For those of you who watched the first Star Trek film and were disappointed, take heart, as this film will set things back on track.",

This time they battle an old villain from the original show in Khan (played by Ricardo Montalban). Its hard for me to choose as this may be my favourite STAR TREK movie. Its between this one and part 4. I still remember the first time I ever watched this film back when I was in grade 8. I wasn't a STAR TREK fan really, but the ending kind of blew me away and sets up wonderfully for the next sequel.The basic plot to the film is that Starfleet's ship Reliant (Walter Koenig as Commander Chekov and Paul Winfield as Captain Terrell) is investigating for a lifeless planet so that they can use Genesis, which will create life where no life exists. They land on a planet which they believe to be Ceti Alpha VI, but soon find that Khan and his surviving crew are on this planet and Khan needs to exact some revenge against Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) who marooned him there.To me the pacing in this film is excellent and something to behold really compared to the original which I found stopped and started far too many times. Wonderfully directed by Nicholas Meyer (who also directed the great part 6 in the series). To me this may be Shatner's best portrayal of Kirk and shows me yes he was a good actor.In addition the music is totally brand new, which at first to me was shocking because the original did hit a homerun with its music. But, James Horner does such an amazing job you quickly forget all about the original's score.An absolute must-see for Trekkies and really has an awesome space battle between Kirk and Khan that plays out wonderfully to Horner's music.

Wrath of Khan, A well-directed, thrilling and surprisingly artful sequel, boldly moves this frontier into the future, all while staying true to the ethos of the classic series. Most importantly, it reminds us that it isn't our agendas, but our relationships that make life worth exploring. In 1982, audiences weren't expecting much from this franchise, after the TV series was unceremoniously canceled years earlier and the first film was such an uncharacteristic slog. Maybe the cool sets, practical effects, corny posturing and brilliant score were of no surprise. Maybe even the great correlation and juxtaposition between our hero and villain may have been inevitable, with Khan and Kirk basically being two sides of the same bloated-chest coin. However, to get a Star Trek film that's such a dark and powerful metaphor for the hardships of war must've been a watershed moment, especially within the Spock-Kirk arc. What especially surprises me is this film's status as a bonafide classic of the genre. Like other so-called \"Trekkers\", I love it, but how much of that is helped by my pre-existing fandom? Wrath\u0085 makes the decision not to waste time with character introductions or clunky backstory exposition; it assumes our knowledge of these things. Instead, it allows its strong script to stand on its own. The humor-injected dialogue, the consistent character moments, the straightforward plotting, and the wide-reaching themes connect us to these characters, whether for the first or hundredth time.",

            "content": "The Star Trek franchise has generally and maybe unfairly developed a reputation for being the threshold between socially acceptable science-fiction and nerd-dom. Basically, many people aren't prepared to boldly go where Star Trek does -- strange planets, a handful of make-up-covered new species and red laser beam special effects. Where Star Trek fans see alien nations, Trek skeptics see alienation. At the hands of the latter group, the second film installment of the franchise, \"The Wrath of Khan,\" will unfortunately suffer from these same prejudices. That is a shame, because its heartfelt tale of leadership is actually universal -- and not only in the interplanetary sense.Those who test the classic Star Trek waters with \"Wrath of Khan\" will be pleasantly surprised. For starters, intergalactic diplomacy is not the focus of this film -- the alien species count is kept low. Instead, \"Wrath of Khan\" is about the return of a middle-aged James T. Kirk (Shatner) to the U.S.S Enterprise as an admiral, taking Starfleet cadets out on a brief training exercise. But when former TV show villain Khan (Ricardo Montalban), a highly intelligent genetically engineered being, comes looking for swift revenge for being exiled by Kirk on a remote planet, the trip becomes more than training and Kirk must hop into the captain's chair once more. \"Khan\" is a coming-of-middle-age story, if you will. Kirk wrestles with getting older, competency and his appearance as role model to the cadets as the only cadet to ever beat the Kobayashi Maru test, a no-win simulation that tries a wannabe captain's character. He even comes face to face with an old lover who of course has a rebellious son. As he battles Khan, it becomes a test of who's smarter -- or who has the qualities a leader ought to have.That's not to say \"Khan\" doesn't live up to Trekkie standards. There are phaser battles between starships, parasites that control human will by wrapping around the cerebral cortex and plenty of seemingly inescapable scenarios. It's not Star Trek's most imaginative story, but one of its strongest. At times, the logic of all the solutions can be hard to follow, but the general idea of what's going on is all that's necessary to enjoy the film. A true character story, \"Khan\" is one of the old Star Trek films that fans (Trekkies aside) of the future will test out and discover that the vintage stuff wasn't so weird after all.",

The fact that Khan had been a villain in an episode of the original series makes it even better.Third- Awesome space battles. Again, I would say that many of the subsequent films tried to copy this and failed.Fourth- the pathos of the characters. Kirk dealing with concerns about his age and the path he followed and regrets that he didn't go the family route when confronted with his long-lost son. Spock making the ultimate sacrifice for his shipmates. Khan being so obsessed on revenge he leads his followers to their deaths.Hands down, this was the best Trek film, and the thing was that it was made on the cheap.

It's not meant to be a repeat of Wrath of Khan, actually it follows on directly from the end of Khan and if you watch them back to back they make one excellent 4 hour film, with all the same characters totally killing it in the acting stakes.WELL-worth returning to both the films if you haven't seen them for a while.

William Shatner is normally hilarious, is quite excellent here as James Kirk. The Wrath Of Khan introduced Star Trek to another generation of fans and was successful critically and commercially.

To seek out new twists on old story lines. To boldly go where no critic or fanboy expected them to go before.This time, it was to glory.On what is supposed to be a routine training mission, the Enterprise receives a disrupted communication from a space station where a mysterious project known as Genesis is being prepared. As senior officer, Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) reluctantly takes command to investigate. He's 50 now, and feels like the antiques he spends his days collecting. But space has a surprise in store, a blast from his past that will either reinvigorate Kirk...or kill him.There is a term for films like this, which revisit old franchises with loyal support networks: \"Fan service.\" Usually it's a pejorative for unoriginal thinking and lazy catch-phrase recycling. \"Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan\" transforms fan service into high art, and good fun.The acting by the cast of the 1960s TV series has a freshness about it. Kirk is older than we've seen him, and Shatner makes use of the challenge by playing him in a low-key, tired way, not the cocky bantam we knew before. Leonard Nimoy's Spock is logical as ever, but a bit cagier. DeForest Kelley's Dr. McCoy is cranked-up and cranky, in a humorous way that enlivens every scene he's in. And so on.Then there's the title character, another carryover from the TV series. Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n's performance was a revelation; in a film featuring Shatner, he's the actor chewing the scenery as the villainous Khan, and doing it wonderfully:\"Do you know the Klingon proverb, 'Revenge is a dish best served cold?' It is very cold in space.\"Director Nicholas Meyer joins in as the new kid in the franchise. Approaching \"Star Trek\" not as scripture but a space-age Horatio Hornblower update proved a smart touch. Watching Kirk v. Khan culminate inside the clouds of the Mutara Nebula is like seeing battle on a three-dimensional ocean, aided by James Horner's stirring score, a standout throughout the film.I first saw this movie at a benefit showing in Stamford, CT, the day before its big premiere in 1982. Many hard-core Trekkies were in attendance. Their cheers and laughter building throughout is something I recall every time I watch this again. I was at best a tepid fan, but by the end of that premiere, I was cheering, too.The film lacks in some details. My favorite series character, Scotty, is a marginal presence. Khan's soldiers look like \"Road Warrior\" rejects, and minor shortcuts are taken to move us from setpiece to setpiece. But even quibbles others have strike me as positives.Shatner has only one outsized acting scene, yelling \"Khan\" after being taunted by Montalb\u00e1n's voice on his communicator. People say it's too much, but I think it's marvelous, baiting the hook not only for an audience worried our doddering hero has finally lost it, but for the wrathful Khan who, now having tasted Kirk's pain, has his appetite whetted for what proves to be a ruinous chase. It's another of the tricks up Kirk's sleeve, whether he meant it or not.The film also presents a gripping ending, which you may already know, but remains unspoilable. As prichards12345 noted in his February 2015 review: \"I was cut up in 1982 when I first saw the movie, and I still get cut up now.\"Me, too. That's the magic of this film. Like Kirk says at the end, it makes what was old seem new again. And for those coming to this new to begin with, it's like you didn't miss a thing.",

Not that he was the only one in this film to ham things up - Shatner also did so with his now infamous \"Khan!\" scream.Odd then, that despite this level of scenery-chewing and camera-mugging the film is still (in my opinion) the best Star Trek movie of them all. Others come close, such as Voyage Home, for different reasons, but I've yet to see a Star Trek movie that matches this one for intensity.Perhaps it is the re-introduction of an old nemesis from the series, or the death of a favourite character, or simply the Enterprise crew doing what they do best - outsmarting an opponent. Whatever it is, Wrath of Khan has it in exactly the right quantities and at just the right times.And, though it might sound a little self-indulgent, whenever I see THAT scene (with a certain Star Trek stalwart dying) it brings to mind the fact that many of the original crews' actors are no longer with us.

Ricardo as Khan is just flawless perhaps the greatest Star Trek Villain ever and when you watch his performance it is a commanding role.The music is also the key to the film as each piece of music in the film helps tell the story and each scene gets it own special score.The special effects are some of the best ever in a film and it's all thanks to ILM who can be counted all for amazing work and this film is nothing less of their fine arts.Star Trek 2 The Wrath Of Khan is is a superb masterpiece and every fan of Star Trek can tell you how much the film is loved.Overall I give Star Trek 2 The Wrath of Khan an 10 out of 10 KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "There are many, many films, especially genre films which have great reputations but fail to live up to them on repeat viewings or, sometimes, on first viewings. However, as today's viewing marked the twentieth time I have seen \"Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan\", viewings spread over twenty years from childhood to adulthood, I find myself able to say with an unprecedented level of assurance that \"Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan\" is a film I believe to be truly 'great', not only a personal favorite but one which achieves excellence in so many ways that I find it genuinely hard to believe there are so many people out there who don't love this film. The film gave me goosebumps on this viewing, much like it does every single time I see it, without fail.The film boasts a brilliantly-written genre screenplay by Jack Sowards and director Nicholas Meyer (the original outline was written by executive producer Harve Bennett, developed into a full script by Sowards, then re-written once more by Meyer, who refused to accept a writing credit), perhaps its greatest strength. While there are 'plot holes' which fans have debated endlessly which I don't even want to mention for fear of them coming up again and a couple of contrivances, overall I find the screenplay to be consistently one of the tightest and most poignant pieces ever written for \"Star Trek\" in any of its incarnations in film or on TV. The Genesis subplot doesn't seem extraneous to me at all as some people feel, in fact I find much of the emotional poignancy of the film comes from Kirk's relationship with Carol Marcus and from the metaphorical significance of the Genesis project. It's also an important plot point, so I really have to say that considering it a flaw seems more like nitpicking to me than anything.The script covers a great deal of ground in under two hours. The opening stages are not merely a series of lame excuses to get the original crew back on the Enterprise, but actually contain great character development and insights into their behavior. The introduction of Khan and the principal story of the film is very effectively done, and very efficiently as well. This is a sequel to the famous \"Space Seed\" episode from the original series, but very quickly yet completely explains the origin of Khan's conflict with Kirk without laborious exposition or a slowing down of the film's extraordinary pace. Once the battle of wits gets going the film is pretty much unstoppable, greatly aided by Meyer's vision of the film as a nautical adventure, resulting in some terrific design and atmosphere (especially remarkable considering many of the sets were cannibalized from sets for the aborted \"Star Trek: Phase II\" series from the 70's. Yet with all the action and the military nature of the film (which, at this point, Roddenberry opposed, despite his original pitch for Star Trek containing phrases such as 'Wagon Train to the stars' and despite Kirk being based on Horatio Hornblower) it never loses sight of the core of Star Trek: the camaraderie and terrific character interactions. The actors don't betray the script's greatness in that regard either: Shatner gives a phenomenal, understated, dignified performance as Kirk, and is just devastatingly good in some scenes, with a few bits of overacting here and there but generally he's great. Do I even need to comment on Nimoy's Spock or Kelley's McCoy or any of the rest of the original cast? Nimoy's performance here barely manages to eclipse Shatner's as the film's best. It's just so wonderfully understated and beautiful. Oh, and Montalban as Khan is the epitome of a great scenery-chewing villain, but with an almost unexpected level of emotional gravity. The Melville quotes don't hurt either. \"Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan\" seems to me a perfect film. It contains everything which made \"Star Trek\" work in my estimation, except for the sexiness of the original series, but that omission is suitable considering the story and considering the aged crew. The film is just so exceptionally well-written, well-directed, and flawlessly paced. Fanboyish or not I simply have to say it: Spock's sacrifice is among the greatest cinematic moments of all time, and I always find myself tearing up at the end of this movie. It's not just a great adventure film, but one with truly, truly exceptional writing for the characters and an emotional poignancy and sense of melancholy which still surprises me no matter how many times I see it.",

And add to all that we get Kirstie Alley as a strangely alluring Vulcan officer. If one could complain, Ricardo's wonderful portrayal of Khan gets a tad shrill at the end, but whatever. Above all these other things is Nimoy's portrayal of Spock, a wonderful actor in a truly classic role, never done better or more effectively than here.

Star Trek; The Motion Picture suffered from a distinct lack of action, Star Trek 2 has it in SPADES! The Motion Picture was trying a little too hard to be 2001, Wrath of Khan took a good ep from the original series and turned it into genius, creating in Khan one of the most memorable villains of the Star Trek universe. The pace and tension just never lets up, Kirk's use of the prefix code 'Here it comes!'(surely James T's finest hour?) only bettered by the protracted and magnificent space battle within the nebula, Enterprise and Reliant slogging it out like battleships at Jutland.Yet at its' heart this is also an very human story about people and emotions, about the love between the characters, a love so great that they sacrifice themselves without hesitation. Spock's death is a bit of a cheat when you've seen the later sequels, it loses some of its' impact but is great when you view it first time around. One thing that always strikes me when watching it is how incredibly violent it is for a PG rated film, it's quite amazing what they were able to get away with Quite frankly this is the Star Trek film all others should aspire to.",

            "content": "My Take: Considered the best of the STAR TREK movies, and for most of its parts, it's hard to argue with that. I was simply blown away by J.J. Abrams' new STAR TREK reboot that my inner admiration for the 10-film big screen STAR TREK series is somehow reawakened. I'm not exactly a an avid fan of Gene Roddenberry's 43 year-old franchise, which began as a TV series and proceeded into a movie series and continued with more TV shows. But to be honest, I have grown a sort of affection for the big-screen series, which I find interesting and enduring as stand-alone films. But after seeing the new reboot (and loving it), I guess it's time to pay a visit to those classic original crew movies. And what better place to start than one of the best in the series: STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN? While I loved the new STAR TREK for the typical summer-movie dosage of action, humor and thrills, I also liked how it had time to introduce (or is that reintroduce?) the characters and work on some intriguing plot lines. STAR TREK: THE WRATH OF KHAN may not be big on spectacular explosions and more elaborate space battles, but its an absolutely rousing space opera with an interesting plot, some intriguing ideas and strong character development. STAR TREK wasn't really about space dogfights and Death Stars, and I guess it's probably for the best. The last thing people expect back then was another sci-fi sensation trying to be as big as STAR WARS was. Instead, WRATH OF KHAN geared itself with much more interesting ideas, including a far more intriguing villain. Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan, probably the most popular villain ever in the STAR TREK universe (though there wouldn't much of a competition), is truly unforgettable, especially with much deeper motives. He has ceased control of a Federation Starship and has also stolen the Genesis missile, possibly one of the most lethal doomsday device in the universe (ironically, it was supposed to be used as means to create life on a barren planet!), and yet, his real motive is vengeance. Vengeance has poisoned his mind, and has driven him completely mad. Guess they just don't make villains this good anymore! Captain (now Admiral) Kirk (William Shatner) has his own issues. He was captain of the USS Enterprise for many a year and age has surely caught up with him. Being Admiral puts those gung-ho days behind him, but he still longs to boldly go where no one has gone before. Can't science fiction movies be this thoughtful with their characters? Add to that, there's the familiarity and camaraderie between the popular crew that I have grown to love about these movies. They may just beat STAR WARS when it comes with the power of the team! But perhaps one of the best things about WRATH OF KHAN is that, despite a few minor details, is a purely stand-alone movie. Sure one of its prime directives is to reunite its fans after the alienation the much-maligned STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE did. But whether or not you know who Khan or anyone else is, WRATH OF KHAN is not grounded in its fanbase. There's about something for everyone here, just as long as you know what to expect. Anyone expecting a special effects overdrive are missing the point. Since STAR TREK was more of a thinking person sci-fi movie, WRATH OF KHAN is more space opera than it is a sci-fi action movie. Still, there are some dazzling special effects and thrills here and there. The tightly-staged space battles are not exactly on par with STAR WARS', but they're just as enjoyable thanks to some well-crafted special effects and a rousing score by James Horner. The performances aren't exactly Oscar-worthy, but this familiar cast portraying these familiar characters? Could it be done any other way? I think not! Overall, STAR TREK: WRATH OF KHAN is still one of the best, if not the very best to everyone else, in the successful big-screen series. Still a must-see! Rating: ***** out of 5.",

            "review_title": "Superior sequel and possibly the finest of the series",
            "content": "SPOILERSTwo years after Captain Kirk and his crew got their first outing on the big screen, Nicolas Meyer directed the vastly superior \"The Wrath Of Khan\". Released in 1982, \"The Wrath Of Khan\" has come to be regarded as one of the finest films of the series. Even compared with 2003's \"Star Trek: Nemesis\", Khan is still the superior film featuring a better plot, better action scenes, and some brilliant moments of personal confrontation.\"Star Trek: The Wrath Of Khan\" begins with the USS Enterprise under attack from some Klingons. With young Lieutenant Saavik (Kirstie Alley) in command, the ship takes large amounts of damage before she is rescued by Admiral Kirk ending this simulation. As fast becomes apparent, Kirk, Uhura (Michelle Nichols) and the majority of the crew of the Starship Enterprise have been pushed to one side. Put in charge of training new recruits, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) remains about the Enterprise as Captain. This crew will eventually be once more put to the test however as Khan, an old enemy of Kirk, has escaped his exile and is in control of the Starship Relliant. Kirk must travel to see an old love and his grown up son as he fights with Khan over an awesome power known as the Genesis Device.Unlike the first major \"Star Trek\" film, the beauty of this second outing is that the crew appear to be aware of their age. Whilst the first film was a superficial, shallow affair where special effects took precedence over plot, this second film demonstrates a greater maturity. In line with this, we are shown a cast of ageing heroes who are lead by a man who is beginning to become aware of his age and the mistakes of his life. Whilst in \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\", William Shatner's Kirk appeared to have degraded to some old man who still thought he was twenty-five, in this second piece, from the moment he has his birthday present and Dr McCoy (the late, great DeForest Kelley) gives him some reading glasses, we are shown a Kirk who is aware that time is catching up with him and who is beginning to feel alone in the world. All those years of chasing women and flying around in his spaceship have left Kirk unable to settle with a woman and have left him increasingly isolated in his older age.The second wonderful aspect of this sequel is that it abandons certain fashion trends. In the first film, Uhura had a distinctive seventies hairstyle and the uniforms reflected the time period. By Khan however, the irritating pale uniforms had given way to a much more appealing red number which remained dignified and simple. Whilst younger crewmen would run around in red and white jumpsuits and work hard, the elder, more senior members of the crew were able to wear red, spacious uniforms which hid any growing stomachs and which could make them look fashionable in a timeless sort of way.All \"Star Trek\" fans or \"Trekkies\" have their favourite films in this ever expanding series, but the one point which personally seems to suit is that the better films in the series tend to be those with enigmatic, intelligent enemies. In \"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\" (1991), Christopher Plummer is absolutely wonderful as the Shakespeare quoting General Chang, whilst in this film Ricardo Montalban is equally as good as the revenge obsessed Khan. In comparison, the weak, most recent instalment, the awkwardly named \"Star Trek: Nemesis\" (2003) features a young child as the enemy who lacks any sort of decent malice and who could do with a few lessons in evil off either Khan or Chang.Perhaps, the final and most crucial thing about \"The Wrath Of Khan\" is that the ending is spot on. Unlike the ending of \"Nemesis\", when a main character is killed off in this film, it feels like he is given a proper eulogy and is properly finished with. It's always a brave risk to kill off a main part of the \"Star Trek\" universe and whilst the recent attempt didn't quite get it right, this version in 1982 was superb and managed to hit the right note.To summarise therefore, the beauty of \"The Wrath Of Khan\" is not the excellent script and the superb special effects, but the facts that it has a superb enemy and that the old crew act their age. If the worlds obsession with celebrities proves one thing, it is often that the famous are scared to act their age. In the first film, the entire crew of the Starship Enterprise looked almost pathetic in their attempts to look young and fresh. By comparison however, in this encounter, Kirk is facing up to his own mortality and the film is considerably better for it. \"The Wrath Of Khan\" is a superb addition to this fictional universe simply for that one fact that the crew finally grows up and demonstrates that it's possible to be old whilst still saving the universe. For once \"Live long and Prosper\" takes on a whole new meaning.",

This is due to literate Nicholas Meyer, an auteur who would again reinvigorate the series with Star Trek VI.

And the score by then 29 year old James Horner is so well done, his score for this film will come to be recognized not only to Trekkies but to everyone else.

Everything about this film just works - from Kirk's coming to terms with his advancing age to the return of Khan, from the Genesis project to the death of Spock - this is great story-telling and fine movie-making. How we could do with more sci-fi movies of this calibre instead of the empty, soulless, and illogical (sorry!) blockbusters littering our screens in the 21st Century.I really like William Shatner in this movie; his Kirk here is no longer the brash Captain of the original series but thoughtful, mature and even slightly depressed as the story opens: a world away from the hammy overacting he's well known for. Except of course, for one glorious moment - \"Khhhhaaaaaaan!\" He's ably supported by Leonard Nimoy as a contented Spock and De Forest Kelly's acerbic Bones. And of course the return of Ricardo Montalban as Khan is just the icing on the cake. One of Star Trek's best ever villains. Montalban is just wonderful.Nick Meyer keeps a perfect tempo with his direction, and I believe he performed an uncredited re-write on the script after some early drafts were deemed to be not working, Meyer may well be \"The Man Who Saved Star Trek.\" There's drama, excitement, a great space battle, a terrific sci-fi premise, plenty of humour, and a genuinely sorrowful yet hopeful ending. Spock's death is still hard to watch without being deeply moved (I was cut up in 1982 when I first saw the movie, and I still get cut up now.) What more could you ask for?",

            "content": "Despite a lot of criticisms about its extreme slowness and length, in marked contrast to the original TV series, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE nevertheless was a huge box office hit, and spawned an ultimate Hollywood franchise: the only known one to come off of a TV series that, in its original network run, never did any better than number 35 in the Nielsen ratings. The first of the franchise's sequels was 1982's STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN.The crew of the \"Enterprise\", led by the indefatigable Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Spock (Leonard Nimoy), having survived the encounter with V'ger in the first film, are back, and there are some new and old twists. The new one is in establishing the fact that Shatner's Kirk has a son (Merritt Buttrick) and an ex-wife (Bibi Besch), both of whom have come up with an experiment in creating life on what would otherwise be dead worlds, an experiment called, for better or for worse, Genesis. But the old one is a menace from Shatner's own past. Khan Singh, the character from the original series episode \"Space Seed\" (air date: February 16, 1967), portrayed once again by Ricardo Montalban (well removed from TV's \"Fantasy Island\" or hocking Chrysler automobiles with their \"rich, Corinthian leather\") has been found alive on the dead planet Alpha Ceti V; and with a crew that has stayed with him for the fifteen years since Kirk abandoned him there, he has now come back for a most brutal revenge. And it eventually comes to involve Buttrick's and Besch's well-meant Genesis Experiment. The end result is a hugely entertaining space opera, though somewhat violent\u0085and, of course, with a climax that will eventually lead to the third film in the series that came in 1984.In contrast to the stateliness of the original film, which was directed in almost Kubrickian fashion by Robert Wise, STAR TREK II finds veteran TV director Nicholas Meyer, whose credits include 1979's TIME AFTER TIME, and the later, ultra-controversial 1983 made-for-TV World War III drama THE DAY AFTER, at the helm, giving the screenplay by Jack B. Sowards (from a story co-authored by Sowards and Harve Bennett) a tremendous amount of energy, especially in the spectacular and decidedly tragic finale. As always, Shatner and Nimoy are aided in the enterprise (no pun intended) by the Usual Suspects: Nichelle Nichols; DeForest Kelley; Walter Koenig; James Doohan; and George Takei. Kirstie Alley made her feature acting debut here as Saavik; and Montalban, though he is about as over-the-top as is possible for a villain to be, is also exceptionally good in his savagery.The special effects work, which I think still holds up almost a third of a century later, is great, as is the majestic score by James Horner, his first for the series, and one that helped establish him as a force in the business of movie music (he later went on to score BRAINSTORM, AN American TAIL, and APOLLO 13, among others). The \"Trekkie\" set will definitely like STAR TREK II, but so too will any self-respecting sci-fi or special effects maven.",

            "content": "The second installment in the movie series based on the popular TV show is one of the most timeless and action-packed of the Trek movies.  After the financially successful but otherwise total disaster of a film Star Trek: The Motion Picture, it was a fairly refreshing change of pace to see the filmmakers go back to their old TV show roots with the crew on a fairly typical mission of fighting a standard space terrorist.  The big kicker here is that this terrorist happens to be Khan, who was Kirk's enemy in the classic first season episode Space Seed.  The filmmakers even were fortunately able to use the same actor for Khan, a much older but still quite lively Riccardo Montalban.  Montalban's performance is probably the best in the film, upstaging all the Trek regulars as well as the late Bibi Besch (who plays Kirk's wife).   Blaxploitation regular Paul Winfield is also quite good as a starship pilot who gets possessed by Khan's brain-eating sand bugs.Technically, Star Trek 2 has to be one of the most impressive looking yet with a massive explosion near the end to signify the birth of the \"Genesis\" planet.  A few shots of the planet that the Regula-1 station was orbiting looked a little cheesy, but by and large the effects were done quite well as was the stunt work during the battle scenes.  Thankfully, the star fleet uniforms were updated to look a little more colorful and military and a little less 70's.  Also, most of the crew's haircuts were toned down to look a little less \"contemporary\".  Hence, the film doesn't have the dated look of the first and most of the special effects still hold up very well.  Even the animated Tron-type CGI educational sequence about the uses of \"Genesis\" can be considered quite impressive.By and large, this has to be the most violent of the Star Trek series (with the exception of the new First Contact) with ample bloodletting, a couple nasty phaser-disintegrations, and the aforementioned brain-eater bugs.  On top of that, it is one of the darkest of the Trek series, with the Enterprise taking a good deal of damage and losing a large sum of its personnel to Khan's frequent attacks.  There's even a scene where Kirk and his men find that Khan tortured and skinned-alive most of the Regula-1 scientific team.  What helps to liven some of the grim proceedings is the humor played between Kirk and his men, most notably the arguments between Spock and McCoy.  McCoy is a passionate and moral man while Spock judges only by logic and pragmatism.  Their frequent culture clashes on issues like planetary extermination are quite lively and whimsical, and it is similarly interesting to see how Kirk and Spock frequently outsmart an overly proud Khan. As it is, Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan is still considered one of the best of the long running 9-part Star Trek series, only closely followed by 4 and 6.  Star Trek 6 in many ways borrowed ideas from this film, with its Shakespeare-quoting villain in a superior spaceship still somehow outsmarted by Kirk and the gang.  It's especially nice to see the same old gang sticking together after more than 20 years.",

            "content": "This one got it right.  After the rather boring first attempt, a film emerged that took elements of the tv show and expanded them to epic proportions.  This had everything:  drama, humor, action, pathos, terror, character development, and atmosphere.  We saw the return of one of the stronger guest characters from the show and an epic battle between a hero and an anti-hero.Much talk has been given to the whole \"even-numbered movies are better\". Personally, I don't think that is quite true.  To me, it's the ones with Nicholas Meyer involved that are better.  Meyer brings a much needed outsider's viewpoint to the project; but, one that has a reverence for the source material.  Meyer had shown that he could expand upon a great concept with his novel the Seven Per Cent Solution, an updating of Sherlock Holmes. Here, he tackles the world of Star Trek.Meyer dives right in by showing that these characters are aging and getting closer to retirement.  He presents a crew that is a step slower, but far more experienced.  They are surrounded by younger crew members who look at them with respect and awe, and, in some cases, bewilderment.Spoilers:Khan was the perfect antagonist.  Here we have an epic character, more anti-hero than villain.  He is a genetically engineered superman, but with an arrogance to match.  His people were exiled in the original series, but given a chance to form their own world by Kirk.  Unfortunately, tragedy has struck them and only a few have survived.  When the USS Reliant stumbles upon them, Khan seizes his chance at revenge, for what he perceives Kirk has done to him.Meanwhile, we discover that Kirk has a son, a brilliant scientist who has helped develop a device which can engineer planets.  This becomes Khan's weapon to strike at Kirk.Kirk must face a son who hates him, and come to terms with the fact that the feelings are justified, as Kirk wasn't there as he grew.The film climaxes in a spectacular battle between Kirk and Khan, via their spaceships.  This was the first time that large scale ship-to-ship combat had been portrayed with great creativity.  The ships play cat and mouse through a nebula, taking their shots when the moment is right.  The Reliant is mortally wounded, but Khan launches one final blow, by activating Genesis.  The Enterprise has been crippled and cannot escape.  The Kobayashi Maru scenario has become reality for the crew.  Spock finds a way out, sacrificing himself in the bargain.The performances are great, with some tendencies towards ham.  Montalban recaptures the fire of Khan and exudes charisma.  Shatner is at his subdued best when directed by Meyer.  In commentary, Meyer has stated he would shoot take after take to get Shatner to settle into a performance that was right. It works quite well, as it serves to keep him in check. Nimoy presents a Spock who has come to terms with his mixed heritage and has become a mentor. Kirstie Allie was a tremendous addition.  She captures the personna of a Vulcan and brings a new mix to the Kirk/Spock relationship.  Merritt Butrick gives a fine performance as David Marcus, Kirk's estranged son.  The rest of the cast are given their moments to shine.The effects were top notched, thanks to the addition of ILM to the production.  The costumes were a welcome change, giving a military flavor to the crew, something that an agency named Starfleet would suggest.  The nautical elements also provide a nice connection to the past.All in all, there is little to fault in this film.  The script is excellent, the performances good, the story is gripping, and the effects are dazzling, while advancing the story.  If you only ever see one Star Trek movie, watch this one.",

            "content": "The Star Trek feature film debut had its fair share of ambition and spectacle, but was a lumbering beast of a film that proved bewildering and somewhat dull. It makes for a decent space opera, but in their wisdom, the filmmakers realized that they needed to spice things up for the inevitable sequel. Even at the expense of kicking Gene Roddenberry - the revered creator of the franchise - to the curb.Thus, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan came into fruition. Coming after the classic Trek episode Space Seed, this film brings back Khan Noonien Singh as the story's nemesis, and the whole thing becomes a rocketing thrill ride from then on. Space battles are fairly simple and short, but they are still quite spectacular to watch, especially with the colorful backgrounds of the Mutara Nebula. The pacing is even throughout, and the film boasts some remarkable iconic moments that all audiences can recognize and relate to.The story is appealing; even though there is plenty of action and peril in the movie, it has enough breathing space for quality characterization and theme development. A good chunk of room is left for Kirk contemplating his old age and mortality, and thanks to the parallels of the Genesis torpedo and the film's ultimate solution, strong themes of death and rebirth emerge very subtly. Even without such elements, the characters come off as being well-rounded and enjoyable. The story covers some fascinating concepts, and is well-structured.This film is shot and edited with quality precision. Acting is phenomenal: while it is always a joy to see William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, and the rest of the crew in action, Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n steals the show as the villain, with a powerful and iconic performance. Writing is great, featuring plenty of great memorable lines. The production has a fine array of solid sets, props, costumes, and special effects (costumes in particular are much improved from the last Trek picture). Music, despite deviating from the classic Trek themes, has a catchy melodic charm of its own.Of this film, I can say this. Of all the Trek films I have known, this still the most...endearing.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",

Having seen it again on TNN recently, I'm not sure why I disliked it so much, and while I won't call it the best Star Trek film (that honor lies with First Contact), it's an entertaining adventure highlighted by good performances, memorable special effects, and two tense space battles.The Wrath of Khan is a sequel to the episode, \"Space Seed\", where evil genius Khan and his gang were exiled on a planet.  Khan and his group escape, hijack a starship, and plans vengeance upon Kirk.  Then there's the genesis device, a machine capable of creating new life, but also has the potential to destroy those the living.  It all leads to a tense showdown between the two biggest egos in the universe.There are a lot of things about The Wrath of Khan that still bug me. For one, how the hell does Khan recognize Chekhov (stating how he never forgets a face), considering Space Seed was a season one episode, and Walter Koenig didn't become a member of the cast until season two.  Then there's Khan and his gang of marauders themselves, who look more like rejects from a He-man audition than genuinely menacing villains.  And is it just me, or does Ricardo Montalban's chest look, well, fake?  Bibi Besch and Meritt Buttrick make very small impressions, and this movie's also got Kirsty Alley, the most annoying actress who's not Rosie O'Donnell to ever grace the screen. I also didn't much care for James Horner's score, which aims to be rousing, but comes off as occasionally grating, and certainly can't hold a candle to Jerry Goldsmith's famed Trek score.With those criticisms out of the way, there was a lot I enjoyed about the film.  William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban make for an effective protagonist/antagonist duo, with the former delivering a genuinely good performance and the latter chewing the scenery with aplomb.  Leonard Nimoy is excellent as Spock, as always.  The most acclaimed aspect of the movie has always been its space battles, and while they don't really hold a candle to the opening sequence of First Contact, these two setpieces nicely emphasize strategy over visual spectacle (which it still has) to up the suspense factor.The most memorable scene of the whole film is the emotional climax, which features the death of a major character.  This represented the first time that Star Trek could not only engage the mind and rattle the nerves, but also touch the heart (and put a lump in your throat).  The Wrath of Khan appears to be the series fan-favorite, and I can see why, but too much of it doesn't click with me.  Still, recommended to those looking for a space opera with the occasional dose of action and pathos.",

The acting is great and the special effects are pretty good, the plot has a connection to a Star Trek episode which featured Khan. In Star Trek II Kirk is bored of being Admiral and misses the days as Captain of the Starship Enterprise. Kirk is sent to the Enterprise for an inspection, meanwhile Khan and his fellow people hijack a Starship and forces the two to call the Scientists working on the Genesis project that they need it. Kirk gets a message from his old wife and goes to the Genesis to find that mostly everyone is dead, he meets his son, wife and a few other scientist in the underground where they discover that Pavel Chekov and the Capatin of the hijacked Starship have them at gun point because of the worms they put in their ears, the Capatin kills himself and the worm comes out of Chekov's ear. Khan then beams up the Genesis device and Kirk is trapped on the underground. While waiting underground they see that the Genesis has created life in the underground cave, soon they're beamed up to they're Starship where they then must defeat Khan in a Starship battle.Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a great sequel that should be seen. 10/10",

Kirk will face an old enemy bent on vengeance, and must retain control of the Genesis device (a terraforming probe capable of destroying all life on a world). Ultimately, Kirk and Spock must face up to the Kobayashi Maru, a no-win scenario that will require the ultimate sacrifice.Still widely regarded as the best film in the Star Trek pantheon, Star Trek 2 reinvigorated the Star Trek franchise by focusing on character, adventure and excitement. Tonally, it's very different to the first film. Gone is the sterility and pretentiousness, replaced by a focus on character, grit and excitement. The sequel acknowledges the fact that the cast have grown older and turns this into a strength as it humanises the characters.\"There's a man out there I haven't seen in fifteen years who's trying to kill me. You show me a son that'd be happy to help. My son... my life that could have been... and wasn't. How do I feel? Old... worn out.\" - James KirkNicholas Meyer brings a naval feel to proceedings, which is augmented by a wonderfully bombastic musical score from James Horner. Meyer also brings a 'literate' approach to the material, with characters readily quoting from Shakespeare, Milton and Dickens. Spock gives Kirk the book 'A Tale Of Two Cities' for his birthday, \"surely the best of times\", he suggests.\nShatnerKirk, reading 'A Tale of Two Cities' as his shuttle approaches the Enterprise.Meyer takes concepts from Greek tragedy, painting Kirk as a flawed hero, who must endure the results of some bad decisions. Kirk chose to maroon Khan on Ceti Alpha V, and as Khan states \"he never bothered to check on our progress\". Kirk chose a life in Starfleet rather than with Carol Marcus and his son, resulting in his estrangement from his family. Finally, Kirk ignores procedure (and Saavik's advice), failing to raise the Enterprise's shields, when communication is not established with Reliant. This ultimately results in at least one crew members death and extensive damage to the ship.\"The hero always thinks he knows the answer, and ultimately he learns that he doesn't. [...] There is always a point in Greek plays, known as 'peripatea', where the hero learns that everything he knew is wrong.\" - Nicholas MeyerRicardo Montalban plays Khan, who can be seen as an Ahab like figure, chasing down Moby/Kirk across the ocean of space.\"No. No, you can't get away. 'From Hell's heart... I stab at thee. For hate's sake I spit my last breath... at thee'.\"Khan, quoting Moby Dick.Although Khan's vengeance drives the film, it's also about renewal, both literally, with the Genesis device and figuratively, with Kirk realising that his first, best destiny is to be captain of the Enterprise. There are also themes of friendship, age, loss and death, which are all tied to an exciting screenplay.Meyer exploits the best aspects of Leonard Nimoy and William Shatners acting strengths. In fact, Shatner is a revelation in this movie. Often criticised for being hammy, he turns in a powerful performance in Star Trek 2. Kirk is vulnerable, yet decisive and the final scene where Spock is trapped behind the glass is very well acted by both men.The ever reliable and effortlessly cool Deforest Kelley also puts in a wonderful performance and provides much of the films heart. I especially like this sardonic one liner as Kirk and McCoy prepare to beam down to Regula One.Spock: Jim, be careful.\nMcCoy: *We* will!Khan-from-spaceSome say this is overacting, but if I'd just been marooned and had my ship all shot up, I'd be pretty pissed too.Star Trek: The Motion Picture was one of the most expensive films that Paramount had ever produced. For Star Trek 2, the budget was greatly reduced and a Star Trek aficionado can spot reused props and indeed some visual effects from The Motion Picture. The Enterprise bridge set from Star Trek: The Motion Picture was redressed for use as the Kobayashi Maru simulator, the Enterprise bridge, and the Reliant bridge.Meyer turns the lack of budget into a positive, the shipboard action provides the film with a claustrophobic feel. Sequences like the tense showdown between Kirk and Khan in the nebula, give the feel of an old World War 2 submarine movie.ILM supply the visual effects, which hold up well - even today. Of particular note to fans of cinema is the groundbreaking Genesis effect sequence, which pioneered the use of CGI on film. A 1882 'making of' can be viewed on YouTube.",

If it had been terrible, it would have flopped. And if it would have flopped, it would have meant the end of the \"Star Trek\" universe. Fortunately, what it became was a great action film with spectacular space battles, mind-boggling special effects, and a less cerebral story than its predecessor. The plot revolves around the return of Khan (Ricardo Montalban), a genetically engineered psychopath who once tormented Kirk in the original series episode \"Space Seed\" and is now back for one purpose: revenge. And he is presented with opportunities to get this revenge everywhere: in meeting an old crew-mate of Kirk's, in dealing with his family, in an attempt to trap the Admiral, etc.As is most unusual, Kirk can actually count on the crew (admit it-- they really didn't have much to do in the series) to help him, which is a nice bonus. This time around, we get the added bonus of great emotional scenes (I never thought I'd say that) and a look at a nebula that is visually one of the most interesting environments in the entire franchise.\"You still remember?

This combined with his 50th birthday leave him questioning whether he is still of any use and what he must do to regain his youthful spirit that had served him so well. These subtle themes are hit at perfect moments in this movie with great effect while on the surface, we still get the most nail-biting, emotionally charged adversarial conflict in all of Star Trek. Khan has escaped the far off planet he'd been marooned on years earlier at the conclusion of the \"Star Trek\" Season 1 episode, 'Space Seed'. We learn that in those years, planetary catastrophes ended up killing most of his comrades and his wife while no effort was made in all that time to check on these people left there to die. Khan lays the blame for this squarely at Kirk's feet and soon steals his own Federation star-ship to pursue him and enact his vengeance if it's the last thing he does.

            "content": "It's easy to see why this movie succeeded after the failure of the first Star Trek film: \"The Wrath of Khan\" aims very low, so it can't miss. The story is instantly familiar from classic Westerns and adventure stories, the drama is mundane and domestic, and there's lots of action. Don't look too closely, or pull too hard on any loose threads, or the whole thing will unravel.Nicholas Meyer took over the franchise with this movie and decided that the whole \"exploring space\" thing was too hard to get a handle on. Instead, he brought back a villain from the old TV show and had him chase Captain Kirk around in circles for the better part of two hours. Along the way there's a bit of melodrama: Kirk's midlife crisis, an old flame, and an estranged offspring, as if his life weren't complicated enough already. The old gang comes along for the ride, even though few of them have any excuse for being there. (It's worth mentioning the delightful irony that Meyer, who never served in any military, introduced the silly space-navy look to the franchise in this film, while Gene Roddenberry, the notorious peacenik, was a decorated bomber pilot in WWII.)I won't dwell on plot holes, because there are too many of them. If you like \"Wrath of Khan's\" blend of action and soap opera, those little inconsistencies and mistakes will hardly matter to you. Other mistakes are bigger and more bothersome: the Genesis Device that Khan wants to get hold of is no more than a MacGuffin, whose duty it is to drive the plot and explode when necessary. (Khan's quest for revenge fulfills similar requirements). The terraforming angle pops up as an obligatory piece of science fiction paraphernalia, mostly so that Doctor McCoy can compare science to \"playing God\", as if that hadn't been done a million times before. The dialogue is stilted and cluttered with shout-outs to Charles Dickens and Herman Melville, perhaps to lend an air of dignity, and the acting veers woozily back and forth between hammy and wooden.The music is superb, and does most of the film's hard work. Without James Horner's nautical score, there would hardly be any suspense or excitement during the many space battles in the final act. The special effects are quite decent, even the ones that aren't nicked from the previous movie. If it weren't for those two things \"The Wrath of Khan\" would feel too much like a TV film -- above average, but not nearly as good as the show it was based on.",

            "content": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture was a huge financial success. So, it seemed right that a sequel should be made and of course, one was made in 1982. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is considered by many to be the best of the Star Trek films and it is not very hard to see why. Your usual cast returns for this film with a few new additions. Kirstie Alley (Village of the Damned and several TV appearances), Paul Winfield (The Terminator and several TV appearances) and Ricardo Montalban who plays the titular Khan. For those who don't know, Montalban played Khan in an episode of the original series of Star Trek. Nicholas Meyer is in the director's chair this time around and he would later go on to direct Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. For the musical score, we have James Horner composing and all of the music is original and new for the film. Upon release, the film gained positive reviews. Notably, Gene Siskel gave this film a positive review after having not liked the first film. The film was a financial success having grossed $97 million. Now despite not grossing as much as the first film, this film was a much more profitable film due to this film's reduced budget of about $12 million.The crew of the USS Enterprise are getting older and are back on Earth. With Mr. Spock now the captain of the USS Enterprise, Admiral Kirk and co. get back on the Enterprise to oversee some new Starfleet trainees. Meanwhile, the USS Reliant is doing research on a planet they believe to be Ceti Alpha VI which is thought to be a dead planet. They need a dead planet to conduct the Genesis experiment which is supposed to create life on a dead planet. Well, it turns out that Ceti Alpha VI is in fact Ceti Alpha V and there are in fact life forms. Khan and the rest of the crew of the SS Botany Bay manage to escape their imprisonment (caused by the events of the episode that they all appeared in) and take control of the USS Reliant. Now, Khan wants his revenge on Kirk and perhaps the Genesis device might be a way in doing so........Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a fantastic film in several ways. The film's flaws are very small and to be honest, rather insignificant. What problems that people had with the first film, are fixed by this film and I am not saying that because that is the general consensus, if one actually watches this film, chances are you will like this film or at least see an improvement over the first film. I honestly do not where to start as I will most likely be repeating the fact that everything is improved for the most part. Character and acting wise, this is the best so far and we are only two movies in. The main focus here is Kirk and Khan. Kirk's age is very apparant here in this film and it is even brought up and done so very well. William Shatner gives the best performance ever he will ever give in this film. He really portrays this character in a way that we will not quite ever see again. Khan here is fantastic. I have seen the original series episode with Khan and I do see an improvement here. Ricardo Montalban gives a very chilling performance as Khan and I will say that Khan is one of the best villains in Star Trek or even a top ten villains of all time list. Having Khan included was what the franchise needed and it is a way for the films to acknowledge their roots. Other characters are fine. It really is the minor characters that I have a problem with and really it is only one. Lt. Saavik played by Kirstie Alley is really the only character I have a problem with. The character does not add much to the story and the performance overall is not very good but I will take into consideration that this is one of the first film performances of Kirstie Alley. Luckily, she gets recast in the next couple of films. Since she is not a major character, this is something that can be easily overlooked as the rest of the film heavily overshadows these types of minor flaws. The special effects were a highlight for the first Star Trek film and this is where it gets interesting with this film. This film is not as effects heavy or at least in the same nature as The Motion Picture. The budget was lower because they wanted to focus more on the story which I am all fine with. The effects look good here still. Do keep in mind that this film is vastly different from The Motion Picture. The Motion Picture was a slow paced experience film ala 2001: A Space Odyssey. This film goes with the action approach and checks all of the boxes in that department. The action scenes are tense and loads of fun to watch. The musical score this time around was done by James Horner who would later go on and work on Star Trek III and Aliens. Now, while I do enjoy the main theme by Jerry Goldsmith, I think the score here is really good too and especially in the action scenes. The ending is amazing and surprisingly back before this film released, the ending was known. But, I am not going to ruin this film's ending. All I can say is that this is where Shatner does amazing in the role. It is just something that just has to be seen. There is probably a lot more that I could talk about, but I think the main purposes of these reviews is to at least get the big picture and hopefully I have done so.Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a really fun film and a great sequel as well. I suppose one could skip The Motion Picture to watch this film and that is fine (even though I enjoy The Motion Picture). Is it the best Star Trek film? I think so and hopefully so do you.",

            "content": "The Wrath of Khan is a supremely entertaining chapter in the Star Trek saga, even if it goes so much at times into the realm of the \"ham-bone\" acting style that it reaches critical mass. And, oddly enough, it's not Shatner this time, but Ricardo Monteban, in his most revered (or at least most recognizable) performance as Khan, who steals the show. Monteban goes deep into making this such a shamelessly entertaining goof who is actually a terrifying presence of vengeance against the Enterprise. He's got that fake chest (yes, it's fake, and once you realize it the more it looks cheesy), the incredible mullet, and accentuation on almost every sentence combined with the pauses and facial gestures that tell all. Not only does Monteban make Khan one of the landmark Star Trek villains, but one of the most memorable villains in all of mainstream science-fiction. He's a great counter-balance to the rest of the characters, who are in the mode of basically making a very good episode of the show into a feature-length movie.This includes a) added drama involving Karen, the mother of Admiral Kirk's child, who also happens to be on-board, and who is responsible for the \"Genesis\" project, where b) a quasi lesson can be learned through the Genesis project about what the future could bring on other planets (and, besides, why can't a world be destroyed/created just like that?), and c) more added drama involving the \"departure\" of one of the key characters. This, of course, is no shock to those who've now seen what the franchise ended up, as part 3 spells it out all too clearly. But the fact that at the time in 1982 the Star Trek people went for an Empire Strikes Back move is ballsy and quite commendable (not least of which because it's a compelling twist). Overall, director Meyer, the cast, the special/visual effects team (the visuals still look amazing after all these years), and the writers have concocted a movie that provides for everyone- for die-hard fans it provides a comeuppance for a memorable past episode entitled \"Space Seed\", and for casual movie-goers it's a movie that skirts tongue-in-cheek with thrilling adventure in one swift stroke. A masterpiece? Probably not, but it would be hard for me to pass it up if I saw it on TV again.Speaking of which, I can't resist: KHAAAAAAAAAAAN!",

The story has two plot lines; the Genesis Project which involves technology to create an organic, livable planet out of a non-inhabitable one and a sequel to the TV series' Space Seed' episode which ended with Khan (Ricardo Motalban), a genetically perfect human being and villain being banished by Kirk to a miserable, deserted planet called Ceti Alpha V. Kirk's lady friend, Dr. Carol Marcus (Bebe Besch), and the mother of his son, Dr. David Marcus (Merritt Butrick), have created Genesis and are experimenting with it on a barren planet. Meanwhile Khan and his cohorts escape from their planet prison, with the forced help of Mr. Chekhov (Walter Koenig) and Captain Terrell (Paul Winfield), vowing to get revenge on Kirk. Chaos ensues as Khan runs into Kirk's lady and son. The effects are as always a treat, the action intense and a good time is had by all (viewers). Montalban and Shatner get to show the veins in their heads and necks in some anger scenes. Nimoy says goodbye; temporarily. And we can't wait for the next Star Trek installment.",

            "content": "\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" is the film the first one should have been. It's exciting, funny, smart and emotionally gripping. What a relief it was to see that Star Trek was able to pull itself out of the death grip of the original.William Shatner said that the first film became such a big hit because of the intense marketing. He is probably right because the first film is such a big bore that I can't believe non-Trekkies would even see it. However, \"Star Trek II\" is a film everyone can enjoy.Part of the reason for the film's success is that Gene Roddenberry did not control the production, like he did with the first one. Roddenberry was a brilliant TV producer, but when it came to films, he was over his head.\nBut then again, the producer of this film (and the next three), Harve Bennett, also had extensive TV experience. But in Bennett's favor, he entered Star Trek as an outsider and his point of view was a shot in the arm after the first film. Bennett's decision to hire Nick Meyer as writer and director was inspired. Meyer and Bennett remember what made the Star Trek TV series so good: the human relationships take top priority over the special effects. The film is a follow up to \"Space Seed\", one of the best episodes in the original series. That episode starred Ricardo Montalban as Khan, a man who tries to conquer space. Montalban returns in the movie and creates one of the most memorable villains in screen history. It is a great performance and he remembers the old line \"A film is only as good as its villain\". The original cast is back again and Shatner particularly stands out here. This is some of his best work ever and it shows the world that he is an excellent actor. Leonard Nimoy is also excellent as always in the Spock role, and this time, he manages to allow Spock's character to grow.\"Star Trek II\" is not overwhelmed by its special effects. Instead, Meyer allows the story to take its time. The pace is fairly fast, considering the agony of the first film. The result is a very special film that will live on for years. Next year will be the 20th anniversary and I predict it will last for 20 more years.**** out of 4 stars",

Where Star Trek: The Motion Picture (hereafter to be referred to as TMP) failed on so many levels, Wrath of Khan succeeds in every department.  Where TMP was a scenic post card of spectacular special effects, the effects in II are just a backdrop for a good old fashioned story.  Where TMP had no memorable dialogue, no interaction between the crew, II has all of that.  Where the villain in TMP was basically no more than space junk, in II we get a truly evil villain played wonderfully over the top by Ricardo Montalban.  As if that weren't enough, there is a really big surprise in the middle of all this, as we find out something about Kirk that we didn't know before.Thanks to a great script, the scenes between the crew, the dialogue seems real, as if these people really care about each other.  This helps greatly when there is no action on the scene, unlike TMP.  It is William Shatner who carries this film, and he is more than up to the task.  The final scenes show a range of emotions that I'm sure most people didn't think possible.I'm not a Trekky, and I'm not hung up on Star Trek.

            "content": "Following the rather dull \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\", Paramount Studios instituted a shakeup of the production staff, all but removing Gene Roddenberry from the picture, with Harve Bennett and Nicholas Meyer becoming the lead creative voices. They decided to create a film sequel to a worthy episode of the TV series, selecting season one's 'Space Seed' as the most worthy. One of the great advantages of that episode was it's chief villain, Khan, played by Ricardo Montalban (who, at that time, was starring in the TV series \"Fantasy Island\"). The TOS cast was assembled (although George Takei almost didn't participate, and Nimoy only did so on the condition that his character would die), and production began. The budget of TWOK was greatly reduced from that of TMP, but director Nicholas Meyer and the production designers made extensive reuse of old sets and FX shots, thus allowing the film to stretch beyond its means. In the 23rd Century, archvillain Khan escapes from the planet that Kirk had deposited him on decades before, and vows to wreak his Wrath upon the Captain (now Admiral). He also stumbles upon information regarding Project Genesis, a revolutionary scientific experiment with the potential for awesome destructive power. Admiral Kirk and his crew race to stop him; Kirk is particularly motivated by his desire to protect old flame Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch), and his son David (Merrit Buttrick). There is much more to say, but I will keep my comments brief. I don't think that TWOK is the best Trek film (First Contact gets that honour), but it comes damn close, and features perhaps Trek's finest villain in Khan. The death of Spock at the close of the film is somewhat lacking in emotional impact when his resurrection in Star Trek III is taken into account, but it is still a shining moment in the history of Star Trek.",

As somebody who's no Trekkie, I came to it fairly ambivalently; the first movie left me a little cold, and slightly bored, so I was hoping this one would be more eventful.Thankfully, it is. There's plenty more incident in THE WRATH OF KHAN, and lots of tricky situations for Kirk and co. to get to grips with. Sadly, once again there are younger, extraneous characters getting in the way (Kirstie Alley, I mean you) and the less important characters - Sulu, Scotty, Uhuru - get little to do other than respond to commands and press buttons, but it's all done in the right spirit and with good one.I like the way Kirk is depicted as an arrogant jerk in this film; Shatner's acting style fits this depiction like a glove. Nimoy gets some decent character work too, and Paul Winfield is always a welcome presence. Okay, so villain Ricardo Montalban looks like a reject from an '80s rock video, but we can't have everything.In essence, this is very much an episode of the original TV show expanded and bigged up to feature film format, but it does do what it sets out to do: provide sci-fi intrigue and adventure with a slightly more cerebral edge than the STAR WARS movies.",

            "review_title": "An excellent sci-fi / thriller which utilizes incredible special effects techniques that are on their way to becoming a lost art in our modern, computer driven world",
            "content": "This movie was an excellent masterpiece utilizing creative artistic talents which are rapidly becoming extinct in the emerging computer era. I found myself in awe when I watched the \"Starships\" fly around on screen and engage each other in heated combat. This is something which I do not feel when I look at computer generated effects of modern movies. When I observed the ships in this film, I actually felt like I was looking at what could have been a real ship in space; whereas when I observe more modern productions I think to myself \"yes, this is nice and although it looks pretty impressive, it just doesn't feel real to me.\" I think this because the ships in newer productions have that all too fluid and smooth movement which is indicative of computer generated models, so that artificial feeling is always there and pinging at me in the back of my mind. As such, it just doesn't convince me as a viewer that I am observing something that could actually exist; it feels like it is fabricated and fake to me. The ships in \"The wrath of Khan\" were actually huge models that were masterfully built and detailed by hand and then shot by a real life camera. Very little computer assistance was used in bringing them to life on the big screen. This is just something that is not done very often anymore and it is becoming a lost art. I think the older films, where this technique was implemented and perfected, were the better for it over their modern computer driven counterparts.The story in this movie was also well written. In particular I very much enjoyed the quoting of \"Moby Dick\" by Khan; both when he first sets out after Kirk and when he has lost the battle but still intends the win the war in the Nebula by destroying his ship with the super \"weapon\" the Genesis Torpedo. The character of Khan mirrored the very character he was quoting, Captain Ahab, in many ways; particularly in that his quest for vengeance against the white whale (Kirk) had totally consumed him.Furthermore, it can not be quarreled that Ricardo Montalban was a phenomenal actor, and he brought true passion and anger to his role as the revenge obsessed Khan Noonien Singh; a super-human genetically engineered to be superior to ordinary man in all ways possible. At least, this was how he perceived himself in his own mind.Throughout the movie, Khan was easily angered and provoked; particularly when Admiral Kirk insulted his \"superior\" intellect, injuring his enormous pride. This encounter, which he was so easily manipulated into, turned out to be fatal for the vengeful Khan and his crew. Also worth noting is that while the character has a warped sense of morality, he still yet had feelings for members of his crew. This was apparent when his helmsman was killed and he yet again vowed vengeance against Kirk. It seemed that the character's primary motivations were his intense desires and passions, thus making him a being in constant conflict with himself as his emotions overruled the better judgments of his vast intellect.This movie ended on a particularly sad note when one of the most beloved of the main characters (Spock) sacrificed himself for the good of all to save the \"Starship\" Enterprise and her crew from the final mad act of vengeance of the enraged Khan. While saddened by this, I greatly respected the lesson behind the ending of the movie in that putting the well being of others before your own is critical for the bettering (or in this case the survival) of all. To quote Spock \"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.\" That was one of my favorite movie quotes of all time.In conclusion, Star Trek II: The wrath of Khan was my favorite installment of this long running franchise. I loved the special effects, the acting was superb (particularly Ricardo Montalban's performance) and the story was enthralling and entertaining. If you are a fan of science fiction movies and thrillers, such as I, then this is a phenomenal movie for you. If nothing else, catch it on cable or satellite once and give it a go. Try watching the special effects and pay particular attention to how the space ships in this movie are portrayed. Compare the use of actual models to a newer movie or series that uses computer generated models and see which type is more convincing to you. Speaking for myself, there is no comparison. Real life models are by far and away my preferred method of creating convincing special effects. Perhaps one day computer technology will advance to the point where I will change my mind; but as of 2009 I feel the technique still has a long way to go before it can outperform movies such as this. A movie, I might add, which was made over two and a half decades ago at the time of writing this review.",

The death of Spock gave this one an emotional impact that had to have been experienced at that time, by lovers of the original series, to be fully appreciated. I wept. Really. It was, without a doubt, one of the most moving experiences I've ever had. Had the series ended then and there, all would've been as it should've been. But money talks, and logic walks. Though I've continued to patronize the STAR TREK films over the years, there was never again the emotionally satisfying feeling engendered by THE WRATH OF KHAN (not even close). STAR TREK-THE NEXT GENERATION, while it got off to a shaky start, ended up being a series worthy of the original (I never got on board for any of the other offshoots). Seeing the slovenly, stupid STAR TREK ZERO brought back memories of THE WRATH OF KHAN; movies in every way at opposite ends of the spectrum that nonetheless both suggest that the end is near (or should be). The series wasn't allowed to die a quiet, dignified death in 1982: instead, it's dying a sad, pointless, money-grubbing howling-monkey death in 2009.

            "content": "Star Trek The Motion Picture was admirable in many ways. It is still the only Star Trek movie that feels like an epic. It had an ending that really made you think, like the best episodes in the series. But it lacked the character moments that made the original series so endearing. Harve Bennett and Nick Meyer set out to fix that in Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan. Originally it was going to be called the Revenge or Vengeance of Khan, but since George Lucas was making \"Revenge of the Jedi\" Paramount changed the title. Meyer must have wanted to punch somebody when \"Revenge of the Jedi\" became \"Return of the Jedi!\" Wrath of Khan is one of only two Star Trek movies that has a direct connection to an episode. In the episode \"Space Seed,\" the genetically engineered Khan Noonien Singh was exiled to a planet called Seti Alpha Five, where he could start his own civilization with his followers. Little did Captain Kirk know that Seti Alpha Six would explode and shift the orbit of SA 5, leaving it a barren wasteland. Khan swears he will have his revenge on Kirk, but he would have to wait fifteen years.Pavel Chekov (now serving on U.S.S. Reliant) and Captain Terrell are scouting for \"dead\" planets for the Genesis project, an experimental process that can literally create life. The Federation apparently didn't notice that an entire planet was missing from the Seti Alpha system! They walk right into Khan's trap, and Khan uses mind control devices to keep Chekov and Terrell in line.Ricardo Montalban is one of the reasons (perhaps THE reason) Wrath of Khan is commonly called the best Star Trek movie. He gives one of the best villainous performances I have ever seen. He is the kind of character we love to hate. It's a shame this man did not have a more successful career, as he was truly a superb actor. It has been noted that Khan is a one-dimensional character, but what makes him more than that to me is the fact that for fifteen years this man has been thinking about one thing: killing James T. Kirk. Can you imagine what that would actually do to a man? A psychiatrist could make a career out of him!In the meantime, Captain Kirk has been promoted to Admiral, and he is starting to feel his age catching up to him. The Enterprise is used for training cadets under Admiral Kirk's supervision. One of the new hotshots is Lt. Saavik, Kirstie Alley's first film role. Dr. McCoy and Spock try to convince Kirk to get his command back, and the opportunity rises when Kirk receives a distress call from the Genesis space station where Dr. Carroll Marcus (his ex-flame) and their son are working. For Khan has stolen the Genesis project, and from there the fun really begins. The level of tension between Montalban and Shatner was enormous, which is amazing considering the two actors never met during filming. The two men tear each other's ships apart, and the whole film is mostly a one-on-one battle.Star Trek II is a winner for its humanity, but revenge is just one of its themes. Failure is an important element, as Kirk experiences failure for the first time in the death of Spock. It is one of the few scenes that makes me tear up repeatedly. Kirk is reunited with his son, although I must say this aspect of the film is overshadowed by Khan and Spock's stories. The Genesis project is an interesting idea and sparks debate about whether humanity should play God. This film also marked a change in the look of the series. Enterprise was given a more nautical look as opposed to the futuristic look in the previous film. The uniforms were updated for the better, so they no longer looked like pajamas. Adding to the experience is an overly bombastic and very fun score from James Horner. Wrath of Khan is one entertaining flick, and I would recommend it as a starting point for anyone unfamiliar with Star Trek.",

            "content": "Caution: DOES contain Spoilers.I have loved this film since I was 7 years old. It is famously the best Star Trek movie and arguably one of the best movies ever made. It's a classic story of vengeance and old enemies, told impeccably by Khan (Montalban) and his passionate hatred for Captain Kirk. Even non-trekkers will be pulled into Khan's very personal, candid quest for revenge, and touched by Spock's sacrifice. Most remarkable about this film is that Khan and Kirk never meet face to face - the meaning and motive here are strong enough to transcend their being in scenes together. The subplot of Kirk's midlife woes (Admiralty, farsightedness, estranged son, etc.) gets sidelined by Montalban's incredible performance: The only truly lovable and sympathetic Star Trek villain ever created. After seeing this so many times, I mourn Khan's death even more than Spock's. This is a worthy shrine to Montalban's talent and immortal sex appeal. Khan is villain personified: bad but charming, cruel but sexy, so very evil, but you secretly want him to win! Earnest motivations and a down-to-earth plot make Star Trek II the most \"human\" of all. It ties together and is laden with sentiment, sure to arouse every viewer's primal emotions. It has been parodied up and down from Seinfeld to Simpsons, but it's so powerful that none of the impact is lost. One for the ages.",

Also Great visual Effects, and a memorable returning Villian from the Original Series. This is the High point of Star Trek, and one story that you cannot skip watching.Takeaways:\n-For Newcomers who aren't familiar with Star Trek, this is the ultimate entry-point to the franchise, and you will definitley be a Star Trek fan after watching this movie.-The Kobiyashi Maru Training Simulation is one of my favorite scenes. Kirk-\"Spock, Aren't you supposed to be Dead?\"-Spock after he gives Kirk a copy of the Book the Tale of two cities: Happy Birthday Jim. It certainly is the best of times.-The New red Starfleet Uniforms Look Great and more Navy like compared to the original 60s Uniforms. These are off course called the \"80s Movie Uniforms\" and Nicholas Meyer wanted them to invoke the true meaning of \"Space Navy\" which is of course Starfleet.-Fun fact: William Shatner had reservations about playing Kirk as an aging depressed man in this film, because just like his character, Shatner had actually just turned 50 by the time they were filing this. Let's just say that the frustration helped Shatner in his performance.-The Now Admiral James Kirk is reluctant to take up his old command again when the situation demands him to do so. He believes that chasing stars is \"a game for the young\" however as Spock points out, \"Logic dictates that the needs of the many, outweigh The needs of the few. Or the one.\"-Ricardo Montleban is the show stealer in this movie as Genetically engineered Warlord, Khan Nooien Singh. TOS fans will recognize him from the episode \"Space Seed\" in which Kirk and the crew encounter khan and his friend's in an abandoned space shuttle, and freed them from their hypersleep. Khan was later stopped in his attempt to take the enterprise and was exiled by Kirk on Ceti Alpha V. In This Movie, Khan now has a deep hatred and desire to kill Kirk because circumstances on the planet led to the death of Khans Wife (Who also helped him take the enterprise) Khan commits to being Captain Ahab so he can hunt his White Whale which is Both Kirk and the Enterprise.-Khan:\"I shall leave you as you have left me...as you Left HER.... Marooned for all eternity, at the center of a dead planet-Buried aliiive.... Buried Aliiive....\nKirk:\"KHAAAAAAAANNN!!!\"-Kirstie Alley was great as Lt Savvik. She studies under her teacher, Captain Spock, and she may have a crush on Admiral Kirk. She is also Half-Vulcan and Half-Romulan (A fact about her, that was never mentioned in the movie, but is explored more in The Star Trek Novels. Even Kirstie Alley mentioned that Savvik is Half Romulan)-I think The Savvik character may have created to Replace Spock, as Leonard Nimoy wanted to leave Star Trek (At The Time)-Spock's Death: I absolutley HATED seeing this scene the very first time I saw it as a child, because Spock is my all time favorite Star Trek Character and hero. But this is truly a poignant, beautiful and saddening scene that leads to a somber yet beautiful ending, as Kirk watches a scene of birth, after witnessing death. (The Genesis Planet is formed at the end)Fun fact: Having grown tired of Star Trek and the role of Spock at the time, Leonard Nimoy wanted to exit Star Trek amid the talks of the original cast doing a sequel TV series.(which evolved into TNG) he agreed to film Star Trek II because after Mr. Nimoy read the script and learned of his character's death, he loved that Spock went out in a \"blaze of Glory\"Spock: \"I have been...And Always Shall be.... Your Friend. Live Long...and ProsperKirk: \"If Genesis is indeed life from Death, then I must return to this place again...\"",

He was almost like Jesus Christ reborn after being trained by Satan to create evil...and wreak havoc on the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise.The scenes from Regula 1 Space Lab and Seti Alpha 5 were shocking enough but 50 percent of the movie focuses on the Genesis project.The flesh-eating eels introduced by Khan is definitely reminiscent of some of the horror movies I had watched in the past...perhaps \"Gremlins\", to be specific.There were great special effects when the presentation of the Genesis project was delivered....all the way to the making a dead moon alive....so much alive that it seems like that dead moon would be like our Planet earth.Well, when the Genesis Device was beamed to Reliant by Khan and David and Kirk realized that they could not stop it, this was perhaps the turning point of the movie. Too bad that Carol, who engineered the Genesis Project, was going to be the temporary sore loser.Khan's final weapon when Reliant got hit by phaser fire and torpedoes from the Enterprise during the \"Mutara Nebula\" battle rendering Reliant totally unable to fire, was something that Kirk did not know and even Spock and Bones didn't know...but only David, who knew plenty about the Genesis project, knows. This was what I call the denouement of the movie: Khan activated a special self-destruct device inside the Reliant bridge that would destroy Reliant...killing himself but in return for the explosion of Reliant and the death of Khan....the Genesis planet would form and create. The special self-destruct device arms the Genesis device to set off a large explosion after T-minus 4 minutes....with a burst radius of about 8000-9000 square miles, to create what Carol explained in the Genesis device for Stage 3.....when Carol said that this stage would involve \"more of an interplanetary scale.\" And the result was big....the Genesis planet being almost the same like Planet Earth. But regrettably, in the sequel called Star Trek 3: The Search of Spock, this created planet ages rapidly....and just like life....dies in explosions of ashes and fire. Which is pretty sad.",

            "content": "After the special effects extravaganza that was \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\", Paramount decided to make a smaller, less costly sequel, and this definitely works to the film's advantage. Unlike the first film, this one is not about the special effects. There's no five minute scenes of cool looking model ships moving through layer of matte paintings, but instead is some wonderful character scenes, and an ending that is surprisingly emotional.The USS Enterprise has to rebound when formerly exiled villain Khan (Ricardo Montalban) attempts to get hold of a device that creates life, belonging to the Genesis Project. It's up to a depressed and aging Captain Kirk, and his crew to save the day.First and foremost, this is an entertaining film. It still has all the nerdy, faux-scientific Trekkie talk, but it also has an easy to follow plot, and a good amount of action. At the same time, the film is told on a relatively small scale, focused mainly on the USS Enterprise, and on Khan's ship, showing that the giant scale and huge models aren't needed to make a film entertaining. Here, more than anything else, it's the little character moments that makes this such a fun watch. The interplay between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy shows why Star Trek became a popular series to begin with. Get rid of the last twenty minutes or so, and this is still a good film. With the addition of Spock sacrificing himself to save everyone else, this becomes a near-great film. The ending is handled perfectly. William Shatner, who is known for hamming it up on screen, gives a subdued performance, and Spock's funeral scene is really quite beautiful. James Horner's score hits the right notes perfectly, and accentuates the bittersweet hopefulness that ends the film. \"Wrath of Khan\" is an improvement over the first film, mainly because of the character work. While the spectacle may not be as grandiose, the entertainment level is higher, and the end of the film is wonderfully realized and executed. Despite being a space adventure film, it's the human elements that make this movie what it is. My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 113 mins. PG for sci fi violence.",

            "content": "As a life-long Star Trek and general sci-fi fan I've seen many sci-fi movies. Typically, I favor the darker films, such as Blade Runner and Alien. But ST: The Wrath of Kahn has always held a special place in my movie rankings. To me, it is the best ST film (even now, after the fairly recent ST:TNG movies) and one that captures the essence of a franchise that holds up all that is good about humanity as a group and as individuals.Oh sure, there is overacting here. Wiliam Shatner and Ricardo Montalban engage in a \"can you top THIS?\" acting contest that is topped by Kirk's often imitated (in jest), \"KKKKKKKKHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNN!\" scream. If you want to enjoy ST you have to accept at least a little cheese.But there is no scene more touching in ST than the Spock/Kirk goodbye in the Enterprise's radiation-filled chamber (\"I have and always shall be, your friend\"). The same scene also expresses wisdom (\"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few ... or the one\"), which, BTW, is turned on its ear in ST:III as Kirk shows his deep love and respect for Spock (something else the series is about ... close, meaningful friendships).There are also few ST battle scenes more exciting than the deadly hide-and-seek game played by Kirk and Khan in the Motari Nebula (spelling). It is a submarine/destroyer clash played out in space. Also, the musical score for the entire movie is terrific, and stands on its own merits for listening apart from the movie.Downside? Well, Kirk's son and his goofy sweater-around-the-neck look is a bit odd. And the sound effects for the transporter, phasers and ship's weapons are really kind of grating (why did they abandon the smoother sounds from the original series?). And maybe Khan is a bit too hotheaded for someone who is supposed to be so smart (or maybe he is simply related to Bobby Knight ... rimshot).But those factors are easily overlooked in what is one grand space adventure. I bought ST:TWOK on DVD and the quality is much improved over VHS. I could make out detail (such as screen images on the Enterprise's bridge) that I never could before. Unfortunately, Paramount really added nothing in the way of extras and essentially blew a shot at having one of the all-time great DVDs (how could they not include an alternate commentary track, or deleted scenes, or anything ST related?).I admit I'm a bit biased, but I gave this film a 9 ... even 18 years after its first release.",

            "content": "After the box office receipts of Star Trek The Motion Picture, while very large, were below studio expectations, Star Trek II was all about the studio deciding to go in a direction that was about making a fan-based, TV series inspired sequel that was a lot cheaper to make - $13 million against the first film's $35-$40 million \u2013 and would have low enough overheads to at least get some profit. While at a commercial level it more than succeeded, and certainly is a classic among the fan base \u2013 it is a rather over-rated movie. It is a fun adventure \u2013 but is in my view not up with the best science fiction and in many ways is inferior to the first film, which was a great deal more thoughtful and daring. This film, while having some great moments, is without doubt something of a cop-out to conventional Hollywood summer entertainment. While the plot is actually fairly clever, it does gloss over a great deal of holes \u2013 while I won't go into them all by far and away the worst is the huge incompetence shown by the McCoy character's inability, with supposed 23rd century technology to do a basic medical on two previously kidnapped Starfleet officers \u2013 which would potentially have saved several people's lives, not to mention would have wrapped the story up much more quickly. It is the frequency of ignoring these quite key plot points that is the main failing of the film.Also, director Nicholas Meyer approach to shoot the film very quickly leads to a somewhat weird visual look. When not shooting scenes in semi-darkness as a fast way to create a 'look' the film looks rather sterile and TV like. The director massively overuses close ups and gives it a decidedly television rather than cinematic look (something the previous film excelled in). Some of the sets (clearly reused from the previous film) now look cheap, and the blocking of actors and the camera with some of Khan's scenes in the climax of the film look and feel like filming of a stage play rather than a film. Costume design does feel overtly theatrical in places, certainly compared with the functional attire from the first film. However despite the rather obvious flaws, the film succeeds on a number of other levels. The films editing is first rate. Relative unknown editor Bill Dornish (who would go onto work with Meyer on the excellent The Day After) edits the film will a real pace and style, which allows the film to zip along so quickly is that you tend to initially overlook most of the flaws. It is a bit of a surprise that Dornish did not edit more pictures as his work on this movie is great. The performances by the key players also succeed in involving the audience in the journey. In fact director Meyer seems a great deal more comfortable with directing performances than the technical aspects of film-making. Shatner, Nimoy and DeForest Kelley all give subtle, warm and genuinely human performances, and really convince you invest emotionally in this story \u2013 it is how these three characters relate to each other, and the journey each of them goes on in this film which is the movie's biggest success and is something that the first film, for understandable reasons, didn't go into at anything more than at a superficial, rather than a deep emotional level that is present in this outing. Ricardo Montalban has a great deal of fun and exudes huge charisma as the scenery chewing villain Khan, although I felt his psychotic need for revenge was slightly overdone. Other performances are solid, including good turns by both Bibi Besch and Paul Winfield in small supporting roles.George Lucas's and Peter Kuran's visual effects companies ILM and VCE offered very impressive new visual effect shots, which complement nicely the effective and clearly cost conscious re-cutting of visual effects footage from the first film. However, the biggest and most successful factor contributing to the film's success after the performances is the truly fabulous score by what was then a relative newcomer called James Horner. He really focused on telling the character's story with his music. The score is epic, fun and romantic and is a contrast for of the Avant-Garde style of Jerry Goldsmith of the first film. As a comparison, it is like comparing Stravinsky to Tchaikovsky. Both different but equally great.Overall and flawed adventure that is redeemed by winning performances from the key characters, and a truly terrific score.",

Basically Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) (apparently in the middle of a nervous breakdown) on the U.S.S. Enterprise is instructing new recruits, with Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy) acting as cadet training officer. While there are also mention of the Project Genesis experiment, which has something to do with long lasting life, Mr. Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Capt. Clark Terrell (The Terminator's Paul Winfield) has been sent to an inhabited planet where they discover the remains of crashed ship Ceti Alpha VI. The two of them are then captured by a group of villains, under the command of returning TV series character Khan Noonian Singh (Ricardo Montalban). He has returned, stolen the U.S.S. Reliant, and plans both to get his revenge on Kirk and steal the Genesis Device in a surprise attack. After numerous zaps of lasers, explosions on both spacecrafts, Khan is eventually defeated when he decides to try and explode the Reliant and get the Enterprise at the same time. But also, while getting away from the explosion, Spock is forced to sacrifice himself in a radiation chamber with the Genesis torpedo, and his body in a casket is blasted onto the planet Genesis.

The first film was really chatty and had almost no spectacle or action, and this sequel is a much better example of how a TV show can be turned into a great film. I may not have understood the full story, but for the great laser and spaceship battles, a good villain in Montalban, and some good moments with Nimoy, it is a likable science-fiction adventure. Star Trek was number 41 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Mr. Spock was number 23 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters. Good!",

Although the scenes of star war seems more magnificent than ours here, we can't expect more when we make it compete with one of the Top 10 movies in IMDb. The scenes of this film here are well connected with its plots. Not as tediously long as the debut of Star Trek series, not seem like as crude as which is without editing, and they accurately match the background musics, which make the whole movie more real seen.Furthermore, the story this time is more interesting and logical than the first one of this series. The villain is reasonable being, the story line is clear to follow and the conversation is much more meaningful. The most of the scenes are acted in the Enterprise and other two ships, but it doesn't make the film fail to attract audiences with the intense fights.Finally, the death of Spock really made me mist my eyes, the sacrifice is moving, it is overwhelming when the coffin was sent out to the space. However, the journey of Enterprise is not finished yet, we will look forward.",

            "content": "STII quite simply is the best Trek film out there. Going back to the original series episode 'Space Seed' it gives a whole new dimension to the franchise. Gone are the campy uniforms replaced with military style jackets while the characters undergo profound changes.The film was made on a fairly low budget (compared to the rest of the Trek films) and was clearly influenced by a Ridley Scott film made three years earlier (I'll give you three guesses...)which means that you get a darker film that concentrates on the characters, including the familiar and newcomers such as Merritt Butrick and Kirstie Alley as the galaxy's best looking Vulcan.Kirk is in the midst of mid life crisis when he is reunited with old flame Carol Marcus and his estranged son David (Buttrick), a storyline that would carry through the rest of the TOS films. Meanwhile Enterprise is now under the command of Spock as a training ship crewed mainly be cadets which means when the inevitable happens we actually feel for the red shirted guys and for once Kirk feels guilty about their deaths.However this is overshadowed by Ricardo Montalban's brilliantly over the top performance as Khan, prepared to sacrifice anything for his revenge. Definitely one of the most underrated film villains, Khan manages to destroy everything around him in his search for vengeance.STII works as well because it's a story that translates well out of the trek world. The problems that the characters face could still be faced in today's world while the final battle between Kirks USS Enterprise and Khan's USS Reliant is more akin to Master and Commander or Das Boot, the only difference being the use of starships and phasers. And if you can make it to the end credits without your lip quivering then you have the heart of a Borg",

Silly characters, bad acting and too much reliance on CGI action doesn't make up for poor script writing. For me, Star Treks II, III and IV comprise one of the best movie story-arcs in Sci-Fi. And Star Trek II: WRATH OF KHAN is the BEST chapter and best ST movie ever made. All the crew favorites were there - Kirk, Spock, Bones, Uhura, Scotty, Sulu and even Checkov - along with the best ST villain in Khan Noonien Singh, played with gusto by the late Ricardo Mantalban. The story is classic Star Trek, the pacing excellent and the space battles are epic. I have seen this movie many, many times since it was first made in the early 80's and it holds up with time. No CGI but the effects are good all the same. They made this movie back when blockbusters took time, effort and skill, not just lots of blinding CGI and \"winging it\" attitudes in acting. I encourage anyone who has never seen a Trek movie to pick ST II as your first venture into the Starfleet Universe. This is the quintessential Star Trek movie of all time. Still the best and still great to watch!",

What a heart wrenching ending which makes us think that Spock is truly dead, and gone from the Star Trek world(when we saw it for the first time if no one gave it away before hand), bringing tears to the eyes of many, only to slowly bring us back to the reality that Spock would most certainly be back , with what Mccoy said about returning to the planet of life someday and the way the movie came to an end.

            "content": "My review was written in May 1982 after a Times Square pre-release screening.Par's \"Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan\" is a very satisfying space adventure, closer in spirit and format to the popular tv series than to its big-budget (and not well-liked) \"Star Trek, the Motion Picture\" predecessor. Bound to captivate \"Trek\" fans and with premiere special effects to attract other space pic enthusiasts, the Robert Sallin production looks to draw strong summer patronage.Story is nominally a sequel to the tv episode \"Space Seed\", with Starship Reliant Captain Terrell (Paul Winfield) and Commander Chekov (Walter Koenig) incorrectly landing on planet Ceti Alpha 5 (instead of 6) on exploration mission. This allows the evil Khan (Ricardo Montalban) who was marooned there with his family and crew 15 years before by Kirk (William Shatner) to take over the Reliant and vow revenge on Kirk for the death of his wife.Admiral Kirk, now a desk jockey coaxed by his pals Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) and Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy) to take command once again of the Starship Enterprise on a training mission, travels to the Regula space station on a rescue mission. Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch) and her and Kirk's son David (Merritt Butrick) have been working there on the Genesis Project. To convert barren planets into Eden-like sources of life. Khan has stolen the Genesis Effect equipment and, besides luring Kirk into a trap, plans to use it against living planets, thereby destroying existing civilizations.Top-notch special effects on set and special visual effects mark the Reliant versus Enterprise space battles, with funny, in-character repartee by the Enterprise crew warming up the picture. Final reel is a classic of emotional manipulation: Spock unhesitantly calculates that he must sacrifice himself to save the Enterprise crew, just four minutes away from destruction by Khan's Genesis device. With themes of rebirth and growth strongly presented, Kirk is reconciled with his estranged son and faces up to the death of his friend Spock, while the viewer is left in the denouement (reminiscent of \"2001\"'s Starchild finale) assured that Spock will return in a new form. Open ending, with a spectacular wide-angle pan depth-effect view of space, should leave the fans panting for the next \"Trek\" feature.Director Nicholas Meyer and scripter Jack Sowards (plus exec producer/story writer Harve Bennett) have opted for a more intimate approach than the first film and it works. With Industrial Light & Magic handling the necessary scope via visual effects and animation, live-action scenes stress a small cast and sets which don't dwarf the players. Functional shots, e.g., Enterprise leaving dry dock, use stock footage from first pic.This allows cast to shine, particularly William Sha tner as the smug and ingenious Kirk, ultimately growing in character by film's end. Leonard Nimoy as Spock is properly heroic, DeForest Kelley provides comic relief in his running battles with Kirk and Spock, and Ricardo Montalban is in fine form as a malevolent Capt. Ahab-styled villain bent on revenge.In support, Walter Koenig has the largest role among the tv regulars, heroically resisting, along with guest star Paul Winfield, Khan's mind control via an unpleasant parasite that burrows (fine makeup effects) into his head. Newcomer Merritt Butrick makes a strong impression as Kirk's uppity son, and Kirstie Alley is solid as the new Vulcan science officer.ILM's effects, under Ken Ralston and Jim Veilleux, are terrific, particularly an animated mid-film demonstration of the Genesis Effect transforming a planet's surface. With James Horner delivering a supportive musical score, other tech credits are fine. Whole package emerges as unpretentious entertainment, with the lack of bombast (plus exploitable finale) a plus in weathering the formidable summer film competition.",

There is a very slight life sign reading so Chekov and the ship's captain, Terrell, beam down; they find a desolate planet but they aren't alone. This is the planet to which Kirk exiled Khan and his band of genetically engineered super-human psychopaths fifteen years previously. Khan captures the two men and forces them to tell him what they are doing there. Once he learns he is determined to get his hands on the Genesis Device but first he must kill his old enemy Kirk!He successfully lures Kirk and the Enterprise to the area but the confrontation leaves both ships heavily damaged. While the Enterprise is repaired Kirk, McCoy and trainee officer Saavik beam over to the space station from where the Genesis Project was being run; here they find Chekov and Terrell as well as most of the station's crew; the latter having been killed by Khan in an attempt to get the device. Kirk and his team beam to a cavern deep in the nearby planet and find the device along with the project leader, an old girlfriend of Kirk, and her son David who is also Kirk's son! Khan still has control of Chekov and Terrell and uses them to get the device. Kirk must stop him before it can be used on an inhabited world. There will be one final confrontation between the two men but the costs will be high for Kirk and his crew.This is one of the best Star Trek films; it is certainly better than the somewhat turgid opening film. The story is both interesting and exciting and Ricardo Montalban is great as the villainous Khan. I really liked the fact that the story linked back to events seen in the TV series in a way that is a bonus for people who saw Khan's introduction but is still enjoyably for people who haven't seen the episode. The introduction of the fact that Kirk has a son is somewhat forced and he isn't the best of characters but he isn't too annoying either. Kirsty Alley makes a welcome addition to the crew as Saavik and unsurprisingly the regular cast are pretty good in their established roles; this is particularly true of Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner as Spock and Kirk in the films emotional final scenes. Overall I'd say this is a must see for fans of the original 'Star Trek' series although it can be enjoyed by anybody wanting sci-fi action.",

From the fabulous score by James horner, to the tense ship battles, great character arcs (especially kirks) great visuals for 1982, including the first ever CGI scene this film delivers in spades.I would also say that this is a career best performance by Shatner too - was he ever better as Kirk than how he is in this? I don't think so. His performance is OTT when it needs to be (Khaaaaaaaaaan!) and nuanced at other times, reflecting on life and death, it's really Shatners film and he shines here. Ricardo montalban is the other side of the coin to kirk and his performance is so gloriously over the top you just have to roll with it, he still brings considerable menace to the role and there's some quite horrible moments in this for a trek film - but the film is all the better for this as it gives it a slight adult edge.The ending is just amazing and I defy anyone not to shed a tear.

The director did an awful job on controlling Shatner's ego by letting that comment \"I don't think these kids can steer\", make it to the screen.  Even in today's armed forces, no good leader would ever utter an expression like that. The film didn't appeal to any mature leader. Every mature leader of today knows that an adversary with a personal vendetta to launch, can cause excess casualties.  Would you serve on the Enterprise if your captain had enemies all over space or the open seas, waiting to get him? Come on.... No wonder Spock eventually leaves Star Fleet.  The plot was very good, but poorly written.  Kirk's character was filled with weakness that made him unsuitable for command. The final death scene with Spock was very dramatic and moving.  McCoy and Scotty's roles were underutilized.  Lt. Saavik (Kirstie Alley) was youthful, but weak, and also underutilized. Dr. Carol Markus (Bibi Besch) injected some of the most positive character in the film, and nearly stole the lead.  Much more could have been done with her to help the plot, if Shatner didn't have so much weakness to keep in check.  Looking back on the whole movie shows where Star Trek has grown from.  The New Generation rectified much of the flaws left from the Original Series.  The Wrath of Kahn was among the Original Series worst dramas.

            "content": "Maybe I'm just crazy but I wasn't all that taken by this much loved Star Trek movie. And yes, I'm perfectly capable of liking other Star Trek movies and series! The main criticism for the first Star Trek movie, which was also this movie its predecessor, was that it was mostly a boring one. Well, I can't really say that this movie is much of an improvement. Boring is perhaps a harsh word but it's definitely a movie with slower moments in it and not all that much action or other excitement.Besides, the story is being a bit too simplistic and straightforward, though it still tries hard to be clever about it all. It also lacked some good depth, which prevented me from feeling involved with this movie or with any of its characters. The emotional scenes therefore also fell quite flat for me.It also aways confuses me as to why the Star Trek movies keep on introducing new characters in them, while the movies already had plenty of returning characters in them. This movie also introduces some new characters, that in the long run add very little to this actual movie. And Khan...well, I guess he's a good enough villain but I did wish the actor Ricardo Montalban who played him wouldn't had gone so over-the-top with it. His overacting is worse than Shatner's, at times.There is still no need and reason to completely bash this movie into the ground though. I do admit that for its time this was simply being a good, high quality, science-fiction adventure movie. The genre at time still wasn't one that was being taken all that seriously and of course the technology was also still somewhat lacking to create a good and convincing science-fiction movie with. This movie however is being quite good and convincing to watch and everyone involved took their jobs seriously, so the movie actually does work out well within the realms of its genre.Good for what it is but hardly the best Star Trek movie I have ever seen.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

They fell victim to some bad writing and to the cheesiness of the 60's and quite get their full stories told. See 60's lacked that ongoing story arcs that we've come to be fond of, which made it slightly weak. This time we get to hear about Kirk and Spock's characters and how they actually relate to each other. The character Khan is a very sophisticated one. Kirk marooned him on a desolate planet a good fifteen years ago and now, after years of being stuck with nothing but classic literature, he gives his damn best to defeat Kirk's over the top acting.Now, with a machine that can create planets, we actually get a film that deals with the morals of a story.

In STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, Ricardo Montalban (as Khan Noonien Singh) joins the regular cast of three actors (Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley) and four extras posing as actors (Doohan, Takei, Koenig, Nichols) in the feature film sequel to their TREK television episode of 1967, \"Space Seed.\" In that episode, Kirk stranded Khan on some distant planet, which requires hefty exposition by Khan when Chekov accidentally discovers him and his Chippendale minions on said planet.Khan was so mad after that clunky exposition, he shoved monster puppet earwigs into Chekov's ears. Paul Winfield, as Starfleet Captain Terrell also gets the earwigs, and a dose of rare Action Figure for standing so close to Chekov. The earwigs turn Chekov and Terrell into Manchurian Candidates, for when they meet Kirk later...Khan steals the Genesis Device, a terraforming instrument that Kirk's son and ex-lover have created, and which for some reason, Khan believes will provide him with some kind of ultimate power - other than making a planet habitable...Directed and co-written by Nicholas Meyer, WRATH is 100-percent better than its predecessor; a real movie, not an experiment in making a TV show look like a feature film.Of course, Spock dies. Wha--? After a studio leak over that plot point caused untold fan uproar, Nick Meyer and his co-writers, Harve Bennett, Jack Sowards, Samuel Peeples and (nominally) Gene Roddenberry, decided to kill off the whole crew in a simulated opening sequence called Kobayashi Maru (proving that even in the 23rd century, there IS no Keyser Soze).Kirstie Alley joins the Enterprise crew as Vulcan Saavik (during that period in Earth's history when she was skinny and hot); Spock has been promoted to Captain, and Captain Kirk is still kicked upstairs as Admiral. Titles matter not in Starfleet, it seems, as any time the original 1966 Enterprise crew want to fly off together - they just do.This time, in pursuit of Khan to retrieve the Genesis Device, which can terraform in minutes rather than millennia. There is an interesting moment as Bones argues with Spock against the Device, \"according to myth, the Earth was created in six days...\" For those christians who refuse to hear it, he actually said \"myth\" in reference to the bible. There's hope for humanity yet.Kirk meets his fey son, David (Merritt Butrick), swishing about the science space station like Peter Frampton, with his mother who looks like Dee Wallace (Bibi Besch), one of Kirk's old flames, now on slow boiler. Uncomfortable family issues ensue...Khan is genetically engineered to be homo superior - but somehow I don't think he'd mind too much if we dropped the \"superior\" suffix, what with his contingent of body-oiled, feather-haired extras who look like refugees from a Pat Benatar video, his gloriously shaved chest-prosthetic (which everyone claims is real - from Meyer to Shatner to Paramount), and his gorgonzola cheese theatrical flourishes.Adding to his ambiguously-hetero mien, he insists on quoting Melville and other classics as if he's wearing an ascot and not a prosthetic chest (which I'll believe is real once I've wrapped my teeth around those nipples). Refusing to be outdone chewing scenery by someone with such a thick Fantasy Island accent, Shatner sets some kind of Richter Scale record for melodrama so funny we can't even laugh at it, with his monumental, head-shakingly furious, \"Khaaaan!\" Khan and Kirk have their final battle royale in a starship dogfight to end all plastic toy starship dogfights - in a fish tank injected with dye-in-water effects posing as a nebula.Like all great villains, Khan believes any day is A Good Day to Die, and goes out with a bang by exploding the Genesis Device on his ship while quoting Melville, but I wonder: how did his ship become a planet when it blew up? But then comes the Death in the Family, super contrived as it may be: Trying to outrace the Genesis blast, the ever-inefficient Scotty can't provide enough power to the Enterprise, so Spock dives into the Reactor Room to Do Something with the Glowing Something which will Fix Something and allow them to Escape The Blast. The McGuffin successful, now Spock can do his Tragic Acting with KFC skin taped to his face to signify Something Fatal and die face to face with his best buds unable to touch him through the perspex, eliciting reciprocal Tragic Acting from Kirk, who doesn't have to be asked twice.It's what Shakespeareans and Kurosawans would call A Good Death, a Warrior's Death, and brings a tear to the third eye, as Spock immortalizes the concept, \"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Or the one.\" During the funeral, as Scotty plays Amazing Grace on the bagpipes and they shoot Spock's casket at the Genesis Planet, Kirk attains Untold Heights of Melodramatic Overacting, \"Of my friend, I can only say this: of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most... human.\" And thus the fanboys were left, all those years ago, pondering at the last shot of the photon torpedo encasing Mr. Spock, having landed amongst the primordial Genesis greenery (without any signs of a landing approach tract, just looking like it was dumped amidst the ferns, which it was, by the \"science-minded\" producers), few realizing that Nimoy himself was instrumental in the decision to kill off Spock due to irreconcilable differences between TREK creator Roddenberry, himself and the studio.He wanted to be free of the green-blooded ties that bound him to that character. He did, after all, pen that 1975 book, I Am Not Spock.How wrong he was...--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",

What the producers remembered here was that it was the great stories that got us watching the original series in the first place and not the characters, although we later got to know and love them. The first was more or less a love-fest as we were expected to just be happy they were all still alive on board the Enterprise after all these years.The threat here is Riccardo Montalban's Khan on the revenge trail after Kirk marooned him on a planet in the original series. Montalban gives a suitably over-the-top pantomime villain of a performance and as you could have predicted comes this-close to achieving his aim before an unexpected act of heroism and sacrifice saves the day, but at a heavy cost.One of the problems for me with the Star Trek movies is an unwillingness to fully embrace the familiar objects from the original, so that gone are the iconic costumery, bridge lay-out and even shape of the Enterprise herself. Everyone goes on about how great it is to be back on board the old ship when it looks nothing like it. they even take the famous \"Space-the final frontier\" prologue and make it an epilogue.Still the old familiar characters certainly are there, particularly the triple axis of blustery Captain Kirk, crusty Doctor McCoy and ice-cool Mr Spock. The rest of the old gang are fairly peripheral while a very young and slim Kirstie Allie gets a prominent part for no apparent reason. On the whole, a watchable, half-decent yarn to further re-introduce the characters to a new audience, it was a big commercial hit and engendered a slew of sequels of varying quality.",

            "content": "After being exiled on a distant planet for 200 years and after capturing a couple of star fleet crew members Khan and his loyal group of survivors begin to plot their revenge against Admiral Kirk whom Khan blames for him and his crew being exiled and forgotten. Khan's plans are two-fold; destroying Kirk and getting his hands on a life-generating device known as Genesis.I'm currently working my way through the Star Trek franchise and The Wrath Of Khan seems to be the film that everyone talks about as being a brilliant film and is often touted as being 'the one to watch.' I can certainly see why many folks enjoyed it, but I wasn't quite blown away to the same extent truth be told...Let's begin with the good things about this film; it is much better paced than The Motion Picture (or should it be called The Motionless Picture), the film has a proper antagonist this time as Khan Ricardo Montalban is certainly one of the highlights of the film even if at times he overplays things and comes across as just a little bit too crazy. The main cast also seemed to have upped their game from the first film and their engagement with each other feels more natural this time around; some of the scenes between Bones and Spock were amusing as their vastly different personalities cause friction on a few occasions.I think the main selling point with this film really lies with Kirk and Khan; in the second half of the picture a tactical battle of wits between the pair begins to ensue often with amusing results. This creates some tension and at least keeps the picture involving; there are incidents and things happening in this film which was not the case in The Motion(less) picture.Director Nicholas Meyer does a far better job here than Robert Wise did in the previous film; there's more action, an actual antagonist, he gets more out of the crew and throws in one scene that some may find hard to watch (such as bugs crawling into a couple of crew members ears). He's perhaps guilty of over-staging some scenes like Wise did, but at least he provided us with some spectacle to go with it.Perhaps the only blot on this film lies with what happened to Khan; he's developed a little superficially and it perhaps would have been nice to get more of an insight into how him and his crew managed to survive for all those years - it might have gave me more of an understanding of their suffering.All in all though this is a huge improvement on The Motion(less) picture and perhaps with a tad more development it could have been a brilliant film. If you haven't watched any of the Star Trek films skip the first one and watch this far better offering instead.",

Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n is brilliant and I loved how his character quotes Moby-Dick in his all-consuming desire for revenge. \"From hell's heart, I stab at thee. For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee,\" he growls. The sacrifice scene is very touching and absolutely perfect too, probably my all-time favorite Star Trek moment. There are a few minor bits that could have been dropped (like William Shatner breaking out the reading glasses now and then), but director Nicholas Meyer generally pulls all the right strings in giving us a movie with lots of big moments, action, and the feel of the TV series. There are bits of humor, cheesiness, and grand music to go along with it, the pacing is quite good, and it all works. Very entertaining, and easily my favorite Star Trek film. You definitely don't need to be a Trekkie to enjoy it either.Another great quote from Khan:\n\"Ah, Kirk, my old friend. Do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold? ... It is very cold in space.\"",

The other user comments here focus mainly on the action-oriented aspects of the movie, but to me, as to the Smithsonian Institution, Harlan Ellison, and posterity, Star Trek was interesting ultimately because it was about people and ideas more than it was about phasers, cute female yeomen in miniskirts and the alien of the week.In this film, we're presented with several ideas:  the needs of one person vs many, tests of moral strength in the face of failure and death, the contrasts of age and youth, the motivation of revenge and the stumbling-block of hubris.  It's a lively action picture, to be sure, but there's some tremendous acting and storytelling going on here too.I recommend you see this film twice:  First, enjoy a well-paced action movie, then observe a thoughtfully written, directed and acted story about people.  That's why, of all the Star Trek movies to date, this one remains my favorite.",

Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is better than the first film in almost every aspect. I took issue with the pacing, overuse of special effects, length, and the lack of a present villain in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. This film wipes away silly and unnecessary special effects and gives us an intriguing story with characters who we understand and care about. It's also a solid 30 minutes shorter without cutting out anything that would hurt the story. I was thoroughly impressed by this sequel even 30 years after its release.We open the film as the enterprise seemingly has a new captain in Kirstie Alley's Saavik, only to find out its a training exercise put together by Spock and Admiral Kirk. I was worried they may rehash the same story line as the first film as Kirk seemed to hint that he may be done with the Enterprise, only to run into an old foe in Khan. Even though I have seen bits and pieces of the original series and had been somewhat familiar with Khan as a villain, I didn't know to the extent to which him and Kirk were linked. I was glad to see viewing of his appearance in the TV series wasn't entirely necessary as they explained enough in the 103 minute run- time.Khan has become somewhat of a pop culture icon over the years, so I had my fair share of expectations going in. Ricardo Montalban's performance and the writing didn't let me down. So much so that you understand where Khan is coming from when he wants Project Genesis from the crew and wants revenge for what Kirk did. In many ways, he was Kirk's arch nemesis and proved to come through with a lot of what he swore to do to Kirk. My only gripe with him as a villain was that I feel like we were missing an in person interaction with Kirk himself. Speaking through a video screen inside the Enterprise isn't enough, you need that human interaction.With that said, The Wrath of Khan has the emotional layers and character depths that the first film was lacking. All of the original dynamics of the ship are there, plus some new and enjoyable ones as well. Plus, it doesn't take 45 minutes for things to get going, the pacing is much improved. James Horner's haunting score also sets the tone immediately from the opening scene, all the way through the bittersweet ending. Overall, everything feels bigger and better with The Wrath of Khan. Having seen the new Trek films, I think this can rank up there with them as some of the best outings the Enterprise crew has ever had.+Fantastic score+Emotionally layered+Special effects & pacing much improved+Very good villain-Although Khan was missing the human interaction with Kirk8.3/10",

            "content": "Khan Noonien Singh swears revenge against Admiral James T. Kirk.This is classic Star Trek.The writers set the scene very well by establishing a strong arc for Kirk and the supporting characters. The concept of the Kobiyashi Maru is key to this and, along with Khan's obsessive Ahab tribute, it drives the plot brilliantly. Humour is also important as it makes a relatively slow build up to the main adventure very enjoyable.There is an outstanding reintroduction to Khan. It is not just well written, with great sci-fi detail, but Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n is absolutely magnetic, as he was in 'Space Seed'.It all builds towards an iconic ending that has one of the great character scenes of the franchise. There are many reasons the central trinity of Kirk, Spock and Bones is so timeless and this is one of their best dramatic moments. The very last image of the movie and it's sequels could be viewed as the franchise having it's cake and eating it with regards to one character, but as it's one so beloved, it's hard to make a complaint.There are one or two sequences that could be argued are slightly too sentimental, plus the odd fake looking fight and practical effect.William Shatner strays marginally over the top in minor moments, but generally leads it with a strong, likeable performance and has great support from Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koenig, and Paul Winfield.The visuals are mostly excellent, with a great mixture of classic Trek imagery like space stations, starship battles, inhospitable planets, and iconic creature design. One spectacular moment involves the enterprise in Spacedock that is notably quicker than its counterpart in 'The Motion Picture', but equally as effective.For me it's a 9.5/10, but I round upwards.",

Not having watched the original series, I wasn't able to immediately understand the movie which, experts say, consists of the continuation of one of the episodes. But the film itself gives us the tools to catch everything quickly. And we must now say an obvious truth: after the failure of the first film it was difficult to do worse, and this film benefited greatly from the lessons learned with the mistakes of the first one. The script is frankly good, based on a revenge story between Kirk and Khan, and it has no dead moments nor creeps like the first movie. The main actors (William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley) shone, in particular Shatner and Nimoy, without however being able to overshadow the talent of Ricardo Montalban, who managed to make his villain into a perfect image of rancor. As for the sets and costumes, there are also improvements: the hospital environment of the first film gave way to a setting where color is most evident and the Enterprise's crew red uniforms are truly elegant. The only less positive note is the costumes of Khan and his comrades of misfortune, who seem to have come out of \"Conan the Barbarian\" or something like that, but this is something that has no great relevance.

Considering that \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" arguably the best installment in the Star Wars legacy, was released two years earlier, it's perhaps a strange coincidence that the best installment of the Star Trek legacy was also the second in the series.This film was a large breath of fresh air for the series after the bizarre first film.  This movie delivers an emotional punch that I believe might have been matched, but has never been surpassed, by the subsequent sequels in the series.  The anger and hatred between Kirk and Khan is truly haunting.  The way both sides were never willing to surrender or run away was completely different from the two Star Wars episodes at the time, in which the Alliance was always hiding and running away from the Empire.Acting was fairly convincing by most of the cast.  I was particularly drawn to Montalban, who of course plays Khan.  His intensity reached a level of conviction that no other villain in the series has been able to match since. His obsession with the destruction of now Admiral Kirk resulted in the film's now ground-breaking, now legendary, use of close-up minature action photography, which although outdated today, I found amazing that they could pull it off twenty years ago, when movies were using rubber Halloween costumes for their enemy characters.This film is an enduring benchmark for futuristic space action/adventures, and it still holds its ground against today's space films.  I find the story of the movie still intriguing and entertaining after many years away from viewing it.  In \"Alien,\" the film relies on suspense to enhance coherence and drive the movie on.  This Star Trek film is completely entertaining, and the action just makes it all the more fun to watch.The only criticism of the special edition DVD is its lack of a DTS audio track.  Action scenes, while fairly clear, lack the crispness that would be best desired to convey the intensity of the action.  For those who say that the film's audio track is too old to properly convert to a DTS track, remember that \"Jaws\" was released in 1975, seven years earlier, and its been given a DTS track.",

Not a bad joke and not a bad way to sum-up part of this second Trek's enduring appeal. This is one of the all time sci-fi greats. As a Trek movie it was the one that ensured the series had a future after the slow and ponderous original, introducing the wit and well drawn character dynamics of the original series.That it balances action, good humour and tragedy so well is due in no small measure to Nicolas Meyer and Harve Bennett who along with writer Jack B.Sowards produced a fable that ties the characters personal journeys into wider themes of life and death. Its clever to, 'killing' off Spock in the terrific 'Kobashi Maru' opener, that fooled audiences at the time into thinking that rumours of the character's death had been exaggerated. When it subsequently occurs at the films climax its an absolute sucker punch as a result and manages to be both touching and memorable. If there is a better death scene in any film i've yet to see it.You could dish out praise all over the place but if you had to be ruthless you'd want to single out James Horner for an excellent score, in the days before he was over-egging the cake in fare like Titanic, the cast who deliver uniformly excellent performances, especially Montablan who eats up the screen like an Atkins dieter at a steakhouse, Sowards for a great script which manages to introduce a few interesting new characters who by the end feel like they've been there all the time and the Genesis plot which is both the films thematic double and the founding metaphor for the subsequent trilogy and finally Meyer, who turns in a pacey, well balanced film that manages to make most other entries in the series so ordinary.It may not be perfect, after all Chekov knowing Khan is a continuity error and its a shame that the budget necessitated the reuse of footage from the first film, but this provides the much needed link to the TV Series as well as cementing its cinematic credentials. Unfortunate then, that the Next Generation would undo all the good work with 4 lame instalments, kinda like tearing down Buckingham Palace and building a council estate on the foundations. If only there was a spare Genesis Torpedo they could fire at this series now to bring it back to life- still we'll always have Khan, or should I say Khhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.",

After being pleasantly surprised by the first instalment, I was looking forward to the second offering, in part as I had heard that this was in fact the best of the bunch. However, I find that this film offers much of the same as the first, not really surpassing in any way. The action is muted, the acting is unappealing, but the idea is interesting. This was the difference between the two warring space franchises; the Star Wars saga is fast and fantastical; Star Trek tends to be slower, but has it's narrative ideas firmly placed within science.Star Trek II begins with Kirk (William Shatner) believing he is too old to command a ship (I feel the retirement element of the original cast will be a theme for the rest of their movie outings), but is taken on a mission due to him already being on an inspection of the Starship Enterprise. A project called Genesis is being undertaken, but after surveying planets, Mr Chekov (Walter Koeing) and Captain Terrel (Paul Winfield), are infected with a parasite that controls their minds, by Khan (Ricardo Montalban), who had been abandoned on the desolate planet 15 years previously by Captian Kirk. Khan wants revenge.The interesting science behind the movie is its theme of evolution. The Genesis project will be able to create life on uninhabitable rocks. This accelerates the evolutionary process and creates life in hours. Yet again, Star Trek offers an interesting idea. Perhaps because my expectations were a little higher for this \"best offering\", but I found it to be flawed but a little bit of subdued fun. The film also offers some very decent model work and special effects (including one of the first computer generated images (CGI).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "The second Star Trek motion picture opts for more visual spectacle; action and conflict than the initial film from 1979 does. Most of the conflict and antagonism was rooted from within the Enterprise itself for a lot of Robert Wise's initial adaptation; arriving in the shape of uneasy comings together for an array of multicultural and ethical characters pulling through to save the planet, nicely masking and doubling-up as at once many-an actor's own off screen issues with partaking in said project as well as the necessary unease at venturing out into cinematic territory for the first time. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is more interested in other things, namely a stone wall antagonist in the form of the titular Khan meaning action, reaction and conflict on a broader but less complicated scale is the order of the day. The sequel appears to be the more successful of the two films; no surprise, given that by the time it had been made big-budgeted American cinema had somewhat undergone a process of juvenalisation by way of numerous George Lucas and Steven Spielberg projects - audiences falling in accordingly with regards to their relationship towards the two Star Trek films. While it works to a degree, the feeling of the film being reactionary to both that of the first and to that of American films as pieces of 'entertainment' as a whole, is unshakable.William Shatner returns to the role of James Kirk, and following years of weaving in and out of deep space; fighting monsters; touching down on planets and partaking in space combat \u2013 he's beginning to feel his age. When the famous Mr. Spock beamed aboard The Enterprise early on into the first film, reading into Kirk's reaction as one representative of a wider context of not just the character's there in the scene, but Shatner's as well as the watching audience's as a whole, ought not be scoffed at. Furthermore, the interior clashing with the ship's doctor (DeForest Kelley's \"Bones\" McCoy) was perhaps representative of the larger extent of disagreements and clashing going on within the project as the Star Trek \"name\" was taken down different routes to what is more commonly known. Here, the self-referential content is evident in Kirk feeling his age in that he's old and experienced enough to monitor training programmes; feel nondescript about birthdays and make a clear distinction between what consists of a \"young\" and \"old\" crew, something that more broadly speaking is representative of Shatner's own experiencing of the entire Star Trek franchise. In doing the television show as well as the first film a few years ago, with all the baggage both before and after that came with Wise's 1979 effort, we've now made it here to the second entry and it seems he's beginning to feel his age too.The film sees Kirk and his crew of the usual suspects do battle against Ricardo Montalban's Khan, and his own crew, whose rough attire and generally unshaven appearance mimic that of their leader; Kirk's smart and much more formal crew thus representative of those of a far more civilised disposition. Khan's titular wrath is one he's been saving for Kirk and The Enterprise and stems from an old back-story involving deception and conflict which ended in the leaving of him for dead on a barren planet of high winds and expansive desert; a locale which has since killed his wife and many of his friends. An interesting political allegory linked to more recent times, namely The Middle East, arrives in the form of Khan; his character, upon the first encounter, quite literally unveils himself by way of peeling back some facial garments which is highly representative of an Islamic sort. His presence in a cinematic space resembling a desert that he inhabits with a large group of guerrilla followers are further items, the being 'left short' by Starfleet and its imperialistic nature even more-so; whereas even his name, Khan, appears to have roots of an Islamic nature further-still based around said area on Earth.The content follows when it transpires Khan wouldn't mind it at all if he got his hands on a piece of equipment called Genesis, eventually rendered somewhat of a MacGuffin, which an isolated space station named Regula I is developing; an operation headed up by one of Kirk's former flames in a certain Carol Marcus (Besch). The item is essentially a WMD, something that is able to wipe out all prior existence on a planet so as to re-tune them to the beholder's new order; in Regular I's case: empty, dead planets into plush Edens so that life can flourish - in the hands of Khan, most probably the other way around. The hopping about and gamesmanship by the time Khan is up and airborne is pretty good fun, the film keeping a reign on all the darting around and moulding in the expansion of its characters quite well in that when certain people are in peril or facing death, we care and we're sufficiently enough involved.The Wrath of Khan is most certainly geared more towards action and spectacle as major points of interest rather than ideas and reasoning acting as such; this edition seeing its characters settle things with violence and conflict at the demands of a vengeful character rather than suspicious objects which require inspection and deliberation. It isn't a bad film, just a romping space adventure which doesn't outstay its welcome and does what it needs to do; effectively changing gears when certain dramatic events take centre stage. A digital readout sequence towards the end is a little confusing, in that why it isn't set for the amount of time in seconds it takes to say \"From Hell's heart, I stab at thee...\", I'll never know. Regardless, by the end we've come away feeling fairly nourished; enjoyed the film and if you're as new to Star Trek as I am, pondered where the series might venture next.",

A lot of this changes come notably from the director (as heard on his commentary) and if i don't always agree with him, i like his humor.Thus, it's not really science fiction but rather a thriller in space that have roots in the submarine fights, very similar thus of his repeat in ST6.But Trek offers much than a war movie: First, it is touched by beautiful poetry: the nebula colors are a great idea to change from the deep space black and the score of Horner is one of his best. As he explains, it's \"easy\": just find a handful of memorable cues and mix them all along.Then, I really appreciate the art direction also when you feel the flavor of the 70s in the sets, the clothes.At last, they are still my friends to rejoice: this time, they are paired with another sweet new female character Saavik that Alley portrays willfully. For the bad mouths, it was a dirty trick to depict the future romance of the never convincing Kirk's son with Spock's daughter! Spock death's was a moving moment, more painfully reinforced by the glass separation. As the grief comes, we want to hug our dearest ones (as later Kirk does with his son), but Spock is denied this human symbol.If my memory is correct, i remember that my father taped it on VHS. As i viewed it before him, he asked me how it was and i answered that it's was useless for him to watch it because Spock dies at the end.

Made as a sequel to the episode Space Seed Wrath of Khan was a film that could easily appeal to non-fans like me whilst still pleasing the many fans of the series. Wrath of Khan works is the story of Kirk being called into action and Khan's desire for revenge against Kirk despite it defying logic. It is a film about the interplay and duel of minds between the adversaries as well their relationship with their crews, particular between Kirk, Spock, Bones and newcomer Saavik. Adding to the experience is some decent model works, including a scene with a mind control insect and an excellent score by James Horner, the film that made his name as a composer.",

Once the Enterprise contacts Kahn's crew, Kahn and Kirk play a tense game of cat and mouse. A sub story is Kirk's success as a captain; his humanity and his out of the box thinking is highlighted to prove he has what it takes to win a no win scenario. Spock also displays serious bravery in saving the crew from imminent danger. The second movie had more fun and colorful characters, than the first, which helped develop the crew's personas further. It was less contemplative and more character driven. Overall, it was enjoyable with great enemies.",

The pace is faster, the plot intriguing with nail biting action and great character pieces. This is what Star Trek is at its very best.The FX work looks fantastic even for today. While the visuals aren't as mind blowing as The Motion Picture they are easily overtaken by the great job done by the cast. All the regulars are on fine form but the highlights come from Shatner and Ricardo Montalban as his nemesis Khan. The duelling relationship between the two characters is what holds the movie together. Kirk is forced to address his ageing self leading to some funny and heartfelt character moments while Khan is simply magnetic to watch. Consumed with vengeance but also pride, Montalban steals every scene while endless quotable lines.The direction by Nicholas Meyer really makes the film come to life. This is no more evident than in the battle sequences. Rather than the Star Wars style large scale battles this is a more like submarine warfare. The conflicts hinge on whits as well as fire power. The first engagement is so tension filled it could be cut with a knife. Add to this a great musical score by James Horner and you have the complete package. There's a reason this is regarded as the best - it has great action, acting, writing, directing and a thrilling ride from beginning to end.Great fun, great movie.",

            "review_title": "Outdated and completely unlike the first Star Trek film (which is actually a bad thing)",
            "content": "My views are in apparent minority but nevertheless I want to stress them out.Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan is a film very different from its predecessor. To the point of being entirely different genre. Star Trek: The Motion Picture was somewhat dull but ambitious, lagging but visually stunning, based on quite typical, but anyway interesting premise, resembling old science fiction stories. It was the slightly poorer cousin of 2001:Space Odyssey. ST:TWK is nothing of these. It is a simple adventure movie accidentally placed in space. Its story has almost no SF elements, they are to be found only in movie's scenery. As a result it's difficult to compare both movies and I don't understand almost all such comparisons made here, on IMDb site. But personally I find ST:TMP superior in virtually all elements, including special effects and visuals (in the 1979 original one can really see the effort and its big budget).Putting original aside, and judging ST:TWK only by modern action-adventure standards I find it an extremely dated film. The acting is weird and/or weak, the main villain outright ridiculous. Khan's motivation is unconvincing, his actions mostly unintelligent (despite film's claims of his being 'superior'), he wears rags on bare chest and looks bizarre and hilarious at the same moment. The story is full of plot holes and, in the end, is utterly boring. One cannot care for neither relate to any of the main characters, even in the supposedly most emotional moments of the film.The Wrath of Khan may be possibly interesting for die-hard fans of Star Trek. However for SF fans, fans of action flicks and pretty much for everyone else it deserves to be forgotten.CAUTION POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERTNot to mention climactic \"his pattern indicates two-dimensional thinking\" scene, which is, as the whole movie, ridiculous. The Captain Kirk's final \"three-dimensional\" maneuver is as two-dimensional as it can really be. Khan is not showing two dimensional thinking, he is simply ignoring the third dimension existence! Pretty lame for a superior being of excellent intelligence.",

            "review_title": "Too Many Problems",
            "content": "Spoiler Alert TNN showed Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan last Tuesday.  I forced myself to watch again, this time to document the many obvious problems with this movie.  It is beyond belief to me that this movie is generally considered to be the best of the ten Trek films, and I want to take a moment to dispute that claim.  Some of these issues have been addressed before, in discussions raised here and elsewhere.  I apologize for the repetition, but I choose to include them because I want this to be a complete summary:1) \"I never forget a face,\" says Khan to Chekov.  And, yet, in Space Seed Khan never saw Chekov.  The argument is sometimes advanced that we can assume it happened off-camera.  You may advance; I will not accept.  We either have canon, or we don't.  If we do, let the rules be applied equally to all Trek.  If it ain't on camera, it never happened.  Khan never saw Chekov2) When Chekov realizes the danger he and Terrell are in, he dons his helmet and leaves the cargo hold.  Uh, whatever happened to emergency beamout? He should have been reaching for a communicator.  If we are expected to believe these people are Starfleet personnel, they might act like it once in awhile.3) Other transporter issues:  Kirk and Company board the Enterprise for the Admiral's inspection via a shuttlecraft instead of using a transporter? Obviously, so we can get the beautiful panorama of the Enterprise in space dock. I thought it was bad form for movies to so transparently speak to their audiences, even non-verbally, and this isn't the only such problem I saw.4) In the Mutaran nebula, shields and sensors are inoperative, and visibility is almost zero.  Yet, we, the audience, can see every movement of the two ships with crystal clarity?  Uh, hunh ..5) Other problems with the Mutaran nebula special effects:  in one of the scenes there was a vortex, a rather poorly visualized one at that.  We are supposed to believe this is a black hole, apparently.  I doubt we know, at this point, what's inside a nebula, but in my view, a vortex is a pretty poor guess.6) In another Mutaran nebula visual, this gossamer filament kinda just hangs there.  Would have been nice to have that filament be between us and one of the ships.  It would have been more effective in persuading me the two ships were actually inside a nebula.  As is, the Mutaran nebula sequence here presents no better than the special effects in ST V.7) In the space dock departure sequence, Saavik engages the maneuvering thrusters, and then orders the ship to one quarter impulse?   I've heard of a lead foot, but this is ridiculous.  I noticed the movie had a science advisor, a Dr. Richard Green.  He must have been sleeping here.  No one else appears to have a clue here as well.8) \"Revenge is a dish best served cold,\" says Khan at one point.  How does Khan know Klingon proverbs?  He's been in suspended animation for 200 years, and then marooned on a lifeless planet for the last fifteen.9) Speaking of that planet, Khan says at one point that it has \"only [one] indigenous life form\"  What did that creature live on, love and air? What did the crew of the Botany Bay live on for fifteen years?   We can assume the BB grew food in hydroponic gardens, or recycled their own waste, or something ..but no animal life survives without food, and this creature didn't have any.10) Khan says also that Ceti Alpha *6* exploded.  There is no doubt here: Ceti Alpha *Six*  Yet Chekov and Terrell beam down to Ceti Alpha 5 thinking it was 6. Shouldn't they have beamed down to Ceti Alpha *7*?11) Khan never forgets a face, but Chekov cannot seem to remember what happened to the Botany Bay in time to warn his captain about Khan?  Yes, he thinks Khan is on the next planet over, if he remembers him at all.  Yet, the reaction when he realizes his danger, suggests to me that he should have remembered before the beamdown, and said something12) Khan refers to \"my beloved wife\" at one point, which statement seems out of character.  The only thing beloved by Khan was Khan.13) The Enterprise is sent to investigate the Regula space station with a crew of trainees, because Kirk says it is the only ship in the quadrant. Oh, really?  Should have been the only ship in the sector, or the ship capable of reaching Regula the quickest, or something.  This is sloppy.14) There are technobabble labels throughout the Regula space station. Two I caught were \"synthostasis\" which is meaningless, and \"thermonics\"  They might have meant thermionics, which is unlikely.  Perhaps, they meant thermotics.  In any case, here is at least the third example where the Science Advisor or Production Staff had no clue.15) That brings to mind some of the other images of rheostats turning and buttons being pushed and switches being thrown.  TNG's tactile instrumentality makes this stuff look hopelessly crude.16) The relationship with Carol Marcus was never mentioned on TOS.  I vacillate on whether I believe the two were married, but that relationship is by far the most committed, fulfilling, and evolved of Kirk's life. It's inconceivable that it was never mentioned.  I'm aware, of course, that it never existed in TOS. Which knowledge makes it hard for me to accept seeing it here.  Although I will say that the emotional subcontext dramatized here between Kirk and Marcus is enough to put to rest forever any claims among \"slashers\" that he is gay..17) I had claimed elsewhere that the Genesis device was a big, overgrown ray gun, a contrived sci-fi element as old as the genre.  It is not.  It is a wave generating device, and if the visuals at the end of TWOK are to be believed, an omni-directional one of fixed range. Yet in its first use in the movie it appears to be a projectile.  Which is it?  If it's a wave, there are problems with the wave pattern generated, for that pattern appears to spread as range from the source increases. Meaning, it is impossible to use because any user winds up like Khan, or it spreads so quickly, it is inconceivable it could be still effective over any range as small as say the distance between earth and the moon.18) More discussion about transporters.  Saavik used the transporter on the Regula station.  How did she get to the cavern below-ground?  We can assume an auto-beamout or a timed beamout, but this should have been addressed.19) In one scene, someone aboard the Enterprise asks them to provide coordinates for beamout.  The Enterprise had the coordinates, or could get them by locking on to the communicators.   I would be interested in knowing, too, how it is even possible for a landing party to furnish beamout coordinates.  The Enterprise could use sensors to detect them and calibrate from sensor readings, placing them in a position relative to their surroundings.  The landing party could provide their position with respect to the Enterprise, or the Enterprise's position with respect to them, but this would be of no use for transport.  Yet another case of science advisor asleep at the switch.20) In the cat and mouse game at Regula, Scott says that auxiliary power is restored, but that they have barely enough for transporters. Transporters are rather low energy systems.  This does not compute.21) I've discussed the death of Spock at length, saying it was unbelievable because of story-external knowlege, namely, Nimoy posturing that he doesn't want to do Trek anymore.  It has other problems: Kirk pushes a crewman out of the way to get to the ladder to go to the chamber where Spock is dying. I guess this was to show his haste, and that he considered it important. I thought it was cheap, gratuitous, and unnecessary.22) In Spock's dying soliloquy, he mentions that he never took the Kobiyashi Maru test.  However, he did graduate from Starfleet, and all Starfleet cadets are required to take the test.   Maybe, he was sick that day.  Or, skipped class.24) Minor quibbles.  I didn't like the music, the credits font was mediocre, to be kind, and Spock looked like my great-great gandmother in the dress he wore in the meditation sequence in his quarters.Final thoughts:  if TWOK is the best of the Trek movies with all of these problems, then the others are sad, indeed, and we deserve the disdain of non-Trek folks for liking them.  Rather more likely, it is not the best of the Treks.  I do not see how given these manifest problems that anyone can say otherwise.However, this was Shatner's and Montalban's movie from the start, a sci-fi version of Moby Dick.  Montalban tries; he really does, but his lines are so lame, not even he can save them.  Shatner, OTOH, was brilliant.  I can't think of a single scene in this movie I liked without him in it. He deserved an Oscar for this performance, and the only contribution this movie made to the preservation of the franchise was that performance.",

            "content": "After the mixed critical returns of Star Trek:  The Motion Picture, the fledgling franchise was in desperate need of a boost.  Star Trek:  The Wrath of Khan provided that boost, and more.Fifteen years (movie time) after Admiral Kirk's encounter with V'Ger, the Enterprise is a decomissioned training vessel under the command of Captain Spock.  Uhura, McCoy, and Captain Scott still serve as active crewmembers. Chekov, the young ensign, is a commander now, and first officer of the science vessel Reliant.  Sulu, newly promoted to Captain, is being primed to assume command of the experimental Excelsior.Enter Savvik, a by-the-book, no-nonsense command cadet.  She is half Vulcan, half Romulan, and the protege of her Captain.  While none of Savvik's actions directly affect the outcome (this is and always will be Shatner's command performance), Savvik is our own interest in this film; the outsider among the familiars, and it is greatly through her eyes that we view the action.  She asks the questions we would, reacts to the developments as we would.The tone of this film, directed by Nick Meyer, is decidedly darker than that of its predecessor, with some heavy-handed violence, tounge-in-cheek humor, philosophical insight, supurb effects, and almost relentless action.  This is what Star Trek was always intended to be.  Gone is the hokey campiness, the ultra-fantastic uniforms, and cardboard computer consoles.  The Enterprise and her sister ship are presented with the look of real Naval vessels; not clean, well-oiled machines, but dirty, somewhat beaten, in every respect more believable that earlier models.  The new uniforms are crisp, functional, and realistic.  Khan's overwhelming drive for vengeance is instantly understood, with help from Herman Melville (ST:TWOK is actually consided by some to be directly based upon Moby Dick; Savvik being Ismael, both Kirk and Khan playing a split Ahab/white whale, each with their obsessions).  The plot is nicely constructed, with Khan's plans of revenge crossing paths with the scientific advancement of a missle capable of re-generating new, programmable life upon its target, and Kirk's reluctance to fall back into his old role.  Once he does so, however, it comes back on a grand scale.As mentioned before, this is William Shatner's command performance.  He has never before nor since been better.  Montalban's over-the-top, wild-eyed performance of Khan is classic, one of the most memorable villians in cinema history, and one gets the impression he might have slept in his wig and costume at night.  James Horner's (Oscar winner for Titanic) score is magnificent, setting the mood for the action precisely; never so brassy as to become gaudy, never so dark as to transcend the picture.The bottom line is that the best of the Star Trek films is also a good enough to stand up against the best of Hollywood.***1/2 (excellent)",

            "content": "STAR TREK: THE WRATH OF KHAN is the second in a series of 11 Star Trek movies to date. It's the first Star Trek movie I saw and I have to say it's still the best one in my eyes even after the first time I saw it 14 years ago. I love it!Unlike most of the other Star Trek movies, which depend upon prior knowledge of the franchise before viewing, this one can be seen by anyone new to it. Even those who dislike the Star Trek franchise still love this movie as a sci-fi action movie in its own right as I found out when I was reading through the comments.Without giving away spoilers, I can tell everyone that this is one of the few movies I've ever seen where almost every scene is riveting and has some significance. Scenes of literal edge-of-your-seat suspense are offset by emotionally-moving and thought-provoking moments. The viewer is made to feel a variety of emotions including fear, love, laughter, sadness, regret, grief and for some even unbearable levels of tension. It is also perhaps the only sci-fi movie to directly question science in a very wide context and make us all wonder about the dangers of science evolving too far and possibly leading to too much power being placed in the wrong hands.Unsurprisingly, this movie was a box office hit unlike its predecessor, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, which was a massive flop.In an unusual turn of events for a sequel, this one disregards its predecessor to bring to the audience a very different story.I will sum up the plot of the movie, with those unfamiliar with the Star Trek franchise in mind - a space ship (the USS Reliant) carrying out a scientific investigation accidentally arrive on a planet inhabited by a genetically-engineered madman named Khan and his followers who were marooned there 15 years ago by the then Captain James T. Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Khan is obsessed with getting revenge on the newly promoted Admiral Kirk and decides to hi-jack the Reliant to hunt him down in what culminates in a terrific cat-and-mouse chase in space.The acting is top-notch across the board. The actors give performances that truly invite us in to their character's feelings.For those familiar with the Star Trek franchise, I can confirm that the familiar faces from the original series are all here - Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Chekov, Sulu and Uhura. They are put into situations that not only capture the heart and soul of the TV series, but also show you how their lives have evolved in the 15 years or so difference with the timeline.A new character, Saavik, a naive vulcan lieutenant, played perfectly by Kirstie Alley, adds enjoyment to the experience. She has plenty of screen time, looks and acts incredibly sexy, takes part in some terrific scenes and has an important purpose to the emotional elements of the movie. Why she has never had the opportunity to appear in anything as good as this again is totally beyond me. And in my opinion her character should have been made a permanent addition to the original crew for the remainder of their movies in the series.Khan, who featured in an episode of the original series, is once again played by Ricardo Montalban. Unlike most villains in the science fiction or action genres, Khan is genuinely menacing through his combination of sheer cunningness, quick mind and unpredictable anger. He's easily the greatest villain ever established by the Star Trek franchise. Every scene he's in is a true joy to watch and the movie is worth seeing just to witness Ricardo Montalban's captivating performance.William Shatner deserves special recognition because he gives what is easily his finest performance as Kirk. He portrays Kirk as someone well into middle-age, sitting behind a desk in a boring job when he'd rather be back flying around the galaxy. His performance was one of the most emotionally touching I've ever seen in a movie and is certainly enough to silence those who unjustly claim his acting is \"hammy\".The action scenes in the movie are truly suspenseful in the edge-of-your-seat sense. Unlike the series, some boundaries are removed in this movie. There are no crewmen wearing red sweaters who fans of the series would reasonably expect to see killed. No one is safe from death. Khan's thirst for revenge is truly merciless and the producers of the movie really brought this to life as anyone seeing the final half hour of the movie will find out.The movie demonstrates clear evidence of meticulous planning in regard to scripting. Some truly great one-liners are delivered here that will stay forever in the memories of fans.The producers do an excellent job of re-using some of the best aspects of the first movie, including the sets for the starships, some costumes and footage of the Enterprise leaving spacedock. This enabled this movie to be produced on a more efficient budget without making the $10 million or so budget seem anywhere near as low as it was.To summarise, STAR TREK: THE WRATH OF KHAN is a flawless piece of science fiction entertainment that can be enjoyed whether you're a fan of the franchise or not. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys sci-fi action movies.",

I have made an estimated 200 viewings of this over the years! William Shatner as Kirk is outstanding, and he looks a lot more happy and comfortable than he did in Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). Leonard Nimoy as Spock is just as pleasing.Ricardo Montalban seems to have improved with age as he makes a much better performer in this than he did in the original TV episode - Space Seed - all those years ago.And just as important as these three stars is the musical score by James Horner. Music was a vital element to the original series and the 1979 film...so it is nice to see the tradition is maintained.However, this tradition would take a bit of a nose dive in Star Trek 111: The Search For Spock (1984) as that film has a less pleasing score.Star Trek 11 is close to perfect but the simple fact that it is another \"revenge movie\" more than a sci-fi movie puts is down the ladder just a tiny bit.

It's truly something that you should see for yourself.This is a film that is about choices, and how much of an impact they truly have. Khan, if you are unaware, is a villain from the original series, and Kirk's choice about what to do with him is the reason that all the trouble is happening in the first place. It always highlights the fact that Kirk is not a perfect man, which any great epic film does with their heroes.Though this film is probably best enjoyed by Trekkies who watched the original, there is plenty here for a non-Trekkie to enjoy.

It's my favourite of the trek films, and it's a bench mark for all trek movies to this day.There is so much I love about this movie. The first time I watched it I was a little kid, and it was on a 12 inch black and white TV. I was blown away buy it. When we got a VCR I would rent this movie at least once a year. It would easily be in my top ten movies of all time.This movie has a broad scope of appeal, and is a movie I think even non trek fans will enjoy. It was listed as one of the 101 Sci-Fi movies you must see before you die.The movie has themes of old age, revenge, and dealing with death. As Captain Kirk is now turning 50 in the film. He is given an antique book, and eye glasses for his birthday.The Enterprise at this point is being used as a training vessel for star fleet cadets. With Spock as the Captain, and Kirk evaluating the cadets performance.Meanwhile another star fleet vessel the U.S.S. Reliant is evaluating a seemingly lifeless planet for the terraforming device known as genesis. Created by Kirks old love Dr Carol Marcus.When the Captain of the Reliant, and Chekov (who is now serving on board the Reliant) Beam down to the planet to investigate what may have been a life form reading. Only to fine KAHN!!! Kahn then puts parasites in there ears as a means of mind control. He then takes control of the Reliant. Then he puts his plan into motion to take the genesis device for himself, and destroy Kirk.The best part of this movie for me is the death of Spock. It was, and to this day one of the best on screen deaths. It is the perfect example of how a great heroic character should die.There are so many good parts to this film I love, but I'll stop with Spocks death.The worst part of this film for me has nothing to do with the film itself. The worst part is I never got to see this movie in theatres as a kid. I wish I had seen it for the first time on the big screen with the wonder only a child can have.Only a few years ago I finally got to see it on the big screen for the first time.So if your a star trek fan most likely you have already seen this movie, and if your a fan of sci-fi movies you have most like already seen this movie.If you haven't and you are a fan of sci-fi. I highly recommend you watch this movie, or your a movie buff in general.You will be entertained.",

            "content": "This film is a bit dated, but it still holds up dramatically. The effects are decent, the small CGI vignette still has a certain charm to it, but some of the other predictions of future technology don't quite hold up. Even so, it's a good film unto itself.One of the amazing things about this movie is that it's formulaic, skimps on production values, is essentially a made for TV movie, but holds its own in a theatrical exhibition. It is, classic Trek at its best in a then contemporary setting.Our favorites are back, as well as some long lost familiar names. We have a Herman Melville like theme undulating here, and some challenges of life itself as our characters face transitions.Even though there's a kind of relativism operating here, Trek maintains a traditional white-hate/black-hat zeitgeist to keep our allegiances to the characters we know and love.There's action, there's resurrection of old wounds, there's vendettas, there's anger, there's passion, and, of course, the U.S.S. Enterprise and her outstanding crew.Kirk's character was rewritten for this particular production. His values and sense of worth are not translated from the TV series, but Shatner is in the role, so we buy into the bravado of a Captain Kirk that never was. Fortunately the triumvirate of his logical and emotional sides with him as the head of the pyramid, still resound with audiences. We again witness reason from Spock clash with feelings from Bones in this installment, and are reassured that the three are friends regardless of their differences. In fact, they have to be.On that note there's a deeper lesson operating here. Just as Kirk must let go of his gamesmanship to embrace his inner adult as he lets go of his inner child, so it is that that one character who helped him and crew through so much turmoil and challenges in the past, and fought with logic and a good heart behind that reason, so it is that a human being is not a computer, and that the binary decision making process that characterizes Vulcans (or Vulcanians) is not normal for human beings. Kirk, in this installment of Trek, is still a little boy, albeit aged and feeling old, he is a gamer at heart, and used his superior intellect to meet and conquer all challenges with the help of his best friend. But even best friends, no matter how tough, strong, resilient and seemingly indestructible and powerful, are, after all, only mortal. And so it is with Spock.All men eventually grab a mate and shed the trappings that entertained them as boys. All men realize that they must live life. It is so with Kirk and the rest of the crew of the Enterprise, as it is with all beings everywhere, from the depths of oceans, to frigid, arid, and plush elevations, to high altitudes and beyond. We only live once, and so we must live that life as best as possible. It may be that Kirk read Marcus Aurelius, but needed his friends to help give him a kick forward to see his path as man, and not just as a starship captain.Again, so it is with Kirk and crew.For me, this was the final \"episode\" of original Trek. All the stuff that came afterwards was essentially filler for a void that needed creating. You can only rely on old staples from your youth for so long. That's kind of the message here as Kirk grapples with an old nemesis whose hatred blinds him so much that he misses a golden opportunity. Kirk, in a sense, puts down another man's anger by letting go that which has been with him for so long.We lose something here, but then again, it is space; the final frontier.Enjoy.",

It takes place several years after the original (some say producers disregarded the first movie). Admiral Kirk is celebrating his birthday with Dr. McCoy as they inspect the Enterprise and oversee the training of a new potential Captain: Saviik. A Vulcan, she has the benefit of the tutelage of Captain Spock. In any case, Enterprise is out and receives a distress signal from Regula 1. Dr. Carol Marcus (an old flame of Kirk) is upset that her project Genesis has been ordered to be seized by the USS Reliant. What Kirk does not know is that Reliant has been taken over by Kahn, the same Kahn who was sent to Ceti Alpha Five instead of being executed for his attempted takeover of the Enterprise in the classic episode, Space Seed. Kahn was accidentally discovered by Science Officer Pavel Chekov when trying to find a planet suitable for the Genesis project. This has everything the first movie needed. Action, a good antagonist, exploration, suspense, space-battles, self-discovery, philosophy, and a reference to classical literature. The best part is that the characters, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Chekov, Sulu and Kirk are characters. In the first movie, they spent so many time pushing buttons amidst cheesy dialog, they were not believable. They seemed like props to the new Enterprise set. Here, they have their personalities (is that really good for Shatner, though?). For any Star Trek fan, this is the must-have in the movie collection.",

            "content": "After the disappointment of the big-budget blockbuster Star Trek: The Motion Picture, everything was reinvented in Nicholas Meyer's take on Trek. This film delivers the action, adventure, humor, camp, and villainy, that made for the best moments in the Original Series. Granted, there are a few flaws. The low-budget effects can be weak, even for 1982, and it feels difficult to believe that the Federation would support a potentially world destroying project like Project Genesis. But instead of a slow-paced quest for \"knowledge,\" Wrath of Khan gives us naval battles in space, terrifying alien creatures, and one of Trek's greatest villains, while still being somewhat introspective with Kirk's attempts to cope with age and the morality of pushing science to its limit.There's no doubt that this is the best Star Trek film, with the original crew, at keeping the viewer on the edge of the seat, and it is the individual battle between Kirk and Khan that makes this film great. Really, both of these men are Captain Ahab; two men relentlessly searching for something that is unattainable. Khan is seeking contentment from vengeance and Kirk is seeking the heroism of youth. It almost seems that Khan, given that he is from the 1990s, is simply a less evolved version of Kirk. Both men care for their crew and want to guide them to victory, yet it causes them to hurt their crew in the process.And Trek has never seen such an engaging individual conflict as Kirk vs. Khan since. Kirk loses a loved one, gains a son, and embraces his true self. This may have been the perfect conclusion to the original crew's story line (even if it would have been sad to say goodbye), however, it was not.*My film rating follows the soccer player rating measure of 6 as a baseline: you did what was expected of you. This film is a 9 because, despite its effects and shaky sub-plot, it showed us what Star Trek should look like on the big screen.",

            "content": "The first film in the STAR TREK franchise was successful enough to warrant a sequel, but the studio was smart enough to realize it was far too different from the original series to keep fans satisfied. Their second film, THE WRATH OF KHAN, is one of the most successful and is widely considered by the fan community to be the best in the series. As the film opens, Admiral Kirk (Shatner) has begrudgingly accepted his new administrative role in Starfleet while Spock (Nimoy) has been given command of the Enterprise. Meanwhile, the USS Reliant searches for a suitable uninhabited planet for testing of the Genesis Project and inadvertently crosses paths with an old adversary of Kirk's, Khan Noonien Singh (Montalban). Khan soon gains control of the Reliant and uses it to pursue the Genesis device while at the same time seeking vengeance on the man he blames for the death of his wife...James Kirk. Now, with Khan on the hunt, Kirk must confront his old enemy as well as the potential life he left behind. I'll won't go into detail about that on the off chance anyone reading this hasn't yet seen the movie.The first film was incredibly somber and moody, shooting for an epic feel with it's slow pacing and it's focus on the expensive visual effects. Sure it was an interesting film, but II brings the series a little closer back to it's roots. There's much more action and the adventurous tone has returned. I'm glad it did, because this film is light years more entertaining. I never got into the original series much (I was raised on NEXT GENERATION onward) but this film is definitely one of my favorites. One reason is the film's villain: Ricardo Montalban as Khan. I've never seen the first season episode \"Space Seed\" where he made his original appearance, but I'm tempted to search it out if he's anywhere as good as he is here. Montalban does insanity well, balancing tense moments of apparent control with violent outbursts. Sure, he has his campy moments but so does the rest of the film. I realize it was meant to be a serious moment for Kirk but his \"Khaaaaaan!\" as he and his away team are left trapped in the underground caverns of Regula was just too funny. I almost felt bad for laughing because I know it's supposed to be a big moment. Shatner does ham it up a bit in this film, but he's also got some real great bits. DeForest Kelley has always been my favorite original crew member as Dr. \"Bones\" McCoy and has probably got the best laughs in the film and I'm glad he was a pretty large supporting role here. On the subject of supporting characters, I'd forgotten Kirstie Alley has a rather large role as Lieutenant Saavik. She did a surprisingly good job as the Enterprise's new Vulcan first officer and I have to admit she looked great back then.The film was released in 1982, three years before I was born, but I wish I could've seen it in theaters when it was still new. I can't imagine how it must've felt watching the climactic final battle and the sacrifice made to survive (again, no details for those fresh to the series and haven't yet watched it). By now, we all knew it was merely temporary but back then fans must've been blown away at how the film ended. I imagine it had to have been on par with the \"I am your father\" moment in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK for Star Wars fans, with jaws hitting the floor. All in all, there is a lot to love about this film and very little to hate (though I got tired of seeing recycled footage from THE MOTION PICTURE, but whatever...money saved for the production, I suppose). The second film was wildly successful, much more than the first, and solidified STAR TREK's ongoing presence on the big screen. And for that, I am thankful.",

The problem with the first Trek film was that the story was sacrificed for the effects.  Wrath of Khan suffers from no such problem.  In fact, the story is the strongest, with only First Contact being comparable, and namely because it shares the same theme (revenge). For any film student who wishes to learn about editing and the application of music in a film watch the four minute (filmed in real time) Genesis countdown.  Watch the way the camera finds each individual character contemplating what will happen.  This is William Shatner's finest moment on film, the first real glimpse that he is, indeed, an actor. The only drawback from the movie is not a drawback, because it isn't in the movie.  In the novellezation of the film, at the conclusion, Saavik asks Kirk what course.  Kirk replies \"second star to the right and straight on till morning.\" (a quote which turns up in Undiscovered Country).  The important thing is that Saavik does *not* question the command, and simply executes it, something she never would have done at the beginning of the film.  The film is a journey - one into hope and then tragedy for Kirk, one into death for Spock and one into humanity for Saavik.  It is the most human of all the films, and certainly must rank with Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back and Aliens as one of the all time great space action films.",

The second Star Trek movie is swift,droll,and adventurous,not to mention appealingly gadget-happy and outstanding special effects. It was everything the first one should have been,and wasn't. As the title suggests,\"Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan\",has a much stronger plot than its predecessor with really helps and its an overall improvement. The film also has the gamesmanship that the first installment lacked,a quality that helped win the Star Trek television series its amazingly devoted following. Maybe its just that there are more special features aboard the Starship Enterprise this time,or that the costumes are so clever,or that the special effects are so eyepopping beyond belief that they don't call undue attention to themselves. Perhaps,its the directorial switch from Robert Wise(of The Andromeda Strain,The Hindenburg,and The Sound of Music)to Nicholas Meyer(Time after Time)that has brought the material more into view and into more pep with the original television series. In any case,this was in fact was the best and the most better installment of the series and perhaps way more better in plot and action than in all of the ten theatrical features that \"Star Trek\" has been based on. And \"Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan\" is the stylish out of them all.In addition to the unexpected twists and turn and not to mention feats of derring-do the film also has the quality of a sentimental journey. This time around by bringing back the original cast of the television series;William Shatner(Admiral Kirk),Leonard Nimoy(Mister Spock),DeForest Kelley(Dr. McCoy),Nichelle Nichols(Lt. Uhara),George Takei(Capt. Sulu),James Doohan(Scotty),Walter Koenig(Chekov),and the rest of the crew for another breathtaking adventure into the unknown. This time around Mr. Shatner's Captain Kirk is an admiral now,given to ribbing the young trainees and wistfully saying awkward things,as usual. Mr. Spock now has a pointy-eared protegee named Saavik(Kristie Alley) with whom he converses in their native tongue. This sequel may not make a new Trek devotee out of anyone,but will surely delight the older ones that have grown up with the original television series. Even the mambo-jumbo of this is not only fun,but absolutely hilarious especially with Shatner doing what he does best--over the top acting.But what makes this movie more intriguing and fun not to mention exciting to watch is Kirk's old nemesis-Khan as played by the classiest of comic strip villains by Ricardo Montalban(who was also played the same character in the television version \"Space Seed\" from the Star Trek series)who makes this movie jumped to life. With his fierce profile,long white hair,manful decolletage,and space age jewelry,Mr. Montalban looks like the world's oldest rock star or space Indian chief,but what makes his character some diabolically evil is something that really brings the film to life and its worth seeing why. Even so after 25 years of its release,the film still holds status as one of the greatest Trek sequels not to mention the greatest science-fiction films of the 1980's. Released in the summer of 1982,\"Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan\" came out right around the time Steven Spielburg's sci-fi fantasy \"ET\",and Tobe Hooper's \"Poltergeist\" dominated the summer box office. Getting back to \"Star Trek II\",it may lasts of long time(at a running length of 114 minutes),its worth seeing especially for the great space battle sequences and Kirk finally getting even with his long time evil nemesis. It may have been corny,but what can you expect for those who never have seen the original TV show or for matter veterans fans of the series. Its not like the other Trek movies that had worn out its welcome(like Treks III through X),but its pure escapism and certainly succeeds in that manner. The best of the bunch.",

Where those were more about entertainment and action, this one (and presumably the others as well) are about ideas.

The way in which this is portrayed on screen is both inspired and poignant, resulting in one of the most touching scenes I've seen in a sci-fi movie. Pretty much everything about this movie is excellent, from the performances, the production design, the special effects (by 80's standards) to the score. In particular, Ricardo Montalban was very menacing and memorable as the villain, Khan. Every word that came out of his mouth oozed evil. William Shatner also did an admirable job, although he occasionally slipped back into some of the mannerisms he used on the original series, which have been made fun of and parodied many times.

Like Superman I and II, Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is one of these movies.Everything just seemed to click. The acting, the story, the action and special effects. Even now as I am writing this the movie is 27 years old and still looks spectacular. It is amazing to think that Director Nicholas Meyer re-wrote this story in only 12 days and didn't get a writing credit.Also, who could forget Ricardo Montalban as the stand out villain Khan Noonian Singh. This wasn't just any cutout cardboard bad guy. This was a man with depth. Someone, although evil, we could sympathise with. He is a great character study of someone dealing with his grief and despair in absolutely the wrong way that it effects (and literally kills) all those around him.Shatner and co also bring tremendous strength to their characters especially surrounding the concepts of life and death. A tremendous credit must be given to Nicholas Meyer who helmed this project. Although, not a Star Trek fan his legacy still effects Star Trek to this day.The Special effects still hold up to todays standards as well plus one of the first uses of computer graphics on film. Finally, the kickbutt cliffhanger ending rounds it all off as a great movie.The only beef I have with it is the dodgy costumes on Khan's goons. They all look like they came out a really bad Mad Max movie and that's the only thing that looks dated.Apart from that the movies is simply fantastic!!!! Go watch!!!",

This idea is what sets the better Trek from the standard Trek (see Trek II, IV, VI & IIX)... OK, I guess it also told us that even numbered sequels would be the better films.Khan, a one shot character from TOS is back with a vengeance, as so few characters ever have been in the Trek time-line, and wants actual, factual revenge. It was a dark passage for Kirk and crew, almost Trek Noir. Following the light bright '2001'-esque Motion Picture, this film worked.The teaser Spock death in the beginning, only makes you want it more. Noble or not, you know it's gonna' happen and you want to see it.An early effort by Nicholas Meyer (who helms the two best in my book; II & VI), the film holds onto it's dark future and brooding tones. Sure, Kirk is feeling old, but in the end he's still James T. Kirk.An epic Trek film, a popcorn movie... more adventure than just Sci-Fi, it works.",

            "content": "I love this film, it is the best of ANY of the \"...Trek\" movies, and also a fine film in its own right. It is up there as one of my favourites. I first saw it in my early teens after having read the novelisation by Vonda N. McIntyre and found it easier to accept some of the anomalies and plot holes because I had made myself aware of the plot devices first.Make no mistake, it is flawed, massive plot holes. Why is Chekov beaming down to the Ceti Alpha system when he knows that Khan has been marooned there previously?? OK, he thinks he is beaming down to Ceti Alpha VI but he systematically fails to notice a whole planet missing. All a bit sloppy, I won't go into it here but the whole movie is based upon his mistake, there are internet threads a plenty for debate if you fancy exploring this one... Aside from that, folk often point out that as Chekov is not in the original episode from 1967 where we first meet Khan, then how can Khan recognise him in the film, set fifteen years later?? I have no problem with this, the Enterprise is a big ship, and there is no reason to suppose that Khan did not meet all kinds of people during his time on it.Anyway. I love this film because it is very HUMAN. Kirk has a mid life crisis, Khan has his freedom and yet screws it all up and risks his people purely for revenge. The two actors are both magnificent in this one and yet they never meet, only communicating on screen!! I will admit that a large part of the reason I love this film so much is Ricardo Montalban. Not only is he incredibly sexy but his scene chewing lines, flashing dark eyes, menace and VULNERABILITY do it for me every time. As for the costume....ahem...cough (Ok OK, I was about 14 when I first saw this..) Characterisations between Spock and Saavik are good but again the book spoiled me by going into more depth. As ever the interplay between Bones and Spock a joy. I have heard people slagging off the FX in this, but the fight in the Mutara Nebula still stands up today, I absolutely love that bit, and have just changed the wallpaper on my computer so that now Enterprise and Reliant are facing each other in the gloom.. This film is not fast paced but I get a little tired of whizz bang \"Pile 'em high and sell 'em cheap\" action movies. When the fight scenes do come they are actually quite epic. But it is not constant enough to give one a headache. I am glad that many of the scenes are just humans being ..well..human. Agonising, making decisions, reminiscing, regretting, living, loving and not being bloody perfect!!!! I could write reams about this film but I will spare you all. It is excellent on so many levels, the musical score is great, acting from the two leads totally absorbing, fight scenes sphincter clenching good, and then there's the sad stuff. I watched this AGAIN the other night and SPOILER ALERT still cried at Spock's death. I love the look on Spock's face just before he leaves the bridge upon learning that if the engines don't go back online in minutes then Genesis is going to detonate and they've all had it........most excellent. I won't talk about the eel bit at the start of the film....ewwwww....makes you want to wear ear muffs to bed just in case of earwigs creeping across the pillow....All in all, one of the best movies ever IMHO. I am prepared to ignore its many goofs and plot holes purely because it is so damn enjoyable to watch. I could finish it and then put it on again time after time.Final note. Have always loved the fact that the Ozric Tentacles spin off dance band \"Eat Static\" took their name from a quote in this film :-)",

            "content": "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is one of the few science fiction films that has a real theme and not in the musical sense. The film is not just about action, adventure, and intrigue, although contains those elements. It is about how people deal with life and death situations and the choices they make. The film introduces a young female Vulcan captain, played by Kirstie Alley in one of her first large roles, who appears to be at the helm of a Federation Starship which is engaged in a life and death situation. It turns out that the situation was a simulation and the young captain is not yet quite a captain but a cadet in training, and her instructor is none other than James T. Kirk, now an admiral in the Federation. The scenario, it is learned, is called the Kobayashi Maru Test, a no-win situation which tests the character rather than problem-solving ability of a young officer.The rest of the film becomes a kind of Kobayashi Maru Test for Kirk, where at every turn he must face the un-faceable at the hands of a former foe, Khan, reprised brilliantly by Ricardo Monteblan who used to play villains before granting people's fantasies on Fantasy Island. Eventually a life and death choice is made at the climax of the movie becoming one of the best endings to a science fiction film ever shot. The script is near perfect, and combines the best of science fiction, action, adventure, and plot with surprising emotion and heart. A brilliant film all around and one of the best performances by the Star Trek cast, especially William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. For those who were let down by Star Trek: The Motion Picture, this movie makes up for it in spades. Maybe the only stipulation is that new viewers may need to see a few of the original Star Trek episodes before seeing this movie especially because so much of the story is dependent upon the empathy that the audience will feel for the characters. An absolute triumph.",

            "content": "It's funny to see that on most Trek-related movie lists \"Khan\" ranks #1. Even at the time of it's release I thought this film, while better than the first one, was over-rated and boring with only 4 notable scenes; the rest of the time you can fast-forward. 1) I wish the producers could have stuck with the \"facts.\" Why couldn't they have picked an actual character from the series to have been the mother of Kirk's son? Even Yeoman Rand could have changed careers and she would have been recognizable enough but the arbitrary creation of Carol and David Marcus was an unnecesary distraction. David comes across as pouty and I couldn't have cared less about this character even at the end. Also, everyone knows about the Chekhov mistake as Khan regonizes him when he wasn't even in the original episode. It would've been more interesting if it were Spock who had the animal implanted in him to see how he would've fought the power of suggestion and to see what Kirk would've done.2) Too much time is spent dwelling on the Kobyashi Maru. Who cares? I understand it sets up Kirk's desire not to lose but couldn't this have been done in a more interesting way? That way you don't need Lt. Saavik as much, a mistake nearly repeated in \"VI\" with the introduction of Lt. Valeris but at least she is put to much better use. 3) For all Spock's talk about Khan's intelligence, where is the evidence? Anybody could've captured the Reliant but the fact that he doesn't change the Reliant's access code, can't steer in the Nebula and can't fire a torpedo straight during the big fight scene doesn't support this. After the attack on the Enterprise when Kirk manages to lower Reliant's shields, who cares? Khan must surely know where the bridge of the Enterprise is from his study of the engineering charts (from \"Space Seed\")so why waste time looking for the override? Just fire. He comes off as one-dimensional. What a waste of a good performance by Montalban. Maybe having Chippendale dancers as Khan's crew wasn't a bright idea after all. A note on Captain Terrell. A wasted performance by the late great Paul Winfield. He is nothing to Kirk so why does all of a sudden, he \"doesn't want to\" shoot Kirk? I understand Chekhov's reluctance since he served with him but who's Kirk to Terrell? Just another officer. Waste him and everyone gets bumped up in rank. Given what Khan does with the Genesis device, how is a whole planet (rocks, trees, lava and all) formed out of the Reliant? If life is destoyed in favor it's new matrix, shouldn't the Reliant just essentially be a tree-covered ship floating in space? Another thing that made me go \"hmmm\", even at a young age. The 4 scenes worth watching: The introduction of Khan, his attack on the Enterprise and how Kirk wiggles out of it, the great CGI presentation of the Genesis device and Spock's touching death scene/funeral. Maybe you can tack on the scences when Kirk discovers Regula-1's crew's fate and Khan's final Cpt. Ahab-esque speech. The latter is well worth it. This is not a bad film. I strongly believe it's overrated and it was disappointing to see the story not being tight and downright dull in spots. The action scenes and special effects are worth it. I just wish there was more \"wrath\" in this movie and less talk.",

With Star Trek, one can hope it would prosper. In this case, The Wrath of Khan succeeds on everything the franchise set out to be in the first place.We have an interesting story this time round. That's all thanks to returning villain, Khan, played by Ricardo Montalban. He beats the crap out of the previous film's alien, V'Ger, and leaves it in the dust. So if you thought 1979's, The Motion Picture, threw away your Star Trek spirit, it's okay to keep watching.Captain Kirk and the enterprise's mission is simple, yet dangerous (of course): Stop Khan in the hopes he doesn't use the genesis: a device capable of generating a living planet able to hold life. Thus, the group face a life threatening assignment. What happens is entertaining and bold - something unexplored in the first motion picture.By all means, whatever you felt about William Shatner's previous performance of Captain Kirk, it's assured you'll be surprised in The Wrath of Khan. Broken from his chains, Shatner is superb. He's backed up by Kirstie Alley in her first movie role as female Vulcan, Saavik. Yet surely, there's a few less memorable acting but all is forgotten with an improvement in costume and special effects. Assuming that Star Trek: The Motion Picture left you dry, prepare to live long and prosper with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Alongside a dramatic amount of enhancement in story, acting and mostly everything, it seemingly kisses the franchise on the cheek while ignoring 1979's setback.",

The sequences of these two space monstrosities swooping close to one another, in order to get off that kill one shot - the coup d'gras were tense and exciting. The acting was all prime Star Fleet quality, very memorable of the earlY TV show.

This movie was entitled \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\", and unfortunately, it turned out to be a disappointment for many fans. Due to its extreme slowness, many have called it \"Star Trek: The Motionless Picture\". However, three years after that disappointment, the second movie in the series, \"Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan\", made it into theatres, and fortunately, it proved to be much better! Cmdr. Chekov and Capt. Clark Terrell beam down to the surface of a planet, which is intended to be used for the Genesis project, and search for signs of life. They soon discover that this is the planet where the evil Khan Noonien Singh and his following have been dwelling for the past fifteen years, since they were marooned by Captain (now Admiral) Kirk! Chekov and Terrell soon find themselves captured, and Khan inserts the young of a Ceti eel into their heads, which will take control of them! Khan now also has plans to have his revenge on Kirk, who is currently on a training mission! The former captain of the Starship Enterprise soon finds his life in jeopardy, and must once again fight his old enemy! Not only is this movie's predecessor from 1979 extremely slow-paced, not much really happens in it (or at least not much that interesting) during it's long running time, which is over two hours! However, although this 1982 follow-up may be a bit slow at times, and not all great from start to finish, there's definitely more to enjoy. This second installment in the \"Star Trek\" movie franchise has enough moments of suspense to make it watchable, and some parts of the film are actually set in some interesting places other than the ship, two things which cannot be said about \"The Motion Picture\" if you ask me. Not much positive really can be said about that film.It was unfortunate that the long-anticipated \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\", released so long after the demise of the TV series, had to be so disappointing. However, with the release of \"The Wrath of Khan\", it was clear that the \"Star Trek\" franchise hadn't lost it. For Trekkies, this film is obviously a must-see. For casual sci-fi viewers, as long as you don't despise \"Star Trek\" in general, and don't need non-stop action in order a movie to keep you satisfied, this successful second installment in the \"Star Trek\" movie franchise could be a treat for you as well.",

            "content": "I go back in time to when I was about eight years old.  Having always watched Star Trek TV episode re-runs with my father, and then this movie came out, I remember it as being one of the best movies I had ever seen, and still to this day, having seen it about 25+ times since, I still think it is the best Star Trek film of them all.  It has all the elements going for it to be a great movie, a perfect villian, human relationships you can relate to, and excellent space dog-fight battles (three of them in one movie!). The comedy in this Trek is still very dry compared to other Treks, by way of comparison, but it is a rather serious and dark movie.  The comedy really lies underneath Khan and Kirk's script lines, but both Ricardo and Bill manage to refine them to a better quality.  The cinematography is spectacular (but limited to technology of the era), Nick does an excellent job as director.  The choice of back-story contributes perfectly to the film, while Trekkers can relate to the original story, anyone who has not seen the series can easily follow the movie with the information given in the film.  Another good element is that there is is three seperate stories that eventually combine into one, you have Kirk and crew back at HQ with the trainees, then there is Terrell and Checkov on there mission, followed by the scientists on Regula.  What really makes this one shine, is that Meyer and Bennett give you three, yes three space battles!  You get a small one first off when the movie starts (just enough to peek your interest), followed by another obe half-way through the movie, and finally at the end with a climatic battle.  The visual exterior/interior damage is really adds a key element to the movie showing that the ships can be damaged.  For me, the use of federation ship (Reliant) against federation ship (Enterprise) really draws the dramatic tension of the battle up a notch.  I could go on and on, and at this point probably could transcript the whole movie and character lines from memory, but let's not.  Worthy to see, if you are trying to get a friend or opposite into Star Trek this would be the movie to start with.  Watching the episode \"Space Seed\" before the movie really makes the whole experience better.  Buy the Special Edition DVD, lots of extras and added scenes!",

            "content": "This, ladies and gentlemen, is what Star Trek is all about! Great sci-fi action, fun characters, and an exciting story with a deep undertone. Wrath of Khan is the sequel to the lackluster Star Trek: The Motion Picture. It takes place an unknown amount of time after the first film when Admiral James T. Kirk is pulled from his desk job to once again go into space with the USS Enterprise. What begins as a seemingly simple mission to investigate a program called Genesis becomes complicated when a ruthless villain named Khan shows up to enact his revenge on Admiral Kirk, the man who marooned him on a remote desert world years ago. This movie is everything you could want out of a feature length Star Trek picture. It is one of the highest points Star Trek would ever see in its long history.Wrath of Khan possesses everything that makes Star Trek so enjoyable. It is undeniably melodramatic at moments, and it can definitely be cheesy but, unlike its predecessor, the film contains some great sci-fi elements, but also hones in on all the unique aspects that make Star Trek what it is. For a sci-fi film the movie is much slower than what we are use to today, but it uses this to its dramatic and emotional advantage. The film moves at the pace of a grand space epic and has all the glorious set pieces and soap opera drama that are needed to pull off the unconventional. It is a beautiful film to look at, especially now that all the visual aspects such as costumes and scenery have a much bigger budget behind them to eliminate any of the laughable cheesiness we became so familiar with in the original series. The whole film is very well designed, especially in some of the contrasts between characters and costumes. Kirk and his Enterprise crew are all very prominently dressed in their very sophisticated and official looking Starfleet uniforms, while Khan and his followers wear fur skin clothing, giving them all a much more sinister and tribal look. The film contains much more visual prowess than ever really seen before in Star Trek.But just because the visuals were improved doesn't mean the filmmakers felt it necessary to slack off on the storyline. The plot of Wrath of Khan is everything we love about Star Trek. It is very deep and it deals with a lot of things relevant to modern society, just in the context of a futuristic one. The project Genesis is a device that has the ability to create worlds out of nothing and create its own life. There is obviously a lot of controversy behind a God playing machine like this, and this plays into some of the undertones in this film. But one of the most interesting ethical aspects of the film is its portrayal of Kirk. We have come to know Kirk as the knight in shining armor character, he is the valiant hero who will never leave a man behind and will go down with his ship if he has to. Yet in Wrath of Khan we see a darker side of Kirk. He is still loyal to his crew and his ship, but his moral ground is shaken with Khan's appearance. Khan brings to light Kirk's darker side by telling the story of how Kirk was, in Khan's eyes, responsible for the death of Khan's wife and the reason that Khan is now in the position he is in. Of course in the end Kirk could never be anything less than the ultimate hero, but some of the things that come to light in this film give it a much more human feel.The acting ability in Wrath of Khan is what Star Trek is. It is a science fiction melodrama and the acting plays it up just right. I will say that I thought Shatner's acting ability peaked in this film, and the rest of the cast felt more real to me than normal. Then of course we have the intimidating presence of Ricardo Montalban as Khan himself, who brings the greatest acting of the film to fruition. Montalban's performance is powerful and riveting, and the utter presence of the ruthless Khan can shake you to your core. If Khan was on screen, so were my eyes. Not to say my eyes weren't on the screen when Khan wasn't tearing up his role, but even more so when he was. He makes the film a lot of fun, but also a much deeper and more compelling ride.Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a fantastic Star Trek adventure that has everything that makes Star Trek what it is. It is some of the finest and most fascinating sci-fi you will ever see. This film can be enjoyed by fans and non fans alike, but it definitely helps if you're a fan knowing what to expect. It isn't your typical sci-fi shoot em up exploding roller coaster ride, but it is something much more gripping and enjoyable to watch if you can appreciate the beauty of sci-fi as an art form, and less as escapist entertainment. This is a must see for science fiction fans.",

In addition to Fritz Lang's 1927 classic `Metropolis,' Stanley Kubrick's `2001: A Space Odyssey' and the original `Planet of the Apes' epic released in 1968, `Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn' is a standout in the genre. The 23rd century-set adventures of the Federation Starship U.S.S. Enterprise - while often entertaining and insightful - rarely were displayed with the kind of cinematic greatness in 1982 under the capable direction of Nicholas Meyer. `The Wrath of Kahn' revisits a storyline that was started in the original 1960s television series (in the first season episode `Space Seed'), where the leader of a genetic super race of humans led by Khan (Ricardo Montalban) escapes from the dying world where he was left by James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and takes control of another Federation starship. Rather then flee, Khan decides to pursue a course of vengeance against Kirk and the Enterprise while also stealing a top-secret scientific project known as Project Genesis. The movie never falters, nor does this impressive Director's Edition of the classic first released in 1982. The print and sound featured on the 2003-issued Director's Edition DVD are wonderful, and the many insights into the production prove to be icing on the cake.

            "content": "The second spin off film from the Star Trek franchise famously dispensed with almost every facet and aspect of the critically and commercially underwhelming 'Star Trek The Motion Picture' and starts from an almost blank page.This certainly makes sense from both the studio's point of view, and those engages in writing and producing 'The Wrath of Khan'.Returning to an episode of the 1960's TV series was of course not a change of tack from the proceeding film which had strongly referenced the episode 'The Changeling'; in this movie however we get a frantic big screen, big bucks, sequel to 'Space Seed'.We must accept madness as a intellectual defect not eugenically removed from Khan as his obsession with revenge can be easily seen as an extension of his obsession to be the best and to beat Kirk would prove this. However Khan exhibits hysterical, neurotic and psychotic tendencies which far exceed a revenge motive, even a self-restoring one, and lead the film to forsake Shakespeare for Melville as a literary motif.This is like playing 'Johnny B. Goode' as a covers band: you feel that you have lost the audience and you are desperate to get them paying attention again so that some people get on the dance floor.Time and tide have not been kind to Khan. Don't really ask how. The writer won't answer you cus the writer doesn't care. It just is what it is. 'The Wrath of Khan' has a lot of this b-movie or pulp novel approach to plot and character behaviour, 'don't ask; it just is'.Khan has got an animal on his now otherwise desolate planet that fantastically allows him to control people. And he gains access to two senior command officers of a researching Star Ship. Which is researching for a top top top secret, immensely powerful federation research project. What a lot of coincidences and plot happenings already just in the set up. Want to ask how any of this makes sense. Ask anyone you like just now the writer. The writer is already checked out of this part. It's just priming the pump.The entirety of the film operates on this basis. A lot of superficial character work is layered on top of numerous plot ploys which replace a natural, or sensible, narrative of plot developments.Soap opera elements of unknown progeny and lost loves also clutter up a film that really wants to militarise and sensationalise Star Trek in a devoted, single minded detour from the unsuccessful first film.Almost 40 years later (as of March 2020.) this leaves 'The Wrath of Khan' as a well staged action adventurer with exaggerated and soap-ish characters.The acting is powerful but not always well advised. Certain cast members get almost no work to do.The positives involve a classy bit of funky space battling, the first battle being, I'd estimate deliberately, reminiscent of 'age of sail' broadside and false flag battle tactics and techniques. The second battle uses the fighting blind scenario to demonstrate that an experienced space captain has more tactical awareness than a Moby Dick obsessive from the late twentieth century.On a side note how convenient that this nebula was so close by, not to far but not too close and how odd that Khan didn't notice it and use his more manoeuvrable ship to command the route towards it once he realised that the Enterprise was less crippled than he had known....like any adept tactician would strive to. He is tame and reactive exactly when the script writers need him to be. And that nebula is the exact distance that the writers need it.Very neat and tidy. But if you don't pay any attention whatsoever to these plot ploys or to the \"Two dimensional thinking\", I mean Two dimensional soap opera characters, then this is a fun ride.Like an amusement park ride it has thrills and spills and ups the ante until the big finish and I've happily watched this film at least three times without being able to stomach the writing but just enjoying the show.It also initiates a trilogy of directly following films within the Star Trek film series so it's success was highly influencial within the franchise.One definite plot hole that exceeds simply \"neat and tidy\" or \"overly hopeful plotting\" is the inexplicable behaviour of Admiral Kirk in his response to the developing situation in the first encounter with USS Reliant. In this situation I have utter disbelief that Kirk would not have requested a full situation update on Genesis from his superiors even before the Enterprise, and by implication himself, has been ordered as the starship to respond, and certainly once he, as a flag officer, has been assigned to the mission. Therefore his surprise and negativity at the appearance of the Reliant when he knows that this is a Genesis related crises and he should know that the Reliant is the responsible starship for the project is literally incredible. He should therefore be more suspicions when encountering this one ship than almost any other ship one could imagine. For Kirk to head in, and for starfleet to let him, is a complete dereliction of duty and responsibility by both. Even over and above this Kirk has actually been told that the Enterprise is the only ship around. So that should immediately suggest that the Reliant is an unknown probable danger. Frankly, as this new approach to Star Trek in 'The Wrath of Khan' emphasises the militaristic aesthetic and function of starfleet then this film should end with a Court Martial of Kirk let alone Star Trek IV. However it doesn't because this is simply an overly convenient piece of script writing so severe as to be a straight up plot hole. In essence the audience is expected to know what Kirk doesn't know and thereby afford him a benefit of doubt that he can not possibly be sustained to actually have as his character experiencing the situation.I rate 5/10 for the effort and the adventure, with several highlights, and obviously it's essential viewing for any Star Trek fan, but it's writing is often simply silly.",

Goes by what made the original 1960s show popular among its legions of fans.  Unlike Star Trek:The Motion Picture(1979), ST2 is more focused on the human qualities of the story than in big budget special effects.  The crew led by The Next Generation cast has yet to make a ST film that's on the same level of human complexities and villainy as Star Trek 2(1982).  Is William Shatner's greatest acting performance in any motion picture he has appeared in.  Followup to an episode called \"SPACESEED\" which involved a group of super strong beings led by Khan who attempted to take control of the Starship Enterprise but failed and was sent to an planet as banishment.  In this film, Khan is bitter towards the former Captain now Admiral James T. Kirk thus plans to gain some bitter vegeance on the Admiral.  Terrific followup to Nicholas Meyer's underrated time travel gem, Time after Time(1979).  A Star Trek film that comes close to achieving the greatness of this film is Star Trek 6:The Undiscovered Country(1992).  The battle scenes are the best in the series and the different set pieces are impressive.  Leonard Nimoy steals the show with his humaine as ultimately tragic heroic turn as Captain Spock.

            "review_title": "The Best Of The Star Trek Films",
            "content": "(Note: Based on the Director's Edition version.)If Star Trek: The Motion Picture was the Star Trek film based more on the original TV series philosophical side, then the second would, perhaps, be considered the Star Trek film more in line with the action oriented side of the series. Yet while seeming to be action based, Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan would also have some of the series most dramatic moments as well. The result of this, in the hands of director Nicholas Meyer would be the best of the Star Trek films.To begin with the acting is pretty solid. The performances from the original series cast members are all well done especially int he cases of William Shatner, Loenard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly. In particular Shatner and Nimor get some fantastic scenes together including one of the best staged and moving farewell death scenes in film history (even if it is only temporary). Also of special mention is the performance of James Doohan whose performance gets some additional (and excellent) material in the director's edition DVD version. Plus there are also good performances from other cast members including Kirstie Alley in her film debut and Bibi Besch amongst others. Then there is the villain...Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan, in my opinion anyway, is one of the all time great film villain performances. While Montalban had made quite an impact with the character int he original 1967 TV episode that performance was just the tip of what this film would reveal to the character. It's a layered performance with echoes, both in writing and in performance, to characters like King Lear and Capatin Ahab as Khan is revealed to be more then a genetically engineered superman in exile but a man driven to vengeance at any cost (hence the title). Khan's face-off's with Kirk are pieces of acting that focus your attention onto him which is even more incredible considering that the two characters (and presumably the actors as well) never come face to face int he film but spend the entire film facing off against each other via screens and communicators. It speaks to the power of a performance when despite that fact, the villain comes across as a real and imposing threat to the film's other characters.The film's special effects also remain top notch. This film remains a prime example of the power of pre-CGI visual effects not only with ships in flight but with the still visually striking battle sequences and things like the Mutara Nebula sequence and the formation of the Genesis Planet. The film also makes nice reuses of some of the effects footage from the first Star Trek film as well which, for once in a case of footage reuse, doesn't make the film look cheap at all. All in all it's rather impressive material coming out of a film that is fast approaching its third decade of existence.If the success of this film can really be credited to any single person it would be Nicholas Meyer. Despite Jack B. Sowards and executive producer Harve Bennett being credited as the writers of Star Trek II it was Meyer who did the (uncredited) massive re-write that brought together the film as it is. Whiel the script is firm in placing the film into being a science fiction action film, the film also a philosophical side as well. yet unlike its predecessor, the second Star Trek film is philosophical not about what's out there but about the human condition as it covers (without hopefully sounding clich\u00e9) the full range of the human condition including the emotional need for revenge, youth, knowledge vs experience, aging, morality, regrets and, most famously, death. Perhpaos the greatest example of this is the films use of the opening and closing liens from Dickens A Tale Of Two Cities as effective bookends to the film. Meyer also makes use of the film's rather limited budget to effectively create a vision of life in the 23rd century and the result is that this film, perhaps more then any other of the Star Trek film, seems to occupy a real world thanks to Meyer's direction of people ranging from cinematographer Gayne Rescher to costume designer Robert Fletcher and the set designs of Joseph R. Jennings. Meyer proves that it is story, not just good effects, that makes good science fiction work.There is also the film's score. Then newcomer James Horner faced quite a challenge in trying to create a score that followed on from Jerry Goldsmith's masterpiece for Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Yet Horner proved up to the task with pieces such as his main title music, the theme of the Enterprising leaving space dock (which reused the same footage that Goldsmith had scored to in Star Trek: The Motion Picture), the battle in the Mutara Nebula and the film's emotional finale. Whiel ti may lack the sound of the size of orchestra that Goldsmtih had Horner's score still has the power to add great emotional nd tension to any scene it accompany. Indoing so, Horner kicked off a career that continues to this very day.Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan is the best of the Star Trek films. Why you may ask? Well with fine performances, a great villain, impressive special effects, a nice script, the direction of Nicholas Meyer and a score by James Horner it what every Trek film has had to live up to. It is a film that is as much about the human condition as it is about action and is all the better for it. That's why it is.",

            "content": "I can't really call this a sequel to the first Star Trek film of '79, more like a restart, with this forming the 1st part of an informal trilogy culminating with the 4th film. This is actually a sequel to the original series episode \"Space Seed,\" featuring the return of Khan, Kirk's best villain. Contrary to the previous film, where the filmmakers did everything they could to distance themselves from the original show, here they did a complete turnabout: picking a specific episode to base the new film on. They also followed the excellent pacing and action aspects of the best episodes; this film moves, the equivalent of a great page-turner of a novel. It's about a dozen years after the end of the 1st film and 15 years after Kirk had marooned Khan and his 70 followers on a primitive planet. Kirk has many regrets by the time this film is over. He and all his usual top officers (except Chekov) accompany a bunch of young cadets on a routine training mission aboard the aging Enterprise. Chekov, meanwhile, is now 1st officer aboard the starship Reliant; he and his captain make the mistake of beaming down, unknowingly, to Khan's home planet. Only about 20 of these genetically-enhanced supermen are left, but it's enough for them to take over the Reliant. And that's how a rip-roaring space epic of revenge and rebirth takes off.Credit must go to director Meyer and Producer Bennett for taking the best elements of the original series, grafting on some potent themes to reflect the passage of a decade or two, and fusing these into a thoroughly exciting adventure. It's adventure on the high seas, transplanted to outer space. Kirk begins to feel old age creeping up on him here and his lack of active field duty shows when he gets caught off-guard by Khan, resulting in some dreadful damage to our beloved starship. But, like two old warhorses who don't know when to quit, he and the Enterprise soldier on. Meyer lent a decidedly militaristic flavor to Starfleet here, a reversal on the laid back atmosphere of the 1st film (maybe, after the threat of V'Ger, Starfleet went all military). It's appropriate, as we have some lengthy battles in outer space in this one, more so than most episodes or the other films. Shatner does a terrific job of capturing some of Kirk's finest moments here, a middle-aged but still formidable captain (well, technically, he's an admiral now). Spock appears to have embraced the human half of his template, almost mocking the logical side of his character at times. Kelley as McCoy gets some of the best lines, as usual, and delivers them with old-style panache.And then we have Montalban as Khan. If you plug in a fantastic villain such as this into a movie and then have the actor exceed expectations, the job's pretty much half done already - you've got the makings of a great story. Khan seethes with mania and superhuman determination, and Montalban electrifies the screen, much as he did in the original episode. Meyer was fond of having him quote passages from Melville's \"Moby Dick\" and here it works beautifully, right to the bitter end. Some of the scenes, as a result of all this, make a very strong impression - a grandly tragic epic feel; check out the one where Khan orders Kirk's death and the immediate aftermath. It's an instant classic and simply unforgettable. This also benefited from the screen debut of actress Alley, who brings an exotic flavor to her part. This isn't perfect: the other regulars, except Koenig, are given short shrift, due to so many new characters. Beside the ones mentioned, there's also Kirk's old flame and his son, as well as another captain. On a larger scale, this kind of plot regrettably established a pattern that removed any possibility of returning to the theme of exploration, the key to the original series. Instead, it's caught up with the more mundane human trademarks of intrigue, chases & battles, and some politics, a trend to continue in most of the films. Although, there is the introduction of an incredible new technology, the Genesis effect, and a rather shocking climax for the Trek fans. They got pretty much everything right here; this one would be hard to beat. Followed directly by \"The Search For Spock.\"",

            "content": "Star Trek II is not only for me my favourite Star Trek film, but it is by far my favourite Sci-Fi movie, combining Shakespearian acting with a complicated story of revenge as well as adding top of the range special effects (for the time) and a soundtrack that continues to be one of my favourite film scores!The film begins in space as a Vulcan Lieutenant named Saavik takes charge of a starship. Upon receiving a distress signal from a cargo freighter, Lieutenant Saavik orders their craft into an area known as the Neutral Zone, whereupon they are attacked and nearly destroyed by a group of Clingon Vessels. It is revealed however that this is all a Training Simulator overseen by Admiral Kirk. Kirk is starting to feel blue as his age is now starting to dictate whether or not he can still command a starship, and this is starting to show on the crew. Meanwhile, the Starship Reliant is on a mission to locate a barren planet upon which they can test 'Genisis', a device that plans to create life on dead worlds by reorganising matter on a molecular level. Commander Chekov and Captain Terral beam down to a barren desert planet with violent storms known as Seti Alpha VI. After coming across a group of Cargo Bays, Chekov is distressed by the sight of the ship's name 'Botany Bay', but before the pair can escape they are captured by a group of men led by the sinister Khan. Khan reveals to them that the planet they are on is Seti Alpha V and that due to the explosion of it's sister planet, the orbit has been knocked irreparably off balance and all that was once luscious has been obliterated. Khan, now feeling betrayed by Kirk for the events that took place 15 years earlier during the original series, plans revenge for the death of his wife. To do this, he places mind controlling bugs into the ears of Chekov and Terral so that they will become his loyal servants. Meanwhile, Kirk and the Crew of the Enterprise prepare to head out on a training mission. However the mission is called off when Kirk's estranged wife, Dr. Marcus, sends him a message saying that the Genisis project is being taken from their test satellite, Regula 1, by the Reliant with no authorisation. The group then make their way to the Satellite but come across the Reliant en route. Unaware that it has been hijacked by the evil Khan and his band of genetically engineered soldiers, Kirk keeps his shields down believing it to be a friendly ship. Now in range, Khan blasts the Enterprise mercilessly with fasers, leaving the vessel short on power. Moments later he reveals himself to Kirk over the Comm Screen, and demands the surrender of the Enterprise and the surrender of all data regarding project Genisis. Kirk uses the time given to gather the data to instead hack into the Reliant's computer and lower their shields so that the Enterprise can retaliate. After receiving several hits from the Enterprise, the Reliant retreats back into space. Repairing what damage they can, Kirk and the Enterprise proceed to Regula 1. What will they find at Regula 1? Can they stop Khan from stealing the Genisis Device? How will Kirk be able to stop his Genetically Engineered Nemisis? Only the movie gives you the answer...What can I say? It is a fantastic film, and still one of my favourites! The acting, the special effects, the character development, the story and of course the soundtrack are just unbelievable! I recommend it to one and all, be you Trekkies or not, this film will have you sitting on the edge of your seat the entire way!",

And in the end, the film was a box-office disaster trying more so to come off like 20001 a space odyssey focusing more on the visuals and effects while having a very sub-par story with terrible pacing. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan manages to bring that audience back to the theater and continue the original series legacy to reveal more films. It returns more to formula feeling more like a star trek episode up on the big screen offering a more concrete story with the return of an original villain from the series and delivery of an adventure. A simple revenge story after being exiled for 15 years Khan returns to seek revenge on Kirk with the use of terraforming devices. A simple plot, but it never really feels empty its well paced that it keeps the plot going, and when the action happens it holds more weight because of that. The dialogue between the crew watching McCoy and Spock bickering. The presence that Kan has with just the abab obsession he has towards Kirk. The treat feels real even though Kirk & Khan are never in the same room together. There are Casualties the Genesis Devices.",

Trek, Space Seed.There is trouble going on in the galaxy again, and who best to solve it but Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest. Walter (Chekov) Koenig, Paul Winfield, and others go to a planet where there is a disturbance and they meet up with Khan (Ricardo Montalban). This was the planet that Khan and Kirk agreed that he would be allowed to populate with his \"superpeople\" 15 years earlier (at the end of the \"Space Seed\" episode, Kirk wonders what would grow from Khan's world. Well, he's about to find out!). Sadly, it worked out badly for Khan and his followers, and he sends Koenig and Winfield back with the message that he is going to get his revenge on The U.S.S. Enterprise and Earth with his stolen Genesis destruction device. So it's time for the older, but wiser crew to put a stop to this.Much like a classic episode of Trek, you'll see all the great qualities that make Star Trek a favorite: great dialogue, superb intrigue, and even better, William Shatner tones down his overacting schtick for once. A superb film, although not an all-time classic, but a great science-fiction flick.",

            "content": "I've seen \"The Wrath of Khan\" on about 20 different occasions, and dammit, Kirk NEVER gets those shields up in time!Kirk's blunder typifies \"The Wrath of Khan\"'s realistic, gritty and almost wholly unique approach to \"Star Trek\"; the near-perfect Captain Picard never makes such a colossal mistake in the later films.  \"Khan\" is all about mistakes, and aging, and the dangers of becoming obsolete; Kirk feels as though he's had his day, and at the start of the film he's actually eager to pass the baton to a young trainee crew.  And yet the series continued for four more films' worth of aging!Often cited as the best film in the series, \"Khan\" is undeniably exciting, but because it's so distinct, I have to say that it doesn't quite feel like \"Star Trek\" to me.  There's an emphasis on military tactics and action that doesn't blend well with the pacifism and allegory of \"Trek\" as a whole. Montalban, though delightful, is undeniably hammy, and the studio-bound sets look, frankly, pretty ugly.  The much-maligned \"Star Trek V\" is actually closer in tone and \"look\" to the original series - and it's interesting to note that my two roommates, relative newcomers to the world of sci-fi, saw no appreciable difference in quality between that film and \"Khan.\"Don't misunderstand me - I'm not trying to bury \"Khan\" here - but I do think it's worth challenging the notion that it's the best one in the series. Yes, the film does introduce an interesting moral debate centered around the Genesis device; however, that debate has virtually nothing to do with the plot, which concerns the Enterprise limping to safety after a surprise attack.  Khan's plans for the Genesis device are never really explained.  In fact, the otherwise talkative villain never even expresses an opinion about the device!Despite these criticisms, \"Khan\" is still a standout movie, thanks to a beautiful music score and one of the most moving death scenes ever filmed (the mere presence of a partition between Kirk and Spock is heartbreaking). Shatner gives an emotionally charged, powerful performance, exploding the claim that his overacting ruined his credibility.  The space battles are interesting and easy to follow; I appreciate that \"Star Trek\" always takes pains to define the rules of its ship-to-ship contests, whereas \"Star Wars\" merely throws a bunch of whiz-bangy effects at its audience and never explains anything (except that every Imperial ship has an easy-to-destroy reactor at its core). I still maintain that later films improved on \"Khan.\"  I'm glad that this movie dispelled the boredom and listlessness of the first entry in the series, but \"The Undiscovered Country\" is undeniably more of a \"Star Trek\" movie because it deals with political and moral issues in a more sophisticated matter.  Maybe \"Khan\" is the best-made of the \"Trek\" movies, but it is not the most representative of the strengths that typically make \"Star Trek\" so great.",

However, I connected to this movie on a level that transcends fandom, because it genuinely is one of the best movies of its time and one of the best science fiction films I've ever seen.The plot picks up a few decades after TOS, still in the 23rd century, and you still have the same main characters, but they're all much older and they're going through their 'midlife crisis', to put it mildly. Kirk has been promoted to Admiral and is no longer doing what he likes best - captaining a starship and going where no man has gone before. McCoy is a teacher, and Spock has been promoted to the captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Kirk literally loves the Enterprise as he would love a friend, and you can see his attachment to it and his utter disdain for having been promoted and been required to leave what he loves to do. Bones McCoy is there to hammer the point home to his face, telling him that he's not doing what he should be doing very early in the film. It's brutal, but very much the truth.So he goes out for a romp of sorts. He takes the opportunity to \"oversee\" the new crew on a mission. Meanwhile though, Khan Noonien Singh, a genetically modified tyrant whom Kirk left stranded on a planet, has grown bitter and angry at the death of his wife and for the nasty circumstances he's been left in, and takes the opportunity to hijack a ship and steal a device capable of creating a new world - the Genesis project. He confronts Kirk, and they play a game of space chicken that would leave even the most disconnected viewer cringing with fear and anticipation.The small things about this film are what really make it so great. Khan, played by Ricardo Montalban, is one of the best villains of his time. He's not just a megalomaniac, he's genuinely evil, sadistic, and intelligent, and has a desire for revenge transcending any rationality. He throws around his worshipful subordinates, and quotes Ahab wherever he gets the chance, because he really, truly *is* deranged. And yet, instead of being cheesy, he's a true screen presence. The old saying that any film is as good as its villain applies here, very strongly and very true. Montalban MAKES this film what it is.The biggest element of the story, Spock's sacrifice, also goes a long way to making this one of the most poignant stories about ST out there. It's by far a recommended viewing for anyone, Trekkie or not, and appeals to emotion and to reason, whichever suits your fancy.",

Maybe it's because it was made by people who weren't really fans of the show giving it a new edge. Whatever the reason, this is hands down the best Star Trek film, and a sequel to one of the series' best episodes 'Space Seed.' It features a larger-than-life merry villain, a not overacting Shatner, and Nimoy and Kelley doing their best acting since the series.The plot of the film involves Khan who has escaped planet exile and stolen a Starship to gain revenge on a now desk bound and bored Admiral Kirk. Along the way, Khan learns of a revolutionary gadget that can transform dead moons into new planets called Genesis, and steals it in his quest to kill Kirk. With the Enterprise heavily damaged and Kirk in battle, it's down to Spock to save the day by making the ultimate sacrifice.The plot is edge-of-your-seat stuff and the film can be watched loads of times without someone getting bored.

            "content": "\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" is an excellent \"Star Trek\" picture. This is the one that started the tradition of the even numbered \"Star Trek\" movies as the best in the series. The first film (odd numbered) left most people, especially Trekkies, unsatisfied. Many people say \"Star Trek II\" is the best in the series. To me, \"Star Trek II\" is the third best, behind \"Star Trek IV\" and \"Star Trek VI\" and just ahead of \"Star Trek VIII\" (First Contact). I wouldn't quarrel over anyone who says this is the best one in the series because I agree it's a very good movie. I just liked the fourth and sixth films better. \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" is not only a sequel to \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" but it's also a sequel to an episode of the TV series. In 1967, an episode called \"Space Seed\" aired and Ricardo Montalban guest starred as the villainous Khan. 15 years later, while currently starring on the popular TV show \"Fantasy Island\", Montalban took the time to reprise his guest starring role from that \"Star Trek\" episode in \"Star Trek II\". And what a performance! Montalban's Khan is the best villain in the \"Star Trek\" movie series to date, and none of the other villains in the following films have topped him (Christopher Plummer's General Chang came the closest in \"Star Trek VI\", followed by Alice Krige's Borg Queen in \"Star Trek: First Contact\"). The story of \"Star Trek II\" has Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and the rest of the Enterprise crew encountering Khan and his crew of baddies when Khan gets a hold of a science project known as Genesis. Plus, Khan seeks revenge on Kirk. Genesis is a project created by an old flame of Kirk's. This woman, Dr. Carol Marcus (the late Bibi Besch), also has a son who's father just happens to be Kirk. The Enterprise crew comes in and tries to save the day by battling Khan which leads to some very exciting moments. And there's no doubt that at the time this movie came out alot of moviegoers (especially Trekkies hungry for another sequel) were totally shocked at what happens to a major character late in the film. It's a moment that has to be seen to believed and I couldn't believe it either. \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" is a whole lot of fun. It's got action, humor, and much better special effects than in the first movie. And it has good performances. The regulars: Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koenig, George Takei, and Nichelle Nichols are fine as usual, but the only thing that keeps \"Star Trek II\" from being the best movie in the series is that the supporting regulars (Scotty, Chekov, Sulu, and Uhura) aren't quite as well-written as they were in parts 4 and 6. But that's only a very small quarrel. Kirstie Alley (TV's \"Cheers\") made her film debut here as Vulcan Lt. Saavik, and she's terrific. She's come a long way since this film was made nearly two decades ago. \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" is a sci-fi adventure that's worth multiple viewings. ***1/2 (out of four)",

I am not an entirely huge Sci-Fi fan, so I don't believe that this opinion can be explained away as geeking (though I do geek over Star wars--never trust my opinions there).  What warrants Star Trek 2's inclusion into the pantheon?  Themes.  The themes (life/death, age and usefulness, friendship and sacrifice, destiny, revenge) in the film are so richly developed and the character development so strong (somehow showing new sides of characters that had already been well-developed over the course of 15 or so years).  And Star Trek 2 is one of the only films I have ever seen that uses other works (Tale of Two Cities and Moby Dick) to the benefit of the film and not as a crutch.  And the symbolism!!!  Don't get me wrong--I'm not saying that the metaphors were very complex but they certainly were rich.  Genesis being the ultimate force of both creation and destruction at the same time.  The journey of details like the glasses, which are silly but add reality to the story.  Acting from William Shatner that truly is subtle!  And a true weight of friendship expressed.  I don't believe that I have ever seen friendship that was as believable as that shown between Spock and Jim, Bones and Jim.  A sacrifice felt.  I love that. I love that Spock's sacrifice is felt as a sacrifice--actually FELT as a sacrifice and not just reported.  And yet he makes this sacrifice willingly. I think about this often, placing myself in spock's shoes.  If I were with a group of 300 people and one of us could die to save the rest and no one were to volunteer, could I do it?  Knowing that I would die anyways but that my death would save the rest--the logical decision is to volunteer--I'm dead either way, but I could never do it.  Could you? And the ingenuity!  This was a cat and mouse game that all viewers get behind because the stakes are real always and the deft manipulations in the chase seem plausible yet brilliant.  For example, the access codes.  I buy the idea of an access code.  The access codes are not a classic star Trek introduction of some new experimental and untested technology to save the day.  And the nebula--I buy that, too.  But these tricks just serve to even out sany advantage, constantly bringing the playing field back to level, so that, in the end, it's one crew against the other, trying to out-think each other and only the most cunning will be the victor. And lastly, this film set the thematic arc for the rest of the series.  Can one outlive his usefulness?  How do adventurers go to be grandparents?  What does one do when a life's purpose fades into the recesses?A beautiful film.  That can be experienced infinitely and always gain flavor. Thank you.",

However, it succeeds in spite of these issues, and not only on a camp level. With a genuinely moving ending, Star Trek II moves past its humorous flaws to provide an entertaining film.Let's get the campy parts out of the way first. This film has some genuine clunkers for dialogue, not the least the infamous \"Khaaaan!!!\" scene. Furthermore, it is a veritable orgy of scenery chewing, with William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban overacting hilariously, to the point that they crowd out most of the cast. The central macguffin of the movie, the Genesis device, is scientifically implausible even by Star Trek standards, and its method of operation is inconsistent throughout the movie. (Through most of the film, the device only creates conditions necessary for life to flourish, which has to be transplanted to the planet. At the end of the film, the device appears to actually create life forms.)In a sense, these issues embody all that fans love and hate about the Star Trek franchise. On one hand, it is fun to watch with both intentional and unintentional humor. On the other hand, Kirk and Spock, along with Khan in the film, crowd out the other characters. This is an issue notable in other Star Trek franchises, particularly Voyager.However, the climax and the ending, if rather drawn out, make it come together. They inject a level of sadness and tragedy into the film that are unexpected and, frankly, undeserved. Although the following sequels undermine this pathos (and Star Trek: Nemesis blatantly rips it off), it is still moving.",

Ricardo Montalban was able to infuse the character of Khan with the madness that only comes from his \"genetically superior mind\" being forced to survive in a world that he could not conquer.

However, this leads to a dramatic confrontation with Kirk's old nemesis, Khan, who has been exiled for many years on the barren planet Alpha Ceti V. Khan is bent upon revenge and also getting his hands on the Genesis device, a potentially dangerous weapon. This poses a threat to scientists working on this Genesis project, including Kirk's long lost love, Dr. Carol Marcus. (This is all Star Trek, by the way. Don't get your theology from it. In fact, it teaches a lesson about the dangers of trying to fool around with creation!) Ricaro Montalban makes Khan a formidable, vengeful, and memorable villain. Kristie Alley portrays quite convincingly a new Trek character, a Vulcan commander called Lieutenant Saavik. Wonderful acting and interactions as usual for Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, and all the other now aging Enterprise crew members (Scotty, Chekov, Sulu, and Uhura) have much their typically great characters.The whole concept of having Khan resurface is clever, although his TOS episode Space Seed wasn't particularly one of my favorites. Of course there are the typical engrossing space battles as well as great special effects, which is practically all the first Star Trek movie, The Motion Picture had going for it. Unfortunately, no interesting aliens here, only the villainous Khan. However, the portrayal of Kirk's somewhat disillusioned aging process is well captured. Also, needless to say, the entire plot line regarding his old love and his discovery that he has a grown son, David, certainly make for a dramatic tale.Of course the ending is a legend in Trek circles. Spock's tremendous sacrifice to save the Enterprise and her crew from certain disaster must be one of the most immortal death scenes in all cinema...his unforgettable speech about the needs of the many outweighing that of the one, and Kirk's grief at losing his longtime friend. My tears were falling long before Spock's torpedo casket was fired off into space!It's a Star Trek masterpiece, and a highly entertaining, gripping, and dramatic work of science fiction in general that can be enjoyed even by those who are not normally Trek fans.",

            "content": "I was not an overly big fan of Star Trek as a child. Growing up in Australia, I fell under the spell of Doctor Who and could not quite find a cool looking space ship quite as exciting as a magic blue box. I did end up enjoying the Next Generation, though it was never must see TV for me. Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan did however make me a fan of the film franchise after an underwhelming opening in The Motion Picture.The Wrath of Khan is a grown up story, it fleshes out the character of Khan, brought to life by a well calculated performance from Ricardo Montalban including moments of quiet menace, calm intelligence, sadistic evil and never far from bat sh-t crazy, and his motives far better than any other villain in the series.While the Klingons and Borg are good enemies, Khan works because he is just one man being driven by motives you can believe a man can be driven by, and the power he has at his disposal, combined with his intelligence and lack of restraint, makes him a very dangerous and believable threat indeed.The film continues to develop the dynamic between Kirk, Spock and Bones that is the real driving force behind the film series. Shatner, Nimoy and Kelly are all on form, apart from one infamous moment of unrestrained silliness from Shatner, shouting out \"KHAAAAN!\" like he is passing a kidney stone that's inspired many a youtube montage and was even referenced in the later reboot Star Trek: into Darkness.Montalban stars as Khan, a super intelligent, super strong humanoid looking war criminal who was left on the moon years earlier by Kirk to give him and the rest of his equally strong and intelligent crew a second chance at life. However, there was no life on the planet and so Khan and his buddies have been living a decidedly second rate existence, with Khan blaming Kirk and becoming increasingly off his rocker over the decades that pass. When Chekov stumbles upon Khan's ship, the evil Mexican hatches a plan to both escape this desolate hell hole and take his revenge on Kirk.Once the script gets Kirk and Khan where it wants them, a chase ensues, and eventually a tactical battle to the death between the two men eventuates with Spock forced to make ultimate sacrifice, the ship's crew blasting his body into space in memoriam at film's end. Kirk and Spock's final goodbye is a scene that can make a grown man weep.Before this though we are introduced to the Kobayashi Maru simulation for the first time (apologies to Trekkies if it was first mentioned in the original television series), a no-win scenario that becomes such a key part of Star Trek lore. We are also introduced to the Genesis project which drives the third film, which is overseen by Kirk's former lover and their son. This is the one that really sets up the rest of the film series. We are also introduced to Lt Saavik, a female Vulcan (Kirstie Alley in her first film role). Moreso than any of the other movies this is so much more than a movie length Star Trek episode. While the first film delivered the box office receipts to show there was a big screen audience for Star Trek, this one delivered the story, the sets and the script to indicate that Star Trek films could actually be not just accessible to a wider audience but could actually be good in their own right. If you only ever watch one of the original Star Trek films, make sure it's this one.",

The friendship among the crew and the quips that they spark are catchy enough for man or woman. When Kirk hears that his old nemesis, Khan, is still alive, he's shocked. But, when Khan learns that Kirk is still alive, he's livid. Ready to avenge the very one who tried to attempt mutiny on the Enterprise, Khan attempts a dastardly deed. Again, a must see!

Each of the Star Trek films has had something to commend it, and while like many people I liked some more than others, I do not subscribe to the even numbers great, odd numbers suck school. One of the things which put such stress on all of the Star Trek films was the pressure of George Lucas' space fantasy \"Star Wars\" which despite all the big bucks spent on it had its ups and downs also. Having said that, this story was well done, and for those who wanted more action in their Trek, it was certainly here. I admit that William Shatner's performance here was certainly one of his finest, but that just goes to show what a good script will do. It was nice to see most of the original cast back (where did Dr. Chapel go, after being established in STTMP?)I did get the feeling that Paul Winfield's character was cheated a bit. He is a starship captain, after all and very few men achieve that, and yet he is easily taken and used by Khan. I had a little problem with that. And I admit, after the Spock death scene, I like many others were ready to string up the nearest Paramount film executive. My one biggest complaint was with the sound score. I have come to appreciate the music of Jammes Horner, but it would have been better to have kept the Goldsmith main theme as a link to all of the films. Nick Meyers did a credible job of directing this film, and all in all it was a good Star Trek feature.",

This guy may be one of the few people who can actually save the current Star Trek franchise - they should give him complete control over the next film - I'm sure he'd even be able to make a great film out of Enterprise and resurrect the franchise as he did with Wrath of Kahn in 1982.Great film for Treekies and Non-Trekkies, in fact it's simply the best!",

            "content": "When Star Trek was originally created as a pilot it was meant to be a space western. But the actual story created by Gene Roddenberry was very different and more military. It would never have made it except for one thing, it created the feeling for one the TV execs of what it would really be like on a space ship.For me, no other movie has ever really created the same feel of space combat as this movie. Taking up a plot from the TV series, a genetic super warrior Khan and his follows capture a spaceship (and put a ugly little bug in Chekov's ear) and set out to find Captain (now Admiral) Kirk for a bit of revenge.Kirk is currently cruising around the galaxy with a young training crew and most of the good old boys and girls from the TV series.What unfolds is a battle between these two ships, a great duel. I love these sort of war stories, where 2 evenly matched enemies must try and outwit each other, but it is rarely seen on film.The result is a tense action drama which reflects more closely the reality of space combat than Starwars of later Star trek movies. Of course Kirk wins in the end, but the ending is bitter sweet.It also works on many other different levels. For example Kirk used to travel around the galaxy defeating all sorts of enemies and aliens, but also getting the girls. In this movie you see the consequences of this when he meets the son he never knew he had.There is the military side of things, as well as Kirk's famous approach to breaking the rules which makes impossible something that is something he has never dealt with (one of the best parts of the movie for me as I teach creativity). Kirk's greatest weapon is his mind.There is the enemy you can respect. Khan is a cruel warrior, he is motivated by revenge, but he also has a fierce love of his people.There is also the balance of life versus death. Genesis can destroy all life on a planet or create new life (or both if you choose).See it, love it, and see it because it was the first movie to use fractal computer graphics (during the genesis sequence).",

            "content": "I really think that this is a good film, and though i had heard a lot about this installment of the Trek series a very long time ago, i've never thought in watching it before i started to like the reboots of the Treks films, which i found to be excellent of course. So yeah, the 'reboots' brought me to watch this so called and acclaimed one of the best Star Trek films ever. Well, i can't say that I am disappointed: i expected exactly what it showed to be: an entertaining and good film.I can see there is really a lot of things that Into the Darkness used as an main source material to base it's new story. Kahn in this film is a very hot-head guy, who just wants to prove that he is 'better' than Kirk, and he really does everything he can trying to destroy Kirk. I really liked that impulsive characteristic in Kahn, something that isn't explored in the reboot. It turns him in a completely new character, and his existence seems divided by the great irony of having at the same time an irrational and a completely brilliant mind. A good depth added about this character, for sure. But Kahn is far from being a 100% convincing villain: what i really disliked about this Kahn was his visual: he is just too weird and is too androgenic to be taken serious. Sometimes i couldn't help but laugh at him and his Thundercat visual.But yeah, the plot is indeed interesting, it treats about Kahn craziness and his insane acts only done to reach an apparently absurd objective, and also treats about delicate subjects such as death and the age of the characters, something that have never been taught before in a Trek film. Though, these subjects are not told in such a superb way as in Into the Darkness, with exception of the talk about 'growing old', which is not taught in the reboot due to obvious reasons.I also liked the score/music theme of this version. The cinematography is pretty simple, despite some interesting outside space visuals. The FX is too outdated, and this fact inevitably prejudices any film. Still, there is some semi-convincing moments that may be worth...or not. It just depends on how you analyzes the CGI in films.Recommended, after all. 7.6/10",

Kirk (William Shatner). Along the way, we are introduced to the Genesis Project, a device that can terraform planets but also comes with the side effect of wiping existing life, which Khan intends to use as a weapon to destroy Kirk.Classic revenge story. The bad guy will stop at nothing to destroy the man who punished him. This movie will be a lot more enjoyable to those who have watched the aforementioned \"Space Seed\", and it also wouldn't hurt to watch a few of the more highly regarded episodes of the TV series for character familiarization. A very good ending to this one too. Shatner is Shatner though; he overdoes himself as always but it does make for some entertaining and unintentionally funny moments.Trekkies already heap tons of praise on this one, so I doubt there's one who hasn't seen it. For those interested in the franchise, better starting off points would be the TV shows. The movies don't really do a whole lot to make newbies comfortable. That said, once you have a little bit of \"Trek\" viewing under your belt, \"The Motion Picture\" can easily be skipped over for this much better second attempt at adapting the beloved science-fiction franchise to the big screen.",

Now, its quite dated, but that's not so important.What is important: the metaphor is structured in very clever way: it's all about the triumph of the cinematic Trek over the 'two-dimensional thinking' of the TV based Trek -- referenced directly in the narrative.And the allusions to 'antiquities' are well done. \"Moby Dick\" figures prominently.

Since so many other reviews have mentioned all the good parts, I thought I'd concentrate on the drawbacks (the few). It's unfortunate that Khan and Kirk don't get to actually appear in any scenes together. Also, the basic premise is a little weak -- Khan's people were decimated because of a natural disaster, not anything Kirk did. His chief sin was not checking on their progress, as Khan said. Seems that's a little wimpy for somebody like Khan who was used to being self reliant. And I always thought they kind of let it get away, that Khan had great ambition and ability and at the end of \"Space Seed\" he was going to cut out a new civilization and empire out of the wilderness. He was looking forward to it, in fact, hence the quote from Milton. In the movie, he's been reduced to a rag tag desert dweller. And it really made very little sense that they were looking for a totally dead planet to experiment with Genesis on (seems like those would be a dime a dozen--we've got eight or so in our own solar system, not counting moons). But then they totally miss in their scans of Ceti Alpha all those humans walking around -- and the little creatures as well, which we have to assume were plentiful enough to eat, but if not, what have all of Khan's crew been eating for all that time. And didn't it strike anyone as weird that most of Khan's people looked as if they were in their twenties and thirties, when they had been stranded for fifteen years, the math doesn't add up quite right--they'd either be in their forties or barely fifteen. I never bought the Checkhov thing, meaning sure he wasn't in the Space Seed episode, but he might have been elsewhere on the ship so that Khan might have recognized him (he has a superior intellect after all). But fifteen years or no, would Checkhov really forget being to the Ceti Alpha system entirely and plopping Khan down on one of the planets? Yet when he sees \"Botany Bay\" he's searching his memory for it, as if that's the first time he's thought about it. And wouldn't anyone notice an entire planet blowing up? Maybe it was a remote system, but you'd think the number of planets in it would be a pretty basic thing to know since Kirk had been there fifteen years before charting new territory and all. And exactly why does that little creature crawl out of Checkhov after Paul Winfield kills himself? That's never really explained very well, it's supposed to be wrapped around the cerebral cortex after all, not just wandering around inside Pavel's head. Anyway, these are all kind of picking nits, it's still an outstanding movie, in some ways I wish it had been different.",

As you can imagine, we were and still are serious about all things Trek. I remember every moment of this film. The characters that were new blended with our old friends seamlessly. Ricardo Montalban recreated his role from the original series with astonishing voracity. All of our old friends were more seasoned, and seeing them again after the debacle that was Star Trek: The Motion Picture (ST:TMP) was like letting out a breath that you had been holding.\"Don't mince words, Bones. Tell me what you really think.\" William Shatner nailed the movie version of his old friend for the first time here. His discussions with Carol Marcus - his old flame, the interaction with his son, the discussion of retiring with McCoy, his discomfort at taking the ship from Spock and his explanation of his solution for the Kobiashi Maru - all of these moments make this film a masterpiece of storytelling. True, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was a more commercial success, mostly because it held us as a story for non-Trek fans. But for the faithful, this movie was a apt apology for ST:TMP.\"I have been and always shall be, your friend.\" Finally, the death of Spock shows a range of emotion by Leonard Nimoy and Shatner that has rarely been duplicated on film. Spock sacrifices himself for the ship. Spock: \"Don't grieve Admiral. It is logical. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\" Kirk: \"Or the one.\" I knew it was going to happen and still I wept openly and could not stop. For some generations that defining moment on film is Ilsa and Rick at the airport in Cassablanca. Still others remember Marlon Brando yelling \"Stella\" in \"Streetcar Named Desire.\" Or it could be the death of Old Yeller. Or maybe is Kevin Costner playing catch with his dad in \"Field of Dreams.\" For me it will always be Spock slumping against the chamber tube as he gives up his life and Kirk his voice breaking simply saying \"No!\" That, my friends, is movie magic!",

When I came to my senses and bought a VCR, and when I eventually upgraded to DVD, well you can guess the rest.  I watched the Director's Edition DVD just before writing this comment to refresh my memory.  This movie still does not fail to disappoint and still holds up after 21 years. This movie felt like Star Trek in a way that none of the others has ever been able to duplicate.  It had all the elements that made The Motion Picture feel less like Star Trek and more like just another Sci Fi movie: McCoy and Spock bantering back and forth as they echoed what was going on in Kirk's head, action and plenty of it, and most of all a conflict that was more than a \"space-happy robot\".  Although you knew Kahn had to be defeated, you could feel the pain of loss and abandonment that he felt.  The interplay between William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban is absolutely electric, despite the fact that they never meet in person.  Kirstie Alley is magnificent as Saavik in her first movie role, and the source of a young adult crush.  The only shame was that she never played the role again. The late DeForest Kelley became \"Bones\" with ease this time, not showing any of the forced character elements that most of the cast displayed in the first movie.  His best moment comes in a deleted scene, restored in the Director's Edition in sickbay tending to a dying crewman.  All of the principle cast fell into their roles as if they were still doing the series and the newcomers complemented them beautifully.  This is definitely a 10 out of 10.",

What if they got shot out of nowhere? 8) When Khan is beaming up the genesis, the Star Trek crew has a good 15 seconds to move that out of the way. Instead, Kirk yells \"Khan!\" for 15 seconds. 9) What was Khan's plan with the genesis? How would he even know how to use it?Bad Acting-wise:1) Chekov and that black guy. Especially, the black guy when he is resisting killing Kirk. 2) Khan is hokey a lot of the time. 3) People saying their last words, then dying. 4) Kirk's yelling of \"Khan!\" was as bad as Darth Vader yelling \"No!\" in Episode III.",

Better look, better story, better effects, better action, better emotion, etc etc.I love watching this movie. It makes me cry every time and it's so pretty flawlessly put together and told that it's just a joy to watch. Since we saw the first movie so recently as well, I noticed this time how many shots were stolen from The Motion Picture - the Klingon cruisers during the Kobayashi Maru and a lot of the space dock shots.It has a few minor faults. For example, why are they so nervous about Saavik taking the ship out of dry dock? Is it that hard or dangerous ... 'cos it doesn't look it. And why does the slug bug decide to just make an exit from Chekov's ear? All accounts were that they burrowed in there and grew until the host went mad and died!I also don't think Kirstie Alley was great as Saavik. Robin Curtis was much better. And this movie - or maybe this director - shows that William Shatner is a sneaky good actor as well.The showdown between Kirk's Enterprise and Khan's reliant is so so good. Then of course the death of Spock is just heart-wrenching ... from the moment Kirk's told that he better get down to Engineering and he looks over at Spock's empty seat. Gets me reaching for the tissue every time.Easily still the best of all the Trek movies after 40 years and handfuls of other movies (although First Contact gives it a run for it's money).96/100.",

Basic problem with the series is that it limits it scope by always having to be tied to the \"Federation\" especially a ship and its crew. They are all obviously written to appeal to no more then a 10 year olds intelligence level.I can ONLY recall a couple episodes that perhaps stand out (God knows I have NOT seen them all - I quit wasting my time years ago) - \"Arena\" and \"Doomsday Machine (was that the title?). Arena astounded me as it is based on my favorite S-F short story by my favorite author...IF YOU WANT AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT REAL SCI-FI IS LIKE, READ IT SOMETIME AND IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE FILMED EXACTLY AS WRITTEN.Roddenberry tried but obviously had to adapt it to the SFX and budget he had at the time. I give him credit for his occasional choice of good source material however.Anyway as for The Wrath... (I liked Mad magazines parody better (\"The Wreck of Khan\"). Gosh they really tried hard to make an exciting film (especially after the BIG disappointment of TMP) but alas...Does it make sense that the Captain (or in this case Admiral was it?), in fact supposedly the very BEST commanding officer of the top Star Ship of the Federation would carry around enough emotional baggage to keep 3 or 4 shrinks busy ( seems \"Bones\" was always psycho-analyzing him)? Man what a screwup! Conveniently violates Star Fleet rules at the outset and jeopardizes the whole ship and crew. Sheeesh.Overacting abounds in this mish-mash of space swashbuckling. If I was an actor, I think I'd be ashamed to admit I was in this film (or any others like it). This film is so full of illogical plot elements, flaws, and plain laughable scenes that I won't bother trying to list them all here. I take it there were no Academy Awards nominations for this film which tells you something. Talk about a clash of the egos - Kirk vs. Khan. Ricky Montalban overplays the uber-evil Khan to the max! God, anybody seething with that much hate inside would have burned himself up long ago. I think any serious actor would laugh their ass off when Khan (his face all torn to ****) looks into the camera and spouts \"From Hell's Heart I spit at thee! For Hate's Sake, I breath my last breath at thee!!!!\" (or something like that).Give it a rest pal!Perhaps he should have added \"Have a nice day!\".",

            "content": "Even though the first STAR TREK motion picture made a lot of money at the box office, it was a rather bloated and tedious affair that disappointed fans of the original late-sixties television program. When the time came for a sequel, Paramount Pictures made the right decision to ditch series' creator Gene Roddenberry as producer (as much as I respect the late Roddenberry, he was simply not an competent film producer) and bring in Harve Bennett as executive producer. Bennett understood that it was the endearing character-driven aspects of the series that had been missing from the franchise's first theatrical outing, and the wise decision was made to simply update the central premise of the television series for the big screen. In other words, Bennett and director Nicholas Meyer returned the STAR TREK series back to its basic roots, which is why the film works as well as it does.The film's rather straightforward plot moves quickly and satisfyingly gives plenty of screen time to the characters we know and love as they face their own personal struggles in addition to the usual life-or-death space combat phenomena. Sadly a regular object of considerable ridicule, the then-middle aged William Shatner actually gets a chance to poke fun at his own reportedly vain image as he is now forced to confront the challenges of aging. Leonard Nimoy has arguably never been better as the Vulcan Spock (arguably the franchise's most enduringly popular character), and his character finally gets the chance to both reach his full assimilated potential as well as put his own philosophies into action. The chemistry between Nimoy and Shatner has never been stronger, which lends their usual rapport even more warmth and leaves the surprisingly moving finale with one heck of a wallop.First seen in the 1967 episode \"Space Seed,\" Ricardo Montalban's superhuman Kahn is one of the series' most dangerous and charismatic villains, and his reasons for wanting Kirk dead are certainly understandable (if not justifiable). In the supporting cast, TREK regulars Dr. \"Bones\" McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Cmdr. Scott (James Doohan), Chekov (Walter Koenig), Sulu (George Takei), and Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) all make their expected appearances, and the subplot introducing Kirk's former love (Bibi Besch) and her son (Merritt Butrick) is expertly handled and fits perfectly within the contours of the film. However, the very best of the supporting players, without question, is Kristie Alley (in her film debut) who is terrific as a surprisingly sexy Vulcan Lieutenant. Alley's performance is such great fun it remains a true shame that she did not return for any future installments.The film manages to successful walk that thin line between playing to their core audience and catering to TREK neophytes. In other words, the film can be vastly enjoyed by both longtime Trekkies and viewers who have never watched an episode of the series in their lives (in fact, the film is routinely cited as the favorite film in the Trek canon by both polar opposite groups of viewers). The film works in virtually all major areas, and builds to a surprising moving climax that may have even the most cynical of viewers reaching for their Kleenex. THE WRATH OF KAHN is easily the place to start if you ever wanted to find out what all of that STAR TREK fuss was about, as it presents the Enterprise crew at their very best.",

Just recently I have had the fortune to tape the Wrath of Khan in its widescreen version, it happened to be a very clean, high quality(in sound and picture) broadcast as oppose to the faded and badly letterboxed broadcasts I have viewed before.  The Wrath of Khan, as I have previously commented is a fantastic space adventure, but the widescreen version is very much so better as it has better framed shots and you can obviously see more action.  As I have just learned if you have only watched the TV version you have missed out on about 1/3 of the action.  If you are lucky enough to fin a widescreen version with good quality sound and picture, I implore you to watch The Wrath of Khan it, even if it means having black bars on your TV to accomodate the picture, it is worth it.

But to the contrary, this second film opened up and turned the saga around. No longer would Star Trek be just about flying through space, it would now include violence. Ricardo Moltaban does a triumphant job to perfection as the villain Kahn, returning for the original series episode Space Seed. He rocks in this. The death of Spock is very sad, but by watching the sequels that sadness is removed from this film.

Here, there are some startling revelations about Kirk. He has an ex-wife and a son who work for the science vessels, and their purposes are at odds with each other. The story of Khan is well told. (The guy does like to quote Captain Ahab from MOBY DICK a lot, doesn't he?) This is the most intense of all the STAR TREK stories, with the brainwashing of Chekov early on (is it just me, or does that guy seem to always get in trouble?) and the untimely demise of Spock. His funeral at the end was a very moving scene, especially with Kirk's tearful eulogy.The downside to this movie? I'm sorry to say, Kirstie Alley. This woman is a fine actress and her life story is one of gritty determination in battling some powerful demons. I don't see why in the world she would like to play weak, whiny, neurotic women. ESPECIALLY A VULCAN! Spock is supposed to be the half human Vulcan, but he displays more emotional reserve than Saavik, who is supposed to be a full-blooded Vulcan.

Taut, well-crafted, effectively directed and able to emphasize the all-important nature of the characters and their relationships, this film by far exceeds its predecessor in every way.  Not a moment is wasted throughout the running time, with visual effects serving as a consequence of the storytelling rather than dominating as in the first film.  Star Trek II also benefits from a strong and compelling villain, found in Ricardo Montalban's portrayal of Khan.  The character's motivation for revenge makes for some wonderful moments of flare, and Montalban squeezes every scene for all it is worth.  He is without a doubt the strongest villain in the entire series, and is largely responsible for the success of this movie.The performances of the major cast members all shine in this adventure, reestablishing the importance of the Kirk, Spock and McCoy triangle.  These characters genuinely seem like old friends, and are able to address the material with a sense of familiarity that makes their performances seem natural.  This belief in the people and personalities of the Enterprise's crew is essential for the drama and devastation of the movie's climax, which is both powerful and moving.There is not a moment of excess in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, which, after twenty years, has yet to be surpassed in quality by any of the Star Trek films that have followed it.  It bridges the gap between the campiness and joy of the original television series and the universe depicted in the films.  As it stands, it is one of the finest films of the science fiction genre, not for its visual effects, but for its depiction of character and its overall success as a piece of cinematic entertainment.",

            "content": "This isn't my favorite Star Trek movie (that will always be First Contact), but without this film, there likely is no Star Trek: The Next Generation. I was fifteen years old when this movie came out, and like many New Yorkers, had begun watching Star Trek reruns on Channel 11 (WPIX) at midnight before going to bed. The series was enjoying a renaissance in those reruns, but a lackluster first effort at a major motion picture yielded what would have been a fine episode, but which was sorely lacking as a movie. This movie delivered on the promise shown by the series by adapting it in such a way that hardcore fans would be thrilled, while the mainstream audience would finally understand the appeal to the \"trekkies\" as they were called back then.If you have not yet seen this movie, see if you can catch the episode that serves as the \"prequel\" for this movie: \"Space Seed.\" In that episode, Kahn (Ricardo Montleban), a product of genetic engineering in the late 20th century with superior intellect and strength, commandeers the Enterprise, is caught, and left to rule a new planet, Ceti-Alpha 5. The planet is harsh, however, and only Kahn's crew and a few plot-driving native life forms survive. When the Enterprise returns to this planet, it does so to check on the \"Genesis\" project, which can bring life to a lifeless planet. Needless to say, fifteen years after being left in this galactic wasteland, Kahn wants revenge, and the Enterprise crew that has beamed down to his planet fits the bill.The usual cast suspects return (I won't even bother naming them all, as most will know), along with Paul Winfield as Capt. Terrell, and, for those who want to feel really old, let's not forget the \"INTRODUCING KIRSTIE ALLEY\" text that flew across the screen looking as good as she ever has while playing Lt. Saavik, a Vulcan \"protege\" of Mr. Spock's who has already managed to work her way onto the captain's deck.Director Nicholas Meyer paid incredible attention to detail and took full advantage of the new-era (for the time) special effects that showed how far that technology had progressed since the series. Unlike the first movie, where even the Trekkies couldn't follow the plot easily or stay interested, this film is absolutely gripping. One need not be a Trekkie to appreciate the plot, as the history of Kahn and Kirk is sprinkled just enough to catch the public up to speed.The other notable new character are Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Beach), an ex-flame of Kirk's who is every bit his equal, only different, and the son Kirk left behind with her, David Marcus (Merritt Butrick), not knowing of his father only because Carol did not want him to become like \"Admiral Kirk.\" Kirk fights his mid-life crisis simultaneously with Kahn, who proves himself a worthy opponent capable of going the distance and leaving a few \"permanent\" scars on Kirk and the federation. The supporting cast plays true to form, seemingly unaffected by time and a bit unevolved by the writes. McCoy hints at his own aging process, and Chekov has moved on to his own ship, but the movie focuses mostly on Kirk, Spock, Saavik, and the Drs. Marcus. Genesis is a typical focal point reminiscent of the series' best episodes, and the writers take full advantage of the lack of a 52-minute time constraint of the series, fleshing out everything from the characters to the special effects in ways that would not or could not be done in a prime time hour.The moral plots are enormous, but not overplayed: life, death, marriage, children, ex-lovers, revenge, and a host of other emotions and moral dilemmas, such as following regulations and deceiving one's superiors all come into play in a way that humanizes these futuristic, brilliant space pioneers, making them just human enough that we trust they are like us, but not so much that we fear that they are just like us when it's time to do their incredible work.My older eyes see through some of the simplicity of this film, but for a wide-eyed teenager with a strong math/geek streak in his personality, this was as good as it's ever going to get in terms of film experiences, and this is from a year in which the other movies I saw in theaters included Poltergeist, E.T., Rocky III, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High.This film is like having the entire original series and everything that followed, along with the permanent hype at its \"genesis\" point, all neatly ensconced in a single film that belongs in a time capsule for anyone in the future who ever wants to see the quintessential science-fiction film of the late 20th century.",

Should have had dark hair with maybe a streak or two of gray.\nTook me awhile to get used to the ornate new Enterprise crew uniforms, at first I hated them because they seemed so fussy. But I adjusted.\nI was truly shocked at how much 15 years had aged Shatner and Nimoy. Dr. McCoy already looked a bit old in TOS, and did not look much different here. Shatner also seemed uncharacteristically sorrowful and tired through much of the film. I never thought I would miss the young hammy & brash Kirk - but I did. I felt like slapping this older Kirk and telling him to snap out of it !!!.\nI'm currently watching the Search for Spock, and am glad I didn't get turned away by the low Rotten Tomatoes reviews. So far I think it's better than Wrath of Khan!!\nBut being a woman, I'm not so much into the space battles, which are supposed to be great in WOK..",

            "content": "I've never understood two things about the consensus surrounding the Star Trek Movies:1) --- \"The Motion Picture is slow, boring & plain bad\" ---...er, no it's not...it's one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made, arguably on par with the Granddaddy of them all: Kubrick's 2001. The final hour once the Enterpise encounters V'Ger is spectacularly breathless!2) --- \"Wrath of Khan is the best Star Trek movie\" ---...I find it one of the weaker ones. It's slow, the story is a little boring and full of obvious plot holes: for one, why would the Reliant not know about the Botany Bay crew in the Ceti Alpha system, why didn't their sensors pick up multiple life readings, why didn't Starfleet or the Federation know about the 6th planet exploding?Lots of niggling things wrong with this picture:it's barely a sci-fi movie: more akin to a wartime submarine battle flick, with on-the-nose Moby Dick references (TOS-ep The Doomsday Machine did that better).Khan himself was all out of charisma, which was one of his character's magnetic strengths back in the superior Space Seed. And he & his crew are apparently intelligent & adaptive enough to crew a Starship, but not to battle in three dimensions? How did his crew overpower the Reliant crew anyway (who would've had phasers etc)?Shatner's well-acted but turns-out-meta \"KHAAAAAAAAN!\" scream. Mere minutes later he reveals that shouting was totally unnecessary as he always knew they'd be getting out (and Khan was already fooled).David trying to knife his Dad!not raising shields after hearing Dr Marcus's dire warning, with the oddly-behaving Reliant Starship coming right towards you, even after Spock confirming they're lying about their comms being down, even after Saavik warns of the regulation requiring shields...that's not Kirk 'going senile' that's just contrived writing. Fine in the occasional TOS ep, but in a big-budget movie you expect more care in the script.the Genesis-Project capabilities are a little over-the-top. Fine for Q-powered super-aliens, but a bit jarring coming from human scientists. And why would it be able to create something out of dead space? If it can do that, why the need to look for dead planets?the script calling for Kirk feeling 'old & worn out' is a bit of a comedown from the ending of TMP, when he had fire in his belly (\"Take us out...out there...\").visually, TWoK is mostly uninteresting...the Nebula cat & mouse was ok, but coming from exploring V'Ger it felt quite meh.then there's the audio mix...even on Bluray it is quite poor: muffled dialogue is the biggest problem, with obvious overdubs happening within the same scene. TMP didn't have this issue.some edits & storyboard choices are odd: why did Scotty come up to the Bridge (all the way from Engineering) with an injured crewman in his arms? That's what the Sick Bay is for!It wasn't all bad: generally I still relatively enjoyed watching...but more out of Trek-loyalty...like those filler TOS eps which are neither good or bad, just merely watchable. A filler Trek is still worth watching, but isn't something I'd recommend to anyone.What saves it from being totally average is the brilliant few minutes of Kirk rushing to Spock's imminent death. A true highlight of the entire Trek canon...beautifully written, directed & played.......and unfortunately, much like Kirk's \"KHAAAAAAAN!\" earlier...the moment is cheapened mere minutes later when it is heavily suggested Spock isn't really dead, that he likely will be saved by the Genesis-McGuffin.The ending would've been dramatically better served if the film left it at him being shot out to Genesis and ending there (Empire Strikes Back style). It's still fine the next film bringing him back, there's enough distance between the two then to keep his death in Wrath of Khan a powerful moment (even on repeat watches, thanks to ones 'suspension of disbelief').TMP is a rare 10/10. A feast for the eyes, ears & mind. TWoK is a comedown in all areas except for the beautifully-handled Spock death & funeral scenes. 6/10 seems about fair, in my book.",

            "content": "This film deserves better than the 7.7 it's currently getting on this site. How can it possibly get a lower rating than much of the dreck which is produced nowadays? This film is a miracle. Master director Nick Meyer wrote the story from scratch over a period of around two weeks.TECHNICAL: The film looks great. The bland colors from the preceding film have been replaced with intense red uniforms, ion trails, and nebulae. The film looks like the cover of a 1980's sci-fi paperback. (which I love!) The effects still look good today. This film boasts the first 3D CGI sequence of any major film, which is still impressive.ACTING: Shatner and Montalbahn give the best performances of their careers. There's really not a bad performance in the film. Shatner is intense and heroic, a bit unusual for a 50 year old protagonist.My favorite scene is when Khan removes his mask on Seti. It's simple, yet so very dramatic.STORY: The story is very good. The film moves at a brisk pace in real time over the course of two hours. This movie is really about the war of nerves between Kirk and Khan. We experience the death of a beloved character, and new life in the Genesis planet. It is a true story arc which leaves nothing left to be said, and is very moving. Meyer demonstrates his mastery of storytelling and directing.This a serious film, with the usual sprinkling of Star Trek humor, which adds to the experience. There isn't a single alien in the movie, except for Saavik, who is played very well by Kirstie Allie.This is really the only film during which we get to see Kirk and Spock calling the shots together, a true dream team whom anyone would be happy to have commanding a space battle! Khan is terrifying, yet we can't help but feel some sympathy for him after what he has gone though. His grievances are surprisingly easy to relate to, throwing some extra emotions into the soup.The Seti Eels which infect peoples' ears has to be one of the most unsettling scenes in history. Very graphic and disturbing for a PG movie.The soundtrack by James Horner set a new standard, and launched his career in Hollywood. It's a powerful composition which brings the film to life and is very enjoyable on its own.Nick Meyer never intended for Spock to be brought back to life, nor to show the torpedo on Genesis at the end. Paramount insisted on that for obvious reasons. It's a pity that the sequel was so poor, but it was redeemed by \"The Voyage Home\", which is also a good film, thanks in part to Meyer's involvement.There would not have been any more Star Trek movies or TV series were it not for the popularity of this film. Abrams' recent reboot was largely a milking of \"The Wrath of Khan\". But that's another review...Final note:Be sure to watch the original release version, and not the extended version which has extra scenes for television, and which ultimately interfere with the pace, detrimentally.",

From a cool film opening, to its humour, likable protagonists, good special effects, a brilliant villain and an epic score. However, all of these just seem an imitation of a far superior film series: Star Wars. The first entry in the Star Trek series, although had its faults, at least had its own style unlike this. This doesn't mean it isn't a bad film, however. Yet again the entire crew put in commanding performances and William's Shatner portrayal of an ageing Kirk is probably his best. The film also has better sound and visual effects and ups the suspense, most notable in the film's first and last half an hour. Ricardo Montalban puts in a performance only second in his career to 'The Naked Gun', in terms of sheer entertainment. His character, Khan, is terrifying and ruthless and Montalban adds a brilliant sophistication to his character with his charming Mexican accent. In this film, as a viewer, you get a better sense of the threat to the Enterprise crew. Despite these positives, the films middle section is painfully slow and despite having a fairly simple plot, its ending, however satisfying it may be, is awfully confusing. It is a huge disappointment that the supposed space battle is very tame and that there is no final confrontation between Kirk and Khan. Probably better than its predecessor and clever in parts, 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is just an attempt at copying the style that is so loved in George Lucas' 'Star Wars'.",

A weary studio green lights a television Mini-Series which would after great writing and visionary direction by Nicholas Meyer(The Day After) would become Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan.Following up on the original series episode \"Space Seed\"(1967) , The Starship Reliant (NCC-1864), Discovers the stranded crew of the S.S. Botany Bay many years after it is left there by Admiral Kirk (William Shatner). Needless to say being marooned on a hostile world for many years has not improved Khan's (Ricardo Montalban) mood. The death of his wife(Lt. Marla McGivers) during this time, had a negative impact as well. Khan it seems is bent on vengeance.After stealing the Reliant from it's Captain , Khan sets of for the final showdown with Kirk in space. Star Trek : The Wrath of Khan is in my opinion the best of the franchise movies. The script (edited several times) was paired down to a sharp direct instrument , which kept the movies flow steady and interesting. The acting may have been Shatner's best in the series and then of course the rest fell into place.The resulting climax , ever controversial, spawned strong interest , indirectly and unintentionally fueling two more films. The films power was only further enhanced by its strong support specifically that of Capt. Terrell (Paul Winfield) and the half Romulan Lt.Saavik (Kristie Alley in her first movie role).A staple of trekkies. A must view for those unfamiliar with the franchise. Overall , one of its finest works.Four Stars.(of 5)",

Much like the lifeless Sahara, which was once green, but due to an orbital knock 6000 years ago, is now a lifeless stretch of sand and rocks in intense heat.Needless to say, Khan wants REVENGE on Kirk and the others for sending him there, and so a kind of plodding submarine warfare sequence ensues, with both spaceships trying to blast at each other, and the bad guys get some great dialogue, and Spock gets some heavy drama cos of his sacrifices, and the spaceship looks better and bigger due to better SFX and the score is loud and powerful. Most of all, the film has thoughtful parallels to our own global situation, but the original episode was actually a bit more clever than this feature filmThat said, this movie is OVERRATED by S.T. apologists - this film contains easily the WORST matte paintings in a wide release motion picture (the Genesis environment looks literally like bad art from a paperback novel circa 1981), and Khans gang of space pirates look utterly camp and tacky, instead of the luminous futurism of the original sixties series. There's a bit of sci-fi techno-worship too, in the overly reverent space- dock sequence showing the Enterprise moving into space, really designed to impress us, the viewers, with widescreen images of the submarine/toilet/lightbulb design of the USS Enterprise, now upgraded for the style of 80's sci-fi.The film also has an 'endgame' feeling about it, wanting us to respect the age, efforts and experience of the Enterprise crew, but because it wasn't a massive flop (like Star Trek: the Motion Picture) it heralded about a decade of mixed, and sometimes pointless Trek sequels, never actually including the input of the series creators Roddenberry, and of course Gene Coon who passed away before the film series began. This is probably the real reason the 80s Star Trek series didn't quite feel convincing. Its all about character reverence, mediocre plots and nerdy military banter set in the \"23rd Century\".

That honor still belongs to the 4th movie The Voyage Home, an immensely entertaining movie that holds true to the real essence of Star Trek.All in all, its not hard to see why so many people love this movie. There are some exciting ship battles to be seen, an unusually sombre ending (and one of the most touching), and two very angry men trying to outwit one another. What more could you want? Also, the old gang are all here despite Shatner's overtly-generous screen time, the real star of this movie is the inimitable Spock. However it would have been wonderful to see the rest of the crew to interact more with each other, which is the biggest single weakness that had always plagued the original series. Luckily, they were given that chance in the excellent 4th and 6th movies (see also the action-packed First Contact, another must-see movie).For those who hasn't watched Wrath Of Khan, do so on a relaxing weekend with a bowl of crunchy popcorns but don't bring any unrealistic expectations or criticisms.

            "content": "\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" was released in 1982 and was a sequel to the original series episode, \"Space Seed\". Totally ignoring the events of the previous picture, this one creates an interesting plot featuring a planet creating device called \"Genesis\" and the return of Khan Noonien Singh, whom Captain Kirk exiled to planet Ceti Alpha V fifteen years earlier. Captain Clark Terrell and First Officer Pavel Checkov from the USS Reliant, land on Ceti Alpha V, which they thought was planet VI, to seek out a test site for Genesis. They encounter Khan (Ricardo Montalban) and his genetic supermen and are brainwashed by some gross creatures that Khan put in their ears. He takes over the Reliant and seeks out the USS Enterprise, which is now an Academy training vessel, on a run with a group of trainees. The rest of the film is non-stop action as a cat and mouse game is played with the Reliant and the Enterprise, Kirk and Khan exchange words, and a battle in the Mutara Nebula. The rest of the original cast is here along with Kirstie Alley as Lt. Saavick. Ricardo Montalban is way over the top as Khan, which makes the film all the better. Everyone seems to have emotion in this one (which is put to the test at the end of the film), they have better uniforms, the Enterprise is no longer pastel-heaven and there is a significant amount of action in this to please the viewer. This is the best film in the series and it is VERY emotional at the end, but he will return...",

And some of the levity that was clearly missing from the first movie is back. That's not to say it's a humorous movie. At the heart of it all is a wonderful melodrama involving Kirk trying to recapture his past glories as a starship commander and coming to terms with the presence of his son and the death of his best friend. It's a shame that most people overlook this subtle performance in favor of his way-over-the-top `Khaaaan!!!!' (which actually turns out to be a performance staged for Khan's benefit).  Speaking of which, I don't think there's been a cooler Trek villain then Khan Noonien Singh. Ricardo Montalban is wonderful.\nJames Horner's score is great. And the dramatic moments are perfectly done. I'll never forget the moment near the end, when Kirk hears McCoy's broken voice over the intercom and then notices Spock's empty seat. The look on Kirk's face, the look that says he suddenly knows what's happened to his friend, hits you like a sledgehammer.",

            "content": "This may be the best sequel to a TV episode ever. What a bold move to single out one episode out of 79; and continue it on a grand scale in feature film format. It's generally conceded that the even number Trek movies are the best. It ain't worth nit-picking which one is better than the other, they're all equally fine.And so are all the performances. There's a better balance of character and spectacle that is more Gene Coon and less Gene Roddenberry. Of course the special effects are (a little ) better in 'Star Trek Motion Picture'; they better be at 45 million dollars. Compared to a cool 13 million spent on 'Wrath of Khan' (some sets DID carry over from the first, that saved some bucks) is part of the reason this movie is justifiably better appreciated. Because the 1st movie was so mismanaged...it shows. Because the 2nd movie was better prep'd with talented writer/director Nick Meyer and producer Harve Bennet who were forced to use creative short cuts to save money without sacrificing story quality; that shows too. (This does not slight director Robert Wise because he never had total control in the 1st movie; besides, with his resume of films, he is permanently etched in movie history as one of the all time great directors.) And Meyer's good natured rapport with the cast saved the Trek franchise from oblivion and recaptured the magic of the Trek characters that was so sterile the first time out.This makes a great double feature to Trek's 'Space Seed'. Or go for triple with 'Search For Spock'...4th with...well; save 'Voyage Home' and 'Undiscovered Country' for another night. A great story has commenced.The \"Director's Edition\" is better. I'm glad I waited before investing in the Trek DVDs. Can't wait till #4 & #6 (but I'll get #3 because it's essential to the story). The bonus disc is entertaining. And Nimoy participates in up to date interviews as opposed to his absence from \"Motion Picture's\" 2nd disc. Does that reveal anything to anyone?\nMore operatic and intimate. And is that a great score or what. From the first fanfare, you know you're in for top quality trek entertainment. In 1982, this was my first exposure to James Horner; and I was instantly hooked.8 out of 10 !",

On the positive side, this movie is really well directed, acted, and written. The characters all feel much more mature than they were in the original series and you can understand Khan's motivations quite well. The best part about this movie is the villain, and the fact that he is a lot more understandable and fleshed out than any other in the Star Trek universe. This adventure might have not had the most at stake, or even the most action, but it was the emotion behind it that made this movie really fun to watch.I give this an 8.2/10. I'm not completely crazy about this movie, as I feel Star Trek is a series that works a lot better on the television rather the big screen, and I'm completely spoiled by The Next Generation. But still a really fun movie and should keep you on the edge of your seat",

            "content": "As promised yesterday I watched Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan. The film is about promoted Admiral James T Kirk who no longer is captain over the Enterprise. Kirk is forced into duty once again when his old enemy Khan shows up and seeks revenge. We have William Shatner as James T Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as Spock and Ricardo Montalban as Khan.The film unfolds in its own pace and sometimes reminds me of 2001: A Space Odyssey, where spacecraft also \"dances\" to music in space. The story fells intimate and very personal, and the main focus is almost entirely on James T Kirk. Khan is his old enemy, it is he who is forced to act and it is he who must take matters into his own hands. This makes other characters around him a little distant, but on the other hand it is very clear from the beginning that this is Kirk's film.Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan is a very well made film with very good looking scenes inside the spacecraft and outside in space. To only follow the Enterprise as she glides out into space to the music of James Horner, is magical in itself. Ironically I mentioned in an earlier post that I looked forward to watching the film because it wouldn't have any computer effects, CGI. Well, it turns out it contains a very early computer generated sequence of a planet.In many ways Star Trek is the feelings between the crew as they navigate the Enterprise like marines in the navy. Director Nicholas Meyer wanted the crew to act even more like navy military so he took it even further in this film compared to the first Star Trek film or the original series.All in all I really liked the film. It had a great personal story and developed itself nicely as things went along. I did however thought the film was too short. I felt it needed to be longer to really make me be able to go deeper and understand the different characters. I also have to mention that you probably need some pre-understanding of Star Trek to watch this film, and if you haven't, you should probably start with the original Star Trek series or watch the first film Star Trek: The Motion Picture. But, in any case Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan is a good film and definitely worth your time.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",

The STAR TREK episode \"Space Seed,\" to which STAR TREK II was a sequel, ended on a note of hope and anticipation.  Just what sort of new world was Kahn going to create?  It was rather depressing to have that hope and anticipation completely trashed by the revelation that that Kahn hadn't been able to create anything.

I heard that if I wanted to learn to appreciate Star Trek, I could best start with \"The wrath of Khan\". The other day, for the first time, I sat through a complete Star Trek movie. Alas, without a positive result.The story is not much and the characters and sets are made out of cardboard. The villain could have really shone in this setting of holier than the pope dogoodies but unfortunately he was nothing more than a middle-aged He-man or Conan with a son who is a combination of He-man and Donny Osmond. Things were hilarious when they were not supposed to be. On top of that it had me asking questions like: \"Why could the delegation that was beamed to a planet not be beamed back when they were in danger of being captured by bad guys?\", \"Why did the good guys not move the genesis device a little bit when Khan was planning to beam the device up but only knew its co-ordinates?\", \"Why did the good guys not look out of the window when an enemy vessel was not visible on their screens because of some interference from a nebula?\". The camera viewpoint showed clearly that the enemy vessel was all too obvious to see with the naked eye and what ever happened to radar, anyway. It just made me feel silly watching it. The only positive point I can think of was that for the first time in my life I actually thought Kirstie Alley was quite hot which was a revelation.There was graffiti and vandalism in Roman times, it is here today and it will be there in the future but not in Star Trek. There is no boredom, unemployment or money. I don't know if anyone ever noticed this but Star Trek is communists in space. And, though, communism is one of greatest political systems ever devised on paper it does not work because, for example, people have ambitions of their own. In Star Trek I just saw drones. This movie was made in 1982, a time when movies like Star wars, Blade runner and Alien were already made. Star Trek and its ideology belong firmly in the fifties. McCarthy would have burned them at the stake, though.Independent of any Star Trek knowledge this is supposed to be good science-fiction. Not so, in my opinion, this movie is cheesy and not up to par. If you think you are not a Trekkie based on five minutes of footage then don't bother watching any more. Liking Star Trek is not an acquired taste but a talent.

            "content": "I really consider this movie to be the first true Star Trek movie, as The Motion Picture was patched together and expanded from a story originally intended as a pilot episode for Star Trek: Phase II. (A series that was originally planned, but then abandoned in favour of the movies)Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan was developed specifically as a movie and didn't have any of the baggage left over from all the failed attempts to resurrect Star Trek in the 1970's. Paramount also brought in new creative staff who brought a slightly different and somewhat darker approach to the Star Trek universe.Another aspect to Star Trek II was the significantly reduced budget. This means that many special effects scenes were re-used from The Motion Picture and meant that any additional special effects or sets couldn't be too extravagant. Unfortunately, this means that Star Trek II is one of the least visually exciting Star Trek movies (not that the special effects are bad though). Depending on how you look at it, this can either be a good or bad thing. As they didn't have the resources to simply produce a simple special effects thrill ride, they had to concentrate on the story, which is one of Star Trek II's main strengths*** spoilers ***While the movie contains a number of interesting subplots, the main story concentrates on Kirk vs Khan. As the story develops, the tension and suspense builds up to an incredible level, climaxing with what I think is one of the best space battles that has ever appeared in a movie and Spock's ultimate sacrifice to save his ship and crewmates. The buildup of tension and suspense is also helped considerably by the lack of lame jokes that appear in later Star Trek films.*** end of spoilers ***For many fans, this movie is the one that all other Star Trek films are judged by. Once you see it, its not hard to see why. If I could, I would give it 20 out of 10.",

The battle in the nebula between the Reliant and the Enterprise was excellently done, making it more like a submarine battle.

As a budding screenwriter I can only look to this movie as something to aspire to.  If I can write a script as good as this, and have such an impact and influence on others, as this has had on me then I will be a very happy man.  Jack B. Sowards is the man to look to.  What do I know about him?  Nothing.  What has he written since?  No idea.  Such a shame because I really do admire this true work of masterpiece.  Ricardo Montalban is awesome and what is really great is that he pushes William Shatner to his best ever performance as James T. Kirk.  Everyone looks to a great villain coming up against an established and renowned great hero.  Khan vs. Kirk.  Nothing better has happened in Trek before, or since.  I can only rate the TNG episode \"The Best of Both Worlds\" as better Trek.  Unbelievable.  If you haven't seen this movie then you really need to.  The bar gets raised to such a height with this Trek outing that none of the seven Trek films since have come even come.  My main desire as a screenwriter would be to write a Trek film, and to write a film that people would compare to this one.  Does it have any flaws?

The villain is perfect, the heroes are people you want to win.The action will make you forget about any slight imperfections in the rest of the film.Like for instance: Why did Kirk get all cocky at poor Kirstie Alley after he won the first space battle? \"You just keep on quoting regulations, Savik!\" Excuse me? If you followed the regulations she was quoting, Kahn wouldn't have just locked his phasers on you and blown you to kingdom come, mortally wounding Scotty's nephew in the process.

I just do not believe it deserves all the accolades other reviewers on this website have given it.

And that's the best way to watch this movie if your a newcomer to the Star Trek universe, watch it with a Trekkie, and ask questions. As for the special effects, they were great!

It is however a rip-roaring Adventure tale set to the Trek backdrop and there is nothing wrong with that. Original Trek had plenty of adventure tales, speculative fiction tales, and the like. The contributions by the principle original series members here are glowing, even when the great William Shatner steps fleetingly into his infamous moments of over-acting. People like to claim this as the first real Trek movie- usually citing so many problems with ST The Motion Picture. I say to them that STTMP IS a Scifi story and the Directors cut version repairs, completes and makes a truly wonderful FIRST Trek film. Wrath of Khan takes us where the original cast (vice any of the following ST series casts) alone can take us- to a story of loyalty, introspection, disgust with convention and reminders of why tradition is important and why innovation in all situations can be both a marvel- and terror. Love of family, and all intelligence is an underlying theme here and respect for the universe (including leaving things be!). STTWOK coupled with ST The Search for Spock and ST The Voyage Home make for a complete tale that expand on these themes and show us all why caring and striving to achieve are the ultimate themes- human and perhaps other as yet undiscovered species themes for life, that drive us, please us and define us.",

Also the villain is quite superb and the special effects are excellent (proving again that it is not the raw computer power that makes them believable in the first place).If this film has one flaw, it is that the series should have ended here (or at least Spock should not have been raised from the dead).

Its just the thing, you know, for good storytelling. That's because it is explicitly abstract and we have learned how to accept the abstractions, to scurry the goofy elements into hidy holes, just like we do when seeing romantic movies. That allows the filmmaker greater latitude to impose cinematic expressions, or to bend the story to those streams which exploit the visual imagination.That's why I think Star Trek in all its incarnations is a beast that eats souls, that dulls the mind of whole generations. Its a curse, every element through and through excepting only the score. I saw this only because someone else dragged me to it, and I find it ever so much worse than I recall. That's only in part because the effects are extremely hokey by today's standards.This is essentially a movie about two spaceships fighting, led by two men who pretend to be complex. Ahab and Lear are enlisted in the attempt to add weight to these characters. Its beside the point that the effects are ghastly, and the acting is among the worst ever seen.Its because of how the thing was conceived, the decisions about abstractions that were made.Those decisions were made in the sixties and to support a TeeVee show, about 40 minutes with 20 minutes of obnoxious ads. That means the characters are cartoons and the stories are so simpleminded and the moral so accessible that any dummy would \"get it.\"So we have simple morality plays in the TeeVee show that were grafted onto the chickenwire skeleton. Yes, they dealt with social injustice and should get credit for it. But they dealt with it in such a superficial buzzword brevity that we are now paying for it, with many folks thinking that life really is described in Spock parables. And we have the American political tradition based on similar simples parables.That's carried over to the films, all of them. The fans would have it no other way, and even if they would have allowed some maturity or depth anywhere in the vicinity, you're still be stuck with the same actors, characters and \"spaceship escapes\" setup.I watch a lot of 50's science fiction and marvel that we took much of it seriously at the time. All these Trek films have now moved into a similar zone of campiness.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",

I cant say enough about the score which is equally wonderous as james horners take on goldsmith's star trek the movie score sores above, usually movies degrade if they replace scorers or scores. This is what should have happened in the next generation movies and reboot (hated the reboot 2009 score, the tng movies sucked for removing goldsmith/horners music while having the star trek II music in the series, except for first contact the only alternative scored star trek movie i liked).star trek II's music should have been the staple for all the star trek movies which is one of the reasons why star trek has been downgraded with the reboot into made for Micheal bay reboot fanboys. The film keeps firm with gene roddenbery's humanistic storytelling unlike the reboot and films after 4, II and III need to be watched together as III is almost a part II of II. I recommend Highly Star treks 1-4 and First Contact, the reboot if you want to remove your brain. This is the best and flagship of the 11 star trek films.

It has aged extremely well, as if two Starfleet vessels battling each other to the death could ever really get old anyway.It's everything that Star Trek: The Motion Picture isn't. Fast, fun, and full of action. I'd forgotten just how awesome Ricardo Montalban is as Khan, and how great Khan is as Kirk's nemesis.The film builds to the incredible crescendo of the blind battle inside the nebula where Kirk finally gets the upper hand and cripples the Reliant, causing Khan to try to wipe the Enterprise out with the Genesis device. Spock's sacrifice is brought to us brilliantly; it's not overly dramatic, but the poignancy of the act comes across perfectly.9/10, only failing to achieve full bananas due to a slightly weaker musical score and the obvious re-use of a couple of scenes from the first film. Nicholas Meyer did an outstanding job on this, and quite possibly saved Star Trek as a whole. Another bad outing after the first film could easily have meant curtains for the whole thing.",

When I first saw Search for Spock, I didn't like Robin Curtis (I), their new choice for Saavik (I was young & resisted the change), but after watching both movies again recently, I've come to realize that Curtis did an excellent job and would have been a far superior choice for the part in Wrath of Khan.Aside from the whiny and emotional human-in-Vulcan's-clothing, Wrath is excellent.  Still very entertaining and watchable, even after 20 years!  Got to love the space battles, especially the quiet, graceful way that smoke from the ships trails off into the nebula.  And what a great villain!  Khan was the best.G-",

After the very well-meaning effort of Mr. Douglas Trumbull, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, which plays much more thought provoking today and maybe spawned Star Trek Voyager, the series. No criticism of Mr. Trumbull whose movie may be the most important of the entire movie series and the different TV series' that have followed but on that day and in anticipation Trekkies a word which I do not snarl at were waiting and looking for rip-roaring shoot 'em up Captain Kirk and the crew. This came in next with Star Trek: The Wrath Of Khan and mighty well it did Ricardo Montalban never to be forgotten for it. I find fault only in one line in the film or portion of a line where God is referred to as a proved myth because the line is spoken in past tense. I know I gasped at such a statement and it is my honest belief that like everything we have like Manna fell from Heaven the Manna that Star Trek is in entertainment is provided by and allowed by God maybe inspite of a thought that He myth-wise is, ever was, or will be unreal. Nicholas Meyer did in my opinion a tremendous job directing this film and I am not sure what much other he has done since with his direction talents but given such an opportunity and not myself a direction or film school student I would have to guess that his aim was making a good and entertaining film not propaganda with such a devoted and large audience its' mind wide open for such by a franchise it loved and loves. Now that is a director who can entertain or thought provoke without forcing you to end up with his/ her opinion. Director's of today improve tremendously with super efforts but little things slip by I cannot detect in Star Trek: The Wrath Of Khan and excellent film well known but escapist.A new Star Trek movie after all that have come is said in production. Let's hope for the best. I do.",

This is a movie where everything came to together, the acting, directing, writing, the music, everything is just amazing. And, unlike The Motion Picture, it feels like classic Star Trek. The story is essentially a sequel to an episode from the original TV show called, Space Seed, which shows the return of Ricardo Montalbon as KHAN and he wants revenge on Captain Kirk, or in this movie, Admiral Kirk for he did to him. Simple plot, easy to understand. But there is a very important sub-plot, involving a former love interest of Kirk and her son, who created a device simply called, Genisis, which will be used to turn a dead planet into a habitable one. One of the best parts of the movie is the space battles between The Enterprise and Khan's stolen Starship the Reliant. There are two really cool battles, which is not only a battle of firepower, but a true cat and mouse, battle of wits. And of course what adds to the battles is the great music, written by James Horner. Now if you never seen this movie and don't know the ending, STOP READING. However, the ending of this movie, much like Darth Vader turning out to be Luke Skywalkers father, might not be as surprising. And I'm sure most you know what happened in the end. But I think I have too many spoilers anywayOverall, this movie is just plain awesome. Of course, this movie is not the end of the story as the ending of this movie will spawn another sequel...",

            "content": "Star Trek II takes the star trek movies in a different direction than its predecessor, Star Trek (The Motion Picture).  It augments its philosophical underpinnings and great special effects with an action-packed plot.This movie effectively plays off of the \"Space Seed\" episode of the original series of Star Trek.  In that episode, Capt. Kirk and the Enterprise discover Khan (portrayed by Ricardo Montalban) and his crew in cryogenic freeze on the Botany Bay, a ship lost in space from the year 1996.  When Khan is awaked, the Enterprise crew discover that Khan was the madman from history who nearly took over all people on Earth.  Khan then tried to steal the Enterprise and murder Capt. Kirk.  Due to the intelligence and resourcefulness of the crew, Capt. Kirk managed to defeat Khan's plans and then exiled Khan and his crew to spend the rest of their lives on planet Seti Alpha 5.In Star Trek II, Chekov accidentally discovers Khan on Seti Alpha 5. Unfortunately, Khan's anger against (now Admiral) Kirk has kindled during his exile, and he is intent on accomplishing one thing ... killing Kirk for vengeance.  Khan manages to steal a Federation starship (U.S.S. Reliant); raid a Federation research laboratory (Regula I); steal the secrets to Project Genesis, a potential destructive project; and engage in a deadly pursuit of Admiral Kirk and the Enterprise.During this film, we see a transformation of its characters.  We see Admiral Kirk regaining his passion for his duties in Starfleet and reconciling his relationship with his illegitimate son and his son's mother.  We see Khan as an intelligent madmen who lets his desire for revenge overshadow his rational, and otherwise prudent, judgment.  We also see Spock's genuine devotion to the livelihood of his fellow crew members.In conclusion, this film contains great special effects, memorable dialog, and great acting.  This film has intense action scenes and a breathtaking final sequence.  In this film, we see the destructive nature of revenge, the creation of new life, and the necessity to reckon with past events in our lives.",

There is the rich characterisation involved, Kirk confronting old age, restlessness at being stuck in a desk job...Kirk & McCoy's conversation early on is excellent as is where he talks to Carol Marcus... Moments that still provoke some tension and excitement are the Reliant's opening shot and when Enterprise returns fire. That build-up of when Reliant continues head-on and the dialogue cutting between Reliant and Enterprise. \"Raise shields\" \"They're raising shields...\" And so on. That moment as the Enterprise heels over, the red alert lights on...no doubt if it had been done in 2002 (when Nemesis was done) we would've had three-way angles of the attack. The dialogue is some of the best in the series of movies. The effects such as Genesis, the Mutara Nebula are excellent considering this is a time when CGI was very early on. Reading Shatner's Movie Memories I got the feeling and do feel this in fact that if it had not been for Wrath of Khan, Trek would've sunk there and then. No TNG, DS9 etc. I feel, perhaps some do as well, that between them Harve Bennett and Nicolas Meyer saved Trek. Maybe I'm being melodramatic but compare this film to Motion Picture (Which I do not watch and have watched so little do actually consider TWOK to be the 'first' Trek film) and you see how Bennett, Meyer and others changed it for the better.James Horner's music as in Trek III is sublime, the top highlights being the Genesis Countdown theme and Battle in the Mutara Nebula. The scene with Spock's death (even if you know what happens next, ST3 etc) still provokes emotion and I would never ever deem a Trek movie other than this as the best.",

The animosity between Capt. Kirk (Shatner) and Khan (Montalban) is engrossing.  Montalban's menacing delivery produces several quotable lines.  Beyond its sci-fi action, the films also weaves in its themes of vengeance, aging, friendship, and selflessness - giving it more pathos than other Star Treks and sci-fi movies.  Perhaps its greatest asset is the James Horner score performed by a full orchestra.  The music seemlessly corresponds with the changing mood of the on-screen action. The score and the raw emotion  makes for a viscerally satisfying experience. I think viewers know little or nothing about Star Trek would still really enjoy this film.",

The originals are, dated, to say the least, everyone is just super horny all the time for some reason and it leads to the stupidest storylines you'll ever see and some of the cringiest material i have ever watched (next to anything put out by the MCU). But despite the terrible writing for a good 90% or so of the episodes the bare bones of the characters are there and the movies do surprisingly, progress them along very compelling paths. Khans introduction however was among the worst of the episodes in my opinion so i wasnt looking forward to seeing the original movie.In the original episode after being brought out of cryogenic sleep Khan proceeds to take over the ship with sheer sex appeal by hitting up a truly desperate federation office who becomes instantly besotted with him becasue hes hot and single handedly hands him the ship. She then loses interest later on after kirk is being tortured to death and decides to free him which leads to kirk getting the ship back and for some reason abandoning all the super intelligent, super powerful humans who once took over the world in the past and started the eugenics war.... on an abandoned planet instead of putting them back into cryo freeze until society is capable of dealing with them, as they do in the modern movie \"Into Darkness\". He doesn't even keep them under federation supervision he could arrest them and incarcerate them into a high security prison or pretty much anything other than letting them roam free :SAnyway the movie takes this shoddy origin story and sculpts a pretty impressive and intimidating villian out of it. The stakes are high throughout the movie, the emotion is palpable and the reveal of kirk's son is a truly great piece of character development. They do **** all with it in the later movies but as far as the wrath of khan goes it was great storytelling.\nNot as good as the modern version but that's to be expected, still a very strong Trek film. It was very interesting to see what the modern movies are based on and how they built on those elements yet managed to keep true to the universe and tone while honouring the past actors.",

The over-sized models allowed for some particular gritty shots of exterior shots of the ships. I can only compare it to the feeling i get when i'm watching Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Because I'm particularly effected by ADD, i'm much more prone to watching Star Trek II rather than 2001. So I guess I'm admitting that i like this movie more than....wow, that's amazing. Kirstie Alley is this movie as well, and i'm curious about her performance. i've never seen her in a movie and been impressed with her, but in this movie i might go as far as to say that she is the best actor in the movie...which is a lot being i'm giving this movie a 9 out of 10. Kirstie Alley plays a vulcan in this movie. Her comic talent shines as she gives a brilliant deadpan performance that further evolves the stereotype that leonard nimoy invented. she's perfect. i hate star trek 3 because she's not in it. you'll hit yourself in the face as you watch this and think about the fact that this woman later went on to star in a movie with the olsen twins and steve guttenberg.",

ST 2 was the first Trek I ever saw, even before the Television show. This was what got me into Star Trek in the first place. This is a masterful work dealing with revenge and death. If you remember in the episode \"Space Seed\", Kahn was put on a planet by Kirk and left for dead. 15 years later, Kahn is back, and he wants revenge. Although this movie is dark and violent, it is still a masterpiece and the best Trek film. I could go on and on about how good it is.

But the effects overshadowed the close-knit Enterprise community that Gene Roddenberry had spent three long years creating in the mid-sixties.  Harve Bennett was hired to do the next Star Trek film, generally outlined to cost much less.  Once the story and the actors were in place, it couldn't miss.  I love this movie. As a \"Star Trek\" film, it is surpassed only by \"The Voyage Home.\"  The high-energy of the battle scenes swoop to the tragedy of Spock's death in the engine room, where one of the most famous friendships is once again testified to.  If you haven't seen this movie, then you should.  Even if you don't consider yourself a \"Trek\" fan.  Adventure, romance, action, tragedy...who could possibly ask for anything more in a movie?",

It's interesting that after all of Ricardo Montalban's years in the movies and on TV, it seems that this is the role he will be remembered best for. And with good reason, because he's magnificent. And Kirstie Alley was beautiful and witty; they should have paid her whatever she asked to be in all the rest of the sequels. The main cast, Shatner and Nimoy and the gang . . . well, they were their usual wooden selves, but we love them for that. Hey, they're no worse than Carrie Fisher or Harrison Ford, and they are considerably better than Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen.If only Paramount had not been quite so determined to use \"Star Trek\" and its fans as a cash cow.

And the familiar characters reappeared after being gone so long.There are mistakes, like when Kan's son shuts his eyes after he is 'dead' when Kan squeezes him tight. And one really has to wonder how a Science vessel can come into solar system and not realize that there is one less planet present (the idea in the movie being one has shifted its orbit after an explosion).

            "content": "When sci-fi is handled correctly. This film surpasses most other sci-fi movies, not only in story, but in dramatic battles and a strong hero(s) and one of cinema's most effective antagonists. Although effectively part of a trilogy set of movies, this being the first, it is a standalone classic which is often overlooked by critics who seek perfect sci-fi. Pioneering digital effects, the movie jumps from scene to scene with an incredible attention to detail. Several story arcs are created and completed. Kirk's dislike of getting old against his ultimate renewal of feeling youthful. Spock's arc of self doubt and meaning which started in Star Trek - The Motion Picture completes here by him making the greatest sacrifice. Kirk's son David is introduced, and the fact that his need for duty kept him away from Carol Marcus (Mother of David) and David himself (who was unaware Kirk was his father) - (this gets a subtle nod in Star Trek Generations upon Kirk meeting Sulu's daughter and him wondering how Sulu had time to have a family).The battle scenes are tense and full of nods towards naval battlefields and tactics. Kirk outsmarting Khan at every step is trumped in the final act by Kirk not seeing Khan being able to make the ultimate sacrifice. (A deleted scene, which was only partially filmed, does suggest that Khan has a child who is with him right up until then end, giving a further balance to his quest to destroy Kirk, however Harve Bennett felt this would detract viewers away from Khan's hatred and have viewers feel too much sympathy for the antagonist).Finally, it has to be said that James Horner's sweeping musical chorus of a soundtrack is revered as one of the best of all time. Fitting perfectly into the Capt Ahab revenge of Khan and the redemption of Kirk as a captain, and not sat behind the desk.Some say this is where the story should have ended, but a supremely low budget factored against superb box office returns inevitably led to a further sequel being commissioned, much to the annoyance of Leonard Nimoy who was under the impression he was finished with the Star Trek universe, more so when the title of the third film was promoted mere months after the release of this film. However, even Nimoy did agree that it was the right decisions to do. A directorial stint for the third and fourth films provided him with what he desired, a creative footstep into Hollywood.Without this film, there would likely be no Trek today. Or if it were, it would have looked very different. Trek's finest moment? Most will agree. Ultimately this film is a perfect example of great care going into a movie, not just to ensure it makes a return, but giving the fans what they crave for in a well handled way.",
