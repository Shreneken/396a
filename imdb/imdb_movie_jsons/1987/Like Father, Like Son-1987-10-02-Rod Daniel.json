            "content": "Like Father, Like Son is probably most appealing to 80s fans, presenting typical teen genre conflicts as well as 80s teen stars, Kirk Cameron and Sean Astin. Young kids might appreciate it simply for the story (despite it's lack of novelty) of a teenager getting all the priveleges of being an adult, while only having to change appearance and not attitude. The decade however, offering a nauseating selection of role switching comedies and parodies, may have the rest of us looking to avoid this repetition and searching for something else on the shelves. Chris Hammond (Kirk Cameron) is a high school senior. He's an average student, a decent track team participant, and likes a girl at school who happens to be dating a psychotic jock bully. And, his dad, Jack (Dudley Moore) is breathing down his neck to get him an ivy league school to study pre-med, leaving Chris secretly wanting to tell his dad to just let him make his own decisions about what he wants to do.Chris's buddy, Trigger (Sean Astin), has a wacky uncle who's staying with him. He lived in the desert for awhile, experimenting with body-switching potions. Trigger gets a hold of the brain transference serum and it switches Chris and Jack's brains so that Chris is Jack and Jack is Chris. There's a mistake here, in that their accents should've switched as well, since when Trigger tried it on the cat and dog, the cat barked at the dog and the dog meowed at the cat. But, it makes for a whole lot of trouble. The incredibly boring and sometimes big-shot Dr. Hammond has to settle on being a teenager awhile. And Chris has to settle for being Dr. Hammond, both without screwing things up. For Dr. Hammond, he hopes to get the ordeal with over quickly; but for Chris, there's advantages to not having to show up for school, take tests, and the like. But, they each grow quite irritable of the situation as they tend to screw up each other's lives. Dr. Hammond has a few nasty run-ins with the bully as Chris. And Chris, involved in an affair with the boss's wife, not only sets the living room on fire, but also risks his father's chances of becoming chief of staff. I still think it's a fun movie for kids and probably teenagers. Safe family fun for the most part anyways due to lack of sex, violence, and for the most part, language. However, Kirk Cameron did tend to get quite annoying at parts as the whiny teenager. Actually, Trigger was one of the best characters in the movie as a sort of slacker friend of Chris, except he's not in the movie all that much. I did like Chris as Dr. Hammond during the hospital scenes, when he had to take his med students on rounds, and didn't know what the heck he was doing. It has it's moments.",

            "content": "The comedy team of Dudley Moore and Kirk Cameron give this their all, but they come out on the short end of the stick with one of half-a-dozen films of the same theme that came out in the mid-to-late 1980's. This seemed had been already done going back to the 1930s, and with the success of \"Big\" in 1986, the theme was repeated with at least three other theatrical movies (and similarly structured stories), every Hollywood studio seemed to be ripping it off. But with some lacking originality, they made up in witty scripts, and unfortunately this one does not fall into that category.As high school student Kirk Cameron gets grossed out over the dissecting of a frog, docto father Dudley Moore proves his success in an upscale Los Angeles Hospital. the drinking of some sort of Native American potion all of a sudden switches their personalities, putting Cameron's awkward teenager into serious doctor Moore's body, and vice versa. Now they have to live each other's lives, and while the possibilities of funny situations seems endless, that rarely ever happens in this misfire, the weakest of the lot of the same carried over plot.As funny as Dudley Moore could be, it seems like he is simply just playing Arthur all over again, being a silly teenager rather than a foolish rich drunk. Cameron gets to show more range, but each of their situations have a sitcom feel, mostly undeveloped, and many of the supporting characters seem like cardboard cutouts. this seems like the type of film that knew of other Studios doing similar stories, and rushed it out to jump on the bandwagon without really getting together a great script. That weakens the impact, and ultimately, it just ain't that funny. Shots of late 1980's Los Angeles gave me some nostalgia, but that's not enough to make this memorable.",

            "content": "Like Father Like Son was made at the height of Kirk Cameron's bubblegum popularity as teen idol, courtesy of his television series Growing Pains which was dominating the ratings in 1987. Cameron was just getting into his fundamentalist religion kick so the script couldn't be too naughty.As it is it's a mildly amusing comedy of the Freaky Friday vein, only this time it's a father and son, Kirk's father in this case being Dudley Moore. Kirk's your typical teenage kid, just looking for a good time and not too serious. Moore is a very serious and respected surgeon who would like to be the new chief of staff at his hospital to replace Patrick O'Neal's whose recommendation on a replacement will probably make or break a candidate.Kirk's got some troubles of his own in the form of shapely Camille Cooper who's hitting on him. She's the girl friend of jock Micah Grant who hates Kirk and his friend Sean Astin.In fact Astin's archaeologist uncle is the cause of all the problems that Moore and Cameron face. The uncle Bill Morrison has come back from a dig at the Navajo reservation with a body transference medicine that Astin thinks would be worth a few laughs, even experimenting with a dog and cat on it. But when the maid thinks it's a condiment and Moore and Cameron use it on the spaghetti, strange things happen. Each lives about 36 hours in the other's bodies and the other's lives and generally make a mess of it. If you've seen both versions of Freaky Friday you've got a general idea of what's going to happen.The film did reasonably well at the box office though it failed to make Cameron a movie star. That didn't happen until Kirk started playing on the Christian film circuit. Moore and Cameron and Astin work well together and it's still mildly amusing.",

But he is very creative when he has to be and quite a schemer.Sean Astin is great as the best friend, and why wouldn't he be? Look who his parents are. Well, that doesn't always mean success, but he has gone on to have quite a career, and here we can see why.Kirk Cameron isn't that highly regarded, and he's no Mike Seaver here. If he has talent, that's the role where he showed it. Here, he's kind of ordinary, but he gets the job done. In the scene with the baby being born he really shines. There is also another kind of stereotypical scene where he goes beyond the usual, As a genius who has trouble with social interaction, he's no Iain Armitage, who is the master.Cloud Dancing from \"Dr. Quinn\" is the one who picks up Earl and carries him to the Navajo medicine man. I didn't know this until the closing credits. He was not known for being funny, but now that I know who it was, it was nice to see him with a sense of humor.Earl is given something to drink and immediately it becomes clear what has happened. The Navajo is horrified to look at the white man and see himself. The white man, apparently speaking the Navajo language, obviously feels the same way.Some questions I have. Chris has an appointment soon with a Northwestern recruiter. Not sure why Northwestern, because they are driving distance from Death Valley. Oh, well. We also don't know why Jack is British but living in the United States. By the way, this stuff that causes the body switching is clear, so why is Jack going to use that bottle by mistake, rather than the one full of red stuff?And one last adventure does not involve a car chase. It is just one car, driven recklessly, causing damage to itself and everything else as we must endure a band that put the heavy in metal, one that makes Autograph (which we and Jack had to endure earlier) look like The Eagles. The editing is interesting because we keep going Jack and forth between two locations, and each time we see the car again, the \"music\" continues from where it left off.It's not a kids' movie. Some curse words were obviously changed for TV. Who says \"dorkhead\"? And there is one scene of a sexual nature which, if you remember this man is actually a teenager, is actually in terrible taste, but doesn't go overboard.But cleaned up for TV as I saw it, I wouldn't say all kids should avoid it. It's pretty childish.Yes, we've seen this sort of thing before? So what. They're all unique, if you really think about it.And I had fun.",

            "content": "I enjoy this movie, I like it even better than Vice Versa, although Leonard Maltin gave it no stars. The biggest exception I noticed about his film, is how Kirk Cameron (Chris Hammond) was only 16, and a senior in high school, 17 in the movie. When in a majority of flicks the actors that age are in the early or mid twenties and look way too old. it's what a real high school looks like, and Clarence (Sean Astin-Samwise, Lord of the Rings Trilogy) his wacky, sarcastic friend, was in this when he was fifteen or sixteen, making him look actually a little young to be a senior. He is the one responsible for the body change, snatching an ancient potion from his archaeologist uncle. Chris' dad, Jack (Dudley Moore) is a heart surgeon, on the verge of being named chief of staff. And Chris is on his biology exam not seeming to have much of a clue what he's talking about, and is an average student. But then they switch bodies and Chris is in his dad's body and his dad has to go to school cause he's in Chris' body, and is really studious in his classes, even smarter than the teachers! While Chris in his dad's body doesn't have the slightest clue what he's doing as a heart surgeon, and has no sophisticated vocabulary, and parties like a child/teenager. Chris has bully problems at school and has to face up to a huge old looking kid who says \"dickhead\" And the kids at school think Chris is a dork, as his father, but the interns at the hospital think he's a lot of fun, chewing gum, driving a jeep, and taking them out for pizza and beer. The chief-of-staff's wife, a good 25-years younger than him, cheats on her husband and screws around with Jack' in Chris body, which leads to catastrophe. Anyway, I really like this movie. Here are some reasons why, and also why, I think it was superior to the others and should of gotten three stars, if not more. Despite the acting and script being considered inferior, this is the only one that makes me truly \"happy\" when watching it, it is set in southern California where the sun is always shining during the day. Sean Astin was in this at a young age, the kid is a teenager, and not a child, so there's two girlfriends in the movie. it is priceless watching Dudley Moore party and laugh watching MTV, and dance on the kitchen table to rock and roll. It teaches something about American History and how Okay became a word, through Chris' lecture in his dad's body at school. The interns have a bawl with Jack in Chris' body after work, eating pizza and drinking, Jack, Chris and Clarence go on a little vacation to get the antidote near the end of the movie, and he and his dad, hug each other and Cameron cries on cue, before the conclusion. Am I forgetting anything?",

The first 20 minutes or so are painless mediocrity, but then soon after the movie collapses. What's the problem? I think the main problem is that the characters are stupid. If I was in their situation, I know I would be terrified and trying my best to not raise suspicion. If the movie had done that, it could have been funny seeing these people trying to do their best but making mistakes. But the movie's two main characters seem to be trying their best to blow the charade - not realistic. And the movie's sense of humor is really bad - we have such stuff as audiences falling asleep during lectures, a gag that's done TWICE.

Dr. Jack Hammond (Dudley Moore) accidentally drinks a brain swap serum and ends up trading bodies with his son Chris (Kirk Cameron). Neither of them even try to pretend to be the other as they carry on in different bodies, in different environments, but with the exact same behavior.The monumental difference between this movie and Vice Versa (starring Judge Reinhold and Fred Savage) is that in Vice Versa the son was a 10-year-old-boy.\nIt's actually funnier, and in some ways adorable, to see a kid that young attempting to be an adult. Even if he's tries his best he's going to fail.In this movie, the son is seventeen so he has an inkling of what it takes to be an adult, or he can at least fake it. Chris not only doesn't try to be adult for the sake of his father, he actually regresses. I mean that he was acting more immature in his adult body than he did in his teenage body.

Mostly however, this is your average situation comedy.

            "review_title": "An amusing and promising concept ruined by a poor execution...",
            "content": "\"Like Father, Like Son\" used to be one of my favorites \u0085 for the time it lasted on a VHS tape, during eight little months\u0085 when I was ten. I'm not even sure it does count as an alibi. But let me contextualize this: it was the early 90's, Kirk Cameron was still in my mind Mike Seaver, the epitome of coolness and every Saturday night comedy was still under the 80's influence starring any of John Candy, Dan Aykryod or Dudley Moore. The premise of Moore and Cameron playing father and son and switching bodies (or minds) was so amusing it almost made me love the film before watching it. I realize that it takes more than a concept to make a movie, and I realize that the film might totally pass over a new generation who associates the name Kirk Cameron to some illuminated newborn bigot and might alas say \"Dudley Who?\" if you mention the name of the late actor. Some might even wonder what the hell is mother Camdell doing in this series and be shocked to see that the chubby Sam from the \"Lord of the Ring\" series used to be a clone of Marty McFly. But who am I kidding? The chances for the new generation to know about \"Like Father, Like Son\" are as low as Miley Cyrus playing the Easter bunny in the next Kirk Cameron movie. Rod Daniel's 1987 movie belong to the infamous league of forgotten 80's flicks that don't even benefit from a second watching.Indeed, all the nostalgia in the world can't prevent the film from a severe bashing, but still, how could a film reuniting so many acting talents (the supporting roles are good) and with such an amusing concept could generate such a lame and predictable story. Reading the trivia section on IMDb would almost make you believe the director and the actors approached the roles seriously or with the right comedic instinct, but the outcome doesn't validate a word they say and prove the late Ebert right. For one thing, Ebert said that a film involving a brain-transference serum wouldn't have any plot because such a serum would be its own antidote. That's the essence of the idiot plot and I do feel like an idiot not to have thought about it. But even by assuming that the antidote would be a bit more complex to find (still why would the Uncle bring with him the serum and not the antidote?), the film had more infuriating flaws to deal with.First, the film started well setting up both Dr. Jack and his son Chris Hammond as popular persons in their respective fields, an eminent surgeon promised to be elected head of staff and the cool kid who dates the prettiest girl and is the anchor leg in the next big relay race. The dialogues are convincing and the acting solid but once the switching occurs, the film all goes downhill. And I mean in an immediate way. Cameron was a normal teenager, not too wacky, not too weird, but from the minute Dudley Moore becomes embodies his son's role, he takes the most outrageous 180\u00b0 turn and starts bawling like a little child. I could pass over the fact that he acted shocked while he could tell what happened (he had just tired the serum on the cat and the dog) but his crying was totally out of character. I was like \"Chris wouldn't bawl like this\" and that's only the tip of the iceberg. None of the actors ever tried to capture the other's mimics, well, Cameron tried, for a while but just when he gets on school, he starts to act like a nerdy little geek with an awkward walk that had nothing to do with Dr. Chris Hammond confident stroll over the hospital walls. In fact, the whole body-switching thing was just the starter of a series of events where we can all powerlessly witness each part ruining the other's legacy. Dudley Moore plays Chris Hammond like a ten-year old boy and if Jack wanted to ruin his boy's reputation, he wouldn't have done better. Surely, even a teenager man in his 50's would understand the value of behavior in popularity. And it all escalates to a childish clowning during a boardroom meeting and a romantic dinner with the sexy Margaret Colin leading to a sofa in fire being thrown in a pool. And Chris leaving the concert because the music is too loud. Wow, over the top for Moore and underplayed for Cameron, how about playing the other side of the coin? There was a nice start when \"Chris\" in Moore's body realized he had a credit card and could drink, but wasn't he supposed to handle girls a way better, how does he turn so awkward when he meets Colin's character?The film always goes to the obvious gimmick, the song montage, the car chase, the fainting during the delivery scene, painful-to-watch awkwardness while the premise could cover many good things. The remark of Ebert about the actors' accents not changing can even seem as nit-picky, how about that one? Why would that cat bark if he switches mind with the dog? Why would Chris' nemesis want another fight after the beating he gave him a day prior? Why would they turn the head of the hospital into some 'villain' when it was Jack who asked for it by playing weird?So many questions but life is too precious to ever try to think of them, I won't cherish the film but the nice memory I had of i\u0085 while it lasted, and that ending that felt like a cherry on the cake at that time, but the cake was so under-cooked, the cherry miserably sinks inside it. A pity for such a promising concept, not to provide anything remotely amusing.",

He has many funny scenes and milks them for all they're worth, my favourite being the chewing gum/cigarette incident. The looks on his co-stars' faces is priceless. Watch also for Moore's date with Margaret Colin (that goes really badly) and when he does the rounds at the hospital.Unfortunately, there are a few flaws. There's a bit of swearing and sexual reference (which would make it an otherwise very suitable film for kids). It wastes the talent of Catherine Hicks in a surprisingly pointless and unnecessary role and Sean Astin is super-annoying (as always) as the \"wacky\" best friend/sidekick. The film also resorts to schmaltz at the end when it goes for a warm and fuzzy finale.Otherwise, a great film that's lots and lots of fun.

Examples of stupid acting while Dudly's mind was in Kirk: the way he arrogantly patronizes his classrooms rubbing his \"older education\" in everyone's face causing the other kids to really not like him, his loudly snitching on the bully in class right after he throws a wet gob of paper at the blackboard, the way he arrogantly talks to the bully while parking his car while being very unaware of how much he is further angering him (the bully was already getting annoyed with him earlier in the film during track practice), him running in the relay at the track meet and then the way he completely dove into the air like that too short of the finish line (what the hell was that?) and that weird loud breathing when he hit the ground, him on a date with the hot girl at a rock concert and complaining about the loud music, leaving early, then stupidly patronizing her while driving her home. Can you blame her for getting out of his car so turned off? Can you blame the bully for then beating the crap out of him (with what I mentioned he did with the bully earlier, plus him being out with the girl he's interested in)? Examples of stupid acting while Kirk's mind was in Dudly: his sissy little temper tantrum to Dudly's mind in Kirk while trying to drive to school. His dancing and yelling to loud rock music in the house. His painting the town red with Sean. His overly forced irritating yelling such as the way he was yelling/singing \"Jeremiah was a bullfrog\" after being dropped off at home by his interns at the hospital, his yelling \"I wanna be a doctor! I wanna be a doctor!\" at the hospital for no particular reason near the end of the movie, as if he was just finding out for the first time what he was. And what I mentioned before about his yelling and running after his \"son\" in the car trying to drive to his school.Then for the supporting characters: the high school kids (the bully, the hot girl, the other cliques that wouldn't except Kirk) were just tired retreads of other 80s high school movies. The seducing woman from the hospital was so snobby, the way she talked to Sean while with Kirk's mind in Dudly at the bar. And when he caught his sofa on fire her reaction was snobby, but he was acting pretty stupid there too so he probably deserved it. The chief executive boss at the hospital was a one dimensional jerk. Dudly did act pretty stupid and annoying, but should a boss completely write off a great surgeon who's been a valuable asset to the hospital for years just for one time speaking out of line at a board meeting (\"screw the insurance\")?",

The best (worst) example of this is the scene when Dudley Moore, playing an 18 year old in a 40 something body, is staying at home alone.  He's supposed to be a senior in High School and yet when left at home for 5 minutes he behaves like a 6 year old....playing loud music and jumping on the furniture.  Obviously the director just couldn't resist having Dudley Moore jump around like an idiot for a few minutes.Had the writer and director spent 30 seconds thinking about how people might really try to act in this situation it might have been entertaining...but then again this movie was made about 5 times in the space of 18 months in the late 80's anyway so I think the best idea would have been to get an original idea and not waste everybody's time.",

That one gets Malice.

Jack (Moore) is a surgeon. His son Chris (Cameron) is a student. And thanks to a Native American brain switching formula, they change bodies long enough to cause issues in one another's lives and also learn some lessons, because everyone always learns lessons in this movie. I mean - just look at every single Freak Friday movie.Director Rod Daniel made Teen Wolf, K-9, The Super, Beethoven's 2nd and Home Alone 4, so when he left moviemaking for photography - and didn't have nice tyhings to say about Hollywood - perhaps that makes sense.I'm certain that there are folks that grew up with this movie as a constant rental. Each generation gets its own body switch movie, right?",

It's like mixing oil and water and just doesn't work. Especially if your cast Kirk Cameron as Dudley Moore's son. Who thought that would be believable? Hey, let's take two of the worst actors in the world that are complete opposites and cast them as father and son.Then, to add to the puke factor, there's the 80's hair band background music. As if Cameron as son and Moore as father wasn't enough to induce projectile vomiting they pushed it one step further with the lame soundtrack.Then there's the story line, the script. Were they taking mind altering drugs when they wrote this? If so, it was something that caused complete stupidity.",

            "content": "This Freaky Friday type of movie has a very strange start, sort of similar to The Hot Chick. A wounded man staggers around in the desert, and he comes across a group of Indians who cure him. They feed him a liquid that allows him to temporarily change places with the next person he looks at, so he won't feel the pain while they operate on his leg. Then, the rest of the movie takes place in contemporary (1987) suburbia. Dudley Moore is a respected doctor whose son, Kirk Cameron, is a high school student who has no interest in science. Kirk's pal and neighbor, Sean Astin, gets ahold of the formula and accidentally slips it in Dudley's coffee. He looks at his son, and they switch!It's a very sweet, dated concept that unfortunately can't continue to be remade. Teenagers don't need to borrow their parents' ID to get drinks, and going on a spending spree with their credit card isn't even a thrill. \"Borrowing\" Dad's credit card is commonplace, and fake IDs are extremely prevalent. Also, as children have become more sexually active at a younger age, that advantage of \"old age\" is no longer a temptation either. But in 1987, it was still adorable and funny. It's very cute to see Dudley ordering his first martini. When the cocktail waitress asks if he wants it on the rocks, he answers, \"No, a glass would be fine. And could I have some ice in it?\" And when Kirk gives a lecture in school while acting like a total grown-up, it's pretty sweet. This isn't the greatest Freaky Friday spinoff ever, but if you like the cast or the 1980s high school time period, you might appreciate it.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. The very beginning when the man is staggering around in the desert the camera swirls around a bit. Also when Dudley and Kirk first switch places, the camera is unsteady. Also, then Dudley and Sean decide to go clubbing, there are some canted angles, and that will make you sick. In other words, \"Don't Look, Mom!\"",

There are so many quotable lines from Like Father Like son. I love when Dudley M. as his son, is walking through the hospital with his interns making the rounds and he has no idea what to do. They interns are all following him as he slowly and awkwardly tries to figure out where to go and when he thinks he's finished the task, he looks at the interns and says, \"great rounds\". So funny.\nI saw some really bad reviews here about this movie: Why? They must have something against really funny movies with great actors.",

The Movie is about Jack Hammond (Dudley Moore) who is a Surgeon & his son Chris Hammond (Kirk Cameron) Switching Bodies. I First Heard of this Movie on Siskel & Ebert's worst Movies of 1987 and I agree with Gene Siskel & Roger Ebert. The Movie is Really Stupid with the whole body swap plot. The Movie's plot involves the father acting like the son and the son acting like the father. When I watched this movie I didn't know this movie was PG-13 because there is a lot of swearing in this movie. I also thought the ending to be weird. 2/10",

There are some funny moments, and though overall it's not very high-quality, watch a few minutes of it on TV, you might even like it a bit.",
