            "content": "Zoya Akhtar's Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, through the lives of three friends, presents the world of contemporary Indian youth, who are successful, affluent yuppies. They just enjoy life because financially they have the means to do it. In mood and execution the film is very modern, light, yet it entails complex relationships in family and between friends. Essentially, in this regard, it has an uncanny resemblance to Dil Chahta Hai, though it's an altogether different film. The movie is non-sentimental and realistic, but it is emotional, and surprisingly enough, quite poetic. The dialogue by Farhan Akhtar is for the most part excellent.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is captivating, interesting and entertaining, and it captures the beauty of Spain with great mastery. At times this presentation is too perfect, but then it's a movie so that's what audiences want to see. It is beautifully shot, with an excellent cinematography working in its favour. The background score is very good, and the songs are very fun and catchy. All these aspects create a lyrical tone that is very uplifting to watch. Some scenes are just amazingly captured. The one when the guys get out of the water after diving, is pure magic. So is the one which shows them skydiving.The film is definitely not flawless, at least from my point of view. The main moral of the story, that life is only once and one should live it to the fullest, is successfully conveyed, generally speaking, but then at times it becomes over-repetitive and saccharine. Towards the second half, it looks like it tries hard to be inspiring and feels too larger-than-life, which it out of place in a film trying to portray realism. The ending is one such instance. Similarly, the friendship between the three leads, which is generally done well, often lacks the natural, understated camaraderie it requires (not because they fight, but in spite of it).Hrithik Roshan finally works as part of an ensemble cast where he doesn't have to carry a film all alone. He plays an imperfect man who grows as a character, and he does it ably. Farhan Akhtar is for the first time convincing and he's natural and enjoyable in a meaty role. Abhay Deol, as the flamboyant, playful guy who's unsure of whether he does or does not want to marry yet, is likable but still a bit of a disappointment. Deol is according to me the best actor of the three, based on what I've seen before, but in this film his character often lets him down--a sad case of weak writing--as it lacks true complexity.I never thought I'd say that, but Katrina Kaif is surprisingly effective and natural, and her part is actually very well written. Laila is lovely, kind, radial and, probably more importantly, is of mixed ethnicity, which makes her line delivery and accent justifiable and credible in this film. This may be the benefit, as it eases the work for Kaif, who, instead of focusing on her accent and Hindi line delivery (which was anyway poor), can for one concentrate on the character. She is never great, but she is good. Kalki is better in a smaller part. Speaking of small parts, Naseeruddin Shah and Deepti Naval, in just two brief scenes each, shine.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara does partially bring forth another step in Hindi cinema's growth and departure from popular convention. It is thoroughly enjoyable, it has both style and substance, and though in my opinion it is nowhere an extraordinary film and is far from being really great, it is still a worthy and appreciable effort about living life to the fullest and cherishing every moment of it. Worth watching.",

            "content": "No Farhan Akhtar movie has disappointed me - whether he stars in it or directs it. I am not claiming that he makes great movies - I am merely agreeing that his films are funny, intelligent and definitely entertaining.The Hrithik-Farhan-Abhay trio have done a fabulous job. Incidentally, Katrina too is associated with a movie that makes more sense than all her prior films put-together. There are many instances in the movie where it appears that the actors are being themselves rather than actually acting - which is also the underlying theme of the movie. Be yourself and follow your heart, wherever you go, whatever you do. Credit should be given to director Zoya Akhtar. This movie proves that her previous, Luck By Chance (2009) was not just luck. Cinematography and art direction have also been handled well. It was very refreshing to see Indian actors in casual street clothes holidaying in Spain. However, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy are getting way too repetitive with their tunes, many songs give us a feeling that we have heard them before. This is a summer movie that will give you what you seek - humor and entertainment. Wouldn't it be really fun if we could go on a nice little vacation and figure out what we want to do in life ? Wish life could be that simple.",

            "content": "I have seen the film this morning and all the efforts put in are worth the movie. As expected, this is a good movie about grown up men and their emotional problems, which is naturally expected from the team that gave us Dil Chahta Hai and Rock On.A group of three friends (Hrithik, Abhay Deol and Farhan Akhtar) embark on a road trip in Spain as a part of a bachelor party for Abhay Deol, who is getting married to Kalki, and confused. Hritik and Farhan have their own personal issues too.The movie is a joy ride with subtle comedy. Farhan Akhtar's comic timing is impeccable. The comedy that was written just out of a ladies hand bag is too good.The wafer thin story line is beautifully put on screen with a superb screenplay. The performances are nothing less than your expectations with Hritik in the ensemble. Deepti Naval and Naseeruddin Shah add up to the list of artists.The movie portrays very heavy topics like marriage, love and Work. Yet, due to the sublime comedy you are never bored. I guess that is a mark of excellent script.Here is one line I want to pick up from this movie. Kalki says this line to Abhay Deol, her fianc\u00e9. \"You enjoy your bachelor trip. Aakhir shaadi ke baad you wouldn't feel like going around with your friends any more.\" And you should see the expressions on the faces of the three guys...And yes, La Tomatina festival, Spainish beaches, and Katrina Kaif were a treat to watch.",

            "review_title": "Brilliantly showcases India's growing individualism",
            "content": "On the surface, this movie is a fun-filled breath of fresh air. Fantastic starcast!!! Spain has been captured absolutely beautifully, and its culture has been shown very respectfully from the Tomatino festival to the bull race. It is refreshing to see brand new locales never shown in Bollywood with a down-to-earth yet glamorous starcast. Music is terrific as well.Each character and dialog has been penned with great consideration, and I am sure they are captured from real life. One can easily relate to the camaraderie among the three friends whether it be their silly, nonsensical inside jokes, impromptu fun-filled moments, or moments of pain and joy that strengthen their bonds, reminding one of his/her own most sincere friendships. Farhan's character's poems are delightful. The movie has been directed magnificently. There are some amazing scenes, my favorite being Hrithik's becoming inundated with feelings after his deep-sea diving adventure. Performances are great by all, but Hrithik is the most impressive. Katrina also suited the role wonderfully.However, dig deeper and take a step back, and you'll see a brilliant, thought-provoking, and excellently written film. While we are familiar with the Carpe Diem theme, we have never seen it embraced so wholeheartedly and taken so literally as it has been in this movie. As India's economy and mindset continues to liberalize, we see the birth and emergence of the carefree individual. There are numerous instances and decisions that display this attitude. The one that stands out is Abhay's decision to cancel his marriage despite the fact that both he and his fianc\u00e9 like each other, he has proposed, and both families are involved. Another is Naseerudin Shah's dismissive attitude of his actions when he was young and his running away from his responsibilities for his artistic pursuits. Farhan and Hrithik have a one-night stand not knowing if they will see their partners in the future. All these incidents are not at all shown in a negative light. On the contrary, they are shown as a part of life that one should have the courage to accept so that each person can live his/her dream.ZNMD captures this mindset prevalent among the youth in India's metros and showcases it on a such a grand scale, which is surely going to accelerate this new attitude as it permeates throughout India. I believe this is going to make this a cult film to remember, which can join names like 3 Idiots, Taare Zameen Par, Udaan, and Wake Up Sid. I personally find it fascinating to see history repeating itself, with India's cultural revolution an uncanny d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of 1960s America, which also had its share of cult films. (Some films to check out include The Graduate and Pleasantville.)On the whole, this idea of living each day as it is your last, not caring about what others will say, do, or think and pursuing your dreams without worrying about the consequences is encouraged. Some may find this thinking too radical and irresponsible, while others will find it liberalizing and enlightening. Purists and conservatives might find this movie disturbing.",

            "review_title": "Perfect summer movie about the journey of Life",
            "content": "\"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara\" (ZNMD) is a complex, honest, and thoroughly refreshing story about friendship, about love, about choices, about ... well ... the journey of Life (lit. 'zindagi'). Writer-Director Zoya Akhtar takes three characters we might think we've seen before ... but deftly makes them original, fresh, and unexpectedly engaging. Her intelligent script perfectly balances the very real, even painful, personal transformation of each character with moments of joy, wit, charm, and humour.No one's Life Journey is ever quite what one plans!Our protagonists? Three best friends since childhood: Arjun (Hrithik Roshan), now an investment broker in London; Imraan (Farhan Akhtar), an advertising copywriter in Delhi; and Kabir (Abhay Deol), a construction architect in Mumbai. Ten years after college Kabir's imminent wedding impels 'The Three Musketeers -- all for one, and one for all!' -- to finally embark on the many-times-deferred adventure challenge they'd always planned.ZNMD explores whether three grown men can survive a 3-week road trip together *and* still remain friends *and* still be the same people.Think you've heard similar, before? Guess again! Ms Akhtar elevates the basic 'road movie' premise into something rare and sublime: brilliant character-driven comedy never cheap but often laugh-out-loud funny, and so true to life and people each of us actually know that it genuinely moves the heart as well as the mind and funny-bone. As each ZNMD character in turn challenges his own fear, whatever personal demon that has been holding back his life, it becomes our victory, too.See ZNMD and discover: *your* life may change, too!Such strong story and plot would be lost, without great acting.Farhan Akhtar just gets better and better, as an actor, every time out of the gate. Already one of India's best young directors, his deceptively brash but sensitive and layered acting in ZNMD is quiet excellence ... and deliciously funny.Abhay Deol is not exciting, but I like his potential. A good foil for the other two.However the real revelation in ZNMD is, most surprisingly, he whom we might have *thought* most familiar. Hrithik Roshan we see so often in heavy dramatic and/or demanding multi-part roles -- because, let's face it, he's that rare actor who CAN do them, and do them brilliantly well -- that it's easy to forget just how plain damn funny and versatile he can be. Casting one of the world's more notorious compulsive workaholics as, well, a compulsive workaholic? Absolute genius!On the distaff side ... Katrina Kaif. Wow! Where did this performance come from? She's always been beautiful, of course, but in ZNMD for the first time she shows subtlety and depth as an actress. Easily, her very best work to date.Cannot finish without special mention of the fantastic music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy, long my favourite Hindi film composers. Their ZNMD soundtrack perfectly backdrops the film's emotional journey. Irresistibly hummable music spans the full range of moods and emotions, much like our three main characters: everything from amusingly lighthearted ('Senorita', sung by Mssrs Roshan, Akhtar, & Deol) to cool and modern ('Ik Junoon -- Paint It Red') to reflective ('Der Lagi Lakin') and even unabashedly romantic ('Khaabon Ke Parinday').But the rocking 'Dil Dhadakne Do' seems to capture the very Joy of Living ... and that is the ultimate spirit of Zoya Akhtar's ZNMD.Perfect summer movie! 10/10Best film I've seen yet from anywhere in the world, thus far in 2011.",

            "content": "When was the last time you saw a feel good movie? When was the last time you laughed at simple silly conversations, when was the last time you remembered your bachelor days (only if you are married), when was the last time a movie made you think about your life, when was the last time a movie inspired you to enjoy the simple things in life, when was the last time a movie inspires you to let go off your fears..... Well not in the near past, definitely not from Bollywood. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes you through the simple moments of life, the life that every one miss out due to their busy schedule, commitments, etc..etc... and the movie does it through the life of three friends and their extended bachelor party trip. The beauty of the movie is that it concentrates on the life of the friends and how they let go their resistance to themselves and their fears rather than showing obscenity that normally rules movies which are based on bachelor party trips. Zoya does a fantastic job in making the viewers feel every part of the movie with a beautiful blend of nature, good camera work, good script and three gifted actors. There is not a moment in the movie which feels out of place, no songs which you feel is there to enhance the marketability of the movie, everything flows smoothly, everything blends so nicely which gives you the feel good factor that you expect from the movie. All the actors were fabulous and were perfect fit for the roles. To start in alphabetic order i will start with Abhay. What to say about this actor, he brings life to his roles and he has proved it over and over in his movies. I couldn't think about any actor who could have blended so well with the character in the movie like Abhay did. There is no replacement for him. I cant enhance on his character as it will give away the plot. The scenes where all the three friends make fun of people through their silly childhood act under the leadership of Abhay can only be carried out well by Abhay.Hritik is an actor who can do wonders when he lands the right roles. When even the new entrants avoids multi starrier movies, he has taken a role where other actors share more or less the same screen space, with no insecurity and no ego. In the movie you get to see a completely different Hritik, with a script which does not glorify him, he is just a friend among the three and he brings life to the movie with his charm and charisma. Farhan was bit of a surprise to me. He has grown as an actor from \"Rock on\" and \"Karthik calling Karthik\". I always found him to be more fit for a serious character than for the joker in the pack act. He does it extremely well. Probably its because of my prejudice that it was hard for me to take him in the role, but i had to let go my resistance.Katrina portrays a character which is similar to her real life, a mix breed of Indian and Brit, a freedom loving, \"live today\" kind of girl. Her combination with Hritik is electrifying. Kalki is such a good actress. Her expressions helps you relate well to the character. There is nothing to give out as a story, its all about three friends on a trip and trying out different things that they never tried before and how those things change there lives. But the beauty is in the details and climax. I think how the movie ends could have been better but song at the end of the movie with the credit makes up for it. Overall Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara impressed me and lived up to my expectation and above. I hope you would like the movie too. But 'hey', everyone has different opinions, the general review by the critics for the last two movies i reviewed were totally against mine. So don't go for the review rather go for the movie and decide for yourselves.Read my reviews on the site www.Movierecycle.com",

            "content": "Review in form of an open letter to Farhan Akhtar,Dear Farhan,You simply rock. As director you have created all brilliant films, your debut film Dil Chahta Hai is a cult film, which inspired all directors of India to make fresh looking light hearted urban films. Then came Lakshya, which was not commercially that successful, but was nevertheless a good film. Don, from which I expected nothing, hated the idea as the original starring Big B is one of my most fav Big B film, was splendid and established you as master. As producer, you have attempted fantastic films too. And now as an actor, you are getting better and better day by day. You rocked in Rock On, you were fantastic in LBC and KCK and in ZNMD too you have successfully stolen the show from my favorites Hrithik Roshan and Abhay Deol who have established themselves as good actors.Your role in the film is quite meatier and helps you stealing the show. Hrithik (whom you originally wanted to cast in DCH) is again fantastic in serious-all-business-minded-guy and changed-in-love-living-life-guy both. Abhay Deol is as always dependable, his tricks in the films are hilarious. Chemistry between you three is awesome. It feels like three real friends are on road trip.I hope you make sequel to this as producer, keeping Zoya on director's seat again, as I think, she was brilliant as director. She might have lived her life with lots of male friends as it not for a single moment seems like a film directed by lady director (which was the only minus point of LBC from my point of view). Hoping to see more from her.Dialogues are fantastic and makes one laugh, smile and think for sure. Story, Screenplay and Script are marvelous. Music is in rhythm with film's flow.All positive \u2013 No. Something minor which I found not-so-positive was Katrina's suitability for Laila's role and SEL's music. Katrina has done decent work compared to her past films, but fails to convince what her character needs to convince (and though I don't like Kariena that much, but I feel she suited for this role very much) though Hrithik being her counter part balances very well, and Hrithik and Katrina looks good together. SEL's music is not as great as their former films, though manages to please.Fav Moments in the film: Too many. Though listing some of them.1. Kabeer's all tricks 2. Imran's flirt with Laila and her friend 3. Imran's each funny comment 4. Imran \u2013 Arjun fights 5. Bagwati 6. Each Poetry recited by Imran 7. The moments which inspires those Poetries 8. In the Air Scenes 9. Imran & Salman's meeting 10. Imran & Arjun's meeting their after 11. Kabeer's Flashback 12. Arjun crying after Underwater 'Meditation'All and over, it's not DCH, it's not Rock On. Though, it has shades of both the films, but it's quite different story to tell and as it has many pleasing moments, one must watch it.A film fan \u2013 Hardik Raychanda",

            "content": "Before going for this movie I was careful not to read anything about it, not watch a single trailer. This extremism mainly comes from my distrust on Indian Media which trashes movies that are comfortably awesome. Okay. If you are planning to go for it, do not read the rest of this. Come back and do it. This movie deserves an open mind. It shouldn't be that you go inside the theater with some invisible strings controlling how you perceive it. Let me tell you it is simple. It is also beautiful. And the combination makes it immense.Right from the first scene, the director makes this his own. I wonder how many directors in this industry will be able to give a complete character definition of the protagonists through a sequence depicting their luggage-packing-styles for a 3 week trip. Zoya Akhtar does exactly that. She is a genius. I'll come back to her.Lets look at the actors. Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar, Kalki Koechlin, Katrina Kaif and Hrithik Roshan. Abhay Deol is a stalwart. He has been a part of movies that have changed the face of Indian Cinema. Hrithik Roshan is another great actor. His movies have always contained a central theme of self-improvement. And for me, he is mind-blowing. Farhan Akhtar is a multi talented dude. Acting, singing, directing with equal panache. Any competitors? No. Kalki Koechlin has proved her worth in Shaitan and Dev D.The real surprise in this movie comes from Katrina Kaif. She is amazing in this movie as the NRI diving instructor with high intellect. She embodies the role with such ease that she never looks the out-of-place girl she usually does. And she is hot in a very warm way. Her physicality is projected and used by Zoya in a controlled manner which enhances her beauty.Hrithik is at his best, giving 100% to the role and carrying the transformations in his character so smoothly that at the end you feel happy for him. His journey across his life comes alive on screen through his facial expression. And eyes. The use of sunglasses by Zoya is absolutely perfect.Abhay is the usual casual fellow you could find strewn all over India. But such is his expertise, he makes that guy stand out. Where Farhan and Hrithik have characters with a certain premise, Abhay's Kabir(a) is a free-bird. And boy, how he uses the freedom! A treat to watch, his dialogue throwing style adds a very important spice to the movie. It pierces you.Kalki is good. With a limited screen-time, she fares really well. She has one shriek in the whole movie and one funny sequence while singing \"I'm a hot chick in a hard rock world\". These two scenes show us why she is different. Pretty powerful stuff. The perfect sugar coated knife.Farhan. Hats off. You just blew my expectation ceiling with an atomic bomb. Perfect, infallible comic timing. Add to that the raspy, metal-on-wood voice, the casual sense of style, the few looks of soul-searching and the full blown expression of joy after Sky Diving. What you get is in my opinion the best performance I have seen in some time. Character constructed, deconstructed, resurrected with the absolute smoothness of a tequila shot.Cinematography. The whole movie is pivoted on the use of short range focus. Pure genius. It makes the scenes look alive. Almost as if you are looking at the characters in reality.Locales. Its one thing to choose correctly and absolutely another to use it. ZNMD sells Spain like Rafael Nadal and Barcelona. The azure blue ocean, the gray and dark plateaus, the vibrant green forests, the super sexy roads and a flaming yellow sunset. Breathtaking.Songs. What lyrics. Perfectly picturised. Totally blends into the script.Background score. I can't stop if I start on this. The use of the heartbeat promotes the signature sound from the murky depths of Kal Ho Na Ho to the actual surge of nervous energy it stands for. The use of the silencing technique while slowing up the screen pace creates magic moments. And whoever played the rapturous guitar chords did a great job. Awesome.Dialogues. Great. General stuff mostly but again, the relevance and timing kills it.All these factors combined with the finesse of Zoya creates the unforgettable experience of ZNMD. The movie is about a lot of things. About relationships, about self discovery, about losing control, about life in a microscopic view. But above all, it glorifies friendship, a virtue that is priceless. It will take you through a plethora of emotions, evoked by the various situations faced by Imran, Kabir and Arjun. The situations poised are some real problems the current society is facing like career v/s life, identity crisis, family pressure and relationship maintenance. And truly, they fit the characters.The single thing that separates this movie from other hits is the creation of numerous magic moments. Directorial expertise blends with the awesome crew work to make you jump in mirth, look with awe, feel good from within, suppress a tiny tear drop, dance in your mind and applaud a timely joke. I would recommend this movie to everyone, just like Iqbal. It will give you wings. And it will give you the desire to take flight, to live your life like never before.Finally, the idea of using shayaris to verbally emote key junctions of the movie is brilliant. In Farhan's voice, it adds to the overall positive vibration of the movie and moves you. Excellent. Thank you Bollywood, for making this movie.",

But this movie has turned out to be a vagabond of friendship, love, adventure, emotions and above all, LIFE.I always believed that Farhan Akhtar is a good showman. Right from Rock On!!, Luck By Chance and the duh Kartik Calling Kartik. But this movie has proved it that he has all the elements that are needed in an actor. He can dance, can cry (can sing of course) and now, he can make you laugh. Abhay \u2013 Farhan \u2013 Hrithik are the three mesquiteers.Zoya Akhtar is one more reason to watch this movie. The way she directed Luck By Chance was not all serendipitous, and she has proved it. ZNMD is all her baby. The male bonding penned and filmed by her is pleasant. The Spanish locations are exotic. Dialogues (By Farhan Akhtar) are real and spontaneous. Movie runs with its own good slow pace, which is very much needed for the road movies. Many scenes halt the heart and literally put you on an adventure mode.Movie would have been a way better if songs were good. Editing needed a bit more stitch. I have no complaints regarding the length of the movie, as I can watch this Spanish odyssey for more than two hours with a tub of pop corn and a coke.Overall, this road movie is a trip to remember.",

            "content": "Farhan Akhtar's Dil Chahta Hai was an iconic movie and was like a breath of fresh air at the time of its release. Zoya's film is a wonderful expression and exploration of the new social dynamics in a fresh new idiom heralded by her brother's earlier work. In the last decade we have seen how some filmmakers have quickly adopted a new idiom, a meta language to depict the changing world order and the place that the modern urban Indian holds within it. Zoya does this beautifully thus elevating what could have been a very ordinary story to a level where it achieves an iconic status. The film depicts the coming of age of a trio of young urbane successful Indians who have to go through certain rites of passage to reach self realization. The element of modernism comes in via the unorthodox paths that these young men adopt to reach that vital stage of real adulthood when they are able to exchange short term temporary needs for real happiness, a kind of worldly \"moksha\" (oxymoron!)The trio undertakes a journey which becomes a metaphor for the journey of the self from boyhood to adulthood. Male bonding and real brotherhood (despite the fact that these men are just friends) is the thread that binds the story in a tightly woven fabric of delightful insights into the complexity of relationships in a modern milieu where the norms of old morality have been quietly exchanged for new ones. Love, romance, sexuality are dealt with in a way that is candid, frank and fresh. The locales that are chosen as settings for this journey are exquisite and breathtakingly beautiful, thus underlining the immense beauty of the world that lies at our feet when we are young and the world is still unexplored. So for example,we have one of the characters in a deep sea dive exploring the depths of the ocean and being reduced to tears by its beauty. The movie abounds in such life changing moments and there is not a single scene when the audience finds it difficult to relate to the protagonists or the storyline. I watched the movie on a week night in a mid-Manhattan cinema and the audience was laughing and silent at all the appropriate places. The film had hit the right spot. I congratulate Zoya and her team on the tight script, the casting, the excellent uplifting cinematography complemented by Shankar Ehsaan Loy's music and the wonderful direction of three great actors. I have always liked Abhay Deol. He is a brave actor and takes on roles that are not necessarily \"heroic\" (as in Bollywood) and always essays them well. Hrithik is seen in a new light and the sensitivity that he brings to his role is worth applauding. Farhan purports to be the \"Joker\" of the pack but is carrying a very real angst in his soul and that is done very well. For me the big surprise of the film was Katrina who comes across as having matured as an actor and looks gorgeous at the same time. There is a new wonderful trend in Indian cinema which we hope will continue unabated and is not killed by the more inane, mind numbing Bollywood brand of cinema. The only thing that will go against this film is that it will not appeal to the masses in the hinterlands where \"DABANGG\" has set a benchmark.",

            "review_title": "Its not a film but a OSHO-nik kind of life teaching experience which needs to be watched by all as a must to learn the essential basics of LIVING.",
            "content": "As I am always partial for the films, which have the power to add something valuable and constructive in your routine lives through their expressive content, therefore I have all good things to say about ZNMD with only 3 negative points which I would like to mention first (apart from its inspired poster). One is its weak soundtrack - lacking the much required melody, which could have taken the important theme of the film to more greater heights. Secondly the film is all about the RICH PEOPLE who can roam around the world as easily as blinking the eye without worrying about any finance or VISA problems. And lastly the overall feel, look and language of the film is entirely Urban and hence it may not be able to impress the people living in Rural regions who would not be able to relate with it. Also, though its basic outline seems to be written around Farhan's earlier DIL CHAHTA HAI, but as the movie progresses it goes on to a different journey altogether which has all the essential life ingredients ranging from friendship, love, sex, hate, fun to the spiritual hidden urges of a human being. But coming to the real value of the film, it is arguably one of the most intelligent and finest movies made in the recent times in Bollywood. Yet it is to be understood that the appreciation here is meant more for its superlative life teaching content and less for its cinematic or entertainment value. Zoya Akhtar delivers a more polished and refine film as her second venture which should be essentially considered as an important spiritual lesson and not just a New Movie meant for entertainment. One reason for this remains that the film doesn't have a Great Storyline. It hasn't got anything new as far as the plot is concerned. But it does have many GOLDEN NUGGETS evenly distributed throughout the film which need to be collected by the viewers and taken home. Contrary to all expectations, the most appreciable step taken by the director in the film is that she doesn't treat any single person as a big star particularly Hrithik Roshan. The film starts off simply without any flashy introduction of its cast. The three lead heroes are all given equal mileage and importance with each one of them leaving his own mark on the viewer individually. And that's indeed a great vision followed by the writer and director. The film basically moves around a road trip and three daring adventures the boys wish to experience in their lifetime. But the condition is that they all have to do it together as a must without any escape or excuse. So if you watch it as a Bollywood movie having an interesting starcast and nice look which might have some great emotional story to tell, then you are sure going to be disappointed. Hence, my suggestion would be to watch it as an adventure movie with people having fun on the screen and realizing their inner potentials on a road trip.Along with its splendid cinematography capturing some breathtaking underwater scenes, landscapes and unseen sequences, the film might turn out to be a cherishable experience for many, fulfilling their own hidden wishes which they may have forgotten by now. Yes, it's a bit lengthy in its second half and some may find its ending also a little abrupt. But if you can really search for all those hidden spiritual messages in its various sequences, then in all possibilities you would like to see it again for anything which you may have missed sipping your drink or talking to your friends in the theater. ZMND not only delivers with its splendidly written dialogues by Farhan Akhtar himself, but also communicates with its viewers through its SPEAKING SILENCES in the scenes. For instance just try to feel Hrithik's natural expressions when he comes out of the water and cries after having an unexpected life time experience. Or just go blank with the zed black screen when the three boys touch the ground after their incredible Sky Diving adventure. And not to be forgotten the never-seen-before adventures on the celluloid, such as The Tomato crushing festival and the Bull encounter run towards the end. Performance wise, the film can be included among the better performances of everyone in the team including, Hrithik, Farhan, Abhay, Katrina, Kalki, Naseeruddin Shah, Deepti Naval and Zoya herself (as a writer- director). And the one person who is sure going to get a huge increase in his fan base has to be Farhan Akhtar, who shows a remarkable sense of comic timing and screen presence in his own home production. But if you ask who is the best among them all then I would like to name Katrina and Hrithik who really have done something against their own image and persona. Especially Hrithik, who plays a simple, well established business man in the film and his character has nothing to do with his Bollywood's Superficial Hero type of image (against all expectations). And Katrina plays it real cool and subtle showing a great amount of transformation in her lovable performance. Abhay as usual impresses with his out of the box act and proves once again that he is surely blessed with a unique sense of cinema.It is quite possible that a certain section of viewers and critics may not like the film for their various reasons. But truly speaking I loved the film may be because I myself have experienced few of these adventures in my real life and believe me they are not just adventures but in disguise are\"Spiritual Experiences\" like \"A Meditation\"as rightly quoted by Katrina in the film. So if you wish to have a similar kind of experiences without going on to holiday then simply go for ZNMD at the earliest.",

The movie starts with Kabir (Abhay Deol) getting all set to be married with Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). Then, Kabir, along with his school- buddies Arjun (Hrithik) and Farhan (Imran) set off for a trip (after some hiccups), where they all would participate in adventure sports of choice of each one of them. The trip gradually portrays various aspects of each of the character. Along with the adventure sports, all of which are greatly shown, the humor is very subtle and nice. Performance of the lead actors is engaging. Farhan Akhtar as Imran is the more lovable one, with most of the funny one-liners, than his friends. He manages to pull off an entertaining performance. Abhay Deol, as always, is very good as the leader of the pack. He portrayed his dilemma regarding his marriage in a very convincing manner. Hrithik's character has more dark shades than the others, and it was his brilliance that made the character's transformation look enthralling. Amongst the ladies, Kalki is great as the overbearing and possessive fianc\u00e9e. Katrina looks and also acts well whenever she plays a NRI character. Much like herself.

            "content": "Director Zoya Akhtar's debut \"Luck by Chance\" was a perfect film. Without a single thing amiss, the clear-eyed unsentimental tale of a couple of strugglers in the Hindi film industry stayed with me for days. Of course, there was some irony that a child of privilege with access to Hindi cinema's biggest and brightest talents should make a film about newcomers scrambling for their lucky break: Zoya is the daughter of screenplay writer/lyricist/poet Javed Akhtar and his former wife Honey Irani. Her stepmother\u2014known internationally\u2014is Shabana Azmi; her brother Farhan Akhtar\u2014a successful director\u2014made another foray into acting in Zoya's film, and the slew of boldface names in cameos announced that this was no ordinary debut. But one can hardly fault her for the accident of birth; what was noteworthy was that she put her connections to excellent use and crafted a truly fine film.I couldn't wait to see her sophomore effort: \"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara\", which I enjoyed much as one might a mousse au chocolat. It was tasty and fattening and very good to look at. I'm still pondering whether it has any major cinematic merit. My friends and I agreed that it was very much an NRI-friendly film: most of the action takes place in a breathtakingly beautifully-photographed Spain, with a few scenes in London. The characters speak English for the most part, along with sporadic bursts of flawless Spanish and Japanese, and the occasional lapse into Hindi. ZNMD could also be looked at as the armchair sociologist's handbook on the complex mating rituals of the rich and gorgeous. The cast, without exception, is privileged, affluent, and beautiful; their major problems in life would make a Mumbaikar or Delhi-ite burst into derisive laughter. In fact, if a dehati (villager) were to see the film, he might scratch his head in befuddlement and wonder what the hoopla was about. From his point of view, these folks had hit the jackpot, but the ingrates persisted in whining. Still, even the rich have problems which cause them enough angst to require much soulful gazing at Spanish oceans at sunset, and conscientious filmmakers owe it to them to handle them with sensitivity, good lighting, and hypoallergenic makeup.With this film, Zoya Akhtar appears to have joined the ranks of the School of Aspirational Filmmaking. Its foremost proponents are Karan Johar and 99% of the directors ever employed by Yash Raj Films. Their films\u2014set predominantly in foreign countries\u2014are made for the new consumerist India. Their characters are upwardly mobile non-resident Indians, and the message to every brown person seems to be: you, too, can escape India's shores and live in a 50,000 square foot mansion on a fifty-acre estate in the country of your choice, drive fast cars (or a beaut of a vintage one, as here) and romance impossibly beautiful chiffon saree-clad damsels. How is never addressed.ZNMD has a surfeit of good taste; Zoya's cast\u2014all beautiful\u2014lives abroad in chic monochromatic minimalist apartments, is multi-lingual, dresses impeccably, and can tell the varietal and vintage of a wine from the merest whiff of its cork. The slim story line concerns three college buddies who set out on the bachelor trip to end all bachelor trips. They had intended to take this vacation four years earlier, but two of the friends had a spat and the scars remain. Now one of the trio is getting married and the other two must give in to his emotional plea to resurrect their foreign travel plans. So off they go to Spain in all its sun-drenched glory. They run into Laila (Katrina Kaif), an athletic diving instructor, who stays on for most of the trip. This is the first film for me in which Katrina Kaif did not jar; she plays a mixed-race woman\u2014half American, half Indian. She speaks English most of the time, some Spanish, and a few words of accented Hindi, but it works here, and she exudes well-being and sportiness. Perhaps from now on, anyone looking to cast her believably should make her a person of mixed ethnicity with only a smattering of Hindi. But wait\u2014isn't that all she has played for the past dozen years? Surely, you'd think she'd want to grow as an actor and add to her skill set by learning Hindi properly, and taking some diction and acting lessons. Maybe her cynical response is I'm doing very well without any of that, so why bother? And everyone agrees she's punctual and professional\u0085Hrithik, after a long time, is not doing all the heavy lifting. He has two buddies for company, and it's a pleasant change seeing him as just one of the guys. The sun glints off his highlights as he strives to achieve optimum work-life balance, dances with game senoritas, and gets drunk with his amigos. Abhay Deol is not as well-muscled but he does some appealing work, wrestling with the dilemma of the perfect girlfriend fast morphing into a harridan fianc\u00e9e. Farhan Akhtar's character, once again, is glib and a bit of an asshole, and tosses off bon mots with a studied insouciance. He, too, needs to broaden his range. We've seen him do this shtick in \"Rock On\" and \"Luck By Chance\", with minor changes of shading in the undeservedly little-seen \"Kartik Calling Kartik\". Kalki Koechlin is pretty and funny as she makes the most of a small role. Naseeruddin Shah is pure gold in his cameo, speaking harsh truths with sympathy. Deepti Naval, too, is lovely in her two small scenes.Zoya has her cast articulate some admirable sentiments: Carpe diem; face your fears; follow your bliss, but it all passes by in an inconsequential, golden haze. So you won't waste time or money watching this movie, but you're not likely to remember it the following week or even perhaps the following day. For Zoya Akhtar's sake, I wish this film every success, for it will enable her future films that will, hopefully, have significant things to say.",

            "content": "This is what buddy road trip movies are made of, and surprisingly it's helmed by a female director who managed to push all the right buttons at making this work. Zoya Akhtar, whose first film Lucy By Chance I had enjoyed tremendously as it took a long and hard look into the workings of Bollywood, reunites her brother Farhan Akhtar and Hrithik Roshan, who together with Abhay Deol form the nucleus whose adventures across Spain we follow due to a pact that's set in motion should one of them was to get married, as part of an extended 3 weeks bachelor's party plan, they were to each choose an adventure sport for everyone to partake in.Which brings us to plenty of bro-mantic moments as they bond over death-defying stunts, and through the conquering of their fears as a group. Not to mention that the road trip across Spain provides for multiple exotic locations in which this film got shot in. Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti's story also contains enough depth for each character to stand out, presenting skeletons in the closet each must exorcise through their journey of discovery, though deftly avoiding melodrama. What worked is of course the chemistry between the trio of actors as they navigate their joined quest being so natural in their banter, as well as their individual character's conflicts that makes this so engaging to sit through since the challenges in their way are things easy to identify with.The culprit who had to put the plan in motion is Kabir (Deol), whose proposal to Natasha (Kalki Koechlin) forms the basis in which his friends have to join him in executing their pact. There's the happy-go-lucky copywriter Imran (Farhan Akhtar) who's also the resident joker of the group, as well as the dead serious Arjun (Roshan) the hotshot broker whose sole objective in life is to make money, lots of it. Naturally their friendship get tested early on due to the nature of being in close proximity most of the time, but once the misunderstandings got shelved and the wheels put in motion, there's hardly a wasted scene as subplots wrap themselves up very neatly in the narrative, involving one's quest to search for his long lost father, another's realization there's more to life than work if one were to stop and smell the perennial roses, and one having to confront his doubts and the compromise of one's happiness for the sake of others.There's the action-adventure level this film delivered, spending considerable time in engaging the casts in their tasks of deep sea diving, sky diving, and one signature activity best kept under wraps for its surprise factor since it ties in very closely to an important plot point. Halfway though there's also the La Tomatina festival, introduced by Laila (Katrina Kaif) their diving instructor and would be romantic interest, as an unplanned detour involving the squishing of a massive amount of tomatoes - one wonders though if the timelines of all activities do gel together so nicely since there were at least two festivals almost back to back with each other.Hrithik Roshan didn't have much luck at the box office last year with Guzzarish and Kites, but Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara will probably put his career back on track given the meatier role of the trio he got to handle. Farhan Akhtar should act more when he's not directing his own films, while Abhay Deol after this has established himself in my books as one of the character actors to look out for. With great scenic shots and an evergreen story about friendship, camaraderie and life affirming decision making, there's nothing not to like about this film that reminds us of the ties that bind. Highly recommended as it inspires one to come up with a similar pact for a road trip.",

            "content": "In one of the defining moments of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, the three friends, along with their diving instructor, have just surfaced from the depths of the seas and the feeling of having experienced life in each breath is sinking in... while the sun sets along the Spanish coastline. The richness of this moment is not only depicted in the beauty of the shot itself but also in the calm that descended upon such exuberant individuals. Through the medium of the film, Zoya Akhtar is reminding us to let our fears drown in the essence of the moment that is Now. Though a familiar ideology, it has never been presented with such tenderness, subtlety and beauty. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara doesn't preach a way of living but simply reminds us of it and does so in a manner that will make you smile in the end.Kabir (Abhay Deol) is the first of the Three Musketeers who is about to break away from bachelorhood and as per their old pact, they take a road-trip that includes each one's surprise adventure along the way. This isn't remotely close to a 'Hangover' style Bachelor party but more like a bachelor trip that takes male-bonding to a level that was once defined in 'Dil Chahta Hai'. Even though Kabir may appear to be the audacious, fun loving guy, his marriage is a worrisome matter for him which he tries to conceal from his friends. Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) is the funniest of the lot and while he can be a kid sometimes, he appears restless and anxious when it comes to tracing his real father Salman, in Spain. Arjun (Hrithik Roshan) is an ambitious financial broker in London, who is unable to separate himself from his work while on vacation because he plans to retire rich at age 40. On their first adventure, diving instructor Laila (Katrina Kaif) introduces them to her idea of living freely, without worries and plans. From hereon, begins the journey of discovering true living for the trio whose adventures mean a lot more than just sports. The more they let go of themselves, the more they embrace their true selves. The moment they arrive in Spain to the tunes of Dil Jaise Dhadke Dhadakne do, we know what's in store for us. Kabir with his pranks on strangers, Imraan with his witty one-liners and spontaneous sense of humor and Arjun, whose devotion to work literally goes out of the window during the journey, provide us with chuckles and guffaws through innovative situations and interactions. Abhay Deol is well suited to his character who plays the prankster among friends and the resilient fianc\u00e9 of Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). His character faces more dilemmas throughout and he has handled those situations well. Kalki was passable in her role which the viewer wouldn't be too fond of in any case. Finally, Hrithik Roshan has a role where he can enjoy himself and the audience can enjoy watching him perform all his talents. Apart from looking like a Greek God, he dresses like a GQ model, laughs, jokes and dances as fluently as he speaks Spanish. Katrina Kaif's character may have been overshadowed by the boys but as an actress, this film should give her more confidence than ever. She gets to speak out the best dialogues, always keep that sweetest smile on her, dress casually and yet look most stunning. Farhan Akhtar is hands down, the highlight of the film's performances. With witty dialogues and a quirky sense of humor, he gets to have most of the fun. He lets himself go with his character and exposes himself to signing, dancing, fooling around, being impulsive, being childish and sometimes, being really mature. He has left good impressions before but this time, he exceeds expectations. Perhaps the secret to such good performances is Zoya's writing and screenplay that allows the actors to be themselves rather than their characters. Through Carlos Catalan's superlative cinematography, we not only witness Spain in its magnificent splendor but also the director's vision of a screenplay that speaks without dialogue. As the actors dive into the depths of the sea, drive through the Spanish countryside, fall from the airplane or paint the world red, Zoya's envisioned screenplay is adroitly depicted like a work of art. What the characters experience in those moments isn't described in words but through slow motion capture of the camera and a screenplay that lets the scene and actor's expression speak in emotions and beauty. While these characteristics of direction and cinematography form the strength of the film, it is Jaaved Akhtar's poetry, spoken through Farhaan in those inspiring moments, that forms the soul of the movie.Shankar Ehsaan Loy have given us melodious tunes which will only grow with each listen after having watched the movie. Dil Jaise Dhadke is peppy and its chorus is uplifting. Der lagi lekin is a soulful track that is brilliantly rendered by Shankar Mahadevan. Truly, accolade worthy. Ik Junoon (Paint it red) is catchy and well suited to the La Tomatina festival. Suraj ki baahon mein is a foot-tapping track that all actors eventually dance to but it is Senorita that is most fun to watch as all three of them take to the stage and Hrithik comes in his invincible form.ZNMD portrays richness and maturity of the director's skill as well as the talents of the actors. While Spain, being the silent hero of the film, will inspire travelers with its resplendent beauty that is explored through journeys, many will relate to Imraan's poetry and the adventurous achievements of the trio. Perhaps the most remarkable attribute does remain the film's ability to convey so much in its silent scenes in spectacular backdrops. Simple moments now look enriched with deeper meaning and all credit goes to Zoya Akhtar's vision of a road-trip that is definitely worth a ride. 9.123 on a scale of 1-10.",

            "content": "After an impressive beginning as a director with 'Luck by Chance', Zoya Akhtar is back with 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' in her second outing once again casting her brother Farhan Akhtar as Imran with Hrithik Roshan as Arjun & Abhay Deol as Kabir to make the three musketeers. They embark on a bachelor trip across Spain before Kabir gets married to Natasha (Kalki Koechlin) where each of them will take the other two to experience an unknown extreme sport opening their respective lives to possibilities that they were unsure to face before.Farhan Akthar with his surefire comic timing, relaxed personality and soul searching gazes makes this his best performance to date. He has matured as an actor proving that he can do more than just serious roles. Hrithik Roshan lets his eyes do the talking. His transition from a grumpy money making machine to a free soul is exulted beautifully. This is one of his better if not best performances and this proves that with the right director and script, he is a fantastic actor. Abhay Deol might come across as the timid one among the three and he might not be the best dancer (especially with the other two around) but he makes the best of what he has, his strong dialogue delivery. His casualness makes the trio feel human.Support comes in the form of Kalki Koechlin who was in control and crazy at the same time which was annoying to watch (in a good way) because that's what her character was all about. Katrina Kaif as the NRI deep sea diving instructor Laila, was so-so. Her dialogue delivery is still weak with wafer thin facial expressions though her rapport with the guys was passable with good chemistry with Hrithik. Ariadna Cabrol as Nuria was an extra with a name; not much to do or say. Deepti Naval as Rehna Habib was believable in her short act while Naseeruddin Shah as Salman Habib was simply a scene stealer.Cinematography keeps you in the thick of the action with plenty of in- your-face camera work. The way the extreme sports were captured didn't look staged most of the time, adding to the make-believe that the actors were in fact doing their own stunts (which I think they did, most of it at least). Locations are spectacular as expected, with Spain getting loads of screen-time to sell itself to the masses though I wasn't keen on some of the aspects shown (wasted tomatoes & animal torture). Other product placements were obvious though they didn't detract from the story. The story and screenplay was finessed well by Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti even with predictable sub-plots and a long run time. The dialogues written by Farhan Akhtar with aptness to each scene were surprisingly good. The background score and songs are well placed adding weight to the visual experience. The lyrics written by Javed Akthar and narrated in Farhan Akhtar's raspy voice at vital emotional junctions in the movie were brilliant.With a well paced narrative and brilliant acting, one must confess that this was a joyful experience that not many 'feel good' Hindi movies manage to emote.",

After all, it's a road trip film...and many similar films have been made over the years. This isn't so much a complaint as an observation....and the film has many of the usual clich\u00e9s you'd expect in such a movie. Yet, fortunately, it's still an enjoyable though not exactly original film.When the film begins, Kabir (Abhay Deol) has just gotten engaged and tells his fianc\u00e9e about his plans before the wedding. Instead of a bachelor party, he wants to go on a three week trip to Spain...something the three of them have been planning for years. The most obvious problem about this trip is Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Although amazingly handsome, Arjun is a workaholic....and anal to the core (and not in a good way). This is a common archetype in this sort of film and the fact that he'd soon meet a free-spirited woman and would learn to let go of his fears and emotional constraints is no surprise at all. His story is enjoyable but the most clich\u00e9d.Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) is the joker of the three. Yet, this is a facade...as he's struggling with daddy issues which he might be able to face while on this road trip.And, then, finally there's Kabir. There's more to his story than he's about to marry a very rich woman. When the two other friends meet her, they are surprised at how controlling and jealous she is...and it's too much so. They want to tell Kabir their concerns about his upcoming marriage...but they aren't sure how he'll take this.Not surprisingly, all these issues are magically resolved by the end of the film...which is pretty typical of such a film. But the locations are lovely, the acting quite nice and the film enjoyable. Worth seeing...but a tad overrated in my mind.",

But there's so much more than the cinematic or entertainment value - so much to learn from the Spanish trip. It asks you many questions:@ You can decide to slog and mint money till a certain age, but who knows you'd live through that age to enjoy your riches? @ You may be a nice guy who wants everyone around him happy. But would you do that at the cost of your ONE life? @ You may hate (or be jealous of) the happy-go-lucky guy around you who never takes nothing seriously and is yet cool. But don't you know everyone has their fair share of pain?Through these questions, and by portraying the power of love in our lives yet again (though in a Smarter-Bollywood-Ishtyle), Zoya makes you believe in the concept of One-Life! Though nothing is probably new in the movie, the entire package is surprisingly spiritual!The 3 friends take a different take on bachelor's party, and decide on a 3-week trip to Spain. As promised years ago, they indulge in one adventure sport of each of their choices, and the other two join in unconditionally. Surprisingly, these thrilling adventures set them free as they take on land (bull chase), water (scuba diving) and air (sky diving). In the run, they realize the importance of, or rather living each moment of, the celebration called life. Love, family, friendship... there's a lesson of value on each of those, sprinkled abundantly with humor. The movie starts simple, slowly getting into the groove. And before you realize, you'd fall in love with life all over again. Surprisingly spiritual!The tears in Hrithik's eyes after the scuba dive, the 3 boys holding hands during the sky dive, and they joining each other in the last leg of the bull-chase event would remain in the viewer's heart for long. And most of us would lookout to grab a copy of the impactful \"shayaris\" of the movie. Akhtars, take a bow!",

The story is average, but certain bits are brilliant. Like the tale of Farhan and his father played by Naseeruddin Shah. There are no clich\u00e9s here, just the real portrayal of what actually happens in life.Abhay and Kalki's story is good too, but ruined by the idiotic ring scene. Hrithik's story could have been there but the whole romantic angle pretty much ruined it. The songs were below average, unlike the hype. Katrina and Kalki have their bit roles, which they do not seem do deserve, going by the sub-par performances they put in.This movie could have been much better without the love angles, and without Hrithik's unnecessarily intense performance.

Sadly, I felt like walking out, after a coupla hours of this never-ending drivel. The plot is incongruous, the actors are wooden and there is no logical conclusion. The jaded 'friends' look as if they are in their mid-forties, not young professionals on a bachelors' 'road trip'. All three look just too old, to be horsing around the streets of Spain. And why Spain of all places? Perhaps the film has been sponsored by the Tourism Ministry of Spain? There are no answers, only conjectures.Hrithik looks middle-aged, heavy jowled, and full of attitude, as if he is aware of his 'star' status in the star-less cast. About Abhay, I just cannot appreciate his lugubrious-style of emoting, so I won't comment any further. Farhan is refreshing, although he is Farhan in every film he stars in. He cannot go beyond a certain style of emoting. The surprise is Kalki. Despite her non-conventional looks and buck teeth, she manages to dominate in the few frames she appears in. A deglamorised Katrina is utterly wasted, and so is another Spanish chick (Adriana?). Naseer looks his usual impressive self, the older he becomes, the better he gets. But he has no role worth the name.About the story, there is nothing of the sort. Kabir's practical jokes and the 'Bagmati' quips are done to death. Of course, the message goes that India is no fun. One should preferably select a location abroad for a 'road' trip. This premise is wholly understandable, though. The convoluted moral at the end of the film is: Have fun, but don't get into relationships. If possible, avoid marriage altogether. And strictly, no kids.Although I subscribe to a similar dogma myself, the way it is presented in the film won't have any new followers rushing to embrace the bohemian lifestyle. The MANTAL dialogue was genuinely amusing. But watching this film continuously and searching for a plot, might spoil the MANTAL equilibrium of some people. So carry a pinch of salt to the cinema hall, guys. Or maybe a tablet of alprax.",

            "content": "I was too much eager to watch this movie because I had liked its director, Zoya Akhtar's maiden directorial venture - Luck By Chance very much. Hence I went to watch it with heavy expectations. The movie has not lived to the level of my expectations, yet I found it as quite nice, enjoyable and impressive.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (you won't get this life again) is based on the lives (and their joint vacation as bachelors) of three friends - Hrithik Roshan who is a finance broker, running after money only; Farhan Akhtar who is stressful after knowing about his biological father and Abhay Deol who is going to marry Kalki Koechlin, the daughter of a rich businessman. There has been a resentment between Hrithik and Farhan in the past due to their common crush for a girl. Now they decide to have a vacation in Spain and that vacation not only make them cross path with a sea-diving instructor - Katrina Kaif as well as Farhan's biological father - Nasiruddin Shah but also provides them a new outlook for their lives. They learn to live the 'TODAY' to the full instead of worrying about TOMORROW or getting too much into YESTERDAY.This movie seems to be a mix-chaat of Dil Chaahta Hai (starring Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshay Khanna), Rock on (starring Farhan himself, Arjun Rampal, Purab Kohli and Luke Kenny) and Dasvidaniya (starring Vinay Pathak). Like the first two movies contained a rift in the past between two friends from the group concerned, this movie also has one. Like the first two movies again, it also contains their friendly teasing, pranks, flirting the girls and joint merry-making before facing the harsh reality of life. And like the last one, it also underscores the importance of living the life at hand to the fullest before the dying moment arrives. However it does not reach to the level of none of these three. It is because of the weaknesses in the script which the director - Zoya has tried her level best to cover with the help of beautiful locales of Spain, Shaayari of her (and Farhan's) father - Jaaved Akhtar, some style generated through the language and culture of Spain and finally, good thrill in the end. The same message had been conveyed more forcefully in Dasvidaniya through a different story. The second half of the movie is lengthier and better than the first one. The story takes off quite slowly in the first half and bores for the first 15-20 minutes.This movie is a visual treat. The scenes under the sea-surface as well as in the heights of the sky are marvellous. Not only the production value is exceedingly high but the cinematographer has done a remarkable job from his side also alongwith the art director. Technically the movie is just superb. Even when the narrative seems to be boring a bit, the beautiful scenes passing on the screen keep the viewer hooked. The running of the deadly bulls in the climax and the heroes running (alongwith several others) to save themselves from them is sensational.The music is according to the mood of the movie. The song - Senorita has a clear stamp of the song - Hum Hain Naye Andaaz Kyun Ho Puraana from Farhan's maiden directorial venture - Dil Chaahta Hai. The songs have been picturized well.Performance wise talking, it's mainly the movie of the three heroes. Hrithik has matured enough since his Kaho Na Pyar Hai days during the past one decade and his looks as well as performance is very impressive. Farhan Akhtar is not only a good director, he is a good actor also and he proves it again. But the show-stealer, in my opinion, is Abhay Deol who effortlessly acts and enters the skin of his character.Among others, Katrina Kaif is not bad but her dialogue-delivery still leaves a lot to be desired. Kali Koechlin is okay as an over-possessive and nagging would-be wife but she is definitely a misfit for the roles of Indian girls. Nasiruddin Shah is fine in his cameo whereas a great actress like Deepti Naval has been wasted.Well, the message to live every moment of your life to the full without worrying too much for the future or regretting the past is all right but the way the heroes easily move from place to place abroad, spend generously, always remain in eat-drink-and-be-merry mood without any monetary constraint makes me think whether enjoying your life or brooding peacefully is also a luxury of the filthy-rich only. Can the people who have to earn daily to make both ends meet, afford such luxury as they trio in the movie could do ? That's why, myself, being a middle-class person with a modest earning, liked the movie but could not relate to it.",

Zindagi is the earliest Indian film I've seen that truly attempts to create beautiful and interesting cinematography, and it certainly pays off. Unfortunately it doesn't quite make the cut for modern film thanks to the 2 or 3 Bollywood musicals and the focus on daily life drama instead of drama worthy of the big screen. The drama is still touching and relatable in parts, if never powerful. The improved acting and cinematography means this drama should be a \"must watch\" for fans of soap opera style drama.If you do watch this, make sure to pause or turn off the movie as soon as the first credits appear.

Director Zoya Akhtar's second film takes a road- trip to the exotic, picturesque locations of Spain, with the high dose of adventure tourism & events, through the eyes of three bachelor friends. This film does same service to Spain Tourism Board that Mr. Yash Chopra's Films has done to Switzerland in past. It is a film about male bonding written by two females- Zoya Akhtar & Reema Kagti. The good part is that it is unpretentious, and does not follow the forced route of dramatic, or stupid hilarious situations, the usual highs and lows of the plot, that today's audience call it their dose of \"entertainment\"/ stress-buster, or rather their escape route. Yes, the film is daringly different from run of the mill as there is little conflict to move the story forward. The events come like a chapters in the textbook or like episodes. In this age and time, when in order to get a film noticed one need to have a unique packaging and a different look. The film in this department stays honest and delivers what it intends to deliver, a neatly packaged, well shot, designer film. A rather smart Product targeted specifically at urban audience. There isn't much of a script either and it is not required. In fact this is one area where another film called BLUE (2009) failed as instead of keeping story & narrative simple and craft it around just deep sea diving, that film gets into a very make and believe masala plot, which definitely was not required, and was superfluous and thus it failed. On the contrary, this film just follows one straight track, where by the end the three friends not just discover a new foreign land but also led to their self-discovery. Sounding philosophical and too heavy?? nah ! the film steer clear of too much gyaan, on the contrary it is a light, feel good film, miles away from the drudgery, daily routine, life of middle class. On positive note, the three major characters look life-size not larger than life & therefore relatable. The middle class of this country who rarely get such experiences can experience such life at least from the confines of cinema hall. After all perversion is a new form of entertainment. The locations are well captured especially the camera work of sky-diving & bull-chasing sequences which are sumptuous and breathtaking. An interesting part about Katrina Kaif's character of diving instructor- one who easily forms a close-knit friendship with three testosterone heavy young males in a quick span of time as if some smart cookie waiting for one such life time opportunity of hooking one such fellow & impressing him with her \"exclusive\" pop-gyaan so that she herself can get rid of her \"hard\" life of diving instructor and can enjoy the luxuries of future life from this \"with benefits\" friendship. But again, thinking from a stupid, middle class perspective, has no place in such premise. Overall Film is above average. Watch for an experience if not for narrative or style. A word of caution for those males who are about to get married: Stay away from this film and watch it only after your marriage.",

It glorifies friendship as well, a virtue that is simply priceless yet doesn't get the respect it deserves.The whole movie is a memorable journey that is wonderfully crafted by Zoya Akhtar, stunningly captured on camera, very well performed by the cast & delivers its message without being too preachy.Cinematography sells Spain... simply put, the breathtaking scenic beauty of Spain as well as their culture & festivals are very well captured on camera.The trio of Abhay, Hrithik & Farhan gels very well with Katrina too giving a nice performance. The dialogue is very well written with brilliant comic timing. But the most remarkable thing about ZNMD apart from Spain is Farhan Akhtar's impeccable performance. Simply put, he was the show stealer in almost every scene. And so far has turned out to be one hell of an all- rounder in his career as director, actor, writer etc.Deep Sea diving, Spain's Tomatina festival, Sky Diving & Bull-Race are some scenes that are shot so nicely that each of them has a story to tell... And these scenes are gonna hang on you for a considerable amount of time reminding one of what things they are missing in their life. The message is simple: Live life your way. Don't make it complicated. Search for your own happiness. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, so live every moment of it. Live it as beautifully as u can.

The road trip which was planned as a series of adventure sports, one chosen by each friend unknown to the others spanning across Spanish cities soon turns into a remarkable trip for each of the three individuals as they confront their inner demons, past ghosts and misunderstood issues in their lives. Zoya Akhtar does nicely, not allowing the moments of self-discovery turn the film into an extended sermon and self-help book and also not letting the fun and frolic seep into the quieter moments. This treatment of duality of life is handled deftly, making the film a pleasing, smooth and thoroughly enjoyable watch. The only plaint I have is that she could have chosen to take a few critical junctures in the story head-on instead of sidestepping those with only a hint of what is going to happen. (Spoliers) Imran's first phone call to his biological father was merely glossed over. Having grown to like the character deeply by then, one wished to actually feel and watch him as he took the bold step he had been previously avoiding. To be fair to Zoya, she did not shy away in some of the other instances like Arjun's moment of epiphany after the underwater dive (/Spoilers).It is a difficult task to develop and endear two characters in a single film, leave alone three. However, aided by its long running time, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara does manage to do justice to all the three leading characters considerably well. Abhay Deol plays the foil to the other two to perfection, glimmering away quietly whenever the spotlight is on him. Hrithik, in an instance of pitch-perfect casting, impresses with his bravado-veiled vulnerability. Farhan's Imran grows on you. A closet poet who is also a copywriter by a day, Imran is also a man masking in his constant jokes and pranks a deep pain he is nursing. And a bonus is listening to Javed Akhtar's poetry in Farhan's voice. Katrina Kaif and Kalki Koechlin are just fine in their bit roles. The magic of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is in the chemistry and camaraderie of the three buddies \u2013 and that's what it deserves to be watched for.",

            "content": "Much like 'Dil Chata Hai' directed by her twin brother Farhan, this is part of a new generation of Bollywood, less reliant on old clich\u00e9s and more honestly exploring the lives of young people. Song and dance are sometimes used less often, and are more integrated into the plot, so there isn't the feeling that these numbers are obligatory. On one level, there are things about the film that trouble me. This story of three best (male) friends going on a 3 week 'bachelor party adventure trip' to Spain is terribly materialistic. As much as the film espouses 'live free and happy and for the moment' that's a lot easier when you're either wealthy or well to do as all these characters all seem to be. Even the character who has to face that he's too obsessed with success doesn't seem about to sell off all his possessions and start working with the poor. But that carp aside, I found this very charming and a lot of fun. While on the surface not all that different from U.S. movies about guys having a wild time together, there is an honesty and emotional reality to the performances and a freshness to the approach that makes it much more fun than those same tired U.S variations I can't even watch anymore. While not quite as moving and thoughtful as 'Dil Chatha Hai' and not quite as successful in it's integration of songs, I still found myself smiling more than I ever would have expected.",

Abhay Deol is natural. Hrithik is perfect as ever. But Farhan surprises you in both humorous and emotional scenes. The scene where he meets his father is the perfect example of his capability as an actor. Naserrudin Shah makes a perfect cameo.

You would have seen so many movies that are shot in a studio and director doesn't even thinks of moving out of studio gate. This one is like world's cheapest trip to Spain and every shot of Spain looks awesome.But the show stealer has been the adventure sports in which Hrithik+Farhan+Abhay participate. They are shot so beautifully that you feel you are actually there with the stars and living every moment of it. Especially the sky diving was simply heart throbbing.So watch this movie for a fun-filled ride to Spain with some awesome funny characters. And I'm sure u will come out smiling :)",

And then most of people are thought that animals are dangerous while they're always torturing by cruel people. That's why human species are more selfish, greedy and cruel. Because they're told that animals aren't good. While some types of human and their culture are more dangerous for some poor animals. Especially how it's would be common things in 20th century.

            "review_title": "Good But Sadly Falling Short of Great",
            "content": "There is a fine line between good films and great films. Several times we have seen really good films falling short of being great films because the director and writer underestimate the intelligence of their audience and become too explanatory and narrative. As result of which, the story drags and audience lose interest. I might sound a bit harsh to the overall outcome of the effort of Zoya Akhtar but I believe this is exactly what happened with the highly anticipated Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (ZNMD). It has all the ingredients of becoming an all-time great film and it ends up being just another good film.It's inevitable to draw parallels with the great Dil Chahta Hai but it's unfair to do so. The only common thing is the lead trio and their bonding with each other but that's about it. I would personally consider it more on the lines of The Bucket List where the main characters break the shackles of their inner confines by doing things they have never done before but even The Bucket List has a different message altogether and is difficult to match.Besides being an excellent advertisement for tourism of Spain, ZNMD is a story of three lifelong friends going on a one-in-a-lifetime trip for the bachelor party, end up doing things which would make them look at their lives in a different way and inspire them to change the course of their lives by taking things in their own hands. Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar have a brilliant story. The first half is excellent but they fail to keep the screenplay tight enough in the second half. It becomes so lose at times that you start wondering how long it will take to finish a particular narrative.While educated humor, good acting, witty dialogue, amazing locations and cinematography work in favor of the film, there is always over-explanation for character building and communication of emotions that spoils the party. Hrithik is over ambitious, yes and it was understood from his intro scenes. There was no need of establishing this fact with seven sequences. It's a long film, almost three hours out of which sharp editing could have reduced the duration by twenty minutes. The song where Hrithik gives orgasmic expressions after being kissed (which obviously was not his first) is never ending. The skydive scene could have been shorter. Ditto for the bull race. Zoya the director was too lenient with the screenplay and editing.Farhan Akhtar has the biggest role in his acting career and he has managed it well. Excellent comic timing and fluency. Better than both his previous ventures. He also got a chance to recite some brilliant poems of his father but wasn't all that eloquent with that. Abhay Deol is the best among the three. It's almost his first big release and he has pulled it off in style. His pairing with Kalki also comes out nice after Dev D. Naseer was awesome in his cameo. A lesson for Hrithik. Naseer's role was also complicated and he only had ten minutes to convince everyone and he did what Hrithik could not in hours.On a personal level, I was slightly disappointed by Hrithik. The brilliant actor that he is, I would expect a lot more from him. Agreed, his character was a difficult one and he tried hard but he wasn't very convincing in the first half. I would also blame Zoya for that as I think she made a judgment error of giving total freehand to Hrithik and not challenging him enough. Katrina Kaif wastes some of the most inspiring lines of the film. Horrible dialogue delivery. She has been in the industry long enough to understand correct pronunciation of Hindi and the alibi of not knowing Hindi will not be valid anymore. Bad, bad, bad performance. The Hrithik Katrina pairing is also not the most comfortable one either. They don't look natural.Even though I have been quite negative in reviewing the film but this is mainly driven from the expectations this film carried. A film like this with less talented people would be awesome but when talent like Hrithik, Farhan, Abhay and Zoya are involved, one would expect another Dil Chahta Hai. Would ZNMD be an earner, probably yes\u0085 Would it be an all-time classic, No.",

Hrithik as in many of his movie is completely artificial in his expressions and acting. Abhay deol did manage to play the role well, so did Farhan. The whole movie is about europe tourism. It's really not more than that. The supposed to be suspense can be seen from mile ahead coming your way (Farhan's father). The message of movie is to enjoy life you must go to Europe and do it as you only get one life. The characters were not relatable at all neither their background stories.

A huge thumbs up to Farhan Akhtar's acting. He fits well into his character and delivers his performance so subtle, but yet delivers his message to the audience in the right way, with no overdo! Of course, with regards to Hrithik, I would run short of any words to describe him! He looks like a Greek God, sent over to Spain!! His dancing skills , make one feel it's too easy to dance!! But that's not the reality!!! It was a fresh change to see Abhay in a Farhan's movie, with a solid character to portray! And he gives due credit to it!! Katrina, looks like a fresh breath of air in the movie. But wish, she had much more to do. She's almost disappeared in the second half of the movie. I must say I was not too happy with Kalki. Maybe she was not the correct choice for that role. Although Farhan usually finds actors who are tailor made for each role in his movies !!Songs were soothing to hear, keeping in line with the Spain background. Comedy was stupendous in the first half, story line was moving, and actors have given their best shot!! Must say it has carved its niche in Indian cinema. I was watching this movie in US, and must say, I was sitting there proud to be from India, where we have such talented actors and cinema!All and all well done!! Great job Farhan and his team.",

            "content": "Let go of yourself - It's the perfect tag line for this movie. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is one of the few Bollywood movies which stays behind with you even after the movie is over.Its basically a story of 3 longtime friends - Arjun(Hrithik Roshan), Imran(Farhan Akhtar) and Kabir(Abhay Deol). Kabir is getting married to Natasha(Kalki) and before marriage wants to go on a road trip to Spain with his best buddies, all in accordance with a pact which they had made a long time ago. Arjun is a stockbroker who is only interested in earning as much as he can till the age of 40 and then retire. Imran, being the joker of the pack, is a writer struggling hearts and hearts with a very important but unspoken thought. Katrina Kaif plays the role of Laila, who is their diving instructor in Spain and loves to live life to its fullest.Spain has never been presented so beautifully. Some of the locales are truly breathtaking. The cinematography is bang on. In terms of performances, everybody chips in. If Hrithik Roshan can emote through his eyes, then Farhan Akhtar's one liners and comic timing is brilliant. Abhay Deol is his usual self, showing he can hold his own be it commercial cinema or offbeat cinema. Katrina Kaif, is a surprise. She is surprisingly good, and her chemistry with Hrithik Roshan is too die for. Kalki doesn't have much to do, but is good. But the real star of the movie is its screenplay and editing. The skydiving and underwater scenes are shot beautifully. Zoya Akhtar is back in the director's seat after the critically acclaimed Luck By Chance. After watching this movie, you wonder why she doesn't make movies more often. The dialogs by Farhan Akhtar and the poems by Javed Akhtar deserve a special mention. The music by Shankar, Ehsaan & Loy is peppy. The songs Khwaabon ke parindey and Senorita however hog the limelight.Simply put, ZNMD is a beautiful ride. Its by no means a Dil Chahata Hai or a Hangover, but it holds it's own special place.",

It is a very entertaining movie that keeps things simple and evokes laughter without going over the top like many comedies.Hrithik Roshan, Abhay Deol and Farhan Akhtar are terrific as they play three friends travelling to Spain for a bachelor trip of sorts. Katrina is good and is clearly looking to cement her place at the top of the Hindi film industry by being very selective. Naseeruddin Shah is good in a cameo as is Deepti Naval. Ariadna Cabrol is wasted.The cinematography is exquisite and the dialogues by Farhan are refreshing. In addition, the locales of Spain have been captured nicely and the music is entirely appropriate and fits in. The whole soundrack is very good but 'Ik Junoon' and 'Senorita' stand out. Shankar-Ehsaan- Loy have delivered again and, by doing so, have shown why they are amongst the best composers in the industry.However, there are some problems. One is the running time of the movie. A shorter movie would have packed a bigger punch since the film gets talk-heavy in places, and the viewer may get a little restless as a result. Also, mocking doordarshan is totally unnecessary and doesn't do anything for the film. The film also lacks in drama in the first hour or so. ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA is still very impressive for it looks at life in a very interesting way, inspiring the viewer to make the most of it. After all, zindagi na milegi dobara (you won't get to live twice). Director Zoya Akhtar's ability to incorporate offbeat elements into her films needs to be appreciated.I don't rate this quite as highly as DIL CHAHTA HAI but that doesn't take away the fact that this, like DIL CHAHTA HAI, can be watched and enjoyed many times. I'm looking forward to Zoya's nextVerdict: inspiring, entertaining, refreshing and universally appealing. One of the best bollywood movies of 2011 so far. You don't want to miss it.Rating: 8.5/10",

            "content": "'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' or ZNMD is what you get when someone thinks of putting together some stars, a great location and a couple of songs but stay clueless about the rest. Some may compare this with Farhan Akhtar's 'Dil Chahta Hai' made a decade ago, but ZNMD made by his sister Zoya is nowhere close to it. Three best friends, Kabir (Abhay Deol), a son of a rich builder, Arjun (Hrithik Roshan), a London broker and a self-made rich man and Imran (Farhan Akhtar) a not so rich ad-jingle writer set off on a trip to Spain to have the time of their lives before Kabir is wedded. As per their pact, each of them chooses an adventure sport that others have to take part in, but the sport is kept a secret till they actually do it. Being a road-trip movie, ZNMD succeeds in taking audiences on a trip to Spain's breathtaking locations previously unseen in mainstream Bollywood cinema. They make it a point to include some of the country's popular festivals. To recreate the La Tomatina festival, the film makers reportedly shipped tons of tomatoes from Portugal. 'Enciero' or 'Running of the Bulls' at Pamplona is captured well too.ZNMD is where audiences pay to watch three dudes having the times of their lives. In an attempt to build a story around the journey, each of them has an issue to deal with. Kabir is engaged but he isn't sure if she is the right one. Arjun needs to know that there is more to life than money and Farhan has issues with his parentage. Performances from the three leads are decent. Hrithik and Farhan show off their ripped abs at the slightest opportunity while Abhay Deol plays a victim of constant surveillance. Hrithik is seen mouthing a few lines in Spanish; something that he probably learned while shooting for 'Kites', a pathetic flop from last year.Zoya and Javed Akhtar have spent their energies in making Farhan's role meaningful on screen. While the former guarantees him screen time as the director, the latter's Urdu poetry brings out the deeper side to his character's outwardly funny disposition. Farhan brings in the laughs with his effortless dialog delivery as the charming flirt. Among the lead ladies, Kalki plays her part well as the annoying and suspicious fianc\u00e9e. Katrina was hired to enjoy the vacation with the boys and spend a couple of minutes making a feeble attempt to act while giving her little speech to Hrithik on making more out of life. Also, there is a Spaniard who plays Farhan's love interest.An indulgent film that it is, ZNMD seems to float at its own pace without a care in the world. It probably needed more scissor-work. And there are some goofs like having first time sky-divers, they are shown to be diving alone and making formations in their very first jump. Then there is a father-son drama that slows the pace. ZNMD is a youthful, feel good movie with not much of a story to tell. Those keen to catch a glimpse of Spain or Hrithik's fan brigade may like it.",

The right tone developed over years of chemistry and history. \"Three Musketeers\" reunited for a bachelor trip in here definitely have all that. Zoya Akhtar's smart, first-rate writing and its humor carries this breezy flick fluidly giving us these characters with their idiosyncrasies and baggage discovering few things, resolving few unresolved issues, facing their fears and giving us many many moments to cherish along their journey. And the pleasure of ZNMD is just hanging out with these amigos on their adventures in their sojourns, their soirees.Groom to be is Kabir (Abhay) engaged to Natasha (Kalki). With a geeky glasses and somewhat sensible head over his shoulder you sense, he keeps the bunch harmonious, at least tries to. Arjun (Hritik, in his best performance), typical \"corporate slave\" (after money all the time), \"whore\" (always thinks of career), no-ones' type (three holidays in a year). He is angry intense one. His plan is to earn till 40 and then retire. Laila (Katrina) asks, \"How does he know he will live till 40?\" True. Seize the moment my friend, she tells him opening a world full of other wondrous stuff. Third is goofy Imaraan, clown of the group played phenomenally by Farhaan Akhtar. His Clark-Kent job is ad copywriter who also is a closet-poet and a bohemian. Together they three form a delectable diverse group.Their bachelor trip is the pact they decided in their youth where two has to participate in adventure sport chosen by each. Everyday ennui will sure get shot of adrenaline no doubt stunningly breathtakingly shot scenes in Spain. Beautiful lush perfect backdrop. These in company of each other let it go and come out exhilarated or peaceful at the other end. Each venture is bookend by Imraan's profound poetry. \"Aankhon me hairaaniyan lekar chalo to zinda ho tum\". Fabulous.There might be flaws in this movie. I am not at all interested in knowing them or will not go looking for them. I'll leave it those who want to miss what this wonderful wonderful film has to offer. Cheers!",

Though it reminisces of Dil Chahta Hai, the other cult movie made by Farhan Akhtar who also acted in this one as Imran, the movie is very very good and is easily one of the best feel good movies that has been made this year. This movie tell the very old philosophy to Live Each Moment to the fullest or Seize the moment etc with the three friends telling this to each other. They are joined by girls, one is the instructor and the other is her friend and another is for Kabir who is already engaged to Natasha. It begins with a three guys getting decided to go on a journey that they have decided 4 years ago and now the time has come coz Kabir will be married soon. It shows ironies too like Arjun the busiest of all, who believes that he will make so much money that he will retire at 40 and then start living will forget what he has to do today, Imran has a tragic past where his father has left him and he tries to confront him. Kabir's future is in jeopardy as he is engaged even without him committing to a relationship. So it's like Past of Imran, Present of Arjun and Future of Kabir and how they confront the past, disown the future and try to live in present is what is shown. Also, though unimportant is that the friends are Hindu (Arjun), Muslim (Imran) and Christian (Kabir). The movie has the best of adventure sports in the world be is scuba diving, sky diving or bull fight all these are shot very memorably and each one's emotion before and after the same are so ecstatic. One moment where Arjun who is afraid of water, completes Scuba diving comes up and just emotes silently with eyes. That one scene conveyed how powerful an actor Hrithik is. Also, Abhay Deol as Kabir is just as natural as himself and Farhan Akhtar as Imran brings out the comic moments all through the film.There are many positives and the movie is superbly shot by Carlos Catalan and I thank him for showing the Spain it is. So enticing and so beautiful. Surely, I would go there soon sometime with my friends too. The narrative is simple yet very well structured and it has the perfect pace. The one scene of Naseeruddin Shah was just on top and as always once again confirmed, he is one of the best actors we have. It's 4/5. This is a delightful journey to take on.",

            "content": "Zoya Akhtar's much awaited (not by me) 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' tells a typically Bollywood (though this time set in Spain) coming of age tale of three rich kids going on a road-trip through Spain. The film opens with a cheesy dialogue delivered by Abhay Deol and Kalki Koechlin. After the three friends are introduced, the trip starts soon after with some postcard images of Spain and then the Bollywood perspective (that awful Sevilla drunken dance number tops it all). Speaking of songs, they are easily forgettable despite Javed Akhtar's lyrics. The supposed message, 'live your life in the moment' couldn't have been more obvious. Yes, spoonfeeding the viewer.On the technical side, the pacing is uneven. At times it really drags and gets incredibly boring. The cinematography is flat. The background score is ineffective and sound effects are poor.The three principle characters are clich\u00e9s. There's the joker and the stuckup one (both have abandonment issues) and the pushover who appears to be laidback. As for acting, Abhay Deol does a decent job. Hritik Roshan is theatrical as usual. Farhan Akhtar is passable (which is an improvement). Katrina Kaif wears a smile from start to end which is a departure from the clueless expression she has worn in all her previous features. Kalki Koechlin is fine as the possessive fianc\u00e9e. There are interesting cameos by Deepti Naval and Naseeruddin Shah.Akhtar's previous venture 'Luck By Chance' was a film that entertained and engaged the viewer. It was an interesting take on Bollywood and the system behind it. She seems to be aiming for something lighter with 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' but it really lacks the sophistication, heart and quality that Akhtar's debut film had. Overall, it's pretty much a dull Bollywood flick.",

Throughout the movie they meet new people , undertake new adventures and overcome their worst fears.The movie falls on the lines of DCH and Rock On!! but is slightly different in its execution with a fresh exuberance.The dialogues are very well written by Farhan Akhtar and are very spontaneous and humuorous . The script itself is very well written though a little editing could have been done.Coming to the main USP of the movie that is the portrayal of friendship which is novel in my view.Some scenes seems to be taken from your own personal diary.The poetry by Javed Akhtar is again a high point of the movie. The particular poetry where three friends are traveling across the roadside thinking about their latest discovery is worth mentioning.Hritik Roshan looks good and has done a very good job so has Abhay but the real show stealer is Farhan Akhtar with his comic timing.Katrina looks good and a few extra pounds has only made her more attractive :).The cinematography especially the adventure sport scenes are shot very beautifully and at times you feel that you are a part of the scene.So thats it ... finally going to grab my popcorn again to watch the movie the second time. Do enjoy the movie once if you like to watch a good movie.",

It shows you stuff that you have being through or you want to try out or things you know that you will face some day. Its filled with unlimited fun starting from deep sea diving, sky diving, throwing tomatoes and running with the bulls. Yes all that in one flick. Apart of all the adventure it creates a fantastic mood of friendship and most importantly, love. Love is what Bollywood specialized in and they did it well this time too. A fantastic performance by all the cast yet Hrithik is exceptional from the facial expressions to the dance moves.p.s Cinematography and art direction is exceptional.

            "content": "To each his own in my opinion. So I will not go on about how much I enjoy classic Bollywood movies that are full of bright colors, costumes, romance, jokes, catchy songs, beautiful outfits, family drama, heartbroken people, melodramatic situations, etc,etc! Because if you have watched this movie, you know it is certainly not any of that. Moreover it is a persuasive commercial of why we should all pack our bags, quit our jobs, look pretty and live off our dad's money, come to Spain every now and again, hook up with people because life is just all about sex, do reckless things like no tomorrow, and say man this is life, live it! Oh let's not forget, let us completely disregard our culture and roots, and act like we are all in middle school again fighting over past loves. But don't mind my lack of interest in a pathetic westernized imitation of \"the life of the party.\" Now you can be not like me, you can hate sappy movies, and romantic classics like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Hum Ap Kai Hain Kaun, K3G, Vivah, etc., but how in the world is this supposed to be life-changing??? I am dumbfounded, honestly I cannot see as to what I am supposed to find moving in this movie! Now don't get me wrong, I was excited as the next to watch this movie, I convinced everyone to go to the theater to watch it. And there I am in a nice big theater with hopes that something interesting will happen. I am waiting for something funny, for something romantic (degrading make-out scenes don't count), something Bollywood to happen. But no, nothing, all I see is a nice appealing visual of Spain, and a very old-looking Hritik Roshan with a Katrina Kaif who looks happy to be back in her own territory where minimal Hindi/urdu is needed, and no Desi clothes whatsoever! Yayy!! So anyway I am getting so bored, so bored, that I am literally falling asleep now. And in all of this, I am still trying to catch what is so life-changing and inspirational about 3 confused desis, a useless Katrina, and some ransom chick from Spain, having fun, sex, make-out sessions, doing cool scary things (ohh they are such heroes)..like no one has ever done any of these things before! I can probably go on and on about how stupid, boring, undesi, and uninspirational this movie was. Not to mention, overrated. This creation of a lackluster script, lame chemistry, and no plot at all - won an IIFA. Disgusting, what has the world come to. Critics are way over their head in patheticness, failing to see that movies like these shame us, and make us truly like Hollywood copy cats! Disappointed. May Allah not let me see this kind of movie ever again. Complete waste of time and money, unless of course you're planning a visit to Spain though it's probably not as good as a travel channel special on Spain. Oh and don't think I am some old lady in a village in India who hates these type of idiotic films, I am a modern teenager growing up in the western side of the world just trying to maintain some decency and hold on to her roots! P.S. if you want to see life-changing see My Name is Khan, or heck just watch a romantic sober movie!",

            "content": "ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA \u2013 8.1/10 Director: Zoya Akhtar Writer: Zoya Akhtar, Farhan Akhtar I always wanted to visit Europe, especially Spain, though I never thought I would be able to do it for $3. That is the feat achieved by Zoya Akhtar, who has managed to impress in her second venture as a director, to make a visually stunning film that captures the nuances and emotions of a road trip/travel abroad experience.The film is about the story of three friends who have decided to go on a road trip to Spain. From this simple premise, we have several stories and layers stitched together, with the backdrop of the road trip firmly moving the film forward. The dialogues have been written by the director's super multi-talented actor/singer/director/writer/producer brother Farhan Akhtar, who plays the role of Imraan, a peppy, mischievous romantic who manages to steal the show and maintain screen presence in face of star studded competition.What won the game for me was once again, humour in simplicity. The film does not resort to cheap jokes, toilet humour, abusive language or flamboyance in urban or rural dialects. Jokes are simple everyday jokes you would expect to hear from men and boys, but the director manages to build up to them, avoiding the risk of falling into the clich\u00e9 trap. Finer details of props and story backdrops have been kept in mind and introduced at the right time to great effect, enhancing the moment, light or somber.The film is a visual treat. The shot taking does not act as a substitute to fill up weak moments or gaps and holes in the script and story. Shot selection was precise and cinematography complements the locales in every way. For the most part, the film spends considerable time romanticizing with the locations. Emotions are weaved into the beauty of Spain; the location is almost like a fourth character adding dimension and depth to the story.The part which ultimately prevented the film from setting a benchmark for road trip films was the plastic relations of the three lead characters and the age old stereotypical characters struggling with problems in the most predictable way. Many would not agree, but the depth of interpersonal relations one shares in one's life are strong, if not the only determinants of what our perspectives on relationships are. For most part, the relation between the three friends seemed less of friendship and more of a fa\u00e7ade. I'm not sure if it was unconvincing acting or the predictability of the story which made the relational dynamics between the leads seem like school kids talking, but sentences like \"he is our friend, if we don't help/talk to him, who else will\" made me flinch.Writers and directors are not expected to come up with new characters for every film. So many personality and character types have been created till date that it is almost impossible to create a new one. But it is not the newness, rather the mannerisms and finer details that ultimately define and make or break a character. Too much emphasis on the grandeur of locations and capturing landscapes has lead to weak character definitions. The role of Hritik Roshan (Arjun) was almost so predictable, that even before the movie actually starts to move forward, his character introduction is enough for one to predict in which direction it is headed. Not to mention, stars in India need to be less self aware of their stardom when on screen. The inability to alienate their famous lives from on screen characters has over the years led to an overall deterioration in the quality of acting standards.While the film is a welcome change from the typical nonsensical, mind garbage the industry has been producing lately at an unmatched pace, the trend of weak characters and predictable or stereotypical stories in Indian films is still maintained at the cost of exotic locations and star studded casts.",

ZNMD is a superb male bonding film taken further from DCH and set in pre-marital Bachelor trip and how it changes their lives. The film starts off well, establishing the characters and then their friendship The first half doesn't move much in terms of story but there are several superb scenes: Hrithik hitting out of a gym(to show his physique) and then his meeting with his gf, Farhan-Hrithik clash There are several light scenes, the underwater diving is well captured, farhan's poetry's are well handled too The sky diving too is well handled Hrithik- Katrina love story is well handled too, Farhan meeting with his real father and also the entire pre-climatic drama is all superb The climax bull fight could be much better and I would've suggested if the wrap up was more neat. A few flaws: The mockery of Doordarshan seemed in poor taste,the pranks at times appear childishDirection by Zoya Akhtar is fab Music by SEL is superb again, SENORITA is superb and well sung by Farhan, Hrithik and Abhay(Farhan having practise after ROCK ON) Khwabon Ke Parindey is awesome and well picturised EK JUNOON is superb too with Tomantino festival used wellAmongst actors Hrithik Roshan back after GUZAARISH(2010) does a superb job, playing the emotional turmoil superbly The actor has grown in big time and he does a spellbinding job Farhan Akhtar proves his talent yet again, and does a superb job balancing the comedy and emotional scenes superbly Abhay Deol blends well and is a natural Kalki in a small role is good, a relief from her shocked characters Katrina too in a brief role seems at ease and her Hindi is improving Naseeruddin shah is effective in a cameo",

The casting is spot-on especially that of the three male leads, who really seem to have had a great time shooting this film. The music sets the mood and comes in at the right moments. Most importantly, the movie has a sincerity in its heart you usually don't expect from big-budget Hindi films. There is an emotional undercurrent throughout the film. Amidst all the love and games it actually tries to convey an important message. This is slow-paced, mature film-making. A word of caution though. This movie has a contemporary flavor to it and those who grew up in the 90s would probably enjoy it most. A man who looked like he was 50+ was sitting beside me in the cinema hall and he slept through the movie!",

The film has 3 stars in their own right yet it employs them as actors over heroes. There are no heroic entries, stylized background score or larger than life action. The entire film is shot in virgin locations of Spain, yet the beauty of the picturesque country is used only as a catalyst and not as a gimmick in this road flick. And though the film has characters like a possessive girlfriend, a flirtatious friend, an illegitimate father and immense scope for melodrama, it remains subtle and lighthearted throughout. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara remains true to its narrative and is as much unadulterated as the fun the three boys have, indulging in untried adventure sports. The most wonderful feature of the film is the way of telling the story. that is, the narration.. Zoya Akthar has done a very wonderful job.. The film is a very simple one compared to other films in B'wood. You cant find any unnecessary scenes and shots in the film. No Masala, No hardcore Melodrama, No sugary dialogues, No confusing Twists in the story-line.. The credible camaraderie between the three male leads is what makes you relate to the film effortlessly. Their bonding is never sugary sweet of the \"yeh-dosti-hum-nahi-todenge\"\u200b types and they do have their share of hiccups, which makes it more real and believable. The problems of the 3 guys have been dealt in a wonderful way. After each adventure they do one of the guy's problem gets solved.. Thats the most interesting factor in the narration.. So guys if you wanna enjoy the 2.5hrs in the theatre You should go for the movie.. Go for the movie with your friends and enjoy the each and every scenes..",

He was the one you can compare with aamir khan in Dil chahta hai, he made the movie much more lighter, bearable & of course took it to a another level.

            "review_title": "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is - Indian Cinema coming of age, Refreshing",
            "content": "The Good: Fresh camaraderie amongst the lead cast, Carlos Catalan's camera, SEL's music, International caliber style and attention to detail The Bad: Length, Lack of 'Indian touch'The Verdict: Indian cinema is coming of age, and this movie is a must watch for fans looking for a refreshing and fun loving proof of it.I went into ZNMD half expecting a censor board approved version of Hangover crossed with an Indian love triangle embedded into a stylized version of Dil Chahta Hai \u2013 DCH. What I found was a beautiful, technically proficient and skillfully crafted piece of Indian cinema at its best, directed, produced and acted by a bevy of confident young (yes they are young in bollywood parlance) flag-bearers of this generation in Bollywood. Was it 'oscar worthy', may be not\u0085 But does this bunch of film makers care about an Academy, just to get their names mispronounced in an Oscar award ceremony, I highly doubt. Go watch the movie for its style, feel good effect, good performances, and a connect with the heart. Especially if you are part of this multiplex going, city living audience who doesn't go looking for reality in a relaxing weekend watch movie.The film starts with our protagonists in the middle of their current lifestyles, representing their class divide through a display of mundane activities that keep them going day after day. Kabir (Abhay) in the middle of a stinkingly rich urbane setup doing nothing, Arjun (Hrithik) on the trade floor of LSE chasing money as a corporate high flier and Imran (Farhan) going around as a stylish 2011 avatar of Naseer / Fahrukh Sheik of yesteryear's. Kabir is getting married to his papa's friends' daughter Natasha (Kalki) and has marriage blues. He seeks permission for a 3 week fun and frolic in Europe with his best buddies, a la Kajol from DDLJ, but only this time his fiance\u00e9 is required to allow him without an ultra emotional 'Jaa beta Simran, Jee Ley Apni Zindagi \u0085'. What follows is a collage of extremely well done light hearted moments, the most beautifully shot road trip in Spain, adventure and touristy activities blended into some life changing poignant movements for all the three protagonists. The trip helps them rediscover their character that they lost in the hubbub of their daily lives, as they return back to do 'what their heart wants'.Spain's country side might never look prettier than here in Carlos Cantana's magical camera. The male bonding between the 3 protagonists makes you chuckle, and then roar with laughter at times. You can imagine the paan chewing school teacher using words like 'eeschool' and 'buwoys' and school buddies using that years later, to bring back fond memories of their college days. The screenplay is not at its taut best, and expects the viewer to be immersed into its visual collage but the same could be argued with most cinematic masterpieces elsewhere. The performances of the lead cast are first rate, with Farhan clearly standing out for the seamless switch he makes between poetic poignancy and outright college kid mischievousness.Go watch this movie for the supreme production values, the movie making fun and the subtle style of narration that is a much needed gift of the new age directors (the Zoyas, the Anurags, the Vishals, the Abhinay Deos, the Imtiaz Alis and their ilk) to Indian cinema. Intelligent is the word\u0085 They do not rely on explaining each nuance and twist of the story, but let the cosmo intelligent middle class of India use their sensibilities. In a dance scene Hrithik does his Karo Na Pyar Hai jig, and just notice that Abhay subtly does the 'Deol dance' too! The 3 'heroes' take First Class, Business Class and Economy class respectively for their flights to Spain. And when I saw that I knew this is not Karan Johar candy floss, not that there's anything wrong with that. A friend slaps another in outright anger, and you wonder how dramatic the scene could have been if the movie was made by Yash Chopra. Instead, it is handled with utmost dexterity appreciating a delicate relationship amongst childhood buddies. Kabir's character is shown as little 'sissy' metrosexual, afraid of commitment and then the climax very subtly leaves an open interpretation to whether he is up for a typical boy-girl romance. Wow, was it really thought out? If it was, hats-off to you Zoya and Farhan! Shouldn't be a surprise coming from a brother sister duo who have Shabana Azmi and Javed Akhtar for parents.The detractors of the movie can point to its length, but who cares when the makers are seemingly having so much fun and expect you to be part of it. The travelogue genre of films is here in India and in what style and panache! Yes you could draw inspiration and parallels from 'y tu mama tambien', Sideways, Motorcycle Diaries and even Hangover for the uninitiated.. Call it a DCH2 if you will, and why forget DDLJ where Simran went on Euro trip only to return 'enlightented'. But appreciate it for the brilliance of production, adaptation to the modern Indian sensibilities, the wonderful connect, the music and the attention to detail. If Zoya missed a point, it was on connecting with the mass Indian audience who doesn't appreciate ordinary people vacationing in Spain, buying 12000 pound handbags or for that matter breaking into 'chicken dance' in a wedding ceremony that looks completely American.With directors like this may be India will have an Oscar entry that doesn't rely on dirty slums and filthy railway lines to grab the world's attention, but uses instead the young emerging face of confident India. It is not a co-incidence that the Indian professionals, the cricketers and now the movie makers do not give a damn to conventional stereotypes as they show the world they are world class in what they do. Great going guys\u0085 keep it coming..",

They are there, they are brief and the movie carries on, and how it carries on indeed. I hadn't even heard of this movie or read any reviews before I even saw it. Very beautifully done, and the scenes in Spain, while selfishly promoting the country also contribute to the colourful backdrops for the movie, from the traditional Indian ones of gaudy outfits, choreographed dancing etc, though the colourful outfits do find their way in Spanish costumes in a dance sequence at the near end. Again involving three childhood friends all from different backgrounds. There is emphasis on those of an elite status in India and tends to focus on that family for the most, which is unfortunately not how half or even more than half of India live. The songs are great and the movie has a great message indeed that you need to overcome your fears and once you do, there is freedom. So live your life to the fullest as you have only one life to live. Two thumbs up for Zoya Akthar!! A complete fan now of her work.",

            "content": "I caught this flick several months after its release on a flight back from India. I knew that it had been a big box office success in India, and that was precisely why I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. It exudes an upper class (for India) sensibility and a cosmopolitan world view which is usually missing from the mainstream Bollywood blockbusters. Zoya Akhtar has handled the themes of male bonding and self-discovery very deftly. She is ably helped by an intelligent screenplay, a competent cast, and of course, Spain's beautiful landscapes, cities, and festivals. The movie flows smoothly - neither hurried nor dragging. The screenplay does not insult the audience's intelligence; it eschews the loud lack of subtlety that characterizes the massy Bollywood blockbusters. The movie was aimed squarely at the metro multiplex audience and it hit the bulls-eye. Although the themes are universal, the world it depicts would be alien to much of the single screen audience. Provincial India does not even exist here except in one scene where the guys, a tad gratuitously, poke fun at the thick accent of their school teacher.The three main characters are well sketched out - again it shows the thought and care that went into the screenplay. Katrina can actually act. Hrithik and Farhan do well. Abhay Deol is hands down the best actor in the main cast but here I found him a bit ill at ease with his role. Spain looks gorgeous - I have made a mental note to go there once again. One could analyze a movie for hours but I have one simple litmus test. If the movie holds my undivided attention, then it works for me. I was engrossed in this movie from the get go, and saw it one uninterrupted sitting. 8/10 from me.",

Their relationship is sometimes intense and on the line. All of them have strong and detailed backgrounds, so you get to know them each personally and know well of their problems, their needs and their goals. The film is full of philosophy about life and also features tons of poetry as well. The film never tries to be heartbreaking and tearjerking in sad ways, yet it succeeds to bring out tears at how beautiful it sometimes can be, many of the events that happen are very heartwarming and artistic as well. The adventures are unforgettable for all the characters, they experience life-changing situations that happen only because other friends get them into all sorts of trouble and stuff.What's really good is that all the friends are flawed, they don't seem to be very heroic and inspiring, they can be immature and make awful decisions in some situations which makes them human.Then there's music and songs. They are amazing, they give such positive vibes and great joy.The film explores tons of problems, each of the characters deals with something difficult and only up to them what decision will they take. Not all problems are solved in the film, it leaves many for open interpretation.Actual the ending of the film is plain brilliant, it ends in such an open manner ambiguous way, you can take it either as an extremely happy or as an extremely sad and depressing ending. There is some subtle symbolism present in the film as well, and it really makes you think about what the film is really trying to tell you.",

            "content": "When I saw the brief synopsis of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara on Netflix before watching it I was worried. All I could think was that I was about to watch the Indian version of The Hangover, and I'd get more than a little annoyed by another group of grown men acting like kids on a bachelor party trip. Thankfully, that's not at all what this film was about. Instead it is possibly more laugh-out-loud funny than The Hangover, has a heart-warming series of set pieces, and is a road trip movie that connected with me in a way that few movies of this type ever have in the past. Not only was I fully invested and excited about these characters and their journeys, but I also was impacted on a personal level. Perhaps if I had looked at the translation of the title (roughly \"Life Will Never Come Again\") I would have better understood that I was going to watch a movie centered around the theme that you only live once. Instead I was surprised by the message of the film, and it made me genuinely introspective.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is my first foray into Bollywood, and if this is any indication what I can expect from this genre, then I need to start to explore more. I adored the musical breaks in the film, and loved how fun and exciting they were to watch. Like any good road trip film, there are a number of little subplots going on, and each main character has their own emotional journey. The film perfectly handles all their arcs, and actually works them logically into the places that they visit along the way. I found so much joy on each of their adventures, and had plenty of laughs along the way. I can't say that this is a wholly original film, I've seen similar stories before, but for some reason all the pieces came together so well for me that I was utterly delighted. I don't know if there's anything more I can say about Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara other than people should watch it! There are few films that have made me look internally and question my own life choices, so when I discover a new one, I can do little else than sit back and say \"Wow!\"",

The movie's plot draws parallel between scuba diving and life...you need a beautiful young scuba trainer by your side and a big bag.(if you find a treasure from diving then you can keep it in the bag or if you die then you will be carried in that bag).The clever usage of pun in 'bagmati' almost hits home.you need more friends to throwstart fun by nonchalantly throwing your phone away while you are on an important work call.\nThose goofy eyed expressions of those guys must have made Michael Kelso proud of his acting.Katrina is as always the poster girl,the movie balances the acting quotient by adding katrina to the mix of hyperbolic trio.Kalki, shines on crazy diamond putting insecure girlfriends to shame.The 'message' reverberates among the crowd...much like Farhan's baritone .With our unfulfilled dreams, lackluster lives and S&M tendencies,we have several reasons to deem it as a classic.Like they say,you need to smell your balls to feel alive...that sort of kick ZNMD provides...I hope my review's coherence truly reflects the movie's essence.",

However, Katrina's performance was a big disappointing, maybe someone like Deepika would have been more fit for the role.\nThe music is a plus point but it goes unnoticed because of some thought provoking dialogues and soulful pious poetry in Farhan's voice.\nSo guys, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara hence go and watch this movie right now!!!",

People who thinks this is just another version of Dil Chahta hai But To them its not like DCH.. the characters are grown and matured settled with their live Well Most Of them are. There are some materialistic similarities there But its a new movie with a thrilling road story.It's about Rich ppl who have perfect Life and also about A middle class man searching for his father.It's the heart what makes this film really Be called Zindegi Na Milegi Dobara. Its Not Just Story acting , Dialg or the screen play the Technical team also Achieved a ground breaking level. there are breathtaking jaw dropping scenes that will thrill u to ur toes.Although its a bit long...but when u left ur seat u will not remember that.U'll b like \"chutti khatam, School Suru.\" Don't Miss This Bachelor Trip Amigos.",

If you were an adventurous guy back in college and had lot trips plan when you would have money and now when you are earning money there is no time.This the best Bachelor Party plan till date. Living your life and rediscovering yourself. Overcoming fear and reconnecting with old good buddies. It will also make you think what we have been doing with our lives. The Quotes being said in the movie are well placed. and 2-3 songs are amazing. I loved them.

The three of them had great chemistry and it made it all the better. The movie's script is told in such a way that we the audience begin to think as if we are there with the characters during their trip in Spain. It is so funny and had me laughing throughout.The story follows these three friends on a bachelor trip in Spain on which they each learn something about one another that changes their lives forever. The journey through Spain was beautiful and a lot Spanish culture is blended very well with Indian culture. There are a lot of subplots in this movie. But unlike Zoya Akhtar's latest film Dil Dhadakne Do (a film I also liked), the subplots are incorporated masterfully and don't mess up the pacing that much. The songs are also really nice. Plus the cinematography is handled excellently.I honestly have no flaws with this film. It was directed to perfection in my opinion, and that's why Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara gets an A+.",

It seems the director of the highly original \"Luck by chance\" decided to concentrate on good music and fabulous locales;the rest obviously took a back seat.The result-a two and a half hour \"reality show- road trip\" with three guys and a few babes who join them once in a while.Give me a break guys, if I wanted to watch a \"Visit Spain\" show , I would choose a one hour program on \"Doscovery Travel and Living\"(or TLC as it is called these days) At least their shows are honest and don't pretend to be something they are not. This movie didn't work for me.And I have not even started comparing it to \"Dil chahta hai\" ,which was a dream debut for Farhan Akhtar, the director.Why, if DCH was a Mozart symphony, ZNMD(the movie,not the music) is like an electronic synthesizer 'symphony' from the Mozart of Madras.And we all know who sells more albums in India-its definitely not the Viennese composer.So what went wrong with ZNMD?Lets take a long, hard look .. Acting-Hrithik Roshan-Hmmmmmmm,lets make him take his shirt off, dance a bit, romance Katrina..that'll bring in the masses/Come on, Farhan, you got a superlative performance out of Hrithik in 'Lakshya',surely you could have utilized his talent better? Abhay Deol- Whats the protagonist of Dev D and Manorama six feet under doing ,potraying a weak, simpering idiot?Just doesn't seem right. Farhan Akhtar-Zoya gave him a 'Luck by chance', he was great in 'Karthik calling Karthik' and 'Rock on'.Alas, a few funny lines and a few tears does not a great performance make. Kalki Koechlin-seems a misfit as a bitchy ,possessive girlfriend.Although she tries her best to be disliked, and succeeds. Well, look who is the surprise package of the film-its Katrina Kaif!Never before has she played any character with such effortless ease.Maybe its because the character is close to her real-life persona,maybe its because we have zero expectations from her as an actress? You put Naseeruddin Shah and Dipti Naval in the cast, the least you expect is that they will get a few decent scenes.No such luck-while Naseer was rewarded with 2 scenes, poor Dipti got 2 short phone conversations,thats it. Story- three guys on a road trip overcome their fears and discover themselves on the way(yawn!how can you stretch it over 2 and a half hours?) Script-Hrithik takes off shirt, Hrithik dances, Farhan and Abhay dance too, they have a few drinks, they pick up some babes, some bull fighting, some sky diving, some deep sea diving. Dialogues-I,Farhan Akhtar, am the dialogue writer of this film and I also play the funny man.Ergo, I get the best lines, the rest be damned. Direction,editing-whats that?Let them have a ball-the audience loves watching good looking women and men get dirty in a tomato fight,besides doing other fun things.Watch the beautiful people and don't complain about not getting your money's worth.If this movie is supposed to represent the spirit of the youth, heaven help us,for the movie is vacuous ,empty and soul- less.The characters are never established ,they have no depth.The movie simply lacks a strong core. I strongly urge Farhan Akhtar and Zoya Akhtar,if they ever get to read this, to go back to 'Dil Chahta Hai' and 'Luck by Chance' and to remember that its the story ,script and strong characters that make a movie, not stars, not locales or good music.You take out the soul from a movie and you got nothing.And thats what you take home from this movie- nothing.What a waste of the combined talents of the cast ,director,music directors,the cinematographer.What a pity.",

And the sooner you stop equating the characters of this film with real people the better. That's why this feels like such a waste. It's a Hrithik is histrionically shown he is child actor knows only to dance, but with the his presence in the movie thrown out of comfort zone and forced to either sink or swim, well. So fixated is the film on trying to appear 'cool', even 'minty-fresh,' that the emotional connects all seem like afterthoughts. Especially the flashback each boy has, and their subsequent, convenient epiphany. It's all so surfacial and unnecessary, even when well-performed, like the moment between Naseeruddin Shah and Farhan, when the latter is finally allowed to drop the forced grin and cry like he does best.",

            "content": "Just when you think Farhan Akhtar can no longer spin a good yarn with 3-4 leads, he does it again.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobaara is an entertaining film with crisp dialogues and clean fun. The premise is simple - three friends keeping up their promise from their college days and getting together for a vacation after several years. Their lives could not be more different from one another, however with one common thread. Each of them has one single issue in their lives that holds them back from living their lives with true happiness. The vacation they take opens their eyes in ways they had not imagined and makes them realize..... yes.... that life is short and one should enjoy it to the fullest.Despite the simple, maybe oft-seen plot in Hindi films, there is a certain freshness in the film with excellent dialogues and screenplay. The cinematography is spectacular with carefully though-out shooting locations. The sub-plots in the film are well written and all of them connect well with the overall message of the film.The acting is top-notch with Abhay Deol taking the cake. He has to be one of the most under-rated actors in the Hindi film industry and is clearly head and shoulders above his more renowned cousins, Sunny and Bobby. He plays the role to perfection so much so that you can easily walk out of the theater without thinking much about it.Farhan Akhtar is creating a name for himself as a wonderful actor with this being his best performance thus far. Surprisingly, his dancing also appears very well-executed in the film. Hrithik, inarguably the most popular of the three lead actors, is adequate for the role he plays.,. But unquestionably, his acting in the film seems to be the most lacking in comparison to the outstanding performances turned in by his less famous cohorts, especially Abhay Deol.The music is good, with Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy turning in another good performance with Javed Akhtar.Overall, while this movie will tend to remind one of the evergreen Dil Chahta Hai from 10 years ago, there is more than enough freshness in this movie for it to stand on its own.",

It does it all: entertains you, teaches you some lessons, gives you some advice, makes you want to rethink the way you're living your life, makes you laugh, makes you wonder what fears YOU have that you needed to get over right away!Despite what some squeezed-brains reviewers would say, ZNMD is NOT a tourism ad for Spain. Sure, it proceeds on a road trip, but the director did a fabulous job of showing the audience the true magic of traveling on road with your friends, instead of flying on plane. The screenplay was amazingly structured and the cinematography was epic. It is a VERY pretty-looking film and that has little to do with the fact that it was just shot in Spain. And some of the situations, if not all, were so HILARIOUS, that I fell in love with the idea of bromance all over again. Zoya Akhtar clearly knew what she was doing. I also felt deeply connected with the slow, no-dialogue portion where Hrithik starts crying after deep-sea diving with Katrina. Thanks SO much for adding Farhan's poem in that scene! Cathartic, beautiful.Hrithik Roshan never fails to amaze me. He knew it was a multicast film, and he knew all three held lead roles. He knew he had to sandwich himself between Abhay Deol and Farhan Aktar because the audience needed to bite and taste all three layers together. I could see what he was doing, say, in the song \"Senorita\". He can dance a million times better than that, but he made himself go with the flow of the script! Hat's off for making the movie look so believable and amazing.Naseeruddin Shah's small role was brilliantly played by the actor. Farhan Akhtar's poetry was cherry on top of this delicious cake of a movie. Katrina's performance, I must say, has vastly improved, and she looked really pretty in this film. Abhay Deol played his role just perfectly, a confused nerd in love..or not. Kalki was brilliant, too. That hairdo completely suited the character she so craftily brought out.And is it just me or was that climax so totally something we never saw before? Maybe in a long long quality time. The whole film was a poem. Brilliant directorial approach, amazing cinematography, and SO New Age. Will attract all kinds of audience. I could go on and on but well, I'll just rate you.10 on 10.",

Y tu mama tambien was revolutionary as it touched on many issues like same sex attraction, live life to fullest etc. I mean Y tu.. came almost 10 years ago but today even after 10 years Bollywood movies do not have the guts to show same sex relations. Indian culture (and therefore the filmmakers as well as the audience) is yet very backward and so they have changed the original movie a little bit to suit themselves (converted gay characters to straight and that makes it boring)and the audience. Plus in Y tu.. you have actors like Gael Garcia Bernal etc who are superb. Hrithik Roshan (who is a bad actor and made it big only because of his father who was established in bollywood), Farhan Akhtar (who is very ordinary in terms of talent and also bad actor and also made it big only because of his father who was established in Bollywood)etc. are soooo ordinary and rubbish in front of original star cast. I would say that it is a boring and a very humble remake with very ordinary and rubbish actors (in front of the star cast of Y tu mama Tambien)of the great movie Y tu mama Tambien. It is very sad that Bollywood makes the most number of movies in the world but not even a single one is to the quality of movies such as Y tu mama...All the movies are horrible with unrealistic fights and silly dances and orthodox and backward Indian culture. It is a waste of time watching any Bollywood movie as they lack creativity (most are copies of Hollywood or other foreign or Tamil movies). India is blessed with world class actors such as Amitabh Bacchan, Aishwarya rai and heavenly Madhuri Dixit but the film makers do not utilize them properly and make absolutely unrealistic rubbish, horrible and shitty movies.

I am sure there is a name to it in cinema language (Cinematography to be exact), but I would call it photography for it to register well in my mind!Absolutely delightful light, brilliantly shot under the sun, happily exposed scenes (both indoor and outdoor) and not to forget lovely editing!Add to this1. a nice light combination of multiple stories running in parallel 2. interesting dose of humor and right proportions of emotion 3. SPAIN and a filmy version of what to do when in Spain documentary 4. moments that you would have wanted to live and would have lived too! I have had the doordarshan scene in my life a few times already 5. affection and love and honesty and trust and lack of it stiched almost perfectly well 6. sequences that would make you ask yourself about when you are going to do them (because most of it is definitely doable) 7. a nicely fast paced, still slowing down movie which would make you breathe in the moments you would want to... the deep sea diving or the long drive in a vintage, or the breathtaking skydive... 8. comedy where it should be, and beautiful poetry where it should be. I thought it was Farhan Akhtar who had written the poetry in addition to the movie, however it turns out that it was Javed Akhtar who did! not surprised! 9. an honest real to life friendship and momentsAnd what you get it is a movie that you should watch again... because Zindagi mile na mile dobara, is movie ka show dubara ho sakta hai :)What I did not really like about the movie though..1. it missed a bit of name calling.. there are moments where good ol' friends do not resist the macho pencho language... this movie was too clean to be true 2. part of the skydive was clearly fabricated... though it did seem that these guys had jumped, I would have loved to see the first tandem jump or at least a mention of it before they make a solo jump... It is IMPOSSIBLE to have your first jump as a SOLO jump! that kind of was messy! 3. Hritik Roshan gets to kiss Kat! not fair! :PA lot of us could compare the roles of the three, and say Farhan got a better role than Hritik or Abhay did a better job than Farhan or similar things... I however feel that the three were so good in what they were supposed to do that I would not really want a change if given a choice!",

            "content": "There's a moment in Zoya Akhtar's 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' when Arjun, the character played by Hrithik Roshan, sits on a boat with tears in his eyes. It becomes clear that in a strange way, Arjun has been set free by a deep-sea diving experience. The realization hits him that life is beautiful but you can only savor it when you live it by your own rules, not by what is expected of you.'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' takes the light-hearted tone of a fun, all-boys road trip through Spain to give you a deep and heartfelt message on why we should live life by seizing the moment and following our hearts. Director Zoya Akhtar, who proved with her wonderful debut 'Luck By Chance' that she has a perceptive eye for relationships and an assured storytelling style, uses the same tools to tell a new story.Three lifelong friends in their thirties decide to take the three-week road trip they always planned when Kabir (played by Abhay Deol) gets engaged to Natasha (played by Kalki Koechlin). Kabir is the binding force between his polar-opposite friends: the free-spirited advertising copywriter Imran (played by Farhan Akhtar), and the uptight Arjun, strait-jacketed by his career. To add excitement, the only rule on this road trip is that all three friends must try out an adventure sport chosen by each of them.Boys will be boys and this film catches that note beautifully. You can be in your thirties, but a few minutes with your childhood friends takes you right back to being a teenager, playing the same old pranks, and imitating your college professor's weird accent. You have to love the natural way in which a simmering undercurrent between Arjun and Imran erupts over a silly, childish fight and how they scuffle about as if they were in a schoolyard. Arjun is aggravated by Imran's annoying, not-serious-for-a-moment attitude, but underneath his flip manner, Imran is struggling with a secret of his own. The adventure gets complicated with love when diving instructor Laila (played by Katrina Kaif) enters the equation - she's a young Paulo Coelho in her own sexy way, showing Arjun how to appreciate life's simple pleasures. A jealous, possessive Natasha also stirs up the pot when she lands up unannounced on the group. She's the worst kind of gatecrasher - a fianc\u00e9e on a bachelor trip.There are several scenes in 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' that make you want to pack your bags and gather your pals. Each adventure sport is shot so thrillingly that you feel alive and in-the-moment, even though you're actually watching it all sitting in a dark theater. Watch that hair-raising skydiving scene - it's such an unusual salute to friendship. A real tone is maintained through the dialogs written by Farhan Akhtar; they have that a casual slice-of-life flavor, and the jokes here are genuinely funny.What makes 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' that much more enjoyable are the performances. Katrina Kaif is content to play off the three male leads, yet she brings a charming, lovely touch to her role. Kalki Koechlin, playing what is essentially a caricature, keeps her character grounded in the real; so while you may not particularly like her in the end, you can see why she acts that way.The three male stars have that believable vibe of a long friendship. Abhay Deol brings an effortless, comfortable energy to Kabir, while Farhan Akhtar is a revelation. He's so goofy that you burst out laughing several times, yet he shows vulnerability just as easily. Hrithik Roshan once again brings real depth to his character with a spectacular performance. He's shy and restrained, then lets go with such fantastic intensity that you make the inward journey with his character.Make sure you take this trip!",

            "content": "First things first, I personally want to say 'Thank you Zoya'.... Most of the young Indians (especially at least those in late 20s and early 30s) are part of a rat race. The rat race to make maximum money in the shortest time possible. So that they can get maximum luxuries and facilities to spend their lives in comfort . What we all forget to do, is to live for today... Even with the sanest of hearts, try to live among these times and you are bound to loose yourselves in this wild rat race. 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' is like a mirror held against yourself making you self realise for those who have already lost it being part of the rat race and reassure others who are almost in in the fear of loosing their dreams to this mad race to make money.Now to the movie, its a wonderful coming of age story of 3 friends. And its not 'Dil Chahtai Hai' nor '3 Idiots'. Zoya uses a delightful first half to establish the 3 characters. She is super successful in presenting the goofy and super cool Farhan as 'Imran'. The initially cold and money minded 'Arjun' shows why Hrithik is the real actor star to watch out for after Aamir Khan. Of the three, the slight weaker but yet assured is Abhay Deol as Kabir. The entire first half which includes the forming, storming and norming stages of their team is a superb comic ride. The visuals of Spain, the backdrop, the culture, the music ..its all a perfect setting. Katrina chips in as a wonderful diving instructor who has the zest for life. She is the eye opener for Arjun and he sees life from a different angle in her. Kalki Koechlin as Abhay's typical fianc\u00e9e is still good with what she does. The interval arrives even as you are still laughing from the previous scene and thats a good one to be in.The second half starts off OK but is tad slow in the middle portions. Its almost like we are waiting for it to all come together. But that arrives soon. If the first 2 adventures enthrall you for the visual beauty then wait for the third one in the climax, its a ripper. At the climax, all 3 of them have grown out of their issues, discovering that they have literally found themselves. Their own true self. And that is what matters the most.SEL score another winner of an album... Senurita, Dil Dhadakne Do are all great but for me 'Paint It Red' was best.Cinematography is cool..The last lines of Imran's poem... that is the best written piece to have been on screen for some time.",

            "content": "Zindagi Na Milagi Dobara, when I first saw the trailer It came to my mind that it would be something exceptional.Because Zoya Akhter and Farhan Akhter are the names in Bollywood who stand for something different and new(Luck by chance,Dil Chahta Hai).But It is something more.You should watch it.Otherwise you will miss one of the finest movies in Bollywood,perhaps the best movie in 2011.First focus on the story, it is awesome and mind blowing.It is out of box according to the presence but it is very close to you if you search for it in the inner world of your mind and want to feel every second of your life.Well, some may say that there are similarities between Dil Chahta Hai an ZNMD but it is not correct.Just character of 3 friends can't make two movies similar.Actually ZNMD has the story which is absolutely better and which has the capability to make one watch the movie at a stretch from the very beginning.Zoya made the best stroke from the first frame of the movie.If you don't watch the credit line,thinking that it is of no use and as boring as the typical Bollywood films,you will miss the definitions of the 3 \"mental boys\". The activities by the trio (Farhan,Abhay,Hrittik)for their trip and the style of packing and preparing their necessary things will tell you how the characters are.And if you watch the full movie I promise you that the trio will be a part of your life by their thoughts,activities,presence and BY THEIR LIFE!!! Hrittik has proved it once again that a good actor doesn't need a movie which can make 100 crores but he needs a script which is really fantastic.He has done the up to the mark job as \"Arjun\". Specially I must admit that nothing but the eyes of Arjun(Hrittik)will tell you many things. Abhay is the man in the industry who has done some great works which are not just the movie you see in every Friday.Just \"Dev D\" is enough to get idea about his very well acting ability.In this movie he(Kabir) is perfect.He will make you laugh, make you think and make you feel like challenged. If you have seen \"Shiela ki jawaani\",\"Dhunki\",\"Chikni Chameli\" just let them go away.Katrina has proved that she can act really better in the character of an Anglo-Indian.In \"New York\" she had done a great job and in this movie she is just awesome and her character(Laila)is as cute she is. Kalki is a heroine who just not works for being eye candy but also for justify a script.In this movie short presence but it is enough to make her character(Natasha) clear enough to the viewers.her character tells us about the complexities and phobia which are created from possessiveness. Deepti Naval and Nasiruddin Shah are beautiful in their thankful presence. Now lets talk about Imran.What is he?Is he a poet,a tourist, a \"Majnu\", a friend,a son finding his father or a man finding his LIFE?You can not but give Farhan 10 on 10 as Imran. The funny activities such as making one dumbfounded,making rapid fire as \"Doctor Fraud\" and Imran's friendship with \"Bagwaati\" are very cute.Thanks Carlos Catalan for such a great cinematography.He has captured the locations of Spain and the characters in the film very well.The man will make you feel that you are the 4th friend of the trio in the car, under the artistic blue water,at he time of sky diving and at the time of running with the bulls,perhaps in all the frames of this movie.the background scenes will make you amazed for example and from my point of view, in the frame of sky diving the miniatures on the land shows you the complexities of life and the blue wide sky tells you that let the problems go away and enjoy the life and fly at large at the sky of life. You will like the choreography by Bosco-Caesar.the cinematography in \"Khaboon Key Parindey\" and in the frame of reciting the poetry in background is too good.Specially having the feel of feeling the air and speed of travel.Make a trip to Spain.I wish I could make a trip to Spain with ZNMD team. Farhan has proved his creativity by writing such a witty and meaningful dialogue. If you have enjoyed the combination of Javed Akhter and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy before;then once again enjoy it.Every song is good enough as it appears in the movie.The trio has not only acted well in the movie but also sang well the song \"Senorita\".Mohit and Alyssa Mendonsa will make you sing as \"Khaabon key parindey\"(Birds of dream).\"Dil dhadkane do\" and \"Sooraj Ki Bahoon\" are the song you can't miss to have the appropriate feel and taste of this movie.Just listen them and feel it. Javed Akhter has not only produced two brilliant son and daughter and many great lyrics throughout his but also written 4 great poems in ZNMD.\"Jab Jab Dard Ka Badal\" is my favorite.Thanks Farhan for such a recitation. Background score is an asset of this film.the use of heart-bits and guitar as background score is great. Anand Subaya has done the great editing.Nandini Shrikent is 10 on 10 in casting. Overall ZNMD is the film which will bring light in your dark room,bring friends in your lonely life,bring poetry in your complex life,make you the man who has his mind and Life.It also a prove that just a hot item song or just two or three packed fighting scenes or a packed work of VFX or just throwing dialogues for 100 crores is not enough for a great movie.A great movie needs realistic story ,presented in such a frame which is just appropriate and artistic ,witty dialogue,great cinematography and the actors who can act and make you feel that they are the characters.And ZNMD has those. Watch it.\"Zindagi Na Milagi Dobara\" na milagi dobara.It is for you.",

            "content": "The subject is not new: Three men on a road trip, thinking about their life choices, evolving and maturing throughout the movie, finding new goals and healing old wounds. Indian movies are not what I usually prefer. I chose to watch ZNMD because of two reasons: Hrithik Roshan, an actor I saw in KKKG and was deeply impressed with. And the plot being set in Europe. I wanted to see how much an Indian movie can catch the atmosphere so different from India.To anticipate the outcome of this review: It was a through and through positive movie experience. I will definitely watch Indian movies more often than I did until now.Before Kabir (Abhay Deol) gets married he wants to fulfill a pact he made with his two best friends, Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Each of them will surprise the other two with some adventure sport experience they will do for the first time together. For this they travel through Spain and find not only adventures, but laughs and loves, new insights and unexpected outcomes. Director Zoya Akhtar has found a way to make a new movie out of an old theme. Charming, compelling and \u2013 thanks to the protagonists \u2013 totally believable. Among all the good performances Hrithik Roshan stands out. His change from the smart businessman to a man thinking about his life choices is intense but still with the kind of lightness and charisma that suits exactly the tone the director sets for the whole movie. Cool demeanor and vulnerability, strengths and weaknesses of his character \u2013 Hrithik Roshan portrays all the different facets with sensible acting, touching emotional involvement and a humorous streak you wouldn't expect first seeing him on the screen. Abhay Deol as the future groom has all the sympathies in his role as the balance between his two friends, but shows the complexity of his character in the course of the movie. Farhan Akhtar characterizes the free spirit of Imraan \u2013 believable and intense. He is at his best in the humorous and in the very quiet scenes of the movie. Katrina Kaif portrays a sensible woman, full of dreams yet down to earth and Kalki Koechlin shows in her scenes that she is an actress with presence and good comic timing.Outstanding of course the music and the dance scenes full of rhythm and fun. Again, it is no surprise that Hrithik Roshan \u2013 known for his great dancing skills \u2013 is the heart of these parts of the movie, though without showing off. So it is the concerted performance of all the protagonists that gives the movie its special flair. As European I have often seen Europe or parts of Europe characterized in a way that makes me slightly cringe. Not this time. Europe \u2013 more specifically Spain \u2013 is portrayed recognizable and simpatico. I have since learned that this lightness and humour on one side, the depth of content on the other side is not the norm in Hindi Movies. As the rare gem among them that ZNMD is I can only recommend to watch it as outstanding example of Indian films.A movie not only for Bollywood lovers. You will agree at the end of the film \u2013 we all should give us the chance to have new movie experiences. Because we all know: Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara \u2013 you don't live twice \ud83d\ude09",

Designed for a generation that is watching classical Bollywood fare only as another genre as an outsider without ever entering it. Farhaan captures the mood of the generation with finesse - amused and observant, believer and cynical, light and penetrating. The setting is premium, glamorous and international. A lot of money has been spent in providing authenticity to the ambiance. Unlike Karan Johar's family series where the context is international but the art direction is caricaturish . Johar dishes out classical emotionally loud Bollywood fare that just happens to be set in New York. The issues are classical - discovering the true meaning of career , love and your relationship with your parents and the resolutions are pitched just right without making them sentimental or too preachy, even if slightly clich\u00e9d and predictable. Music adds to the mood without being too distinctive. Spain is captured beautifully and lovingly.Watch it.Among other things for its rather joyous desire to celebrate life.",

It is just an adaptation of many of those romantic comedies from Hollywood, by Bollywood. Obviously, an attempt to match with Hollywood at least in romantic comedy genre. Once again, there are a group of characters who represents hardly 1% of Indian population. And there are hardly any scenes in India too. And finally Bollywood seems to recognise that there are countries outside USA, UK and Australia too. I repeat, there is nothing Indian in this movie. It can be watched like a Hollywood movie, with some characters with Indian names.",

First, the character connection could not be made and I didn't feel a zilch when Imraan meets his father, no emotions for me. That story was completely ignored and was only used to bring closure to the film. Second, first fifteen minutes gives me hangover from Hangover. Third, Acting becomes overacting when you try too hard to make people believe in what you are saying, same happened with Hritik, who previously had been a good actor. Fourth, prolong sequences of Leads enjoying themselves on air, with tomatoes, in bar - my verdict not needed as I have Tourism channel on my TiVo. Fifth and most important, the film had no basic storyline. Seems only the idea to get lots of sponsorship and paid vacation for everyone was there in director's head when she wrote the script. All and all, average movie. Can ignore if you are Holly-addict.",

Was my first movie starring Fahan Akhtar and this chap sure knows how to make his dialogues deliver the dose a chemistry among 3 old friends needs to keep the discriminating (not me!) engrossed. Katrina Kaif riding a bullet (or was it a Harley?) must have been the BDSM male fantasy the community probably deserves now. Spain looked good and more so the Senoras and the Senoritas.

            "content": "After exactly 10 years of DIL CHAHTA HAI, we got another 'to-be' cult classic which will b remembered for a long time - I m sure. and What a co-incidence!! That film marks the debut of Farhan Akhtar..here also he is part of the film..but as an actor who is extremely good.Someone rightly said ZNMD will teach us the meaning of LIFE... it stays to the true words of its title 'ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DUBARA..'. some lines of its unforgettable really..\"Who can guarantee you that you will live upto 40 years???\" such lines struck the chord of everyone & everybody looks back to his life with a different opinion..This film does produce an elegant way of giving philosophical view through the journey which Kabir(Abhay), Arjun(Hrithik) & Imran(Farhan) took. it never got bored for a single time. while watching this, you will be flooded with many aspects like how to loose control of your life, how to keep the value of friendship, how to ignite your dubious view towards LIVING, & obviously what you want from your life (which is already shown in 3 idiots & many films, so last1 is not new).Zoya Akhtar made this film into such an extravaganza road movie that you feel connected in every way... the sky diving scene, the underwater surfing scene & lastly, the running-from-the-bull scene, you will feel blessed & corrected for its sharp penetrated effect in your mind.The cinematography is exotic, beautiful & charismatic. after a long time, I have seen such an enigmatic camera work in a Bollywood movie that you just forget its an Indian movie. specially, the sky-diving scene, OMG, the shot has been taken with so much perfection that you can feel the flying effect. not only that, the whole movie is full of colors, exotic locations & great view of natural beauty of Spain where it is shot. it is like the colors are representing the colors of life. Amazing cinematography.Dialogues are also remarkable. actually it is expected because this comes from the veteran poet & lyricist Javed Akhtar. he created the lines of poem of Farhan Akhtar, which holds true to the feel of the movie. every poem is at the best, deep in its meaning.Finally, the acting. there is no need of talking ab8 the Trio i.e. farhan, abhay & Hrithik. because we all know what these guys can deliver. Farhan lifts his character Imran into another level with his perfect comic timing, perfect blend of feelings & emotion. He is superb. Abhay,as usual delivers a solid performance. his typical dialogue throwing mannerism gives Kabir a much more poignant effect. He is brilliant as a casual guy who, in this socio-culture of India, has been started to compromise his own likings which is usually happened often. Hrithik as a Arjun is just as rocking in his performance. its a treat to watch & experience his transformation from a lonely, life-in-a-hell corporate guy to a great, spiritually transformed, free-bird, contented-with-new-viewpoint-ab8-life guy. He is perfect. Fans of him wont be dissatisfied with him.But, ya, most of all, about whom I want to write from the start, here it comes...KATRINA KAIF!!! She is a REVELATION!!! Oh MY, I couldn't but stare at her... she is far more developed in acting in it. most of the time, the awkwardness which usually comes in her acting while acting in Hindi movie, here that6 is completely GONE. you just cant help loving her here...& this applies to girls also!!! not for a single time, her appearance has been outsider (which is usually the case). she is the most charming essence of ZIndagi na milegi Dubara... & of course, not to forget, her passionate Kiss with Hrithik made the film more vibrant in its energy. Guys, if you don't like Bollywood now-a-days, just watch this for Katrina Kaif.. you will love it. & Girls, for your thing, you have the 3 cool, classy, trendy boys who actually rocked the screen!! each one is a pleasure to watch. SO WHY R YOU WAITING TILL NOW??? just grab your ticket & see it & feel it. I am sure nobody, after watching would feel like abusing me!!!Watch out!!!",

Three characters have certain personal issues and in the beginning they are not all that aware of them. Hrithik Roshan plays a workaholic stock broker, Imran is unhappy because he's recently found out that his real father is a man called Salman, who lives in Spain, and Abhay Deol is going to marry his girlfriend. These three \"dudes\" decide to take a road trip together, an extended version of a bachelor party. What follows is very predictable. And not particularly exciting or intriguing. You can only connect so much with whatever these guys are going through. The director has, unfortunately, failed in creating any depth in the characters. Also, I found the self-centered nature of the movie and all its characters appalling. I mean here we live in a world filled with poverty, nuclear plant disasters, environmental damage, climate issues, failing economies, and here are three \"dudes\" just having a good time and worrying about their rather petty issues.Whatever happened to Hindi cinema that used to bring social issues to the forefront and at the same time offer entertainment.Abhay Deol has acted in some really good movies. It was disappointing to see his talents wasted on this one. Watch this movie if you really have nothing better to do. Otherwise pass it and don't waste your time or money.",

Instead, there is an extremely good looking, rich guy (Hrithik) struggling to be in relationships because he is so career-driven and miserable. Goofy friend with daddy issues (Farhan Aktar) who also writes poems secretly and another guy who keeps the group together but breaks up with the woman he is about to marry because she thought he was proposing her when he showed her the ring he bought for his home (I mean, come on!)

It's charming. It's delicious. The DOP does a great job and the way the stories unfold in the scenes are great too. The best thing about the story is that, it has a running story. We are just watching a part of a much larger film. We are only watching the Bachelor trip part but the entire story is about three friends (amigos!) and their life and their personal story. Have you noticed how each of the three friends' personal life made them who they are? It's incredible if you take some time and think about it. Think about each of their parents. The girls they love or think they love. And their jobs. What they do for a career. Even though they went to the same school, during the same time and are approximately the same age and same sex, they are SO DIFFERENT. And they are all best friends.

I must say, the Hrithik, Farhan and Abhay trio were spectacular, and as always, Farhan's work was top notch. I started on a positive note, as it pretty much goes downhill from here onwards.The movie, was ruined by inconsistent screenplay, several bloopers (although rather small), and a below par story. They had the recipe for a magnificent road trip film, but this was not to be unfortunately. The entire film seemed rushed. There was no sense of commitment by any of the actors/actresses. Shamefull really. How can one spoil a cake when the batter has already been made. Surely the hard part was done? I don't understand how it got so many awards instead of movies such as Roackstar, Don 2 etcetera.That being said, it was refreshing to see a bollywood movie without any traditional, stupid (and rather embarrassing) fight/action scenes, and still being funny for the general populace. Also, I must say, the sound track was TOP notch. it is still one of my favourites, almost an year on.All in all a good movie if you can honestly find nothing else to do, but please, for the love of god, it cant be that hard to find something else to do. Foe example, stapling your eyelids shut.On a side note, because i think it now goes without saying, Katrina kaif was horrendous as always... Shame really. If anybody thinks that she can act, please, please, please open your eyes, or go to a psychiatrist. Thankyou. Although, on a positive way to look at things, she is getting better, albeit at snails pace.A dismal 5/10. expected so much more.",

Here are some negatives: None! , I honestly can't find issues with the film because it's well shot, acted, written and directed,but if I had to really dig in and wish something could've been changed, I think that it was when they played Sare Jahaan Se Acha when the three of them went skydiving. I was kinda confused why they played the song during that, but I can ignore it. Here are some positives: 1:Acting: The acting is really great in the movie and I don't think anyone did a bad job. Hrithik Roshan was great as Arjun and I liked his arc from being a workaholic who cares about work and money to someone who wants live life in a great way and his acting was really nice to see! Farhan Akhtar was also great as Imraan and I liked the poetry and acting by him. Abhay Deol was great as Kabir and to be honest he's an underrated actor. Everyone else also did great like Katrina Kaif, Kalki Koechin, Nassuredin Shah and etc. 2. Cinematography: The cinematography was great and the shots were beautiful! 3. Soundtrack: The soundtrack in this film is one of my favourite soundtracks of all time. Ik Junoon is my favourite and also Dil Dhadhkne Do, Khawbon ke Parindey and the rest was great.4.Pacing: I thought that the pacing was good and wasn't uneven. 5. Nostalgic feeling: I love this movie a lot and I've seen it a lot of times! And when I was at my old high school, I had a lot of fun with my friends and it was a great year and this film makes me feel those times and I wish I could go back! There are more positives, but overall ZNMD is a great movie which explores friendships, conflicts, inspiration and more! It hits the right notes and makes you emotional when it needs to. I love this movie and it's a great and entertaining movie!I give ZNMD a 10/10!",

The gang of bwoys is on a roll in this film and you just go with the flow......Every time a prank is played, u wanna laugh out loud. every time they try a sport, u want to be a part of it. And Spain.....its just too beautiful...People have been comparing this film with some other films like rock on, dil chahta hai and saying that its not of that level. But what they fail to understand that every story is different from the other. The genre may be the same, but its a different story with different actors and a different director at the helm.The actors deliver excellent performances. Though i am a huge Hrithik Roshan Fan, even i am finding it tough to say that he was the best. All three were just amazing and the chemistry they had between them was superb. Just like it was between the cast of Dil chahta hai.I found the pacing of second half a bit slow....but then, drama is always a bit slower.....Jokes in the movie are great.....everyone a real life one, unlike those cheesy forced one liners from recent Hindi comedy films. Youth, college goers can easily connect with that because that is what happens always between them.Finally, i wud just say, its an excellent movie not worth missing out on.....i have my tickets booked for a dobara watch......u should too.....",

The poems of the character Imran was just icing on the cake. The movie may have generic tropes but it's executed very properly and that's all matters.

            "content": "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara opens with a scene in which a young man is on his knees, proposing to a girl he has known for no more than six months. The film ends with three buddies on the run from the bulls of Pamplona in an affirmation of freedom from all baggage, professional, emotional and social. It can happen only in Spain.Kabir (Abhay Deol), the young son of a construction tycoon, is engaged to an interior designer, Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). ?I construct buildings and you design interiors, we are perfect,? the scion tells his would-be wife. The wedding date is promptly fixed.To celebrate the impending end of his bachelor status, Kabir and his two best friends, free-spirited advertising copywriter Imran (Farhan Akhtar) and workaholic financial broker Arjun (Hrithik Roshan), embark on an extended road trip through Spain.It turns out to be an outing of a lifetime as the three men confront the past, negotiate the present and carve out a new future. They are helped along by a lively half-Indian, half-British girl Laila (Katrina Kaif), who they meet on a beach in Costa Brava. She turns out to be their deep sea diving instructor. Laila believes that a man should be in a box only when he is dead.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara has a simple enough narrative core that revolves around the three male protagonists seeking to breakfree from the confines of their respective boxes. Their struggles yield many charming moments although one cannot avoid the sneaking suspicion that this cheerful ode to life, love and friendship is as much about telling a story as about a selling a country to prospective tourists.Be that as it may, there can be no denying that Spain is a marvellous country and, thanks to Carlos Catalan?s fluid camerawork, it looks absolutely stunning on screen. The beauty of the land disarms you and you cannot but go along with the flow of this rather heady ride despite the occasional bumps on the way.The screenplay, authored by Reema Kagti and director Zoya Akhtar, manages to stay on course all the way through to the end although narrative pace isn?t what it strives for. Even as the three friends indulge in constant banter ? witty one-liners and poker-faced non-sequiturs are liberally tossed around ? and play pranks on strangers and on each other, they have serious emotional issues to settle and many ingrained fears and doubts to overcome.Arjun has a fear of the deep, Imran freezes at the very thought of jumping from an airborne chopper and Kabir has no appetite for being gored by a bull. But they are bound by an agreement sealed between the friends at the very outset of the voyage of discovery. So they are compelled to deal with their phobias and surmount them in acts of inner defiance that alter their lives forever.The ?seize the day? philosophy that underlines the film is old as the hills. Yet Zoya Akhtar, by investing the tale with a delightful lightness of touch and dollops of gentle wit, brings a degree of freshness to bear upon the plot.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara does exude pronounced traces of the spirit of Dil Chahta Hai, but its essential rhythm is its own, stemming from the dynamics of a full-fledged road movie shot through with intelligence, emotion and, above all, humanism.The adventures that the three men encounter ? deep sea diving in Costa Brava, a tomato fight in Bunol, sky diving in Sevilla and, finally, the San Fermin Bull Run in Pamplona ? are catalysts that bring out the best in them. As physical metaphors for liberation of the spirit, they are seamlessly integrated into the storyline for the most part.The understated, youthful ambience of the film allows the actors to be their own selves and they all do it without a hitch. The high points: the infectious Senorita number and the single-scene special appearance by Naseeruddin Shah. As always, he sets the benchmark.",

Hard to tell. Emotions of betrayal, anger won't fade away easy. The fogiveness would take more time given the closed character of Arjun. But what it portrays actually is the changing nature of the relationships. The scene where Kabir explains his unhappiness is as real as it could get. Sometimes people grow apart in relationships eventhough they are similar. On contrary the difference in Arjun and Laila's behaviour gets them closer as they completed each other. Imran has the highest growth as a character here. He realizes his mistakes and apologize.It is definitely a good watch.",

Then the film deals with every characters' conflicts in their lives. Kalki and Katreena are also in fabulous roles.\nThe impressive thing about the film is every single character in the film adds meaning to the story and subject. The small humor in the story majorly generates by Farhan's character (who also wrote the dialogue of the film) adds another complicated yet soothing layer to it.\nThe seriousness in the film is created by Hritik's character. He lags life in his life, as his tight and grayish clothes. Also his transformation is quite interesting. Whereas the suspense of the film is brought by Abhay's character. He is mischievous yet sincere. He is most complicated character among all.\nKalki's character is written very well, but her performance took it on another level. Same as the Katrina's character, which adds quite subtle meaning and layer to the film.\nThe scenes were well written in the film, for that matters it takes you forward in the film. The cinematography is brilliantly appropriate to the landscape and the scale of the film.\nIn the end, i would like to immensely appreciate the Farhan's Poetry (Wriiten by Javed Akhtar Sir) which adds completely another dimension and subtle touch of zeal in the film.\nAs Imraan says in the film, \"Dilon mein tum apni betabiyan leke chal rahe ho.

Kabir (Abhay Deol) has just met Natasha. After six months they get into engagement. He desires to go on a comprehensive bachelor party. A three week road tour with Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan)- his two most excellent friends from the time when he was in school. The only difficulty is Arjun is very busy with his work. After much emotional blackmail and coaxing the men set off on a trip they were meant to go some four years ago. On a daydream holiday they had desired to go after completing their college but it under no circumstances took place. A road tour where every one gets to perform the final sport of his selection and the other two only have to do it with him! Irrespective of their consent whether they wanted to do that or not! Kabir Imraan and Arjun come across together in Barcelona and set off on an exciting activity that would not just make them iron out their differences but would also face their fears, change their insight, unknot their fabric, force them to smash out of the box and educate them to grab hold of the day. In another words, a holiday that would transform their lives everlastingly!For the one who is sad or depressed should definitely watch this movie. This movie is a blessing for those who wish to dream who wish to fly and live every single breath of their life.

And we cannot see super star Hrithik roshan but we can see only actor Hrihtik roshan playing his character.. Thank you for the entire team for giving us a cult classic film like this.",

            "content": "Most of the people stuck with Hollywood movies. In respect of Hollywood movies, even most divergent characters are also part of American culture. Different cultures bring huge difference. I don't know why but I felt Arjun, Imraan and Kabir are more likable and somehow more real then charismatic Hollywood guys.On the other hand, I liked Imraan's poems. Especially the last one. It was very touching. The idea of the poem and the scene matches perfectly. The film about breaking boundaries and I think at the same direction.I strongly recommend this movie to everyone who is looking for something different.",

            "content": "The movie is very interesting good to watch it...full of adventure and never makes one feel really bored or the movie is slow..I was especially interested in the emotional aspect between the three friends how they help each other out in times of their distress or the aspect where we are so much part of the corporate world and we forget the essential things that life has in store for us to make our lives beautiful.I also found things such having to conquer ones own fears like Roshan had fear of water ... and having to live another day with the good feeling.The emotions felt very natural and not at all fabricated or the fact that friends are their for friends in help and distress is also showed appropriately without any extra emotional baggage like over crying or drama thats usually a part of bollywood movies.The quote which says \"Live this moment for there is all that exists , who knows you may or may not live after 40 years or next day\" is a dialgoue given by Katrina kaif to Hrithik roshan after he says he would retire after 40 years and then would think about enjoying life.",

The story, cinematography, music, direction, characters and every aspect of the movie is just brilliant. The best part of music is the Farhan's poetry and song \"Der lagi lekin\" piano instrument, takes my breath away just incredible which you can't express in words.",

            "content": "'Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara' is literally a Refreshing movie to watch, you have to see it to believe my words. Its a basically a Roadtripmovie but emotions, simplicity and excitement are so blended in it that you get a feeling of living a life of each of characters in film. Itstarts with 3 of Friends well established in their own fields and in their 30s as Kabir (played by Abhay Deol),Arjun( played by Hrithik Roshan) and Imran (played by Farhan Akhtar) on the way to their Road trip which were they were planning since their college days. Excitement part is that all three friends must try out an adventure sport chosen by each of them. On the journey you get closer to each of character as story unfolds their life and how their perspective about life changes when journey ends. Songs in the movie are just awesome, performances of each actors are very good but Farhan Akhtar stands out, he has done exceptionally well considering he is director first. Katrina Kaif has done well apart from looking good and dancing that she does quite often in regular Bollywood (Hindi) movies. Talking about regular Bollywood (Hindi) movies, this movie is exceptional in its own form as it has Katrina Kaif (Hottest Bollywood Actress) but don't have an Item Number Song !Hows That :) and also there is no antagonist in this movie that is quite unusual for a Bollywood (Hindi) movies. Its kind of movie that you would start planning a Road trip after seeing this..its just superb !",

            "content": "I understand that is a popular movie and due to this people follow the trend of liking jt but honestly the acting was really bad. The dialogue felt force and none of the three main stories closed any of their circle. In order to make it more inclusive to the Spanish speaking audience and get more revenue it felt forcefully included. I would have love that the movie felt a bit more real at least when they are running away from the bulls. The movie spend a lot of time out of the two hours+ with nothing interesting happening. In a positive side, how they embrace Spanish culture was beautifully done.",
