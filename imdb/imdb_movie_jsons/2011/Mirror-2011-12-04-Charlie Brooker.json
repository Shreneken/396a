There are a few episodes that are not so good when compared to the others but most of them are fantastic! Each episode stands alone, this show gets compared to The Twilight Zone a lot and while it's a pretty good comparison, I think Black Mirror is actually a lot better.

Most of them are about how technology is changing, has changed us, and not always for the better. It's almost like a satire of how media obsessed we have gotten. Each episode really makes you think afterwards and will make you want to talk about what happened. Every episode is like a mini movie, there're stand alone episodes and every episode has an incredible cast filled with A-list actors. While everyone will have their own favorite episodes, every single one of them will make you think and there's not a \"bad\" episode in the entire series.",

            "content": "Amazing British anthology series with a very intriguing concept. The premise: taking contemporary phenomena (ranging from the wild popularity of talent shows on TV to the impact of social media and smartphones on our lives) as a starting point and speculate how such phenomena could/would evolve in the future. Each episode tells a different story with different protagonists and focuses on a different theme. Of course, the series doesn't explore the beneficial aspects or any positive trends - (where would the fun be in that?) - but clearly approaches its topics from a pessimistic, cynical point of view (hence the title). As the show's creator Charlie Brooker ('Dead Set') puts it: \"...They (the different stories) are all about the way we live now \u2013 and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.\"The resulting mix of bleak sci-fi, drama, satire and black comedy makes for highly intelligent Television and ranks among the most original and entertaining shows I've ever come across. The writing and directing are excellent and the cast includes such talented thesps as Domhnall Gleeson, Rory Kinnear, Toby Kebbell, Hayley Atwell, Jon Hamm, Jason Flemyng and Rupert Everett - to name but a few. Unique, fascinating and highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

            "content": "Black Mirror is a British science fiction anthology television series created by Charlie Brooker. Each episode of the series presents a standalone story that explores the darker aspects of modern society, particularly the unanticipated consequences of the use of technology in our daily lives. The show explores various themes such as the impact of technology on society, privacy, surveillance, and human nature.The series is known for its dark and disturbing tone, and its ability to take a thought-provoking look at the ways in which technology is shaping our world. The show's episodes are diverse in terms of genre, tone, and style, with some episodes being more comedic and others being more dramatic and suspenseful.The acting in the series is also noteworthy, with a talented ensemble cast that delivers strong performances in each episode. The writing is also exceptional, with well-crafted and thought-provoking storylines that keep the audience engaged and thinking long after the episode has ended.One of the criticisms that could be made about the series is that some episodes are stronger than others, and some may not resonate with all audiences. Additionally, the series can be quite dark and disturbing, which may not be suitable for all viewers.Overall, I would recommend Black Mirror for fans of science fiction, anthology series, and those looking for a thought-provoking and thought-provoking series that explores the darker aspects of modern society and the impact of technology on our lives. The show's diverse episodes, talented ensemble cast, and well-crafted storylines make it a must-watch series. It's a unique and captivating series that keeps the audience thinking long after the episode has ended.",

It was one of the truly rare shows willing to take an unflinching look at humanity and how screwed up it is, and how much worse it's getting. In my experience, those who don't like the show seem to prefer living with their head in the sand while humming loudly to drown out the noise. Ignorance doesn't change the world, seeing it for what it is and then choosing to be better is what can do it.",

Anyway so far I have really loved the idea of a series that shows the different ways that us humans are being lost to our computer and phone screens 24/7 and the effects that can have on their entire life. The 2nd episode was just so good! This man was able to drive the guy way off course and even out of the city because he was so wrapped up with his phone. It's scary to see home many things like that could actually happen right now. I have definitely enjoyed pretty much every episode I have seen except for the (i think it's the 3rd one) I admit it started out interesting enough with this boss who puts his unruly employees in his simulation games but the fact that they knew who they were was a little stupid.Oh and the one with Miley Cyrus is so good! I love that little robot!!",

            "content": "Black Mirror is an anthology, meaning it is complied of different sci fi tales to make their seasons. This means the series doesn't really have any synopsis I can say, the only thing I can say is just watch the bloody show already. Every episode is different, some horror, some romance, some drama, and if you don't like the episode then just skip it, it's not like you'll miss anything as the next episode on your binge watch will be the complete opposite of what you just watched. As far as acting goes, it's top notch, stars like Jon Hamm, Daniel Kaluuya also appear on episodes bringing their amazing performances to the table. Every episode has their own cinematography, some bright and colorful, one episode will be black and white, really adding in on the unique feel of the whole thing. I would definitely call this show a masterpiece, but i almost gave it a 9 because of the 5th series. 2 episodes from the fifth series were pretty sh*te. Smithereens was great, so was Andrew Scott's performance. So yes, a masterpiece still, I won't let 2 bad episodes change that especially when compared to the works of art that the previous series had to offer. So ignore season 5 apart from Smithereens, Smithereens had a very important message and was a wonderfully shot and acted tale. Think of it as a mix of mini films. Now there may be some things that you may not find good, but there's always an episode for you. There 's twists, laughs, scares all in hour long episodes and tied up in a neat little bow just for you. And the Christmas Special was stunning, don't forget to watch that. But if that isn't enough, they have their own interactive film, Bandersnatch. An. Interactive. Film. You choose what the main character does, and it is awesome. So please, If you have the time, try watching this, you will not be disappointed.\nVerdict: With something new every episode, Black mirror really gets to you, and in all the right ways. A+",

What I wouldn't give to sit down and talk with Charlie Brooker, to find out where his ideas come from, and what plans he has for the future of the show. The more bleak they are, the more I tend to enjoy them, and the more an episode has that feeling of 'well that could really happen,' the more I love them still. I will admit I feared when the Channel Four arrangement ended, The Americanisation of the show did worry me a lot, but how wrong was I. The show has definitely changed, and improved for my money, episodes like Playtest and Metalhead are downright scary, while episodes like Hang the DJ and San Junipero tug at the heart strings. How on Earth do you pick a favourite episode, so many outstanding contenders, a few of the best include White Christmas and San Junipero, but the variety is so rich everybody will have a different favourite. I can't wait to see more in the future, Please Charlie :-)",

Maybe this is why they failed.I do not think the producers Black Mirror primarily thought about how to entertain the audience. The inspiration for the episodes comes from problems we phase currently or fear in the future to deal with. We admire Black Mirror because it mirrors our reality (at least the dark parts). Made up content has flaws. Nothing fits. To many contradictions. But a series based on reality - it wont face these plot holes. And this is what makes many of these episodes so great. They are potential realities.Anyways. I think Black Mirror might change the way you think. And if this is the first time you check that kind of genre out - this change might be major.",

The black mirror is the screen that rules our lives.Each self-contained episode is brilliantly crafted and produced. The stories are compelling and the acting is phenomenal. This show is not for those looking exclusively for entertainment, as the episodes leave you with a distinctly empty feeling. Although this is obviously the intent, one cannot help but wonder at the creators' bleak outlook on the world. The presence of bestiality in the first episode could very well deter some viewers, but I would remind them that the show is Twilight Zone-esque in structure as well as theme. The episodes may be watched in any order, as they are all completely independent of one another. The second episode in particular is storytelling of the highest form.Black Mirror is disturbing in the best possible way. It unflinchingly explores the issues of society through deeply intimate stories and characters and their interactions with technology. Let me be clear, it will not leave you feeling fulfilled. Watching it was an exhausting experience that shook me deeply. The thought provoking subject matter combine with powerful, desolate stories and excellent performances to create one of the most unique and brilliant shows that I have seen.

Each episode tells a different story with a set of new characters (as an anthology does), but one main character stays the same - technology. Black mirror isn't annoying with anti-technology messages, it doesn't have the \"oh, technology bad, book good\" mindset, it focuses on many aspects and possibilities that technology may bring in the future, it doesn't judge, instead lets the viewers do the judgement and come to their own conclusions which was a breath of fresh air to be honest. The first and second seasons were a nice introduction to what the creators had in mind and to the message of Black Mirror. Third and fourth seasons can only be described as masterpieces. All four come with thought-provoking plots and unexpected twists. Boredom is nonexistent. Next comes the fifth season aka Black Mirror's downfall. This season brought us three episodes, they weren't necessarily bad they were very much okay but it felt like you were watching a different series entirely. The creators must have lost their initial focus. The episodes weren't filled with gore, technological advancements, ethical dilemmas, they weren't mind boggling as they once were. You didn't stare in terror or fascination. Fifth season lacked the originality and philosophy aspects that made Black Mirror remarkable. The plots were lazy, nothing crazy, each episode had a celebrity starring cause let's show our audience how much we don't care anymore, we want the money. They brought Anthony Mackie (E1), Andrew Scott (E2) and Miley Cyrus (E3) - and this is not meant to criticise the celebrities, they all did a great job -. This was a huge disappointment for me, i adored this series, i told all my friends to watch it and we discussed what we would do in those bizarre situations, my emotional friends weren't able to finish some episodes because they found them that frightening. It was amazing. And to think this series would throw all it's original initiatives for more views broke my little cinema-obsessed heart.Ending this prolonged review. 9 stars. Wish I could give it a 10 but I can't forgive the creators for the 5th season. They became what they once called out. Not only a shame, a tragedy.",

Incidents which should elicit mercy and understanding are treated with a level of sadistic and creative punishment completely disconnected from coherent judgement or critical thinking, with an atonal shift from the rest of the episode. The idea of revenge in one episode seems not focused on punishing the actual perpetrator, but on the perpetrator's body, essentially wiping a criminal's memory, creating an entirely new person, then punishing that new person for the crimes of someone they no longer are.The obvious intent of many of the episodes appears to be to make people think about the topics, such as the idea of rating people in real life, or of creating AI copies of people to torture and interrogate so as not to hurt the actual person, or the inherent absurdity of politics. Sometimes it works, but more often it leaves me asking \"What was the point of all that?\"",

            "content": "(Updated after Season 5).A series of independent stories, all centred around technology. Is it a help or a hindrance?Brilliant series, created and written by English comedian and social commentator Charlie Brooker. Highly original in its concept - examining possible technological advances, and seeing how these could be used, or abused, and how they can help us, or be the bane of our existence. Set at an everyday person level (mostly), so is highly engaging.Plots are very intriguing and entertaining, drawing you in and keeping you locked in until the end. Often part of the intrigue is figuring out the innovation depicted in the episode and how it works.In many of the earlier episodes, Brooker was happy to just make the revelation of the innovation the punchline, and then just let the episode run its course from there. These were not bad episodes - the are no bad episodes (the worst score I gave to an individual episode was 7/10) - but did leave me a bit disappointed. I kept thinking this series was going to be like Alfred Hitchcock in the 21st (or 22nd century) and the lack of a great twist towards the end or powerful conclusion made me wonder what all the fuss was about.However, with time Brooker's writing got better - grittier, more daring, more profound. He found his formula and pushed the envelope in terms of his creativity. While S2 E2 - White Bear - was the first episode I gave a 10/10 to, it was really only from Season 3 (starting with the brilliant Christmas special between S2 and S3 - White Christmas) where the series consistently delivered a punchiness to its endings. S3 E1 - Nosedive - was one of the scariest and depressing imaginings of future social interaction I've ever seen...and it was 100% plausible.Things then went from strength to strength. The pinnacle, for me, was S3 E6 - Hated In The Nation. A murder mystery combined with highly plausible technology, engaging, well-developed characters (well portrayed too) and a big swipe at social media and the types of people who inhabit it. You're forced to think about your own moral view on issues, while not being lectured as to what is the \"correct\" choice. Brilliant episode.Many aspects of the series give a damning, and quite relevant, view on society, and possibly where it is heading. It's not all doom and gloom though - there are some episodes that are quite upbeat, even romantic (San Junipero, Hang the DJ) and in S4 E1 - USS Callister - Brooker makes use of his considerable comedic talent to deliver an episode that is wonderfully funny yet grippingly thrilling and action-filled.Season 5 is a bit of a disappointment though. The plots are much more mainstream and less cerebral. There's flashes of the old Black Mirror but Brooker never really rams the point home or provides something profound. Very entertaining and still highly plausible but not of the same quality as the previous seasons.",

Then came Bandersnatch which was good but more of a gimmick than anything else.Then came season 5. My God, how the mighty have fallen. I got a sense that these episodes were knocked out quickly as the dialogue was awful, the themes had all been touched on before and there were only three episodes. Out of the three only Smithereens was any good but, in comparison to earlier episodes, it was only a shadow of what came before.Black Mirror used to have bite but Series 5 just sucks, which is all you can do when you've lost your teeth.",

            "content": "Black Mirror, Season 5, 3 hour-long episodes.Ep1, Striking Vipers (60 mins): Charlie Brooker's premise is that there's no sex like VR sex. Danny and Karl, a pair of straight black guys, experience sexual-confusion when they play a VR fight-game \"Striking Vipers X\", one whose avatar is a hot blond chick and the other a hot asian dude. After their first awkward VR kiss, there's very little fighting and a whole lot of R-rated soft porn - yes, you have to suspend a WHOLE LOT of your critical thinking to let this play out. Danny is married and boinking wife Theo for a kid but his torrid albeit confusing affair with Karl's avatar in \"Striking Vipers X\" is adversely affecting those efforts. She suspects something but he's committed to the lie till he can't, then just forget the ending because that is NOT how things would play out, but Black Mirror is more about stretching the possible than adhering to the likely. Episode is about twice as long than it needs to be. Rating: 7 of 10Ep 2, Smithereens (70 mins): Charlie Brooker's cautionary tale of social media's responsibility in distracted driving. This episode delivers commentary on several elements of technology: the inherent insecurity of ride sharing, how social media founders have lost control over their creations, and how easy it can be to surmount rigid password privacy rules if you're connected. Episode is about 1/3 longer than it needs to be. Rating: 8 of 10, has a touching moment or twoEp 3, Rachel, Jack, and Ashley Too (67 mins): Miley Cyrus plays Ashley O, a famous pop singer victimized by an overlording adoptive aunt and her coterie. Rachel is a young femme fan of Ashley's and even more so when Ashley releases a tiny android version of herself called \"Ashley Too\" to help young girls build self-esteem and confidence. Once the full potential of the little droid is realized though, it unleashes the full, profanity-laden personality of Ashley O. There's another tech element to this but it's not worth describing since the whole episode is marred by three things: first, its target demo is tween girls and guess who doesn't watch \"Black Mirror\" at all? Yeh, tween girls. Second, Miley Cyrus as pop star plays more to her fantasy than ours, and her voicing the \"Ashley Too\" bot is so raw and without any voice-over talent, it just sounds like her talking/swearing in normal voice. And third, throughout the episode she sings a butchered pop version of \"Head Like a Hole\" (Nine Inch Nails, 1989) and it just grates your soul. Masculine Guy Rating: 3 of 10, Tween Girl Rating: 8 of 10Overall rating for the season: 6 of 10, meh, blah",

            "content": "Watching movie has always been my passion ever since I was a child. Among hundreds of movies that I have watched, the series Black Mirror impressed me the most.The series consist of multiple episodes illustrating the dark side of technological development. For me, although these movies are not too long, they have very profound meanings. In detail each episode shows us how dangerous technology could be either when they fall into the wrong hands or when we are too dependent on it and let it takes over our life. For example, there is an episode in which a boy was forced to do nasty and horrible things so that his secrets, which were stolen from the Internet, won't be exposed.To be honest, watching Black Mirror knocked me sideways since I have never imagined such scenarios could be possible. Despite knowing that they are only imaginary situation, there is nothing to ensure that they won't be happening in the future in real life. In addition, very few special effects were used, which was according to me, very surprising since they still managed to fully deliver their messages. Another factor contributed to Black Mirror's success is the performance of the actors. Most of the actors are not well-known but they did a great job demonstrating the feelings as well as the personality of different characters. Therefore, viewers could easily understand the gist of each episode.However, I feel that it is not suitable for certain people since it contains sexulal, nudity and violence content. On top of that, the series may be irritating for sensitive people to watch since in some episodes, the result or the message is quite scary to think about. Another drawback for Black Mirror is that it is not packed with action scenes which sometime might be a bit dull for me.In short words, Black Mirror gives us a big picture of our tomorrow world experiencing a rapid growth in the field of technology about how dreadful it could be. Although there are several minor cons, I find this series very though-provoking, all thanks to the amazing and creative minds of the director and screenwriter. There is no doubt that everyone should include Black Mirror in their must-watch list. With such meaningful content, I expect this series to gain even greater success in th future.",

Charlie Brooker has popped out of the internet at times when I least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program Screenwipe and others. That was my first exposure to Doug Stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. Black Mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the Twilight zone. It is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead. I have always been interested in futurists and Brooker seems to fill the requirements for one. There is nothing in the first two installments that do not reflect current trends in our collective behavior but instead extrapolates where current trends in communications technology; avatars, social media and reality television might lead us if we do not seek to preserve what is beautiful and pure about our collective consciousness and humanity. Having seen reviews here that feel there is no commentary embedded within these stories I couldn't disagree more. As the title suggests, Brooker's Black Mirror shows us a dark reflection of our selves and allows us to evaluate these scenarios through our own emotional filters. There are no blatant soap box messages but I interpreted the narratives as cautionary tales and would hope that no one, when confronted with them, would hope for these near futures. The only thing holding them back from becoming reality is our own resistance to complacency and purely spectator culture. Beyond these philosophical aspects, the program is incredibly well produced and executed in my opinion. The characters and sets create convincing realities and I was never once drawn out of the story due to poor acting, scripting or characterizations. I could not recommend this series more and hope that it will continue on. Congratulations to Brooker and company for their work and their apparent concern for all of us.",

Every individual has a rating attached to him/herself that can be seen upon viewing the person's face. Using a five star rating scale, those with a higher rating have greater privileges whereas those with lower ratings are the scourge of the Earth.

This show came up as one of one of four 'Mind Boggling Shows Like The X-Files'. I never really got into X-Files, but quite liked the bits I saw. IMDb's score (for BM) was 8.9, so I thought it was well worth checking out.. Big mistake. similarshows certainly got the 'mind boggling' aspect right, but they missed the word 'awful'. If only I'd checked the reviews here first, as some share my view and would've warned me. Not only was the main theme of the first episode repulsive, it was completely ridiculous. I guess I'm one of those who 'missed the messages... ' '...the relationship between technology and psychology'.. Well the tech. fell down for me when they didn't realise a dismembered finger was actually a man's; and as for the psychology: man kidnaps girl, man makes fantastically ridiculous demands, PM says no, one of his staff makes incredibly stupid mistake, his subordinates say he must comply, his wife cries, he decides he will (or more accurately, he's bullied into it), evidence is available to show the man is unlikely to kill the girl but they ignore it, everyone, including the kids, watches 'the act' on national TV, at tea time. 'It' apparently goes on for over an hour, then afterwards they find out that the guy released the girl before the act had begun, then topped himself. Maybe I am missing something, but I really can't see much depth to it at all. I found the psychology of 'The Fall' deep, immersive and disturbing. Not this.I'm not a big fan of watching more of something that's rubbish (imo) just to see if it gets better.. If that's what floats the creators' boats (and a multitude of viewers who thought it was 'outstanding' (as did the Emmy's it seems), 'brilliant' and 'the best show ever', I'll jump ship.",

Worth seeing it all with detailed attention cause it's probably one of the most intelligent and critical TV series done recently!!

Indeed, he (and his collaborators) show themselves to be skilled film-makers: in this trio of short stories about how technology is changing our lives, two have a sci-fi feels and the understated way with which a future world, subtly different to our own, is conveyed, with a minimum of carefully deployed special effects, is a lesson to Hollywood with its obsession with spectacle and its inability to understand that less can be more. Yet while Brooker's films are delicately made, there's a certain obviousness to the points he is making; while he's extraordinarily skillful in imagining the details, there's less below the surface than you might hope for. I found the middle film the most convincing (and indeed moving), and exactly because it was most explicitly a fable; in the others, Brooker's merciless eye is also not a little heartless. But Brooker deserves credit for not standing still, and settling for making new series of 'Screenburn' ad infinitum; 'Black Mirror' may only be a partial success, but it's bold and fresh and worth watching, even if it's not so much deeper than the world it's taking apart.",

You will have to watch it with an open mind as it is somewhat distasteful and well... extremely far-fetched (Which is pretty absurd for a satire, but I digress.) I did thoroughly enjoy it however, it hit all the right notes.After watching the second episode, I was left in shock about the jarring contrast from the first episode. It's so different than the prior, it's set in an alternate reality and is just.. unusual. Still dark, still intriguing, but didn't quite capture my imagination the way the first one did.The third and final instalment was probably my favourite of the 3. It was again, completely unrelated from the previous 2, but it had a really interesting concept and narrative, and was executed phenomenally.

I don't think Black Mirror will appeal to everyone because some themes are a slightly uncomfortable especially in the pilot episode. So far the actors that have been cast have done an amazing job, and the writers have managed to make some far fetched ideas seem graspable. Basically this series is unlike anything else on TV and for that it gets a big thumbs up from me.

I just don't get it. Is it to warn about bad technology ideas? If so, I don't really see why that is interesting either.

I feel that Smithereens executed this well. On the other two episodes, they brought the show down to the lowest common denominator instead of elevating the thinking of the viewers like previous seasons did.The first four seasons tied in the episodes in many subtle ways so it was almost as if it was all in the same universe. This season seemed to have dropped all of that and that is the most disappointing aspect for me.My individual ratingsStriking vipers 6/10-Not a bad concept but a very basic plot. It did touch into the perils of advanced video game technology in a decent way. Could have been about 20 minutes shorter and had better twists. Not the worst episode, but probably in bottom third overall to meSmithereens 9/10-I expected the least out of this based on \"expert\" ratings, but it was by far the best. Some complain that it was too much like a crime show, but black mirror has dipped into different genres before. Kept me engaged from beginning to end and stayed true to the franchise in my opinion and an ending that left you hanging in a good wayAshley Too 4/10- I like the premise of the manipulation of the singer behind the scenes and thought this episode could go somewhere but the ending ruined it leaving no twist and more of an ending that you would see on a teen drama movie. Some say that this paralleled the life of Miley Cyrus and I can respect that premise, but am not sure if Black mirror was the place for it.Overall, not unwatchable but by far my least favorite season and a mild letdown.

The plots for each episode are clever, unique, thought provoking, insightful, duplicitous, cathartic and have stunning endings. It's a refreshing look at how technology can turn on society when in today's world people feel like they're missing out on or aren't part of something bigger if they're not participating in some form of social media. The series also scrutinizes technology turning on itself, humans using technology to turn on eachother and humans using technology to turn on themselves.

Add that they're all exceptionally well- made pieces of art.Recommended for appreciators of proper sci-fi, cerebral thought experiments, philosophy and those who wonder what modern social tech might be doing to our human nature. Also if you enjoy anthologies ala Outer Limits & Twilight Zone.Not recommended if you're in the mood for binging on 'just-one-more' series arcs or you fancy light entertainment. Black Mirror is heavy-going and encourages concentrated viewing and musing afterthoughts, personally I couldn't binge on it.I needed almost a month to watch all 19 eps, so about one a day which is as bingey as it should be. Watch it in order as you get a little appreciation of how the BM-universe expands.One fine thing to point out is that Black Mirror's cast is genuinely diverse without making a crazed identity-politics agenda out of it...people are people, and that's how it should be.\nMy ep rankings:10/10: Hated in the Nation / USS Callister9/10: Fifteen Million Credits / White Christmas / The Entire History Of You8/10: Nosedive / Men Against Fire / The National Anthem / Playtest / Metalhead / Black Museum7/10: San Junipero / Be Right Back / The Waldo Moment6/10: Shut Up And Dance / White Bear5/10: Hang The DJ / Arkangel2/10: CrocodileEveryone uses the out-of-ten system differently. In my book a maximum 10/10 is very rare, and 9's relatively rare (about as rare as my 1/10's & 2/10's)...so props to BM for having five such exceptionally strong episodes, plus plenty of strong 8's. Anything from a 6/10 is worth a watch, 5/10 is borderline ok so that leaves just the one genuinely poor story. Oddly enough those three weakest eps all came in a row, tho' of course your experience will differ.Weighting the balance positively Black Mirror deserves an overall 9/10 putting it right up there in my top 5 favourite series ever, above Game of Thrones & Breaking Bad. Alongside Twin Peaks & classic Twilight Zone. Below only the modern Battlestar Galactica.So if you haven't seen any yet and my spoiler-free review speaks to you, I can only add don't judge the series on its very first episode (it strongly divides opinion), the next two however should blow you away!",

Horrified that someone would conceive and execute such a vile, disgusting piece of television such as this. Instead of fantasy, charm, literacy, and magic, we get an absolutely disgusting piece of rubbish. Rod Serling is turning over in his grave after this garbage was likened to TZ by Netflix. Everyone involved in this should be embarrassed, but I doubt that's possible anymore in the world we live in. But I guess that was the point wasn't it?

            "content": "Black Mirror has been by far, my favorite series in decades comparable only to The Twilight Zone and of course, The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. Black Mirror managed to surpass BOTH for me which is no small feat, combining both sci-fi and mystery with an ongoing theme of strange curiosity that evokes both imagination and emotion. I found myself quite literally on the edge of my seat with each and every episode, ruminating over each episode that graced my screen after watching and anxiously anticipating the next episode - and series - with disappointment and feeling a great void when they were over. This was true with each and every episode from series 1 through series 4. I am still ranking this series as a whole an 8 out of 10 which would have been a strong 10 without reservation had it not been for series 5. Now, we reach series 5 and I'm more confused than disappointed. I'll explain...\nWhile there have been only 3 episodes thus far in the 5th season, they all seem to have an ongoing theme of absurdity. Well, almost uselessness. The 1st episode is interesting but way too far-fetched and predictable than remotely possible which is the key element in what creates good mystery and sci-fi in the first place. This episode, it's just silliness. And, if you happen to have strong core values you may want to view this before showing it to your children. Even my husband who is a die-hard sci-fi addict found it not only absurd but revolting, just FYI, and we are absolutely open-minded and accepting of alternative lifestyles and views. The second episode is a regurgitated lesson from back in 2010 and is equally predictable. The 3rd episode is definitely sci-fi approved however there was way under zero mystery and was more predictable than the first 2 episodes. I will say though, that the addition of the altered 90's lyrics from 25 years ago was a nice touch. It's as though they shoved Charlie Brooker (who I admire greatly) into a closet and said \"You have 3 days, come up with 3 episode stories.\" They're terrible. And, to a certain degree they have all been done before. I won't mention how or where as this would create spoilers. The directing was awful. So, what happened?",

            "content": "I was very disappointed by Black Mirror Series 1 & 2, save for S1E3 - the only instalment NOT written by Charlie Brooker (instead penned by Jesse Armstrong of 'Peep Show' fame), 'The Entire History of You', which on its own is an excellent drama.I went away from this series with one conclusion; Charlie Brooker cannot write drama well. His talents lie with casting an eye over the irritating aspects of media, succinctly cutting down the pretentiousness and rubbish churned out for our consumption with some accurate criticism and adolescent musings (see: Screenwipe, Newswipe etc.). That's what he's good at! Being funny and critical at the same time.What he clearly isn't good at, and this is made all the more apparent by the 2nd series of Black Mirror, is fleshing out basic ideas for a drama into anything more than a GCSE Film Studies project with a budget. The characters aren't real, they're two-dimensional clich\u00e9s. The constant references to social media and modern technology don't feel incidental, but desperate, like Charlie poking his head up from behind a prop screaming \"Look how relevant this all is!\" Twitter this, twitter that. The stories all feel like conversations down the pub after a few pints, \"What if the prime minister had to shag a pig on live TV!\" \"Why would he do that?\" \"I dunno... terrorists?\" Even with the suspension of disbelief, none of his writing delivers the impact or level of social commentary one would hope for.'The Entire History of You' did what the other instalments didn't; characters that felt real, a relationship that felt real, underpinned but not obscured by plausible science-fiction. The 'what if' is answered with the expected pessimism present in all of the Black Mirror episodes, but it's still entertaining to watch the story unfold. I wish Jesse Armstrong had written all of Black Mirror, perhaps I would have had my expectations exceeded rather than trodden on.",

            "review_title": "It's...OK",
            "content": "So I've seen a lot of the episodes. The strength of the series is definitely the ability to take aspects of modern life and spin them to their logical extremes to make a point. So, for example, you take a world that shares and rates every aspect of our lives on social networks and imagine a world where those networks aren't just harmless wastes of time but can actually impact your ability to get a job or find a place to live. Or you look at our modern democratic system that constantly monitors public opinion to make policy and imagine a situation where a politician must do truly disgusting things to appease the masses, even at the expense of their dignity and family.There's nothing wrong with these ideas; science fiction has a long and storied history of critiquing society to point out potential issues and moral hazards. The problem I do have is the way the stories wind down and the conclusions they draw. Almost without exception the conclusions are bleak. Characters never make the right choices or even if they do they are inevitably crushed by the systems they rebel against.If you think of these stories as little horror movies, it's the point at the end of the film where the survivors either get to walk away having experienced something horrible but having survived and learned a little bit about themselves along the way, or they all get slaughtered and the last scene is the final survivor being pulled back down into the darkness by the monster and the camera panning twenty feet over to the safety they almost reached.Both types of endings have their place. But when you choose to use only one of them the negativity starts to get a bit stifling. There has to be hope sometimes or it just feels depressing and pessimistic. I suppose this may just be a personal thing, others may not mind the continuously bleak outlook, but for me it gets really hard to watch more than one or two of these in a month.The acting is usually pretty decent, as are the production values. The writing is also usually quite decent, although they often stretch logic to the breaking point to get the ending they envision. I guess this would be a mini spoiler warning, but there is one episode where a sophisticated device malfunctions to lethal effect because of interference from a common, everyday piece of personal electronics, the equivalent of a commercial airliner hurtling into the ground because you didn't turn your cell phone off. To call that absurd doesn't really even begin to cover it; it could never happen.So in the end, my feelings about the show are rather mixed. To some degree I really like the creativity of the concepts and the decent execution, but on the other hand I find myself feeling rather depressed by the constant negativity and a little irritated that I can usually guess how the story will end half way thru because it is always the most bleak ending that they run with.",

            "content": "Black Mirror was once known for projecting a grim future, 10 minutes away from where we are. We didn't watch it to be amused nor excited, we watched it with the intent of being bummed out. We expected to welcome the credits with an awesome feeling of self loathe. This was the point. Black Mirror is the reflection of yourself in your phone screen when the screen is turned off. A dark reflection of who you are. The intention is to show a dark depiction of ourselves through technology. Exactly what a Black Mirror is.Throughout its time on Channel4 it was allowed to explore this, thus generating a huge following of people like myself who demand depth, intrigue and not your typical fairytale stories made to meet a wide audience to generate \u00a3\u00a3. It was so ridiculously thought provoking I would go as far as to say it was one of the greatest TV programmes to come out of the UK! Which leads me to the problem.. it came out of the UK.I was slightly nervous when I discovered it was moving to Netflix. Anxious as I knew the Americans were going to have a huge hand in the subject matter and storylines, yet marginally comfortable in knowing Netflix (like Channel4) has a reputation for taking risks on out of the box stories. The reason I was anxious about the Americans is not some deep shred of racism. It is simply that there is a huge difference between how British and American audiences receive TV programmes. This is common fact when it comes to comedy, but it is also apparent in emotion inducing drama too. If you study popular American TV versus popular UK TV you can easily see that British audiences are more comfortable with 'out of the ordinary', uncomfortable and especially dark subject matter. We don't mind hating ourselves, in fact we quite like it and are pretty good at it!Series 3 turned out to be pretty damn good actually. San Junipero in particular is my favourite episode of the whole programme! The programme was allowed to retain that awful feeling of dread, the familiarity, the dark techno-aware subjects that depicted who we could be, who we would be and who we are now! There did seem to be a little more of a Hollywood type of feel to the whole thing, yet that didn't matter too much as long as the stories could run their course!However. Since then there has been a huge decline in what we come to expect of the show we know and love. USS Callister was, for me a small shining light (or rather a welcome opposite to that entirely), but still didn't give me that sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach. The episodes began to get milder and milder, taming down to suit a wider audience who would be at greater risk of running away If you were to show them an early episode. Yes there was tragedy, yes some of the storylines were dark. But its where the darkness comes from that matters! We didn't want obviously fictional narratives, we wanted ones that seemed real! That could be here and now and not too far away. We didn't want the big dramatic moments, the killer shots or the epic finale, we want mellow darkness and discomfort.Finally we reach series 5. A series that has completely and utterly disappointed me on all levels. Well, not all. They are entertaining, but definitely not in Black Mirror fashion. Where are the twists, the thought provoking, self hating moments. The situations which present to you a perfectly twisted, yet astonishingly accurate version of the world we live in?If you were to grab someone who was disinterested in Black Mirror's subject matter, and ignorant of its relevance and show them just a couple of episodes from the first series, but let them just mildly watch it without truly getting it.. then ask them to describe it to you: what you would have is Series 5.... A few entertaining yet dark stories with a bit of technology thrown in. Yes we know that the app they use in episode two is metaphorical of our current social media platforms and how we are all addicted. You are not incredibly smart for figuring that out because it's so blindingly obvious and in your face. Black Mirror has been showing us that same metaphor in so many episodes, but it's been so good because it has been a genuinely clever metaphor and has been presented perfectly!I genuinely feel as though the smartness of the programme has been lost. That it has now become a parody of itself and is simply a few slightly tragic (but not too tragic) stories with some technology in them. It doesn't take a great deal of intellect or understanding to grasp the concepts. Themes are also being rehashed into more diluted versions that are easier to palette for everyone! This might sound extremely harsh and make me sound like an awful person, but I see from my social media, so many more people talking about how amazing it now is. These people are the type that find films such as White Chicks funny and who's favourite film is Titanic. They talk about how clever the programme is after watching the latest series and that it's got so much more better as they didn't understand the first few series. I find myself internally screaming at them \"NO YOU DON'T DESERVE TO APPRECIATE THIS PROGRAMME\" the message is lost on so many!I still have faith, which is why I've given a 9. The first 3 series get 10 from me, the 5th gets a 2.",

A common theme however throughout the serie is the inevitable demise of the main protagonist. Whether being killed, psychologically tortured or in some rare cases coming out on top there is always an element of tragedy and despair in each episode mixed with some dark humor.The first two episodes I watched where \"Shut up and dance\" and \"The national anthem\", both takes place in current times with the same technology we have access to today. I found these first episodes to be accelerating, alarming and somewhat disturbing. But what is truly frightful is the fact that these horror scenarios can happen to anyone anywhere(if precatutions are not taken) which I think is the genius of this show.With our technology moving forward at an increasing speed I do think that safty issuses and moral questions concering the use off new devices(and whether they shall exist or not)may become an issuse, Black mirror shows what \"can\" happen in some extreme cases.Writer Charlie Brooker really brings something new to the table which Is something I am highly fond off. My only concern with the show are a few episodes that i found somewhat exaggerated and way to unrealistic. The episodes that do it for me are those that infact are realistic with a twisted interpretation of modern technology. Some examples are white christmas and nosedive.If you like thrillers and horrors I think this serie is worth a go. It sometimes gives me an urge to disconnect from todays accessories.",

Episode 1: The National Anthem, sees Princess Susannah (Lydia Wilson) kidnapped, and as ransom for her safe return the demands are that Prime Minister Michael Callow (Quantum of Solace's Rory Kinnear) must have sexual intercourse with a live pig and it must be broadcast on all news channels. After many attempts to solve the problem with alternatives, such as locating the kidnapper hideout, this disgusting act is forced to happen, but the Princess was released before the deadline, and even though Michael's career continues his social and home life is less good. Episode 2: Fifteen Million Merits, sees a bleak automated Britain where people are forced to live inside a place where to earn credits for food, and enjoy visual entertainment, e.g. pornography from Wraith Girls, they must constantly ride on exercise bikes, and they lose merits for buying food and skipping entertainment. Bingham 'Bing' Madsen (Psychoville's Daniel Kaluuya) decides to help out new friend Abi (Jessica Brown Findlay) get her chance to become a singing star on X Factor style talent show Hot Shot, with judges Judge Hope (Rupert Everett) and Judge Charity (Julia Davis) and Judge Wraith (Ashley 'Bashy' Thomas). This costs him 15,000,000 merits of his, but he is not bothered as he does not do luxuries, but in the end she ends up on Wraith Girls, and he only \"gets out\" by speaking his mind about the system, but he remains in near solitary. Episode 3: The Entire History of You, technology has allowed people to store all their memories, such as conversations and experiences, in their heads with the help of super chip placed near behind their ears, and they can look back and experience any of these again. Young lawyer Liam Foxwell (Toby Kebbell) starts suspecting his wife Ffion (Jodie Whittaker) is having an affair with a man called Jonas (Tom Cullen), and he is looking back on any memories he has that would suggest this, and obviously he forces her to show her memories and confirm the suspicions. The series is a great satirical play on the significance technology has played in the world, the first episode focusing on the Twitter age and news coverage, the second on the impact of applications and talent shows, and the third about image capturing, and obviously the title Black Mirror refers to ourselves being part of all this, it is a must see drama mini series.

Each episode from season 1-4 is easily watchable and at least very good, while many episodes are brilliant. Sometimes the twist isn't at the end...but at the beginning or the middle...it always keeps you on your toes and delivers. You find yourself saying, \"I could see that happening within the next 5-10 years.\" And some of the plot lines are starting to drift into reality today. Black Mirror seasons 1-4 are a must watch.Then there is the fifth season. Do not bother. Each show is terrible. The stories get ridiculous, are pointless, or have characters you just do not care about. Like too much in Hollywood these days diversity was put ahead of story the episode called Striking Vipers. It has an LGBT storyline...that isn't really LGBT...and doesn't seem to know what to do with itself other than check off a box for an LGBT theme. They weren't willing to go where it needed to go or just thought virtual reality sex would be enough to make it interesting...it does not. Check out the earlier episode, San Junipero for a brilliant LGBT storyline that works on all levels. Episode 2 in season 5 is completely forgettable. And episode 3 with Miley Cyrus attempts to make you feel sorry for vacuous pop stars but instead makes you hate them all the more. Season 5 seemed mailed in without much effort.Season 6 needs to be a great improvement or the show could lose viewers. Watch seasons 1-4...skip season 5 altogether.",

            "content": "An anthology series of sorts, where technology and humanity don't always lead to pleasant results. This satirical and usually demented show is great in its technical craftsmanship and usually sharp and witty in its execution. The first episode The National Anthem is a great start to this series, about the princess being kidnapped and the Prime Minister being told he needs to have sex with a pig or she dies. This sounds lowbrow, but it's pulled off with a straight face and in lesser hands this would have been written into a corner - but the ending simply works. 8/10The second episode Fifteen Million Merits is perhaps the best of the series, about a society that peddles stationary bikes to generate power and the individual earns points to purchase products or a chance to appear on a contestant show. The idea is thoughtfully explored, there's a quick budding romance that's wonderfully done and the episode goes into some dark places. This is a great piece of science fiction. 9/10The third episode The Entire History of You explores the trivial bits of nonsense we obsess about, when everyone has recorders implanted in the back of our heads and you have the ability to record and playback any time, anywhere. What begins with our lead going through his job interview and replaying one phrase that could be interpreted in any way, over and over - leads to an obsession about the possibility of his wife having an affair. The segment is well acted and the use of the technology feels entirely believable. 7/10The second season didn't engage me - sometimes at all. The first episode Be Right Back, felt too cold and distant and felt empty and pointless by the end. 5/10The second episode White Bear hinged on a twist gimmick that was both a strength and a weakness. The twist works as an idea, but sours everything before it and both the twist and the preceding events felt half baked. Didn't deliver. 4/10The third episode The Waldo Moment, about a depressed comedian voicing a crude animated character that ends up being used as a political puppet to disrupt an election is successful enough. But like all the episodes this season, the sharp wit and beautifully thought out visuals are missing. 6/10The White Christmas special plays up the anthology format for the first time, as two men in a mysterious outpost kill time on Christmas by telling their stories that led them to this point in their life at this outpost. The three stories are all engaging and the use of the technology feels remarkably real and the results are haunting and twisted in its humor and drama. A great return to form. 7/10",

Since is treating and telling story and problems about the actual or near future society and the dark side of technology you have to consider that every single episode is a reflection and meditation starting point that most of the time can let the viewer with a sad sensation or let with a bitter taste.Each self-contained episode is brilliantly crafted and produced.

Sort of a \"Idiocracy\" feel to the series, with the current state of affairs brought to some sort of futuristic territories, but no humor and very little to recommend it. I watched the first one, the one about the return of the dead thru software, the one about the special Disney punishment village and the one about the \"American Idol\"/Hunger Games kind of TV show, with the avatars and all that. None of them really any good, and a pity to see Mike Smiley and some of the characters from the Thick of It wasted in this. I spose they enjoyed the paycheck",

But it was interesting to learn that one of the least liked episodes among fans is \"Hated in the Nation\" which is about a vengeful hacker that manipulates government controlled insects to kill people with the contribution of many mindless social media users. It is constructed as a murder mystery with the typical foil duo of detectives. It places a lot of different issues that are of most important right now into the plot: government surveillance, climate change, cyberbullying and mob mentality. It's not as futuristic and flashy- the topics at hand are not of the future but more present. There is no crazy technology the episode is built on.

I will admit that I didn't watch all of it - dear god, after a few episodes, the idea of watching the whole thing seemed like torture. Yes this series is filmed with a decent quality and will look quite nice. it's \"edible\" to the eye. no critique on that part.The actors weren't the greatest, but then, none that I saw was horribly bad either. No critique to the directors either.Major critique to the script writers. the people writing this series went to a \"creative writing\" program, came out with a fancy degree, but have never creatively written in their lives. take an online creative writing course, and after a few classes you will understand exactly what I mean. It's always the same guidelines - create a character with flaws, but with a strong will to achieve a desire. make their desire clear, and obvious. Then, find obstacles. since this series is supposed to be \"disturbing\", of course the obstacles has the better of them.There would be too many examples for me to give here, but again with the script writing, there are major plot holes everywhere. Some of them are so undeniably obvious that even some of my friends who enjoy this show, admitted, despite all their will to defend it, that what I pointed out was indeed huge inexplicable plot holes. Finally I see neither what is really disturbing nor what is really interesting. That the show tries to have situations that are realistic yet futuristic compared to society as we know it, I get, but there are so many things where I just don't really grasp the major difference in comparison to our current social or political situations, that it just ends up being contemporary society with a bunch of gadgets, which end up in the same results. I mean that those gadgets don't really make an impact that changes much, compared to our current society. It's not social science fiction as it tries to be - it's social drama that they tried to make into science fiction. This show isn't more disturbing than the world as it stands now. Is it awakening people? I don't really think so, as most people will just see it as \"bleak\"-ish science fiction.I recommend reading the review on here that also says that it's essentially a high budget rip-off of the twilight zone.Bad script writing renders black mirror an uninteresting bore, and no amount of fancy visuals can make up for all the clich\u00e9s, lack of imagination, and mechanical, industrial story lines.",

            "review_title": "Pure Paranoia",
            "content": "Sorry Charlie Brooker, but this series seems as though written by an aging populace preaching resistance to change. The ideas portrayed are clear, but they only paint a one-sided perspective that's biased towards the negative, with scientific or moral dilemmas purposefully ignored or emitted to promote it, and doesn't hold up to further scrutiny. It is well executed visually, perfectly acted, shot and written, and episodes start from the right vantage point to yield maximum effect. It's with the message that I have the biggest contention; There have and always will be negative obstacles to any progress: Technology has revolutionised fraud and theft, provided new forms of bullying, sensationalism and public humiliation. But it has transformed the world enormously for the better, improving access to information, communication, commerce, increased globalisation and productivity. Such challenges breed discussion, promote awareness to decrease prevalence, and offer possible improvements to laws and regulations. As problems evolve with and because of technology, our ability to combat and prevent them evolves as well. Here are the issued I encountered for each episode (SPOLERS AHEAD): 1.1: This premise hinges on a man who recognises the actor brought in and posts his picture online, thus alerting the kidnapper to the deception. If such a critical and decisive operation were to take place, one would expect it would be handled with more professionalism and secrecy. The actor is walked to the entrance in the open, and the man takes the picture with no protest or rebuke before or after the incident (although the actor is 'rushed in' as if the phone was a gun. An outrageous scenario orchestrated for plot development? I think so. The Prime Minister's wife also appears to be exceedingly insecure about people's perceptions of her. One would think someone in her position would be better accustomed to sensationalism, scrutiny and disgruntled public opinion. You also wouldn't need to be in the public eye to know that comments on some websites should not be taken seriously.1.2: I don't believe spending your life peddling for credits while living in confined cages under an advertising regime resembles a realistic premise, but perhaps it's not meant to be - the episode's sole purpose is to make an abstract comment about the nature of media, advertising and commercialism. As the world becomes more connected, the representation of an individual as a virtual caricature becomes more common, but only because of the nature and prevalence of such interaction. Technology is not responsible for this, human nature is. We have always objectified those furthest away from our grasp, and technology brings us closer to the same extent that it leaves us behind a barrier.1.3: Is this technology wrong because of the scenario offered? Would objectifying memory cause more conflict than resolve, and signal the end of indiscretion and privacy? The answer is no, or rather no more than presently. We often recall and deliberate over our past experiences, and this technology wouldn't change that. Regarding the main story, we are presented with an impossible scenario (possibly the worst) and asked to choose between truth or privacy. If you are in a relationship where the question \"Show me where you were last night?\" consistently surfaces, trust issues or relationship flaws very likely exist. This is in contrast to what one would envision to be the typical application for this type of technology; Domestic disputes and crimes would be recorded just like everything else. They could be erased through force or intimidation, but it's very likely that such a system would have a backup capacity (much like Facebook does when you delete an account), so that deleting wouldn't stop the perpetrator from getting caught. This hypothetical scenario could in fact dramatically reduce the rate of crime committed, not increase it.2.1: Be Right Back has a similar conundrum. This is a world where an artificial body can be grown and moulded from powder in hours (and stored with an infinite battery pack), but an artificial computer isn't able to properly mimic human reactions to emotions if it doesn't have 'sufficient data'. Contrary to what is stated, people have all types of online interactions these days that go far beyond pleasantries and encompass most of the emotional spectrum. For missing data, it wouldn't be hard for a system to calculate the best response specific to any individual for any given situation or emotion. By that time we would also have cars that drive themselves, avoiding accidents altogether. In fact, the Google driver-less car already exists. A better premise could focus on how surrogates would be treated and the legal implications of their existence.2.2: If we possessed the technology to wipe away sinful memories, then this would be the most impractical use of it imaginable. Repeatedly wiping the memory of a criminal for continuous emotional torture and entertainment would be deemed highly immoral by any present or future civilisation. What would be the point of torturing someone who doesn't know what they've done wrong? The implications of memory wiping have been addressed in numerous films, notably Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. For criminals, it could offer a blank slate or a second chance at life. For others it could wipe away traumatic and debilitating experiences to improve quality of life. These are all moral and legal grey areas, but still offer more realistic scenarios than shown here.2.3: Not much to be said here. Could the team behind a satirical blue bear ever be approved to run for public office? The answer is no.Constructing incomplete, cynical and misleading scenarios that only work to spread fear is simply pointless and counter-productive. A superior show would examine both sides and predict the future more accurately. A more pressing threat (possibly worth being a little paranoid about) is artificial intelligence, but this far exceeds the scope of this series- clearly this isn't the programme to watch if you're looking to educate yourself about science and technology.",

I will say that it was refreshing for a series to have each and every episode to be independent of one another, that each was a self-contained and complete story in itself. So you could essentially sit down to watch them in any random order. I managed to get almost through the third episode of season 1 before I gave up.It turned out, that despite each episode being very well produced and also having some interesting concept behind it, that the premise of the series was just not appealing to me. Why? Well, because I am not really all that interested in technology.The acting in the three episodes that I watched was good, and it was nice enough to see story lines poke fun at things that are wrong with society today, such as how desperate for fame people are that they are willing to participate in \"talent\" shows, or the fact that most of our lives are spent online in one way or another, etc.I guess that \"Black Mirror\" would have a wide appeal, and at first glance it seems like it is something that might slip under the radar of most people. I, for example, hadn't even heard about it prior to being recommended to watch it.",

            "content": "Black Mirror is a phenomenal TV series, but it's also deeply unsettling because it explores themes of brutality and humiliation in especially social media platforms, and often has an eerie invasive feel about it. However much it unsettles, it also challenges, so Black Mirror is often as repugnant as it is thought-provoking. Some episodes do indeed go too far and become expressions of anxiety, paranoia and shame rather than having a take-away. I would give Black Mirror 9/10 for that, but on the flip side some episodes can be uniquely transcendent so it is difficult to do that.Black Mirror tackles ideas of cyber crime and the heartlessness that can happen from behind a screen. It talks about cell phone addiction and other kinds of benign-seeming uses of technology that can open the door to catastrophe when used in the wrong way. In particular Black Mirror tackles something we might call \"outrage culture,\" as in the blacklisting of people we don't like. The themes of Black Mirror often do tie into modern day happenings, such as \"canceling\" someone like on Youtube. The series does give you a lot to think about, especially about the punishment of those who occupy a moral gray area.While not always on its A game, Black Mirror has many gems, and is remarkably variable in its scope and in its tone. As others say, however, Black Mirror is hard to binge-watch because it can be unimaginably bleak, and often intentionally so. The series is rather traumatizing and difficult, but often the very bleakness can act as cautionary tales, and help you to be more empathetic and responsible when interacting with people online.I hated Black Mirror, it was miserable, but also I think the series is better than most because there is a responsibility to it, and I do believe it doesn't try to condone its own blackheartedness. I do appreciate the substance of it.I wouldn't say I love Black Mirror, because it's terrifying and sometimes disgusting, but I do appreciate it and admire much of its efforts.",

No two mirror black mirror episodes are the same, but the creators of each episode themselves link every episode together through its overarching themes of technology and it's effect on the future world.Along with Black Mirror's A-list starring cast beginning from Miley Cyrus all the way to Jon Hamm and Daniel Kaluuya from horror blockbuster 'Get Out', Black Mirror isn't shy about what it's intentions are, and it really is a refreshing take on a universal series. It rarely ever missing the mark, and never fails to keep audience members entertained while binge watching on a week night.",

It is a show that I found to be very different and unique in its own way. The episodes all have their own story lines and completely different casts. The episodes blew a little hot and cold for me but overall I found it to be quite entertaining. The 1st episode about the PM I found incredibly disturbing but it was riveting to watch. Episodes 2 and 3 seemed quite slow overall and not much actually happened but the cast done enough to make them watchable. The plots for these two episodes just sounded more interesting than I actually found them to be. Series 2 I thought was much better than Series 1. Episodes 1&2 had incredible story lines that both came with a twist towards the end. These two episodes kept me on the edge of my seat. Hayley Atwell was absolutely incredible in the Be Right Back episode, some of the finest acting I've seen. The White Bear episode was exceptional too. A lot of fast paced action and really makes you wonder what is going on. The twist at the end of this episode worked incredibly well. Episode 3, The Waldo Moment was also pretty good, this one was pretty basic. It was more of a comedy and was good in its own way.The National Anthem \u2013 8/10. Fifteen Million Merits \u2013 7/10.

I admit, I was wondering what in the hell I had gotten myself into, but I must also admit= it kept me entertained and disgusted, all at the same time. It had my interest. After it ended, I thought about moving on to something else, but my interest was still piqued.Well, I gave the show another try and binge watched most of the episodes. I really enjoyed half or more of them. Some were painfully slow, with no pay off at the end, but most of them offered some truly stunning and intriguing looks at technology and human behavior in the future. This is a really great look at humanity and things we might be facing in the not-so-distant future. If you have an intellectual mind or a love for weird dystopian/utopian worlds, and want to peek at where we might all be going with this stuff, you will certainly enjoy this show. A couple of episodes will leave you annoyed or asleep, but most of them were pretty cool.

Its also fun to see every guest star or recurring actor on Game of Thrones has been recycled in literally every British TV show ever!But honestly with Brit TV, the acting is downright inspirational, the writing keeps me on the edge of my seat! Black Mirror is one of those series. I had no idea what it was about when i started it other than it was British drama and i was looking for another series to binge. From episode one National Anthem..my mind was completely blown. I was shocked, horrified, and terrified at how believable these outrageous stories were.My favorite brit actors of course wow'd me.Black Mirror feels like The Twilight Zone for now! At least the first two seasons do.So far im one episode in on the 3rd season and already I'm bummed out. They've gone American. and already its trash. for Godsake Rashida Jones is credited with writing the opening episode of season 3.

All of the stories include a tweak in the current world, often in the nature of technology. Be Back Soon has elements of romance to it, while other episodes are more thriller or political in nature. They all belong together but each have their own feel. There are cameos by characters in one episode in others, but it's done as a fun thing to spot, not meant to illuminate the stores, which is why this is definitely episodic in nature.

The Twilight Zone focused on the moral goodness and hope for humanity while Black Mirror can be far more depressing and reflect the negative tendencies of society.My favorite aspect of the series is the negative effects of technology. I don't think that has been a part of conversation in society, but it is true. Netflix's recent documentary The Social Dilemma highlights this, but Black Mirror takes this concept forward. There is so much we don't understand about our existence and our place in the world: our existence, extraterrestrial life or the unknown effects of greenhouse gasses that are rapidly causing climate change. We keep discovering and exploring, but at a certain point we have to realize we need to stop.This is the focal message of Black Mirror: understanding the negative effects of technology and of human nature. I think this show was needed before the pandemic to wake people, to make them realize technology and people have faults. I do not think something like this is needed at this time, it will most likely just make our current situation feel more depressing.I am optimistic about the existence of humanity. We need to learn from our mistakes and realize the massive potential we have to cause our extinction through technology or other means. Technology is painted as something that causes humans to be cruel, which is true just not to the degree portrayed in the show. Certain episodes seem to display technology as a way to be cruel and mask or expose their insecurities. Charlie Brooker is a complete genius because every episode captures these feelings no matter the different technologies used.I love the show even though it can be slightly depressing depending on the episode. I highly suggest to skip the first episode about the British PM, it scarred me for months before I could watch any other episode. Brooker has a real message behind every single one of his episodes and that is why I love watching them. Maybe season 5 was not his best work, but I am excited to see how this pandemic has inspired him to create innovating, daring stories going forward! Please watch this show, it is definitely worth your time!",

(To be clear, this first \"season\" consists of only three episodes, although subsequent seasons have more.) This looks to be a truly superb dystopian science fiction anthology series \u2014 I'd rate it a 9 out of 10.I'd point to two qualities that make this show stellar. First, it's truly smart stuff. The story devices are thoughtfully invented and quite original. (These are \"near-future\" -type sci-fi tales depicting how new technology or cultural trends can have unforeseen consequences.) This show doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence, it relies on him or her to pay attention and think.Second, the writers here have a firm grasp of genuine psychological horror. There are no radioactive monsters in the sewers here, or killer robots from the future \u2014 but \"Black Mirror\" manages to be scary without those things. It does just fine presenting the viewer with visions of human shame, fear, jealousy or existential loss. These are stories that deal primarily with the psychology of their characters \u2014 and they truly get under your skin.This is great stuff \u2014 I'd recommend it.",

Which is what it makes it so good.Basically Black Mirror premise is to dive into (very plausible) scenarios into where technological progress may lead us if we are not careful, and just how f-ed of a world we may end up with it.Would recommend watching all of the episodes, and it is a perfect show to watch if you feel like watching something but maybe do not have time to watch a movie, while still getting that beggining, middle and end feeling - and most likely will be very philosophical after that.Strong 9/10",

            "content": "My favorite TV Show of all time. It's a series of science-fiction anthologies focusing on potential ugly outcomes of technology innovation, and many of them are already about to happen. Episodes are standalone with their own original story, but they all share the main theme of how technology might affect us and reveal the hideous side of our soul. Furthermore, their typical dark and ironic tone are so exceptional, it blends in perfectly with the main theme. Besides, the anthology approach was really a great choice because it keeps the audience focused on core concept of the series while enjoying various stories rather than be attached to some recurrent characters in a standard approach. Indeed, the show has never ceased to amaze us, either with unimaginable ideas of technology, or sometime with new plot development regarding similar tech innovations but from very different angles. Like its creator - Charlie Brooker said: \"There was a signature tone to the stories, the same dark chocolate coating - but the filling was always a surprise.\" And all together, that's what has made Black Mirror stand out as an uniquely remarkable picture of our time.\n* The series's title was inspired by the cold, shiny screen of a TV, a monitors, a smart-phone... when it's off - technology's \"black mirror\" that can reflect the darkness of humanity.* Some of you might decide to abandon the series after watching the 1st episode. That's a terrible mistake! In fact, I consider it as one of the weakest stories of the collection. In my opinion, as it was a pilot, Brooker didn't want to go too deep, therefore the shocking stayed in the shallow but not in the profound. However, don't give up on the show because of it! Otherwise you'll miss some extraordinary gem that'll make you regret.\nSo far, my 3 favorite stories are: 3rd - \"The Entire History of You\" (season 1); 2nd - \"Black Museum\" (season 4); and especially the 2014 Christmas special, \"White Christmas\", has been my number one ever since.",

            "content": "I binged the entire series (4 seasons) one weekend in 2018 (over 1,000 combined minutes in 19 episodes). Black Mirror has been reviewed ad-nauseum, and I have nothing more to add that will influence anyone's viewing decision either way. However, I will offer a brief opine and a selection of the best episodes for your consideration.Each episode is a self-contained pseudo-science fiction story, running anywhere from 43 minutes to nearly 90 minutes. I can compare it to an updated version of The Twilight Zone, at least that's the first thing I thought of. Except, in Black Mirror the characters aren't really in another dimension per se, they're in the now and all the freaky stuff that happens is 'common' among the population.Technology, and how it can affect (sometimes adversely) everyday life is the centerpiece of each episode. If you're looking for a feel-good series with predictable plots you're not going to find it in Black Mirror. You'll see the dark side of humanity and what people are capable of when this cool technology is exploited for all the wrong reasons: some of these episodes get really gloomy.Although each story can stand on its own (you can afford to miss episodes and still know what's going on), I counted least seven chapters that briefly refer to another in the series (like a specific piece of technology, or a quote from a character). If you miss the reference, though, it's not going to totally throw you for a loop.Among the dark themes, there is some humor. Odd, creepy humor. Don't feel weird or awkward laughing at certain situations that may otherwise be inappropriate. I was horrified after the first episode in season 1 (The National Anthem). Truly sickened, in fact. When I watched it a second time, I giggled like a mad-man. But it's that humor that makes Black Mirror a fun and addictive series to watch. Some of the 'laugh-out-loud' moments, for me, were in seeing justice get served to the deserving. What boundaries will they cross in the next season I wonder?My favorite episodes are:Season 1, Episode 3: The Entire History of You (9/10)Season 2, Episode 2: White Bear (9/10)Season 2, Episode 4: White Christmas (10/10)Season 3, Episode 1: Nosedive (9/10)Season 3, Episode 3: Shut Up and Dance (10/10)Season 3, Episode 6: Hated in the Nation (9/10)Season 4, Episode 3: Crocodile (9/10)Season 4, Episode 6: Black Museum (9/10)",

Many of the other reviews here capture the cleverness of the series.However, the last 1 1/2 series have succumbed to identity politics. It's sad to see such a powerful writer and executive producer stumble and fall into post modernism. You will see a sudden influx of unrealistic, dislikeable female characters. In particular, the episode \"Hated in the Nation\" is doused in political correctness, nauseatingly so.Is this simply a case of being upset with female characters? Not at all. Prior to the political correctness dousing, the female characters were natural and realistic, capable and vulnerable. After this, I predicted that the \"female hacker\" in \"Hates in the Nation\" would outsmart every male hacker within seconds because \"she's female\". You will see a consistent theme of imasculation of male characters and hyper masculinisation of female characters. From a show that aims to reflect reality, it's such a disappointment that it falls into these shallow stereotypes.Let's hope the writers don't follow the path of Season 4 of Sherlock Holmes. Can the writers turn back to realistic, relatable female characters? Once you head down this path, writers rarely recover. Realism loses out. The edginess of season 1 is unlikely to be seen again, unless the show heads to extreme political correctness.",

A better show would have been to explain how THAT happened.A review of this episode: the English princess is kidnapped after her too-small-to-handle-the-job security detail is overrun\u0085 by one man, apparently. A ransom demand requires that the prime minister have sexual intercourse with a pig on national television, which he initially refuses to do. After a twit on the PM's staff arranges for a fake video to be created, the kidnapper somehow gets wise to this and sends a finger, alleged to be the princess', to a television station, which has been the focus of a subplot involving sexting and the leaking of information by a PM staffer. Some cybercrime specialist determines where the ransom video was uploaded. Surprise! The location was a waste of time and the television station's reporter is shot at the scene. Eventually, the PM does the deed, the people shake their collective heads in insincere regret while leering at their screens, his wife is humiliated, the princess stumbles out onto a bridge \u2013\u2013 unharmed, and the kidnapper hangs himself. Okay?The thing that irritates me about shows like this \u2013\u2013 after having watched enough seasons of \"24\" \u2013\u2013 is that they are so predictable and so avoidable. After the PM does his porcine performance, the finger's DNA results shows it was from a male, of course! And, of course! no effort was made to ensure that the kidnapper would ever honor his demand. Did anyone question why the royal family was not involved in this? The writing is amateurish and seemingly motivated by nothing more than sophomoric pretensions. No effort is made to explain the events or give meaning to any aspect of the story except as a most puerile of \"wouldn't this be cool?\" scenarios in the writer's room. Such logic is also often behind the thought process of bad tattoos.To compare this dreck to \"The Twilight Zone\" is an insult to Rod Serling and his superior talent as the creator of the best show on television. To call \"Black Mirror\" \"science fiction\" is a misnomer\u0085 at least for this episode. I will watch at least one more episode just to see if there is any hope. Sometimes if you dig in the shite long enough you may find a quid.**Of \"special\" note: I like how this show threw around the coarse language in verbal and written form, but IMDb seems a bit prudish in the same \u2013\u2013 even if it's their own spelling suggestion!**",

I knew nothing about the show before getting into it and I am not a fan of horror, so I was skipping this every time it appeared on my Netflix watch-list, especially as it was giving the creepy vibes. But, how wrong was I!! This even remotely does not belong to the horror-genre.. I clicked play on Netflix and the first episode I ever watched was USS Calister (Netflix decided to automatically play the most recent season first even though I did not watch previous episodes!!), but a glad mistake, I was spellbound by the end of the it. It was everything for the \"nerd\" in me times 100!! There was cool tech, the mother, gripping story-line and homage to Star Trek, I was soo pleased by the end of it that I wanted to watch it again! Then I read about the series and found of that the show was an anthology, mainly created by ITV and purchased by Netflix after they noted its brilliance. My binge-watching marathon commenced, right from the first episode of season one (you can watch it in any order, but if you want to see the evolution of a relatively low budget series into a Netflix extravaganza, I would recommend watching in the order which the show intended to) The first episode with the UK Prime Minister and the pig was bizarre to say the least, still with brilliant writing but the second and third episodes were one of the best things I ever watched. Season 2 started with an amazing, heart-touching episode and then ends with a bang in the form of \"White Christmas\". This episode was screen-writing at its best and provides a very convincing/shocking premonition of what future tech will evolve into!Season 3 and this is where you can see how Netflix millions manifest onto small screens. Brilliant episodes, one after the other and it is soo satisfying to binge-watch them! Season 4 continues the same theme of excellent episodes and ends with a bang in the form of \"Metal Head\" and \"Black Museum\"!! I wish Netflix announces season 5 soon as I simply cannot get enough of Black Mirror!! Do yourself a favour and do not miss this master-piece at any cost. It really is \"worth\" the Netflix subscription!My Fave episode in chronological order:Fifteen Million Merits: Amazing insight of the power of media plus the gorgeous-gorgeous Jessica Brown Findlay ...\nThe Entire History of You: I saw this episode thrice already. Without spoiling anything, this is Black Mirror at its best! ...\nBe Right Back: This was heart-wrenching tale of star-crossed couple and a chance to re-live. ...\nWhite Christmas: I though the best of the season was already episode 2, but we get 2 amazing ones here ...\nNosedive: Like, comment, share, thumbs-up .. what if your entire life was based on that!! Brilliant episode giving us a peak at the impact of social acceptance. ...\nSan Junipero: This should go down in the history as one of the best love stories. ...\nMen Against Fire: Soldiers at war with very new high-tech vision, both sad and dangerous ...\nHated in the Nation: Simply wow!! Story of a sinister terrorising with high-tech flying things ;) ...\nUSS Callister: Live Long and ... have fun!! Plus very strong performance from the \"Mother\" (Cristin Milioti) ...\nArkangel: Helicopter-parenting .. how far would you go?? ...\nMetalhead: Post-apocalyptic struggle for survival. Wish they make a movie out of this. ....\nBlack Museum: Very clever writing and amazing conclusion! ....Weaknesses, well there are far and few, not every story's conclusion is satisfying. Sometimes, it leaves you wanting for a better closure. But that is a very minor issue. Just do not miss this show, you will be glad you didn't skip it.",

Black mirror is basically fearmongering, especially about social media. Almost every single episode's underlying theme is how facebook and twitter is this vile cesspool that only brings out the absolute worst in people and only spawns trolls, bullies and terrorists, a system that makes us all soulless total psychopaths reveling in mass murder and human suffering.Black Mirror seems to be made by old people. The kind, who only have a cursory understanding of modern technology, probably from the news and conspiracy nut blogs, and they envision this formless evil beast that will inevitably destroy humanity. We all fear what we don't understand, and the creators of this series are just bringing this concept to the extreme. You can see it in every episode: social media is evil tyranny, modern medical and scientific advances are just waiting to kill us all, and where one single person is enough to hack some automated system and go on a killing spree, while the authorities are just fumbling about completely powerless. Aside from one single episode, Season 3's \"San Junipero\", the entirety of Black mirror is totally ridiculous, pandering fearmongering, that exploits people's lack of knowledge about technology and sends a completely wrong message. This sort of luddite thinking and behavior is what lead to the Dark Ages...Having said all that, Black Mirror is a surprisingly well put- together series. The production value is very high, and for a sci-fi TV series, the CGI is remarkably good. The stories (discounting the subject matter) are well written and well acted. Some of the episodes tend to be sluggish and boring in places, but I chalk that up to the creators, who seem to be from the old-school sci-fi scene with strong hints of Stanislaw Lem and Phillip K. Dick influences.All in all, Black Mirror is very well made sci-fi series, that is just a bit too on the nose about it's hatred for modern technology and especially social media. It's definitely worth a watch if you can distance yourself from the ridiculous fearmongering.",

Just because it might sell better is not an argument, as variety also sells. Is it because the ones who end up in humanities, as opposed to sciences are not only usually less intelligent, but also start up in fields that pay far worse. So anything that reinforces their obsolescence in the work market only reinforces the Christian mythology about the end of days.The series is unpleasant in taking the ugly side of tech, in an unimaginative context. Take the first episode. People can see in a virtual reality hints from their smart phones. Yet they still need a big screen just like the young screen writer envied the people having big screen macs back in the day. The technology seemingly surpassed the need for a screen - see the brother emerged in virtual reality - yet the writer can't possibly understand that. Or when Tesla cars can drive themselves, in this alternative near future the Taxi is a Taxi and not some sort of Uber and has a driver too! So much for visionary.Yes, the phones should have been different, but the catalyst of the unimaginative writer incapable to get a science diploma is precisely his fear of a smart phone like the iPhone. And the fear is palpable, after all the screen writer probably has a hard time understanding that the Russian girl who keeps writing is a scam as the Nigerian prince.

            "review_title": "Vengeful Sadistic Catharsis (Season 4)",
            "content": "This series is in a way outrageously disturbing. It is not science-fiction as usual, but it is science-fiction from a systematically vengeful and sadistic point of view. The six episodes have no alternative meaning and that's why they are poignant in a way because even though we know it is going to be sadistic and vengeful, we do not know how it is going to develop and the punch line is always flabbergasting.USS Callister is the story of a power-hungry man who is in real life servile and even humbly spineless. He is a game programmer and as such he invented a game of virtual reality in which he can be himself as he would have liked to be, dominant, powerful, a real slave owner who, in the game, is always successful and can transform the team members of his USS Callister into monsters. The interest is that the team members in this virtual reality game are real people imprisoned in this VR spacecraft via their DNA. Of course, they only are copies of their real selves that stay in the real world. But they have to submit to Captain Robert Daley or they are transformed into monsters that can be killed and revived as many times as Mr. Captain wants and what's more he can capture the children of these team members by getting their DNA and he can torture the VR copy of the children in front of the eyes of the team members who are copies of the parents whose children's copies are being tortured. But what happens when a new \"member\" is brought into the team who does not want to play the game?Arkangel shows a mother who decides when her daughter is still young for a reason that does not justify the decision, to implant in her a sort of GPS that enables the mother to see the world through her daughter's eyes on a screen. The mother becomes invasive and she for a short while decides to put the screen away and keep it dormant. But that will not last when her daughter is a teenager and able to have love relations with boys. I just wonder what it would have been if she had preferred girls. The mother gets crazy when she finds out one boy actually drugged her daughter to rape her. That will lead to the final crisis and both mother and daughter will get out of it deeply bruised.Crocodile brings another mind-reading device, this time it is able to go back in time and read the memories of people. Imagine the drama that can come from anyone if they were able to know exactly how the people, they were dealing with felt about them and about themselves. You can meet very dangerous people in the street, and it is better not to know. If you can then you will panic. And the story is ending in some sort of banal conclusion that it is always better not to know what other people think of you and what they think of when they are with you.Hang the DJ is just a crazy dating system that brings together people, always one man and one woman, no anti-LGBTQI segregation at all, of course not, but there is always a time limit that becomes a time frame that has to be respected and when it is short it is always too short and when it is long it is always too long. In this dating world, where people do nothing at all but wait for their date, date them and then wait for the end of it to have a new prey provided by the system, and the word \"prey\" is the only word that fits. What happens when one person falls in love with his/her date and when this date falls in love with him/her? There apparently is no escape. So welcome to permanent and recurring frustration with no compensation or escape at all. Sinister. The very end is the negation of anything human you may believe in.Metalhead is mysterious. It is the story of some kind of animal, outside in the real world that got in a way killed or destroyed and the kid attached to it is wanting, not desiring, absolutely wanting, absolutely haunted by his demand based on his deprivation, is wanting then a replacement. Three people try to enter the warehouse where they could find a replacement. It is abandoned except that it is under the control of some mechanical dog that is - or in fact, are - but one is enough, entrusted with the responsibility to get rid of the intruders. They are AI dogs that have tremendous technical powers and psychological understanding of human beings. Wait and the humans will always end up doing what will cost them their lives. More drastically pessimistic than that you die. Not me of course. It is a show and nothing else.Finally, Black Museum is by far the best because it reveals the real nature of humans, you know these entities that some people call men and women. Here we are essentially dealing with men who are perverts and live on the nasty suffering they impose onto other people. Imagine a VR-being or a Tussaud's mannequin in which the experience of the highest suffering of the real man represented by the mannequin is embedded and that he could be forced to relive artificially this moment on command from the visitors of the museum. Imagine the sadistic people coming to that museum just to electrify a guilty character who was electrified and have this VR character relive entirely his suffering when he was executed. Sadistic I said. And in this case, the end is absolute and plain justice. Vengeance will come sooner or later, and it does come in the film.In our world today, there is a deep vein of vengeful sadism in all or most people. Is there any exception? And modern means of entertainment enable these vengeful and pain-hungry perverts to satisfy their perversion, thirst, and hunger for pain, blood, suffering, torture, etc. This is deeply revealed in these episodes. But what our real concern is that these perversions are not only virtual even if they are mostly satisfied virtually. Is it catharsis? I am not sure at all because of the level reached by some people who are your next seat neighbor on a train, a plane or a bus. And catharsis requires the regular and recurring release of the violence of this death instinct in us for this very catharsis to last more than an instant, more than the length of a TV episode. It could be seen as some kind of feeding of the perversion, keeping it alive and \"vital\" since the subjects cannot survive if they do not have their portion of perverse fodder, their pound of fresh bleeding flesh. Are human beings becoming the perverse cows raised and fed on the bloody hay of these perversion-providers?So, enjoy your perverted onanism on these VRTeleConference TV-episodes. Enjoy the drinks.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",

When watching this series, I kind of had a feeling that movies just failed to catch up with the fast changing realities of our lives while this TV series does catch up.I'm still giving it 8 and not 10 because the series doesn't feel like it's giving any deep message. Also, it a bit too one-sided. Cuz all these new technologies have major positive effects, not just negative ones, and the series only concentrates on the negative stuff. Also, the series generalizes too much. There are plenty of people on Facebook or Youtube who only need it for professional and business reasons, and plenty of professionals who put useful stuff there, not just farting dogs.

A lot of nice atmosphere, which I love.But when season 3 started everything seemed different. It went from clever to mediocre acting and shallow writing. And these predictable plots are worked out in an action-for-the-sake-of-action package. So then we lost interest.

The sharp plots have been replaced with by the numbers chase scenes and clangingly obvious 'twists'. \nIt is so obvious that the original scripts and ideas have been savaged by people with agendas beyond making great TV.

I feel conned after looking at this particular IMDb rating. I find IMDb ratings are usually quite reliable, but not this time. I am not going to give ANY spoilers, I am just going to say that if it was someone's intention to make something as dire as possible, then then this was achieved. Everything about this was bad. I cannot believe how this got the ratings it did. How on earth could anyone rate this higher than awful. If you decided to try this, and a third of the way through you think to yourself 'surly it can't be this bad, it has to get better' then I am sorry to say you will be sorely disappointed. It doesn't get better. When you start to think to yourself that this story is unrealistic, un-ironic, and beyond awful believe me when I say you that that's the best it's gonna get, & trust me when I say it won't ever get that good again, just worse, much much worse.

It's something different as if we needed a new genre to place this social and technological fiction that isn't so far off from what we already experience in the so-called \"first world\", or at least in most episodes. Each episode is an hour long and written by different people which makes the two season of the series, with three episodes each very diverse so far. there's also a christmas special and a third one coming out of netflix. It deals with the overabundance of conectivity and communication technologies in our lives, but isn't so far off from the present. Except having a 4-G or 5-G cellphone tracking your everymove seems acceptable while having it inside of your arm, or your eyes, or behind your ears seems different. It's those tiny differences that are making the stories of Black Mirror, but the real ones that are at stake in the criticism. And suddently you understand better why the techies wearing google glasses were getting a beat up when first introduced, or why there are signs baring entry to cyborgs and cameras to the social centers & infoshops. That's what science-fiction does best : changing little things to turn it into fiction, so that we're detached enough to finally understand our surroundings. I hope the netflix produced version is going to stay as critical but somehow doubt it.",

Sure, there are some women who do \"bad\" things, but they are very nuanced, with lots of back story and context; \"How did she get to this point? What pushed her to this?\" White, male villains will be cartoonishly one-dimensional and just presented as-is; \"And then there's this putrid piece of filth... You know he's evil incarnate, because he's a white male.\" Other than that, it's basically a modern twist on Twilight Zone with a focus on not-too-distant future technology. Each episode is its own universe and stands alone in this anthology.

I watched 5 episodes (1,3,4,5 and 6), but I really can't comprehend why so many people (including my friends) think so highly it.Call me critical, but I feel that if a show is sciency (projecting a view of the future and the technical advancements it holds), psychological (predicts how people behave in this futuristic setting) AND has a clear moral message, this projection should be VERY believably for the show to be any good. And in all the episodes I've seen, it utterly fails in this.In all episodes I've seen:\nthe point the writers try to make is already obvious within 10 minutes, after which you are hammered to death with it.to make this point as bluntly as possible, shortcuts are taken and story is sacrifised whenever needed.the people act completely inhumane without any common sense.the overacting is just painfull to watch. Again, probably emphasize the message the episode wants to convey. Take episode 2 for instance, with the woman who cries the entire episode.there is just too little logic and sense of reality.It's like all the writers care about is getting their message across and shocking people with it, instead of coming up with a decent, believable story. I'd give the third episode a 6 the other ones 3's or 4's.So, don't feel like there's something wrong with you if you don't like this show.

Here's the problem with Dark Mirror - The world they are satirising, Youth mass media/social media, doesn't need satirising. It's already satire!The pilot is beyond ludicrous and plausibility. Everybody in charge is an idiot and the filmmakers treat the viewers as such - conveniently glossing over glaring logic flaws and asking the viewer to suspend basic assumptions like cheating us into believing a cut off man's finger is that of a dainty princess. It's really lazy writing and the show continually asks us to suspend our disbelief beyond for even the most basic of plot points. It would be okay if they cut a few corners to get the message across but the whole thing is an exercise in cutting every corner just to get across a few insipid dark views on the modern world. Like I said, watching real life is more satirical than this. I did watch the 2nd episode in the hopes that it would get better, but unfortunately it didn't. It was just as silly. It's obvious that Charlie Brooker thinks young people into Talent Shows and Facebook are morons, but a good satire needs to be more than pointing out the obvious. It needs to be more than getting a giant brush and pairing it with random thoughts about the modern age. A good story and something more insightful than a twitter post by a professional sports player would be a good place to start for a show like this. As it stands now it's nothing more than a shallow observation by somebody who thinks they are being clever and nobody has the heart to tell them otherwise.UPDATE: Just watched the 3rd episode. It's actually interesting because it deals with human relationships and emotions in a grounded way. It does pull a few sneaky tricks, but overall it's much better than the 1st and 2nd episode.

Each is a self contained plot though it seems to happen within the same universe. This keeps things interesting and fresh with the motto show, show, show. I found the first episode to be re-pungent, Since this was the one used in the trailer before the show aired I had avoided this series for years. Fortunately the first two episodes were the most... I'm going to use the word controversial here since the one that comes to mind would be censored. After that the show finds it's moral footing. Because of this I don't think it's for everyone however the ideas and scenarios in the show are not too far fetched as regardless of the plot of the episode there is always the a central theme of focusing on the spectacle, of how things will be perceive. Rather than the person or their actions. In a world governed by Likes and star ratings, this makes sense and I would recommend it.

            "content": "Note: I have watched through Season 5, and I have no intention of watching further.Black Mirror messes with your mind. There is no overarching plot because each episode is it's own story. Each episode focuses on a theoretical situation, usually centered around a current or theoretical piece of technology, and all of them portrayed very realistically. It's easy to think of the show's conflicts as immediately rising threats in the real world, with major emphasis on the word \"threat.\" Each episode makes the technology's benefits very clear, giving more credit to its believability, before explaining how it could be used for evil purposes.Season 1 & 2 - Easily the best seasons. The stories are so harrowing that I couldn't force myself to watch more than 1 episode in a row. Even though I watched these seasons years ago, I still occasionally find myself pondering their implications. There are a couple of rare duds, but most of the episodes are fantastic. These seasons are so good that I wouldn't blame you if you don't watch the rest of the series. 8/10Seasons 3 & 4 - The original writers probably dropped the series after season 2 because they ran out of material. When Netflix picks it back up, I think it's more accurate to call this a new and similar series rather than a continuation of the original. The seasons have many more episodes, and also many more duds. Granted, even the duds still have thought-provoking concepts, but every 5-15 minutes of substance is dragged out into a 60 minute episode. The series would have been much better if each episode simply goes on as long as necessary to convey the point rather than dragging on to fill a full hour. Plus they are generally \"ruined\" by relatively happy endings, and the removal of the hopelessness means the formerly gut-wrenching problems don't pack the same punch and they don't stick with the viewer for nearly as long. The result is a show that's much easier to binge (which is Netflix's goal) at the expense of good storytelling. 5/10Season 5 - Fewer episodes means the writers get to throw out the dud ideas. The episodes didn't drag like the duds of seasons 3 & 4, so it's a step in the right direction. Though it does still lack the punch and lasting impression of seasons 1 & 2. I don't think Netflix is ever likely to return to the roots of a show that's difficult to watch, so this is probably the best we're going to get from now on. 6/10",

            "content": "The first episode I saw was S4E1: USS Callister which was similar to the short story I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream. It's really well made, thought-provoking, disturbing and also funny. It's half spoof of Star Trek and half psychological horror. If only the show maintained that quality.Another great episode was S3E6: Hated in the Nation. That was as good as a movie only a bit shorter and with a smaller budget. It builds up suspense and the twists and turns mostly make sense. It's a really interesting concept which might become more realistic very soon.One of the more disturbing parts of an episode was in S4E6: Black Museum, based on a short story by Penn Jillette from the 80s, apparently. Someone being addicted to pain is indeed a messed up idea - I suppose it's called masochism and some people do have it. It found a good balance between intriguing and hard-to-watch.The rest are mixed at best. At first I found the ideas creative and interesting, but pretty soon they start to repeat again and again. One of the most common ideas is that of a virtual environment and a soul trapped there. But this is rarely fleshed out. If you take a photo of someone, is a new copy of their consciousness trapped in that photo unable to move? I doubt it. The same if you write down their name.Similarly, just because you figure out some way to digitally represent someone, it doesn't mean that it becomes conscious. It's an interesting idea, but not if it's in every episode and the details are triviliased. That's not how consciousness works. Simulations require huge amounts of data and processing power. A simulation of a person is not the same as a real person.Some episodes take things in uninteresting directions, becoming more about sex or relationships than giving any insights about technology or the human psyche. Some are absurd in terms of the choices being made, such as one involving a pig (S1E1). It's not scary if I have no respect for the stupid decisions made by the protagonists.Some are overly depressing and questionable morally - they fall apart when you think about them, like S2E2: White Bear. It's annoying if an episode hinges on making you uncomfortable and having a big twist, only for the plot to make no sense once you spend 5 minutes thinking about it. A punishment makes no sense if the person can't remember doing anything. It's perverse to enjoy the punishment of someone who has no idea why they're being punished - it's also expensive. There's no way regular people, including kids, would actually want to watch that for entertainment.Many episodes only use technology as a gimmick and their story could have occurred completely in the normal, modern world. As such, their stories are usually shallow once you see through them.Eg) S2E3: The Waldo Moment - a comedian could simply run in politics, as many celebrities have already done. Waldo was more annoying than anything else. And S3E1: Nosedive applies to our daily use of social media anyway. Some people are superficial, but rating systems are useful for many purposes. Even without a system, people rate each-other privately to some degree.Some episodes are just boring, take too long to get moving, have bad acting and are forgettable other than that. I still haven't finished every episode because some of them were just too tedious. Regardless of technological quirks, if the characters are dumb or don't communicate or if the rules of the world are inconsistent, I completely lose interest. And that's maybe 1/3 of the episodes, unfortunately.",

I applaud the foresight of the writers who present these issues in a way that seems obvious while were watching each episode but probably have not pondered in our every day lives. This show overall seems to have the underlying message that we want all these things which we believe will better out lives but comes with a set of problems which ultimately doesn't change anything.

            "content": "Usually, I try to keep away from dystopias because I can't bear their gloominess and pessimism. When I started watching Black Mirror I only knew that it's a criticism of modern society. But I didn't expect to see that shocking, dark, disturbing depiction of a very near future. But once started watching I couldn't stop. I watched and wondered which dark tale I would see next.I absolutely adore British TV shows, they are a gripping and unique blend of comedy and drama, and distinguished English humor is always a ray of light even in the most tragic circumstances.Black Mirror is not like that. No humor. No ray of light. Only shocking truth.In the majority of the science-fiction films the future technologies are just a part of the society and it isn't shown how they affect our lives on minor levels. Well, Black Mirror shows it like no other film or show. It shows how new gadgets, technologies, social media and entertainment industry imperceptibly slowly and steadily change our perception, change worlds (Waldo's Moment), societies (National Anthem, White Bear, 15 Million Merits), life of individuals (The Entire History of You, Be Right Back.)Each episode deserves a separate review, separate kudos, but I'll express my thoughts shortly on each of them here:1. The National Anthem - the first and the best episode for me. I'm totally freaked out by it. By a society that gathered to watch the most humiliating act forced over an individual. If only a few people from this mob have refused to watch it they could have prevented it. But they haven't.2.15 Million Merits - unlike other episodes, which describe life and situations, in which we can easily imagine and find ourselves in today or tomorrow, this episode is entirely futuristic. It contains an exaggerated image of modern society: unified people with unified lives zombified by TV. Sometimes in this world appears something real, something beautiful, something innocent. Then it's broken. Sometimes somebody resists. Then they are sharply made the part of the system again.3. The Entire History of You - basically it's a family drama. The future technology from this episode can be useful for people with bad memory, and can turn into in evil by creeps, who like to think about their past relationships. The evil in this episode is also that with the help of this technology main character humiliates his wife in a way that no one has right to do because everybody has a right to privacy, even spouses.4. Be Right Back - we see a beautiful girl Martha who resists the influence of modern gadgets and social media, but eventually, ends up dating a software.5. White Bear - a society must have a code. If there are crimes there must be punishment. But even a death penalty and Lynch Law are more civilized and merciful than that what we have here. The law can't be sadistic and entertaining. Otherwise, it's not a law, it's a crime.6. Waldo's Moment - do you want to be ruled by a cartoon that stands for nothing, thinks nothing, offers no decisions, only farts, insults and makes jokes about its d..k? Well, they want.To conclude, if you want to broaden your horizons, watch British TV shows.",

Thank you Charlie Brooker for the best show of all time.Black Mirror is a television series that originally aired on E4 for it's first two series until it was bought by Netflix, and has received a much more bigger audience since its removal. If I had to say, I do believe the show was a tiny bit better then when it was on E4, but I mean a TINY bit better, I am not saying the show got worse, but you can tell it got way more involved with the US, but still kept to it's original British roots. The series takes place in either the same universe or 19 different universes, which would make more sense as the show is very hard to piece together as a related universe show, and follows different futures where technology slowly begins to outsmarts man, in good ways and bad ways (by good ways I mean San Junipero and that's it). I am literally in love with the show, as it practically shows us how one day, technology is gonna roar over humankind and probably destory us, if it's physically or mentally. Some of the stories have already frickin happened (Nosedive, Be Right Back, National Anthem). The show has no bad episodes, although some do feel very poorer to others, but still send powerful messages. If there was a episode to send a silly message, it would have had to been Metalhead (even though I still love the episode and remain in my top 10 favourites) or Playtest or Men Against Fire, which were my two least favorite episodes out of the entire show. My favourite episodes have to be Fifteen Million Merits, Nosedive and San Junipero, darkest episodes would have to be Shut Up And Dance, Crocodile and White Bear, while least favourites would have to be Men Against Fire and Playtest.Well, Black Mirror is officially my new favorite show now, sorry American Horror Story!",

Actually current cars have that so how come they needed to rely on eye witnesses?

I think I described to my friend as a Charlie Brooker keeps building the same house but giving it a different coat of paint. Ever since the show literally peaked with \"White Christmas\" (which is undeniably either the best episode of the show or in the top 3), they have kept repeating the \"torture AI\" concept. This became intolerable for me when I reached \"Black Museum\". I like a lot of episodes that go for something new, like \"Metalhead\" or \"Shut up and Dance\", but the amount of episodes that keep refreshing old ideas is starting to get tedious. However, the worst episode of the show was either \"ArkAngel\" or \"Black Museum\". Jodie Foster seems like a nice person, and I haven't seen many of her other directorial efforts, but I think she made one of the most boring episodes of the show, on par with the first half of \"White Bear\" which was intentionally bad. \"Black Museum\" is like a bad remaster of a game you like. There are other types of technological horror stories you can tell, \"Shut Up and Dance\" proved it, but they keep resorting to the same beats of eternal hell inside a computer. I think the show needs new writers and a new showrunner ASAP.\nThe show is also limited by the gimmick, that being technological horror stories. This has really limited the writers creativity, unlike Inside No.9 which has a simple one location gimmick, which gives them more freedom. Honestly, for a show written mostly by two guys, Inside No.9 is a much more creative, shocking and impressive British anthology tv show. So just go watch that. Its less tedious and annoying.",

Reminds me a lot of The Outer Limits, which was one of my favorites back in the 90's.\nBlack Mirror is a fascinating way of looking in to the future more or less tongue in cheek. The only reason I'm giving it 9 instead of 10 is that I wish there was more horror elements, but you do get your share of horrible imaginary though. Also the first season as a whole is boring compared to the rest of the seasons. (The Waldo-episode was a complete snoozefest.)\nThe acting is really good. I also love the fact that I get to see familiar actors and actresses like Bryce Dallas Howard or GoT's Jerome Flynn, which also do an amazing job. The special effects are seamless and I wish more series and movies had such a fantastic effects.\nMany of the episodes come together from the simple idea that technology and social media are consuming us and our world at a fast pace and it's dooming us more or less. I am not myself a huge friend of social media or the latest gadgets so I agree 100%.\nYou should most definitely watch this series, it will make your day!",

Black Mirror trapped me, looking into it's gaze and I loved what I saw staring back at me. Each story is different, but all episodes have an undercurrent of technological variations. It highlights what society will become (and in some cases already is), from being completely obsessed with our phones and social media (society is well past this point), to the afterlife and how we might best use technology for the power of good...and love. There were perhaps 2 weak episodes for me personally, one being 'Men Against Fire' (yawn) and the second being 'White Bear'. They for me were just a bit boring and done to death. All the other episodes border from sublime - to breathtakingly beautiful. All of the episodes are wonderfully acted though. Do not miss out on this. Disturbing yes- but it reflects a world we actually inhabit now - damned until the end of this civilisation, shackled to our phones and selfies. Some may look at themselves differently after this- I certainly did. Judging by this body of work, the writer Charlie Brooker is, quite frankly a Genius.",

The creativity and new plot for each episode is a marvel to watch. For the most part it is hit and miss as some episodes are not as good as others.

This is the way I watch BM - by watching one episode very infrequently and taking some months to recover from the enormity of the (let's hope erroneous) prediction. Still no better SciFi in 2019 IMHO.####I generally supply good reviews, however, very few TV series, films will ever get a rating of 10/10 from me. Black Mirror is one of those TV series.As a fan of Sci-Fi (i.e. Ray Bradbury, Phillip K. Dick two of my all time fave authors), the writing in Black Mirror (BM) is deserving of accolades accorded to the aforementioned greats. BM brings into sharp focus the trajectory humanity *could be* on (see Prof Stuart Kauffman's concept of the 'adjacent possible') and extrapolates beyond our current smartphone reality to an altogether (sometimes) grimmer collection of alternative higher-tech futures. BM is great Sci-Fi for this principal reason. The cinematography provides some stunning visuals (Ep 4 - San Junipero) and perfectly blends periods across the time hopping story lines of some episodes.

It's basically a contemporary equivalent of Twilight Zone for the 2010s.I love Black Mirror. I discovered it when Netflix revived the series in 2016, and the stories it tells are interesting and unsettling. Is all that happens in the world of Black Mirror the right thing to do? Do the character even know the difference between right and wrong? See this show asap. It's not going to fizzle anytime soon; but get a Netflix account if you don't have one already.",

I think all three of them are very good Black Mirror episodes and all three amongst the best of the series. In my opinion it is probably the best season the series has had.There is a maturity to season 5 which I think may have confused some people. The characters are more developed and the analysis of the tech issue that is influencing their lives and society is a bit deeper.I've seen many complain that the episodes are a bit slow but I think they are just missing that there is actually an increase in content, an increase in observation over previous episodes.These three episodes have all managed to avoid being \"one liners\" which Black Mirror is prone to becoming. Earlier Black Mirrors have tended to just repeat the same idea over and over throughout the episode from different perspectives, but without any development.In season 5 we are seeing much more development of the basic idea around which each episode is built.Of the three episodes I think I liked Smithereens the best, although it is actually hard to pick a best one.In Smithereens the portrayal of the police team was really first class as was the massive media company. There was just so much going on in that drama and I think if the detractors watch it again they might pick up on some of the things they have obviously missed.The other two are also really packed with material. I do think that those that aren't getting this series should just watch them again and this time look for all the stuff they have missed.",

            "content": "'Black Mirror' is, in my opinion, a standalone in what it achieves. By exploring the dark side of futuristic technologies it really delves into the uncertainty and fear surrounding technological advancement and the fragility of the human mind. It poses the audience with very real and very relevant questions about where we are and where we're going and whether the progress we're making is truly progress at all. Being an anthology series means that each episode of 'Black Mirror' offers a new and unique experience and story, whilst maintaining the common theme of technological advances. It's exciting because with each new episode you just don't know what you're going to get since they're often written and directed by a different team of people. Luckily, each episode and season benefits from an incredibly strong cast of talented actors that bring to life very real and interesting characters. However, the anthology organisation of the show is a negative as much as it is a positive, since each episode is very hit or miss. There are some episodes that are truly dreadful and that fall completely flat, whilst there are others that are brilliant masterpieces. Which ones are good vs which are bad, will all comes down to individual tastes but personally my favourites are, The Entire History of You, Nosedive, Shut Up and Dance, Hang the DJ, San Junipero, Playtest, Black Museum and White Christmas. Each episode, whether you enjoy it or not, will leave its mark and is very representative of very real issues that we're debating today. Is it right to unnaturally preserve human life? Is it right to monitor your child's every move? Is it right to exploit technology to exact our own justice or revenge? Is it right to create unnatural technologies that defy nature and pose a danger to everyone that uses them? It's these kind of thought provoking and emotive moral dilemmas that 'Black Mirror' tackles with each episode and what makes it so brilliant.",

And here the focus is on possible side effects and misuses of the possibilities of new technology.It is many times a journey into the darker sides of humanity in a dystopic future. But also how good intentions of new technology conflicts with our aspirations as good humans to have a loving and meaningful life. There is a wide spectrum of stories in this show, from very emotional love stories to dark sci-fi horror. So there is a very big variation in the episodes. and everyone start watching should find some real golden nuggets to like.Stories are well thought out and seems quite realistic. No overplayed action or violence, you basically just know it is there to take the story forward which is good.The show is really addicting to watch, you just want more of this mind expanding, thought provoking and sometimes frightening and disturbing stories about us as humans in a possible future. An amazing show, masterclass of stories and actors. I really look forward to season 5.",

I thought: \"No way, they will find a solution to it, because this is what the story about: twisting and turning to come up with something brilliant\". Nope, they let the prime minister do an indecent act, live on TV so that the whole world can watch. To make it even worse, his whole staff is pushing him to do it!I mean, common!!!!! How far away from realism can that be? I know it's not a documentary, but they might as well let some aliens come over and save the girl! There are few nations that give in to kidnapping. They might pay some ransom but they will definitely do it behind the scene. Usually, they crack down on them with brute force. So, to have a minister do an indecent act live on TV to \"pay\" for the ransom is just ridiculous. No nation that respects itself would even think of giving in to this!! At the end you even know who did it and why... that even ridicules the whole thing to a magnitude of 7.I thought that maybe the second episode would be good, but it's even worse, because there is no tension behind it.

It is a strange setting for a series based on technology. Yet appearances are deceptive. There is more going on than meets the eye. Two women meet at the club and one asks the other if there is anything she would like to do that she has never done. There are more possibilities than it seems.Nosedive \u2013 Instant and random ratings of routine interactions determine social status, living quarters, jobs and so on. In this new world it is hard to climb and easy to fall. Does one pretend to be happy and successful in order to get better ratings, or does it pay to be authentic and honest? One young woman pins her hopes for a better life on a previous acquaintance who happens to be a rising star in this precarious world. However, this acquaintance was always mean to her. It is difficult to know who to trust. One false step or twist of fate may lead to a nosedive in life prospects.The stories are timely, darkly humorous and imaginative. Technology is a fascinating subject. I was worried that this television series would not be as adequately funded as if it was a big screen film, but there did not seem to be much of a difference. While there is depth lacking in the dialogue and the acting is a little flimsy, the Black Mirror series and these stories are compelling. Seen at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.

Some episodes are in a futuristic reality, where you could imagine how that's how the world may be in the next 30+ years and then there is some where it goes into the bit extreme and surrealism.Most of the episodes I did enjoy and there was a few that I didn't, but that's probably one of the good things about this series. There's an episode for everyone and they try and explore all different aspects and scenarios of what all kinds of different people, from all aspects of live life could face in each of these different realities.There's alot of big names in this, before they actually made it really big and also there's alot of Marvel stars which I thought was a pleasent surprise. It makes you wonder, if this is the show that got them more recognition for their career.Non of the episodes really join up and you can watch them in any order, or just the ones you fancy the look of and it won't make any difference to the overall outcome to the series.

Sometimes there is real flair and inspiration on offer. Other times, the tales can be rather unremarkable and occasionally, boring. That said, as a guide, I'd say this series is more polished than not. Season three, sees a departure from UK only based episodes and offers up imaginings from the US as well.

It gave me nothing. The acting is alright, the picture is great but it's just boring. Again, this script could have been something old and dusty that they just adapted for Black Mirror rather than in Season 1 where they all felt connected. I say Bah!Lastly the episode with the guy who screwed up his life completely.\nNow this episode is worthy of Black Mirror. It's the same untold story that unfold like leaves of a flower which is great. The only critique I would give it is that it had NOTHING to do with futuristic AI.

The third season has some harsh depictions of social media hate, societal ranking by online activity, and even technological effects on warfare. None of this episodes are cheerful and all of them end on a haunting note that will leave viewers second-guessing their online interactions and the nature of our reality. This season fell right in line with what I've enjoyed so far about the short series and I found no episode lacking in mind-bending social commentary and sci-fi entertainment.The first episode \"Nosedive\" follows Lacie (Bryce Dallas Howard) as she tries to increase her ranking in a society that judges each social interaction with a five-star rating. As Lacie takes a road trip to her old friend/bully's wedding she encounters different rankings and finds that the world isn't open to those who haven't had positive interactions their whole lives. The scenario is a definite possibility as individuals achieve fame and money from Instagram likes and a person's career can be destroyed from a single Twitter rant.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",

And a great recommendation it was. This \"Mini-seriesesque\" show is from production companies Zeppotron and House of Tomorrow. The former, having many previous productions in British television.On to the episodes, since these episodes are so diverse I will give a quick review of my 3 fave episodes:Nosedive (S3 E1): Just because Dallas Price Howard is the lead (she is one of my favorite actresses) isn't the reason that this is one of my favorite episodes. One of my favorite things to do (as a past time) is to go through the massive amount of videos on Instagram. The premise of voting on people (or in Instagram's case liking things) is a power that while holds no substance can destroy a person's morale. We care more about what others think than what we think about ourselves. It's a little Psychology and a little philosophy. The acting in this was Awesome. The radical change of the lead character was real. The general idea of the tech was not something really futuristic but more like something that could actually happen in a few years, but like an app not mandatory in integrated into society. It was shot in South Africa and really made use of the rural S.A. locations.An Entire History of You (S1 E3): No to be morbid in a sense, but have you ever had a memory you wish you could forget? Ever have a green-eyed monster thought? Well, in this ep they really took on the mind of a jealous person and forged it with technology that I believe would make anyone go nuts. Both Tobey Kobbell and tom Cullen played well as adversaries. The whole interview he had in the beginning did not connect well to the rest of the plot; I felt the first 5 mins could have really did something to connect me to his anger. The settings of modern furniture and the dinner party had an allure to it. This might be turned into a movie; rumors are Robert Downey Junior is going to produce. Be Right Back (S2 E1): This ep takes us to the great obnoxious emotion of mourning. Hayley Atwell plays a grieving pregnant widow. She did a great job of relaying the intimate feeling of losing someone and then getting back just enough of them to not want them any more (if that makes sense.) This is a Strange place in the spectrum of sentiment and broke her at the end. Domhnall Gleasons portrayal as a composite reincarnation of him self was good but lacking some definiteness. I felt like the cake represented something. A relic mirage of pleasure.Honorable Mentions: Fifteen Million Merits (S1 E2) \u2013Stationary biking all day is a terror in any dimension.San Junipero (S3 E4) \u2013 That music though\u0085 Walk Like an Egyptian \u0085 Heaven is a Place on Earth.",

I can understand why people will like it and why it will have such high rating on IMDb. But, for me the story and this show is not smart enough. Nor does it tries to be. So, I think I am not their targeted audience. I didn't like Dexter for the same reason. It was slow and stupid.I like Prison Brake First season. Till it start getting stupid.It is impossible to watch Fourth season without vomiting. But, even after all this I really like Breaking Bad.And were was I. Yes, Black Mirror. People who like to watch Horror movie.Will most likely love this show. I don't know why I never liked a single horror movie. Except may be Death note. Horror is added in it's Genera. But it's great.",

Hayley Atwell stars in an episode in season two but that episode was average. Watch Nosedive that has Bryce Dallas Howard in it and its her best performance ever.

            "review_title": "CONTAINS SPOILERS-Pseudo-intellectual garbage",
            "content": "The first episode is just pointless. What is sad is how pathetically lovers of this thing come across. They read so much depth and intelligence into it. There's nothing there. It's clear that the ending was conceived first, and then a story (a truly weak one) was written to support it. My problem with it isn't THAT the PM would eff a pig to save someone's life (queue the \"we don't negotiate with terrorists\" people) or even that the princess could be so easily kidnapped, with no clues left behind.One, the thought that someone should have to pork a pig (to save a human life) is presented as a real dilemma for everyone involved. Really? This is the worst thing one can imagine? Seriously, just think about it for a minute-and-a-half. The idea of it is portrayed in such a way that the PM and everyone around him (including his stupidly unsupportive wife) act like it's so dire. All one has to do is imagine the captive is their own child\u0085and it's dilemma over in three seconds. The whole idea of doing it puts the characters in such fits of anguish, such outward displays of inner turmoil that you'd think the world was coming to an end.I could come up with a million things that might actually bring about the melodramatic anguish that the characters play out. It's incongruous. Or is this a British thing? Is this how British people would react (honestly) to such a scenario?Two, citizens tune in to watch together at sports pubs as if it's a World Cup final. The Nation looks excited and jazzed as if they think it will be funny and not demoralizing to anyone. Drinks all around! Then, when the act actually takes place, everyone looks surprised, like they expected it to be humorous but then were shocked when it turned out to be unwatchable. Really, they all couldn't imagine that in real life it wouldn't be funny?Three, the conversation about the approval rating is unnecessary. That such a conversation COULD or WOULD take place is just the writers proposing a conspiracy as if that territory is food for thought. Are politicians that horrid? Maybe. If they were, would it be news to anyone? Again, it's just a cheap shot, not a revelation. Four, the captor is SO amazingly advanced that he can fool the British government. He expects their every move, plans contingencies for them, and punishes them in real time when they act predictably. But, evil as he is, he cuts off his OWN finger instead of that of the princess. Why does he care? He's already kidnapped her, harmed her, scared her half-to-death, emotionally tortured her, brought her to the brink of insanity, but cutting off her finger is just what\u0085too far? Further, no one can seem to tell the difference between a female finger when it is delivered to them in real time. How did he arrange to get it delivered to them so fast? Who delivered the finger? Why did he bother to put it on ice??? How did he do it through the pain? Sure, he kills himself at the end. So, he's suicidal? Suicidal people don't plan extravagant terrorist acts (with no true consequences) and then kill themselves after. What would be the point?Five, the PM's wife acts like the PM is betraying her and their marriage somehow. She becomes distant and cold to him immediately as if he wasn't just forced to perform a demoralizing act to save someone's life-which appears to have worked. They act like nothing's wrong in public, but then behind closed doors, can't even get a hug from her. He was raped. Imagine the reverse. A woman is the PM, and she has to take it from a horse or a large dog or something. Then after the act, the husband treats her insensitively, and without empathy?Lastly, the writers feel the need to add an extra shot of cheap, predictable nonsense by staging a phone call during which the PM's aid is told she was released 30 minutes prior to the act with the pig. It's another cheap shot that is below the creativity belt of any self-respecting artist. We're also supposed to believe that someone went through the trouble of time-lining the whole thing precisely enough to discover the 30 minute window in the first place. It would be after the fact, because, the news of the princess being found couldn't have been kept mum for 30 minutes. Word would have gotten to someone and it would have halted the pig scene. But, someone (who knows who) time-lined it right away, cause THAT's what was on everybody's mind at the time?Why am I writing this to slam one episode? Because the real tragedy here is that so many people are taken in by it. Production values are all that matters. People are so easily entertained and so boring that anything which filmed well, with decent actors will hypnotize them.I watched episode 2 anyway. I watched it because of the decent acting and production values, hoping that the first episode was just a mistake. I should have known better. Anyone who would lead a series with an episode this poor, doesn't advertise much promise. The second episode, \"Fifteen Million Merits\" is less cheap, but just as pointless. It is also excruciatingly dull. Mind you, I watched it with bated breath the whole time, expecting something meaningful to happen. I wasn't bored, but it was dull. Don't know if that makes sense to anyone. In the end, it was as the first. It's just that we live in this world where everything is dire, cynical, pointless, meaningless\u0085just add water (plot). This seems to be the flavor of the show, so two is enough. Go ahead; tell me I'm really missing out. I'll take my chances and watch reruns of \"As Time Goes By\" instead.",

They criticize modern society, where technology has a big part in an everyday life.

I think there is one happy ending among all three seasons. S1E1 - I suggest you skip this one. It was by far the worst in my opinion, the only one I really disliked. It was pointless and disgusting, blackmail via social media for no apparent reason. \nS1E2 - a future dystopia show about using media entertainment to escape a dull reality. I enjoyed it. S1E3 - a future where everyone has an implant that records every moment of their life and can be played back on screen. It was pretty good. \nS2E1 - Can robots replace people? Good presentation of complexity of emotion and personality. \nS2E2 - it is strange, you don't know what's happening for a while, without giving too much away it's kind of a dark twist on justice. I liked it. \nS2E3 - could happen this year - a look at public opinion and the fakeness of politicians. Very good. \nS2E4 - it says it is 'three interconnected tales' but it is all one story, and comes together at the end. Another 'technology and justice' story. S3E1 - social commentary on virtual 'popularity,' well done. \nS3E2 - technological horror story, somewhat predictable but fun. \nS3E3 - technology and blackmail, this one is how the concepts of S1E1 should have been done. I liked this one, even if the kid was stupid - he's a teenage boy, so his foolish emotional responses are believable. \nS3E4 - a virtual reality romance, not my thing personally but well done. \nS3E5 - a commentary on combat and dehumanization of the 'enemy.' Very well done. \nS3E6 - a combination of technological terrorism/horror with social commentary - the deaths are pretty disturbing especially if you have certain phobias, but I really liked the show.",

With each episode being it's own story, there are some losers in there. That being said, the concept is so good I have to look paste them and applaud the creativity and application of science fiction that isn't so far in the future that it is a guess. Much of the technology used in the shows is in some stage of development (not all, most) making the future feel like next generation. The highlight is in how from a social and psychological standpoint close it is to where we are today. The general sense is a bit of twilight zone mixed with next generation technology mixed with possible evolution of social or application of the tech from a darker perspective. Taking this next generation technology and exploring what hackers could do with it, how it could be used/misused by those in power, and other variations on this theme. The one thing I found in common was that how many times I had no intention of watching an entire episode only to watch it, and the next, and the next. Quite Addicting and well thought out with hopes that Netflix (which from what I can tell has taken it over) has done to improve it and increase the episodes. Hoping the upward trend continues and the creativity not lost. One of the best shows I've accidentally watched.",

The black mirror in Mexican culture is a magical object which reflects different aspects of the human nature - exactly as does technology here; it is not an actor, just an instrument. And just as any other instrument, it can not make life better or worse without human intervention. So, if the series are showing a dark side, it is the dark side of humans, not of technology. Even in \"Hated in the Nation\", where technology is so advanced that it almost seems to have a will of its own, there is a human actor and a human motivation. Moreover, in episodes like \"San Junipero\" things look sparklingly positive and in many others - they are ambivalent. But I suppose the series themselves are yet another black mirror reflecting the human fear of technology, thus the one-sided perception.",

I can only speak from my perspective of being an older American male who grew up on the original Twilight Zone TV series. From my perspective, Black Mirror is slow, boring, and it is an insult to the original TZ show to have this show compared to it. The TZ made clear points by usually having a discovery twist at the end of the episode. I don't believe this show comes anywhere close to that. Black Mirror is not something I'm going to do what I consider to be wasting my time watching.

The stories are diverse and seem to come out of left field, which is brilliant in its own right. They do share a common theme, however - examining the darker side of technology and how it's come to dominate our lives for better or worse.Can't really say much more without spoiling it but one doesn't need to be a science fiction/fantasy fan to truly appreciate this show. It's got a powerful message and will, in my opinion, inspire viewers to contemplate some of the larger questions facing the human race. The drama and acting are uncommonly good to excellent; the pacing taut and intense. It's an enjoyable experience as much as it can be an uncomfortable one, but the discomfort is a good thing; after all, how many t.v. shows truly make us use our brains these days?",

Afterwards, had I not just wasted 45 minutes?The second episode shows some bloke who is apparently a slave to the gaming and online world. It should be a scary future, but it was as boring as hell! I managed just over 10 minutes of the episode before I turned it off.I have absolutely no intention to see the 3rd episode or any from the other series... to me, it felt like a grossly over-rated programme.

While from the S01E01, we can easily tell that even the prime minister has to comply with the public will, embarrassing the requirement though, the people enjoyed the event at the beginning and felt offended and the terrorists'obscene dictation disgusting at last.So who won? The first lady begged his husband not to conform crying \"I know the people.\" But didn't the prime minister know? He was supposed to be the political leader of the kingdom with an intelligent administration to help him,suited up in the world stage,a dirty trick played by some terrorists,a pig,live on the air,how about you go fuk yourself\uff1fHowever the kidnappers were smart, so they held the princess, a beloved royal member to sway the public, thus the public were dragged to their side though they might not support their act, but from a totalitarian perspective, an embarrassing awkwardness weigh way less than one's life,let alone a royal one. A moral dilemma was designed elaborately, and the people were led deliberately against the political elite, their emotional resentment towards the elites were activated, on this specific subject.Now let's take a look from the prime minister's side, what was set before him?The palace want him to submit,the public too and the Party, even though he was the party leader. He hesitated,If he yielded, then he would attain better palace relationship and public support and even consolidated his leadership inside the party and against the opposition in the next election.Ever thought of the cost of this possible \"Pig\" move,dismembered by the human race and a horrible experience accompany him for the rest of his life.Political profit tempting him, but the line was dropped there telling him not to do anything inhuman. Provided that there could be a compromise between pros and cons, thought our leader,suddenly a idea came up to him.\" This move won't be inhuman at all, since the people want it, the people want it and I am the political representative democratically elected by the people, so I should follow the public will and gain my credit by this courageous move.\" \"The people are ignorant and misguided.\" Said Sir Humphrey, I should add no more but usually the people can't tell right from wrong.Something Real - Film Review on Black Mirror S01E02In post-mordern life, consumer-level technology has dominated our everyday experience, with which we consume music from the music industry, reality shows from the TV industry, electronic devices and online entertainment from theose tech giants, we have man-machine interaction and commodities to assist or to devalue us physically and mentally, everything on earth become man-made, then shall we bother ourselves wonder, is there something real left?New GodNot much as one could expect in the future probably, apples and an origami crane were the only visible clues and items in this episode, anything else? Right, the voice, the voice of the female character Abby, in this fantastic totalitarian world, tradition and conventions were eliminated by progressive demand, family ties and blood relationships weakened, everyone living in boxes with big screens, we all cling to the state or the community as the background of the film set in, more precisely in this case, pop culture or government by the masses. If say God died centuries ago, we worship celebraty gossips and money today, so when given a chance of ascending to the top of the society, would one be hesitated? Abby believed it worths a try.Judge Hope and Judge CharityThe pop culture has been selling hopes and dreams to the public successfully, exploiting our vanity and ambition for their own profit. Consumers seem rather servile to such culture and embrace it enthusiastically, from those dreamers practicing their shows backstage, hoping that one day they could enter the stage and become a real star, by judgement of Judge Hope and Judge Charity, see the essence of this whole thing is charity and your hope, the hopeless you are begging the judges! People can be so spineless confronting wealth and higher social status, while the judges can be cruel, simply because this is a show to them after all. The audience are onlookers like zombies with their virtual characters on the screen behind the judges, who knows that by watching other people performing and becoming star, their stories may well be a good inspiration and preparing them to be potential players!StuffAlso we can see how the pop culture or TV and Internet has influenced day and life of our age, violence video games and pornography are the most popular content online and we are obsessed with virtual stuff, some User Generated Content is mostly nothing but rubbish, even though we share them on Facebook and Twitter, socializing. The industry boomed and jobs guarateened but what about life or spiritual aspect, who cares if you are due to get excitement in the next 30 minutes? Let alone future generations.It takes too much for an individual to fight against the entire system, Abby failed, so did Bingham, digital screens are everywhere and we finally compromise as a docile consuming vessel. When Bingham drank that cup of condensed juice on the table near the industrial crane statue, we all realised the answer.",

Some episodes will uplift you, some will depress you. I personally cannot binge watch Black Mirror because it is just so draining to watch. Each episode induces you to reflect on your humanity, your personal life, how you deal with society, how technology affects your connection to society, the future of technology, and many other things.Each episode is a stand-alone episode (but is said to be occurring in one cinematic universe) so you can jump episodes and seasons (except for the last episode of season 4-- watch that last). Different episodes have different characters (and I think writer and creators).Black Mirror is the modern version of the Twilight Zone. It combines various genres in a predominantly sci-fi theme, while providing a utopian or (mostly) dystopian satire of humanity's technology-dependent present and future.I highly recommended that you watch this show, especially if you belong to the young generation (after the Millenials) who were born with all this \"high technology\" we now depend on. Just be patient with season 1 because that's a pilot season-- most pilot seasons usually are just building the series' steam.",

This is the heart of Black Mirror, and what made it so popular.I'm afraid for season 5, a season that is very short by the way, only 3 episodes, that they strayed away from. While the acting has always been top notch, and still is, there are no complaints in this department, at the end of each episode it failed to really hit me, failed to leave me feeling disturbed. Mostly I think this is due to each episode ending in a happy sort of way.If this is what the writing crew, and the directors of the series were hoping to achieve, then they have succeeded brilliantly.But this series prided itself, and was built on the principle of technology and humanity clashing, and bringing out the dark side of humanity no matter how advanced our society becomes, so in that aspect, I am afraid it has failed miserably.I only hope that Netflix realizes this, and can make some changes and improve it again for season 6.",

Each season features a collection of individual vignettes with uniquely creative and uncomfortably thought-provoking narratives. From underscoring the power of social media and the control it has in our daily lives to showing what life could be like when humans have access to memory implants, the show offers a profound and unsettling commentary on the society we live in.It's a well-written and brilliantly produced high-concept show, with neat cinematography, crisp editing and terrific screenplay calling the shots. Production design, costumes and makeup are totally convincing in almost all the episodes.\nwhile some episodes make their point better than others, all present interesting ideas. Appearances by well-known actors like Rupert Everett, Jessica Brown Findlay, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Jon Hamm add to its appeal. All in all, Black Mirror offers a mature Twilight Zone-like viewing experience that is both entertaining and disturbingly captivating.Overall, The series is a contemporary reworking of 'The Twilight Zone' with stories that tap into the collective unease about the modern world. It's a smart, suspenseful, thought-provoking Sci-Fi series that. There is no progression throughout episodes, each episode is a standalone story, each is unique and has different set of actors. That means that you don't need to be consistently dedicated to it like you would other shows. Mostly, the stories deal with horrors, potential, and/or ideas regarding technology or world concepts. 8.4 stars out of 10 for stunning presentation of mind boggling stories.",

            "content": "After my cousin and cousin-in-law showed genuine freaked-outness and enthusiasm about these series I decided to watch it.The series is indeed quite original. And the fact that all the episodes deal with some negative side-effect from technology makes it relevant. But even though I definitely believe the technological possibilities proposed in the episodes, I certainly can't believe the human aspect. The behavior of the characters is farfetched, unbelievable. Exactly in that sense: I don't believe them.I guess this would categorise the series as 'horror', scary things happen and the characters overreact and do silly things, things that people wouldn't do in reality. And there's the snag for me: the series seems to want to use something from reality, technology, to scare us, yet fails to do so because of the characters' responses. There also is a strange focus on certain themes that seem to be the biggest horror to the creators of the show, and they are usually very sexual. Mostly men having to deal with the woman they love not having sex with them.I'd like to see this show grow. I'd like it to become more 'thriller' instead of 'horror'. I want to actually believe these things could happen. Well... only for an hour or so ;) \nI'd like to see this show grow and create storylines that involve more variant fears, and I can see they seem to be doing this. Hear, hear!So yes, please, go on. I cant' wait for the creators to really scare me silly... in the future.",

            "content": "Set in a dystopian society, Black Mirror isn't a regular tv show with a basic plot. Each episode is different and complex with a plot that is not predictable from the start nor the end. Each episode of Black Mirror ends on a huge twist.My all time favorite episode of Black Mirror is the Season 1 Episode titled Fifteen Million Merits. It separates humanity into three categories: the lower class, middle class and upper class. The lower class have limited rights and menial jobs, while the middle class are forced to ride a bike all day hoping to gain fifteen million Merits in order to win the hot shot ticket and participate in the contest led by the upper class.Black Mirror is quite dark and let's you see life differently. There are one or two episodes that are quite lighthearted, for example; the season 4 episode titled Hang the DJ. This episode leans into a world where all relationships have an expiry date and the only way to escape is to find your soulmate. It is quite an interesting concept, but sometimes the dating program contradicts itself.To conclude, Black Mirror shows us the dark side of modern technology and how twisted it truly is. Every episode makes you think about how the future will look or if it already looks like it. Black Mirror is definitely a show people should start watching.",

            "content": "Black Mirror has undeniably gained considerable popularity in the last 2 years, benefitting from Netflix injecting a healthy dose of money and production power into a previously understated British gem. The power of the show is down to the consistent quality of stories, but this has begun to devolve slightly with the arrival of the American audience. There is no doubt more quality stories may be on the way, but there is certainly a fear that executive decisions may end up harming this television treasure.The best of the show is undeniably in the first 2 seasons (when Charlie Brooker was at the helm); this was when Black Mirror wholeheartedly embraced the bleakness of its stories, each one a tormented glance at a future better off avoiding. A personal favourite, \"The Entire History of You\" is a prime example - unrelenting, thought provoking and disturbingly real. Part of the charm is also the continuous employment of lesser-known British actors, many of whom have gone onto many bigger things following having shown their qualities (such as Domhnall Gleeson and Daniel Kaluuya).Since Netflix obtained the rights to the show, some of this quality has lapsed from time to time: misfire episodes were more common in seasons 3 and 4, alongside a sincere lack of despair usually portrayed in the show. No doubt there were still some strong showings (\"Shut Up and Dance\" is another good episode), but these were diluted by the presence of tame episodes like \"San Junipero\" and \"Metalhead\". This also correlated with the use of more and more famous actors (such as Dallas Bryce Howard and Jimmi Simpson), which to me signifies a weaker story propped up by bigger names.As eager as I am for the new season to be released, there is certainly an air of apprehension: seeing Anthony Mackie and Miley Cyrus in the trailers screams overcompensation, alongside the clear budget raise each episode is displaying already. We can only hope that the episodes this coming season have not been sterilised for the mass market, and still hold the gravity that made this show great.",

It opens with a group of roommates in a club having fun 3 minutes later it's revealed that Anthony Mackie and Nichole Baharie are lovers. Jump forward what appears to be at least 5 years. They are married and celebrating his birthday. The other roommate Yahya Abdul-Mateen II shows up to present Mackie with a virtual reality game device and game. That night they play said game only to have sex. Where did that even come from? No hints at unrequited love between Mackie and Mateen. Most friends/roommates don't immediately try to have sex after years of being apart when there was no sign of lust/love between them.\nSeason 5 Episode 2: I won't ruin this with spoilers. The only redeeming episode from the season. Andrew Scott ( a highly underrated actor in my opinion) plays a character just drifting through life after the death of his fianc\u00e9e carrying a grudge for a social media site. Truly the highlight of season 5 thus far. A must watch.\nSeason 5 Episode 3. Miley Cyrus stars as a bubblegum pop star hiding her own personal angst. What appears to be an attempt to come off as a warning of not to judge a book by its cover falls flat. Weak backstory let's this episode just languish in its own mediocrity. Basically another teen \"drama\" that wouldn't have made it into any other entertainment platform except Netflix.\nPersonally I've loved this show until this season except episode 2( really great). Hopefully more episodes will be made that go back to the type of writing that previous episodes had. Better known actors can't help the show if all they have are weak scripts",

But when these compete with each other to give us the best content, we can't help but be in awe. Like in any other season the latest season consists of a bunch of standalone episodes. Some episodes have some familiar faces in terms of TV celebs. Each episode speaks about the perils of technology & how adversely it will affect us in the future. The scripts are one of the best we have seen. Each episode got us thinking & stayed with us post the show.\nThe fourth season is similar in execution as compared to the previous season. The episode about the dating app simulation was our favorite. The first episode about an IT honcho, who has made his fantasies come true in his own private world sets the tone for the remainder of the series. New viewers will have no difficulty whatsoever following the show. \nBlack Mirror is easily one of the most flawless show on Netflix.

The scenery, plot, costuming, etc. is outstanding. It's a diverse cast, and you can understand how the talent got to be there.\nI love Black Mirror.

When the pill was invented, everyone thought it was going to ruin relationship between men and women, saying goodbye to monogamy. Society thought women were going to become \"sluts\" and that sex would become this unhealthy, devalued thing. So know there's social network, dating apps, augmented reality and TV shows. Guess what people think about this new stuff ? Black Mirror. What an easy thinking way. Black mirror is the opposite of forward thinking. It just shows the pessimist's view of new inventions when there is a lot of up sides to them. Plus, the fact that thinking that people are not capable of choosing the impact of technology on them is just like saying free will doesn't exist. What a great vision of humans.",

After all it had the benefit of 60 years worth of technology improvements but the producers and writers didn't take advantage of it. In fact they squandered it.The stories are incredibly morbid, banal and pretentious. The few episodes I watched were difficult to watch to the end. There's nothing uplifting here.The characters are difficult to empathise with because they come across as total fools.

He says he uploaded porn films, I thought to myself if he/it had learned to have sex from porn he'd be hitting her, spitting on her and calling her names while not being at all concerned with her sexual pleasure so technically he'd be crap at sex.

Along the lines of the original Twightlight Zone, or Night Gallery.\nPeople seem to think that every episode has to be dark, or have some sort of tragic ending. That would create boredom, because the end would be predictable.\nThe thing I like best about this series is every episode is completely different, and never what I expect. That doesn't mean the viewer is surprised by some twist at every moment. Some episodes are bleak, scary, fun, horrific, odd, etc... but they all make you think.\nWhile some episodes are better then others, I can't think of any that I didn't enjoy.\nMy only criticism is there aren't enough episodes in each season!!!",

            "content": "I've been watching black mirror for about 3 years now. I've seen every episode twice and some episodes 3, 4 or even 5 times (Shut Up And Dance in particular). Every episode is intriguing right from the very start and keeps viewers hooked into the story until the end, with each episode having a unique and fitting soundtrack to really set the mood. The plot twists in some episodes are incredible and unpredictable, and even watching those episodes again and again and knowing how the episodes end, they're still just as entertaining. The scariness of it though, is the reality of it. Black mirror showcases how scary society could become in the 'near future', and the realism of how true it could all become is what's frightening. This realism adds to the thrill and horror of the show, and makes viewers especially intrigued into each episode.Some episodes however, ARE better than others. Hang The DJ, San Junipero, Black Museum, White Christmas, Shut Up And Dance, U. S. S Callister and Nosedive are among some of the best, and some of the not-so-entertaining ones, in my opinion, are Metalhead, The Entire History Of You and Rachel, and Jack And Ashley Too is just a plain over exaggerated teen drama, which is NOT black mirror. But, I'm still giving this show a 10, as the complete and utter brilliantness of each episode's storyline and the incredible episodes overall outweigh the not-so-good ones.Ive recommended black mirror to almost everyone I'm friends with, and it's always been a great entertainment/drama to watch at hangouts.I'm currently re-watching the show and the subtle excitement I'm getting from a possible season 6 persuaded me to write this review. Hoping it's better than season 5!",

            "content": "Before watching, I read a handful of reviews for this series and wowed at the high overall rating of 8.8.Now, let's get this in perspective...A higher rating than: \u0095 Halt and Catch Fire (2014)...?! \u0095 Hand of God (2014)...?! \u0095 Bates Motel (2013)...?! \u0095 Manhattan (2014)...?!NO WAY! ...and this is the problem!I watched the first two episodes of \"Black Mirror\". I was horrified and stupefied by the first \"The National Anthem\" and bored senseless with the second \"Fifteen Million Merits\".Whoever wrote \"The National Anthem\" needs his head examined. Apart from the fact that I'm not keen on Rory Kinnear, I say this for two reasons:i. It was a totally unnecessary, disgusting and vile piece of writing. The writer must have been seriously short of idea to resort to something like this. Now, I'm not a prude but this could easily have been focused on a 'safer' topic that would get the same 'point' across (whatever that point was supposed to be).ii. It was completely and utterly unbelievable. Does anyone REALLY believe that a Prime Minister would resort to 'obeying' the demands of a kidnapper in such a way??? It wouldn't happen. I repeat: IT... WOULD... NOT...HAPPEN...! The repercussions of this would affect the country considerably more than the loss of one life (and by saying this I'm not trivialising life). Over the years, the knock-on negative effect for ANY subsequent Government would be phenomenal. Politics would be changed forever and the general population would have such a deep loss of self-respect that I believe the people would resort to some form of anarchic behaviour including, in some cases, self-destruction. There is no Government on Earth that would submissively resort to such action.As for \"Fifteen Million Merits\", it was a very nice idea, a great concept but... Alfred Hitchcock could have gotten the point across in a 20 minutes AND make a better job of it.I'll give this one more chance by watching the episode \"White Christmas\" which, I notice, has specifically been given wonderful reviews.However, judging by my first and second incursions into this series, I would recommend staying well away. Instead, try watching \"The Outer Limits\"... same idea but HUGELY better!",

Second, the episodes are not made or thought to be masterpieces by their acting or dialogs or even effects . They catch the simplicity of a normal lifetime moment but with the dark immersion of future(maybe!) technology. It's the underlined ideas that are important here. All the other elements are basic ON PORPOISE so you can focus on all the consequences our future choices can bring. And to be honest, where in the world have you seen full on perfectly serious played drama with mindblown visual and whatever effects for a SATYR!?.\nLast but not least, some of the actions of the humanity are disgusting, horrific, and repulsive. Some is a way too small and insignificant word for this actually. I don't understand how SOME of you are so surprised.All in all, whoever's reading this, i advice you to give it a try if this is what you were willing to do and please, watch more than 1 episode. If you ask me, start with White Christmas (episodes are individual).",

The problem is that with the mature rating certain episodes feel more like they push at boundaries just to push and fail to highlight what the overall show is really about. Since each episode is it's own unique story there are standouts in both directions, good and bad. This makes it difficult to give just one rating so I'll settle for a mid-high score of 7. Even with certain episodes bringing it down the highlights are outstanding. But even the highlights I would struggle to rate beyond an 8 or a 9. It's good juice to fuel your philosophical thoughts and some of it is entertaining. But will I remember these in 20 even 10 years? Possibly, but probably not.",

            "content": "Fantastic. Thought provoking. Seed Planting. Concept exploring and not trying to answer questions though questions are placed well enough that you can decide for yourself.Each episode is a different \"world\" or set of characters. Mostly set in a world very much like ours now. Entertaining in a way, but better than that. Stimulating. You can try to guess where the stories going and all that but you're just missing the point and perhaps denying, that this is a mirror, showing back at us what we know is moments away if not here now.I have long felt that we often attack new technologies, phones, internet realms etc, pointing out the undesirable behaviours surrounding them, but really the only problem there is that we aren't equipped to handle these immense powers/tools. Physical/mental evolution has been shocked by the unimaginable parabola of technological power we all have, even the poor, and the speed and leaps of imagination are only going to get crazier. Soon, we could create new nations/planets with each generation. Not that we should. So far, we're already confronted with these challenges and our society as a planet is paying for the incongruity of what is possible and our old structure, the one we know. Understandable.So, Black Mirror, highlights the weakness we deal with when confronted with our great power. The addictive and often extremely disheartening behaviours and inhumane reactions we have to this new world.Most episodes could have been made into movies. Not that they should have but could have which shows value. These 45 minute tales are tidy and well developed. If you like one you're likely to like them all just not all the same way. Some the episodes are actually worth returning to as soon as your done. I won't say which. A number of episodes, I watched online, I immediately returned to a few key moments in the story after seeing the end of the episode. One of them I just went straight back to the beginning. Good stuff. The USA needs more stuff willing to go there but we're so sensitive, fearful of saying the wrong thing, judgemental and crippled by originally well intentioned etiquette (or P.C. culture or whatever). I suppose we're not the only ones cause those very things are covered a bit in Black Mirror as well.",

How are you gonna have consecutive bad endings just to have a CTO be mentally disabled? Those video game characters should have suffered. He's been bullied his whole life, and he deserves the punishment? Ow, and way to rely on the fact that men will fall for anything as long as a woman is shirtless. Disgusting stereotypical show.

Seasons 1 & 2 appeal more to a British audience but if you stick it out until Season 3 the storytelling broadens to include a more predominant American presence to it's characters and storytelling.My only criticism of the show is that conflicts within a character are often left unresolved by the end of an episode, leading people to review \"Black Mirror\" as a bleak or dark description of a fictitious future.Definitively worth watching/buying on DVD.",

Every episode is a 10 out of 10 stars. With a gun to my head I would highly recommend watching the \"white Christmas\" or with John ham. TRUST ME ITS GREAT! Jeeze I literally love every episode I can't decide. Every episode is a story within its seat that involves technology in some sort of way...unlike in all the shows and movies on tv where \"the bad guy\" always loses and the good guys live happilu ever after....well this show is NOT that. All but 1 maybe 2 of these great GREAT stories with superb acting do not end with a happy ending for our main character or protagonist and it usually ends on a very bad, sour, depressing and twistful for our main characters.",

Alas, the second episode is a completely different story. \"Black Mirror\" repeatedly and perfectly depicts what the future may hold for us as people of the world if we continue to increase our dependence and reliance on technology and social media respectively. As I believe the title is intended to foreshadow, it shows us a dark reflection of ourselves. The show eloquently brings to light how future technologies can make our lives immensely better, but as history has shown us, and as is depicted in the show, immensely better can easily become immensely problematic.As for my taste in shows, I appreciate developed characters and plot randomness or unpredictability. Charlie Brooker I applaud thee because the characters are consistently fully developed and you can never pin down where the episodes are going to go. The character development leads you to easily empathize with the various situations the series puts them in, and by the end of the episodes you'll find yourself evaluating their decisions as if they were you're close friends.Brilliant execution, use of technology, and plot development - simply brilliant.",

It's m.o. is poignantly portraying and exploring the role technology is playing in our present through a series of futuristic, somewhat hyperbolized sci-fi scenarios where society has arguably mal-adapted to technological advance. The thing is\u0085 despite the futuristic setting, the show resonates intensely with the now, I guess, as good sci-fi should do. A sample of themes from season one:-How absurdity, grotesqueness, and even violence have been trivialized to the extent of becoming entertainment at times. How trauma, depicted so readily on screens these days, has become something to watch primarily for stimulation. How, in many ways, we've become sadistic spectators or at best desensitized unconcerned bystanders. -How a system that commodifies human life and energy (particularly lower and middle- class human life and energy) i.e. \"a dead-end job\" is maintained by aloof sociopathic elites through the brainwashes of materialism, distraction, and dream- selling. AND how society is complicit in this basically by being satisfied with the comfort of minimal needs being met, no matter how vapid and mundane this renders their life. -How perfect memory, its storage, and recollection can be a double-edged sword. In a society where everyone has a brain implant that records and stores all audiovisual aspects of an individual experience for playback (and projection for all to see) at any moment, what issues will arise? How would you use it? To what extent would you relive your pains, your pleasures? To what extent would you fact-check your friends, family members, and lovers? To what extent would you chase clarity on events that happened outside of your experience, since you know an accessible recording exists in another person? The subsequent seasons continue to tackle various heady and humane issues connected in some way with advanced technology (e.g. hacking, terrorism, virtual/augmented reality, racism, social media addiction, manipulated consciousness). Every episode is its own mental trip, has a twist, and most leave you with a sense of psychological vertigo. This probably isn't a show you want to binge-watch because, again, it isn't a feel good show due to its existential tone (even though it has some truly funny parts and scattered gems in the dialogue). But it IS a show that engrosses your mind and gut, and compels you to watch every episode. I like to think this show is like medicine: sometimes hard to palate, but necessary. I took off a star only because some of the endings frustrate far more than they satisfy which, all considered, might be the point. Great show. Highly recommend.",

How it could affect our living today and in the future. All stories have a basis or common logic and who knows it could really happen to you in the future. You have to be open-minded and understand the logic of technology in order to understand and relate yourself to each story. I think ALL 19 episodes were my favorite ones.

            "review_title": "Great premise and execution, marred by inconsistent world and unrelatable characters",
            "content": "Black mirror has all the makings of something I would greatly enjoy: Bleak, dystopian sci-fi with societal relevance, alongside being the brainchild of Charlie Brooker, whose show Screenwipe I am a fan of. Additionally, the acting is generally good, with some variance (as you would expect with a fresh cast for each episode), while direction, cinematography and editing is on the whole quite excellent. The dialogue usually does its job well. And I had no problems with Black Mirror being harsh and somewhat brutal, I thought that aspect of it worked nicely. In fact, an underdog grim reality sci-fi tale against a sea of commercial feelgoodery is easy to root for.Despite all this, I didn't really like Black Mirror. I didn't hate it, but I enjoyed it far less than I had imagined. At first I couldn't quite put my finger on why, considering all the positives. After mulling it over I found the answer interesting enough to jot down - if nothing else, to see if I'm alone in feeling this way about it, or if it resonates with anyone.I'll go into the two main reasons, as mentioned in the title (I will use some examples from the first season and the Christmas special, so only read on if you don't mind spoilers from those episodes). First up:Inconsistent world: Obviously, a good sci-fi yarn can, and should, make up its own rules about how its universe works. However, it needs to be consistent within those rules. In Black Mirror's case, its setup is a dystopian near/parallel future, in which new technology is ruining human interaction in different ways. Its tone is realistic, and treats its characters the way a social drama would, and not in the way of, say, a larger than life action-adventure.In such a setting, individual and societal action need to make as much sense as it does in our own. However, Black Mirror is written in a way that forces points to come across, while sacrificing believability in its world. Some examples (out of many):In the Christmas special, one of the main characters gets out of jail time by going free, but instead being \"blocked\" by every living person (you can't see or hear any other person). In NO world would this be a lesser punishment than going to jail. At least there you would have some social contact. (by the way, how would he even shop for food? Or do any kind of work?). Additionally, if everyone could just block anyone and it's instantly legal, with a restraining order to boot, the world would be in chaos. And yet another point: The other main character who gets blocked by his girlfriend seems oblivious to the fact that he can easily seek legal help for getting joint custody of his believed daughter, as there was absolutely no reason for him not to have a right to see her. In which case he would quickly have discovered the truth.In the second episode of the first season, the female protagonist is tricked into joining the porn industry, on a live television show. It is done so brutally and tactlessly that, the horrors of reality shows aside, no human audience would accept this sort behaviour (it would at a minimum be devastating for the show's ratings). An audience cheering for this event would be so removed from the ethics of our time that they do not resonate at all, and the scene falls flat.These kinds of inconsistencies within its own premise would, however, be much more forgivable, were they not compounded by the second problem:Unrelatable characters: In almost all of the episodes, the protagonist is painted as someone who falls victim to technology's trappings, and the idea seems to be that without the technology, the protagonist would not end up in the same situation. This is not to say that the protagonists are painted as sympathetic, by any means - but ultimately, the tech seems to take the brunt of the blame for the transpiring events. However, many of the characters seemed to me to be irredeemably malicious on their own, and the tech did nothing other than make it somewhat easier for them to indulge themselves. For example: In the third episode of the first season - which is the best of the lot - our protagonist is jealous of his wife to a violent degree, and would obviously also be so without the memory tech. I didn't feel any empathy for him at all, as his character was, in my eyes, completely irredeemable. Thus, the message became \"bad man is violent and bad things happen\" rather than the intended \"too much technology in society can be a burden\".This problem doesn't limit itself to main characters: In the Christmas episode, two seemingly ordinary officers snicker as they offhandedly expose a soul to thousands of years of mental torture. That's not technology gone mad, that's two individuals completely devoid of empathy. Now, the idea put forward may be that technology would gradually change everyone's nature to become like this - but that's the whole \"video games make kids violent\"-argument all over again, which is boring and merit-less. The tendencies need to be there already, all technology can do is exacerbate them somewhat.In closing: All in all it is a pity that these issues clouded Black Mirror for my part - however, as I mentioned there are many other good qualities to this show, and others who aren't quite as nit-picky with regards to tonality, or simply don't agree that this problem is even there, may find it to be quite a rewarding sci-fi-experience.",

Personally, I find it offensive and distracting, whether it's gratuitous or whether it's important for the plot (I'd rather watch a plot for which sex wasn't important). Given, it isn't graphic and the show's not saturated with it, but it's in just about every episode, which for me pinpoints it as a series theme and a central interest for the writer.Most will probably disagree with me.

Charlie Brooker himself has said that the title is based on an idea that when we look into a black (switched off) computer screen it reflects a dark shadow back to us. This shadow form accurately reflects the darker recesses of the human mind as depicted by the show's protagonists. Episodes vary dramatically however this theme is always beautifully maintained throughout. The writing is so intelligent and thought-provoking to the point where the message stays with you long after viewing.

We're fixated...ensnared like a fictional cobra's dizzy-eyed hypnotism. Interesting factoid: Earth's atmosphere is comprised of Nitrogen and Oxygen. But, did you know that when organisms pass away, the bodies decompose into the fertile, rich land-creating nitrogen in the soil and even in the vast, cerulean blue that makes up 75% of our globe. Plants are able to utilize this process and power life itself. Humans, animals-we learn to crawl, talk, walk, run, sprint, walk again, slowly strafe, slow our breathing-then rest our eyes after seeing and experiencing a good life; a personal history that could fill countless novels.As we come and go, the seemingly countless black mirrors scattered across every inch of our planet continue on. Newer, faster versions are created every year-unlocking a limitless amount of information, automation-even redefining what convenience and \"one sec... here you go\" means. Are we headed towards a Skynet takeover? Well, yes, in part. Only a small part. It's much more than an artificial paradigm shift. It's about the journey towards arriving there-and humanity is the centerpiece; the protagonists.Charlie Brooker has created and curated a not-too-distant glimpse at where technology could one day, realistically, be. We all hold the all-knowing Doc Brown and young, exuberant, multi-faceted Marty McFly in dear regard, but that vision was even was undersold by a few miles. The future will be brighter, far more advanced, far more spectacular-with a Blade Runner wildcard factor: If we continue to progress towards AI dependency, it'll be our downfall.Is it laziness? Sure, I like using the remote, too. Is it scientific exploration? Thank you, Mr. Kubrick. Is it a lift hill on a futuristic roller coaster-once reaching the apex-will come rocketing down towards the ground at breakneck speed? Stay tuned you theme park junkies you.In the fourth season of Black Mirror, a few, albeit, \"disparate episodes\" exist that delve further into the soul and mind than other entries. I like to think of Charlie's Brooker's structure as a flawless symphony. You have bridge compositions that ease the mind into a trance, before the big numbers etch their way into our hearts-slightly altering how we process the world around us; our life. A spiritual cleanse. The beauty and power of art.The National Anthem plays with the sickness social media has plagued across each one of our devices. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook all hold the power-with the strength in numbers-to move mountains, figuratively-or perhaps, literally? What seems like an internal country crisis (dear Princess Savannah being captured and ransomed), morphs into a global, social phenomenon. This notoriety causes one of the highest, most prominent figures in the world-and the UK-to (yes, let's say it together) \"give it to a swine from behind.\" Brilliant, humorous, but such depth in the message.The Entire History of You is a dangerous, raw exploration into each moment of our lives being digitally preserved and available 24/7 for near-instantaneous playback. A super-powered DirecTV Genie with an infinite SSD. Would 911 have been prevented if security and world police agencies could see every single moment in our lives before boarding any plane? Would crime as a whole be lowered? Or-even deeper down the rabbit hole we go: The truth is twisted behind your back, until one day you subtly take notice to nuances that seem off with a significant other, close family member-whomever. You obsess-like playing a dark-caped detective. Replaying through things with \"this person\" until your suspicions drive you mad. Every time you approach this person, they make you feel like you're unjustifiably accusing them, so you briefly give up. But you can't let it go. Something is there, scratching the inside of your mind. Then one day you unearth the evidence and reveal the lie. You weren't going crazy. This person made you feel awful for accusing them, but, in fact-you were right the entire time. I don't know about you guys but this makes me shake with fear.Be Right Back toys with the stretched, dry tear-ducted-emotion of losing someone insanely close to you. IF...technology allowed for a recreation of this loved one-based on their \"social posting personality\" and interactions via email, would this appease us-or hold our natural grieving process in a wretched circle of hell. We'll never truly forget our parents or god-forbid a spouse passing too early, but we do have to move on to an extent. If not, we'll ironically trap ourselves in a hell matrix.USS Callister reminds us that bullying is bad, and creates a path towards suicide-or possibly worse, a stealthy, grotesque psychopath. Technology as a whole is utilized best here, in my humble opinion. Not only is this a standout episode to get all your nerdy fanboy friends into, but this disparate installment plays with Star Trek themes without ripping out Star Trek itself. It's far too smart for that move. The notion of transforming a life of fandom to that of a toxic villain is powerful and all too true example in a world of comic book film adaptions. Don't forget: Evil, maniacal men can wear the \"good guy's uniform\" in a gold statue worthy performance.Hang the DJ is all about the advancement of technical algorithms and how this now contributes toward two people meeting, falling in love, and defying traditional norms and expectations. We've all had flings that we knew from the beginning would someday fall apart. For Frank and Amy, they knew from the get-go that it was each other or nothing; no living. A pure romantic entanglement, that for one hour defies the Black Mirror DNA. It's a stroke of genius. A flair for the dramatic; a love story that \"hits home\" to each one of our lives. For me, Hang the DJ rounded the bases multiple times. A dating app isn't just an app. It's a simulation within itself where 99.8% of our digital replications choose one another nearly every time. Thus, when the real world us meet, the app's digitized versions of ourselves have done their job; have made the sacrifice so the real could be together. This episode is designed around one arching theme: To cheer for true love. No cheesy popcorn here. I mean it. We may have ever-changing, ever-expanding technology, but that doesn't change the chemistry and power of the deepest human connection: love. Or does it?If you find yourself not agreeing with my assessments and positioning, then you've missed the point entirely. This is a love letter to a beautiful schematic that holds its own against all other comers. We're stuck within a sack of non-original creativity-for the most part-so when unique, original creative ideas come to fruition, it's truly art, and why we write, play music, paint, dance-or do what we do.",

Directing: the type of emotion and passion pulled from every single actor is just incredible; camera work seamless. Consider that each of the original six episodes were directed uniquely, the result across the series is a real achievement. Acting: take episode one's PM: Rory Kinnear playing the part of Michael Callow. He hit the mark so fantastically, and on top of that the supporting cast in that same episode all conveyed such incredible feeling. Empathy was basically thrown at you through their eyes - extras included. There were so many great performances, but one in particular by Lenora Crichlow as Victoria Skillane in episode six, deserves mention. As the primary character with complete focus throughout, her efforts were Emmy worthy. Summary: so surprisingly good I was truly blown away. A series like this does not come about often.

I have never seen anything similar. Each season contains only three episodes but this is a very real case of quality over quantity. I cant recommend this enough, if you haven't seen any work from creator Charlie Brooker you are in for a real treat. I look forward too see what ideas are install for the remaining episodes.

They were original, and had likable characters, yet the endings made me angry. In \"Playtest,\" it was just annoying that he died. Same with \"Shut Up and Dance.\" Hector was very likable, Kenny, eh, but it just infuriated me when that the anonymous guy leaked the video after he had obeyed everything he had said. That totally ruined the episode for me. As for \"Hated In The Nation,\" the fact that the bees killed 375,000 people made me very angry. They worked so hard to save individual people for most of the episode, and then the bees end up killing thousands. It was just a waste of time for me. I suppose these bothersome endings are intentional, for there were other annoying ones in other episodes as well. The show is still good despite this and I hope season four contains episodes with not so annoying endings. The show is well thought out, well shot, and has great acting, so for that I give it and 8 out of 10",

So many twists, sometime predictable but still surprising to an extent. Every single episode is thought-provoking.Some people will like some episodes more than the others, depending on how much they relate to it. If you have been thinking so much about the subject of death, you will love \"San Junipero\" (literally the only episode with an actual happy ending). If your interest lies within the realm of detective/ crime genre, you will adore \"Playtest\" and \"Hated in the Nation\". \"Fifteen Million Merits\" is all about the entertainment industry and \"Nosedive\" will get you choked-up a little if you are an Instagram-freak.For me, this is one of the best things ever came out in the decade.",

While each episode presents a different world with different characters, all of them have a common underlying theme - the dark side of technology. In this review, I am going to discuss aspects of this TV series that makes it my favorite of all time.Firstly, the show has the ability of presenting a very depressing, dystopian world that could actually happen in present time. This aspect makes the viewing experience much more terrifying. The characters presented are also three-dimensional and have a lot of nuance on them. This makes the audiences care and feel invested on them. Moreover, the high production values adds an extra layer of realism to the world since it looks very realistic. Additionally, the stories teaches a lot of moral lessons that audiences can learn. Last but not least, the great cinematography presents a visceral experience as every shot is composed beautifully, with a slow creeping camera movement and many wide shots.It is a revolutionary piece of television that will stand the test of time and be remembered years from now.",

The first episode turns from what appears to be a lighthearted comedy to a explicit horror short in the span of 40 minutes (If I can remember correctly).This formula however is often played throughout the rest of the series and there is lack of surprises from then on. The viewer can imminently tell from watching one episode of Black Mirror that the next will structure in the same format, the same message and nothing else new added.San Junipero is by far my favourite episode out of the entire series, as it shifts the current themes played throughout the episodes of possible dystopians and anxieties we have towards future technology into something more positive. It allows to viewers to be aware that whilst the idea of communication online\nand the lack of human interaction face to face is a frightening thought, it elaborates on the better outcomes and persuades a message that sometimes you meet the unlikely friendships and relationships that would most likely to have never happened without the help of technology.",

Which ruins he fabulous writing. Like asking Picasso to paint your Mum... pointless and a waste of time for a genius. Yes I know maybe 3 of them aren't about twitter. And some have good story lines up until you go, oh it's about twitter again. If this show makes you question your beliefs in society. Then your a moron to begin with. But if you just enjoy its cos colours on the TV. Then good enough. Seriously let down by Charlie. But I know he doesn't care (good for him). Will watch the next series probably but if it's just about having a futuristic version of google glass on you at all times I'll probably be disappointed.

I can without doubt say that this is the most heartfelt and sad series i have ever watched and after days i'm still thinking about each and every episode!Must see 10/10",

            "content": "I love Black Mirror. Its been one of the best shows on TV since it began. (Can we call it TV now?) Not every episode is perfect. But its always entertaining and thought provoking. Its never lazy or formulaic. Its always imaginative and provocative.What I don't understand is that it seems people are quite down on Season 5 and I don't get why. Sure, I would not say any of them are as good as the very best episodes like San Junipero, White Christmas, Shut Up and Dance etc. But also I wouldn't say any of them are as bad as the worst.Smithereens was the best of the three IMO. Andrew Scott was superb as always. And the story was heart-wrenching. But its the Miley Cyrus episode that seems to be coming under fire the most. Now I'm no Miley fan, but I thought she equipped herself well in this and was perfectly cast. One thing people seem to be saying is that this episode 'Rachel, Jake and Ashley Too' was cliche and a trite portrayal of the music business. All I would say to that (and I work in the music business), is that those criticisms come from people who have forgotten the idea of a metaphor. Yes, if the story was just saying Rock is real and Pop is contrived then that would be both a lazy cliche and inaccurate. But to assume that you would have to ignore that Charlie Brooker is never that simplistic and never that lazy as a writer. So think harder, dig deeper and perhaps you will find more than meets the eye. This series is not, never has been nor never will be for lazy viewers.",

            "content": "Black Mirror, for me, went through a different phase each season. I will use these phases as building blocks to review the series as a whole. Start-up: At this point, the series was new, wild, very confronting and, unfortunately, completely unknown to the outside (read: non-BBC) world. Everything was right. The creator had an idea and he made it happen on the small screen. In my opinion, the best episodes were created in this season for just that reason. While underrated, the brilliance caused the series to earn a second season. Growth: This is when I picked up on the series because it got better and more reviews overall. I really enjoyed every episode except the very first one and I could only hope for more brilliance from the creators. The writing was excellent and the concept was still incredibly cool and unique. Maturity: The series achieved its peak with the White Christmas episode. The show got a broader fanbase and Netflix decided to throw money into the concept to scale it up to six episodes a season. This was the moment I, and with me probably many more, got very excited for the future of the series. However, the new episodes were still enjoyable but every fan knew this was not the rebellious and brilliant series it used to be. It lost its touch with its core, which mostly showed in the unusually happy episode San Junipero. Don't get me wrong, that episode was brilliant, but not as 'Black Mirror' as the striking episodes in the beginning (like Five Million Merits) used to be. Decline: I watched the fourth season right when it came out, and I let it sink in for a few months before I wanted to write this review. There was not a single episode that got me on the edge of my seat, and there was not a single episode that really got me thinking. What I loved about Black Mirror was the challenge it gave us to look differently at (all our behavior with) technology. However, this season, more than ever, let the good guys win, had inexplicable and unreasonable plots (instead of technology, it were the people causing bad events) or it was outright not 'black' at all (Hang The DJ, which I will review separately because of its wasted potential). For me, Black Mirror has ended. It was great as long as it lasted. But every great concept like this was great because it was what it was at the time: a niche. A niche talking to a specific audience that wants to be challenged. When Netflix wants to produce more episodes in a shorter time window, it comes at a cost. The cost of the niche that I valued so much at the beginning of the series. So right now, it is time to find a new niche series to enjoy.",

This is the odd, but all-too-foreseeable kind of society Black Mirror \u2013 Episode 1 \u2013 \"Nosedive\", focuses on, forcing viewers to contemplate a life like this, a life where even the coffee boy at work, rates you, and you him.Bryce Dallas Howard plays the main character Lacie; a cutish, bouncy, overly-fake woman, who scrapes her social rating up from a 4.2 to a 4.5 by being overly nice and overly helpful to everyone she meets. 4.8 is pretty high, and belonging to the elite of the elite, is pretty unattainable for Lacie.Like Facebook, people have their own online accounts where whole lives are broadcast for all to see with the use of captions, slogans, and photos. And accompanying these pages is a massive rating in the top right-hand corner, that is forever updating itself to reflect your social success or your social awkwardness \u2013 how people have rated you, using a five star system.Alice Eve plays Naomi; a very successful blonde socialite who has a rating of 4.8 \u2013 and hers is a rating that never drops below that. Her online presence makes it seem that she lives a perfect life, and as she is about to marry the perfect man, she will also have the most perfect of futures as well. She and her fianc\u00e9 do not have any friends with a rating below 4.2 \u2013 that would be an absolute social faux pas in her opinion and in the eyes of many others.As it goes \u2013 high-raters stick with high-raters, and low-raters have no choice but to socialise with fellow low-raters, for high-raters will not accept them in their social circles. It is a very abstract, but kind of realistic analogy for society's current climate \u2013 people socialising with people with the same kind of social status, and excluding anyone who doesn't fit their mould, per se. However in 2017 rating people using our phones isn't something that has started trending as of yet, so let's just hope that this concept doesn't filter into real life any time soon.As a lover of concept shows I would give this episode a rating of 4.8, meaning that it was pretty damn good.",

Every single single scenario feels absolutely plausible, and when it doesn't, it's only because of this coating of sarcasm that makes itself obvious to the spectator. The casting is perfect.\nWhat I love the most is the fact that every single episode becomes absolutely captivating after maybe 20 minutes, and never stops from there. I don't see this as a science fiction show. To me it feels like a social experiment, where they basically created a sandbox in order to play with the flaws of humans, showing that no matter how much technology evolves, we're still the same.If only I could say that about the entire series.After White Christmas, the stories lost their meaning. You can still enjoy the very forward thinking implementation of how humans would react to new tech, but it definitely feels more plastic. It's politics are mostly gone, and only present in very cliche narratives. This doesn't apply to everything though, Hang the DJ and San Junipero are both beautiful examples of how much they can play with your emotions in a productive way.Give this show a try.

The only extra star I gave it was for the actors attempt to save a criminally bad script.",

If a few boring scenes come one after the other, I lose interest. This problem is of course not because of the series but because of me, but unfortunately, a lot of moments like this have happened. Everyone was saying 'Really good series, mind fu **, you have to watch' ... I won't say that I'm sorry I watched it, but I won't say that I was overly thrilled. I was expecting 5 seasons of Shutter island-like episodes, and in the end I got a few above-average episodes (I'd like to single out Shut Up and Dance and maybe White Christmas)\nMy rate is like this because the actors were outstanding, some ideas were well worked out (but some were a bit unfinished).IMO:\nIt's not a mind bending episode if you finish an episode before discovering what actually happened. Mind bending is when the ending is shown and revealed, but you still don't know what the f happend.",

Where every once in a while a BB-episode will end with a truly shocking event, every single one of these Black Mirror-episodes feels like one big shock. (Then again, they only make 3 episodes per season!) The material is such an accurate reflection of the time we live in and is so condensed that the stories are hard to shake off for quite some days after viewing. Again, very well written.

This glitter that make you feel like it suppose to be within the 'quality' rankings. Actually this is kind of similar to the general idea of 'Black Mirror'. I have to be honest, it is pretty hard to stand here and say \"it is not good TV\".I did fall in love with the idea of the memory cheap, I think that this one is very reflective to the general idea of this series, and it implements it pretty well. It is not entirely out of the reality to say that we could fall for this one. The possibility of seeing time, back and forward, seems pretty functional. More than that it is not very far of what we have now.My primer issue with the series is the fact that in my opinion it is a bit too judgmental. Too subjective. Also, I find it degrading the human kind, not very sensitive to realistic human needs, such as real person to person relationship. I always believed that technology can hypnotize one, and blur our senses with it's presumably perfection. But assuming that a person would alternate human relations for machine, is a huge clich\u00e9'.I also find it a bit exaggerating with our technology possibilities, but this is not the case for criticizing here, since you can never know, and that is why science fiction is here for.Some of the characters were seem to be a bit too edgy between good and evil, such as the judges in the singing contest. At first I though maybe it's suppose to be an exaggeration of the situation with a taste of symbolism, but the endings made it clear for me that it was suppose to demonstrate a realistic future story.We don't need to go too far to speculate what will happen if we'll keep on running with the current technology, the present reflects quite well the disadvantages of advances, we can just look around. Just need good pair of eyes for that.... probably a small use of the brain would be necessary as well.I am very sensitive about this subject, because I believe with all my hurt in self limiting of technology to prevent this culture of running after transparent satisfactions.",

The sci fi aspect became very limited, the stories quite boring and if those episodes were from another TV show, I wouldn't even continued after the first one. I don't need to see new episodes every year if this is the result, I'd prefer waiting few years if that would give me the good old depressive and filled with anxiety and hopelessness of the first seasons.

I guess it depends on the expectations of each viewer and how the seen would be interpreted. Personally for me it is one of the best series I've ever seen that makes you think over lots of things, like where the society is heading towards and how technologies are bound to collapse with human nature. If you are on the other side rates or just about to watch the series, I'd like to give some of my personal hints that hopefully would explain you why it is so highly rated and what could be the way to understand it:don't take the plot for granted and don't try to take the direct story straight forward, usually the true message is more subtle or between the lines;because the message is not so obvious, some commentators do complain they don't get this series. But one of the key points of this series - make the viewer think (about it) and have the freedom of the interpretation of his own. This said, if you're planing to watch it for a relaxed romantic Friday night - consider somewhat else. This series requires attention, it is not meant to have adventure type fun - it's meant to make you think.when watching the mainstream plot don't focus on how real it is or how likely it is to happen. It's not. And it's not the key point of the stories. For one thing - it's Sci-Fi, by the nature of the genre it cannot be real. Plus it can be exaggerated in order to help portray the \"hidden\" idea.(spoiler ahead) as an example, many commentators complain about first episode that this is totally unreal or that it was absolutely disgusting to watch therefore it's crap. But what is the idea behind that episode, what is the focus there? PM who's forced to do the indecent act? Or maybe the spectators/viewers who are so indifferent? Where is the line, what is decent nowadays, how far one can go showing and another observing? There are Jackass type videos where people may put fireworks in their butt naked asses, or prank by pulling down girl skirts publicly in the streets, harassing people, or news channels showing bloody, dead, disassembled bodies from war/blast zones and where's basically nothing covered or untold anymore, people cast videos of killings of their own suicides... Is this happening? Yup. Does any of it surprise you? Should it? Is all of it decent or disgusting? Have you noticed how the understanding of \"decency\" and \"privacy\" is changing with the time? How numb, insensitive people have become to things compared to the past. And how triggers to enforce feelings, like empathy, are becoming more and more stronger? How people nowadays go more extreme: more extreme news on TV, more extreme video on Youtube in order to have the \"shock effect\" and attract viewers. So how long will it take till we'll be watching PM having an act with a pig while having a nice cold beer considering it to be normal or maybe have an awakening? And that's just one moment in this episode. Another quick one - PM was a victim but did anyone care, like really care? Do we always care for victims? Is it \"show that you care\" or \"do as you care\"? How sensitive the society it to the pain of others? There's much more, but I will leave it for you. Just start asking all sorts of \"Why...?\" questions and spend time thinking over the answers. That may be the way to finding a discovery of your own.",

Some are about insects, others might be about outer space. The only common theme is the natural world.Some of these episodes leave you full of hope for what will be possible in our lifetimes. Most of them leave you worried. Although I would say that overall they paint a bleak picture of what's coming, they would best be viewed as a reminder that we humans often fail to anticipate the ultimate consequence of our actions and discoveries. They show us that we can find ourselves in situations where we as a species walked inexorably into our own doom, unable to stop our march.Such instances have already occurred in history, an example thereof would be the development of nuclear weapons. Although their existence is a threat to human life, it seems that for the time being we are unable to get rid of them. Think about it. They are not a virus, we have the capacity to destroy them, but our current political standpoint makes it hard for it to happen. Fussing with human genome has so far been avoided, but we have the technology and we only need one country to open this Pandora box. Same thing with AI. It seems that there is no way to stop the advances in AI, as it is advantageous for every country to invest in it, and countries that don't will be left behind. I don't think we have the capacity to even make a pause and think a bit, because there would certainly be someone else pursuing it, so we all walk inevitably to the further development of an evermore capable computer intelligence.We live in a world where it is impossible for each of us to see the bigger picture as the specialization we are subjected too only allows us to be experts in a tiny area of knowledge, and this series alerts us to the possibility of unimaginable pain that we are going to be able to inflict on ourselves in a future that we will be able to see during our lifetimes.",

After emotionally tearing you apart, psychologically intoxicating you, and even after intellectually stimulating to the point of lunacy, you will still be looking forward to watch an other episode. However, you will only be marvelled that each episode contains different characters, setting and plot. This certainly happened to me and I couldn't stop thinking about how a future that seems so distant in the episodes, could actually be the state of humanity in 10 minutes. Maybe this is the reason why Black Mirror is so good. It leaves you to think what happens after the episode has finished and your screen has turned black. Turned into a black mirror itself.",

This is an anthology series in which you take each episode separately. Further, so many have missed the messages behind the episodes. This series does a great job and showing the relationship between technology and psychology. Several episodes dive into deeper meanings of psychology and humanity. This is what I enjoy so much about this series, it is thought provoking. This is not the kind of series to watch and be simply entertained. You have plenty of that on TV. This series is for you to think. Hopefully, if you have found yourself not enjoying that first episode, I implore you to watch several other episodes. It gets even better. I especially enjoy the entire history of you, fifteen million merits, white bear, San Junipero, and men against fire. These are such great episodes.

If you're new to the show, don't be put off by the first episode. First of all, it is probably the least Black Mirror like episode, but also consider that just because it is disturbing (as anyone in their right mind would say), it does say a lot about the people using that technology. Currently as of October 2018, there are 4 series out and series 1 and 2 are purely based in England and series 3 and 4 are mixed between England and the United States (although sometimes filmed elsewhere). The tone of the show definitely changes, but not necessarily in a bad way, however the American episodes seem to be somewhat glossier made though don't have quite the storyline that the English episodes have. For series 5, I'd like to see some more money spent on those episodes based in England. The episodes are consistently well thought out, though sometimes \"a leap of faith\" is required in the odd episode as the concepts don't fully add up if you scratch beneath the surface. It does however provide excellent drama. This is up there with 'Breaking Bad' for being a well written series with ideas that are there to challenge our ways. A lot of people give a lot of credit to Charlie Brooker, but I'd also like to add Annabelle Jones and other contributors. If you watch it and feel that you can't watch any more as it is too sick, give it a day or two and watch some more.",

This piece of art here, deserves much more of my attention, and I mean a lot more. Currently I am in Season 4, Episode 3, but I have plenty of reasons to write this review. I accidently started with season 4 episode 1. Didn't know what the hell was going on, but it was good so I decided to watch Episode 1 season 1. And it was an entire different story, a different setting. At the end of it, I was just blown away. While I thought that the entire series was based on what I saw in s4 episode 1. It showed me how powerful these episodes are, that even one single episode could make me watch an entire TV show of it. And that's what Black Mirror delivers, it delivers great mini-movies. Black Mirror tries to hold a mirror infront of you, or someone around you. Some of it may confront you with personality traits that you own. It also shows that science evolves faster than our own instincts and how to deal with science when it's combined with desires in general. Making us question if technology is a step forwards or a step backwards. If you haven't watched Black Mirror, then wait no longer! You have no idea how great this TV show is. It's a rare piece of art that is hard to come by. The only thing that will be saddening for me, is what the hell will I watch after this? To me no other TV show can actually compete let alone be compared to what this art is.A big fat 10/10 for me!",

My opinion at the end of the episode - very well crafted but definitely SOULLESS. I decided to not watch another episode of Black Mirror. So this friend of mine tells me to watch White Christmas because this is the best episode. Broke my promise and watched it. Definitely a step up in ingenuity, however I have the same problem with the LACK OF SOUL of this show. Personally I don't think I'll ever watch another episode of Black Mirror. Bottom line if you want an ingenious type of show that is basically devoid of any type of empathy and all around SOUL - then maybe this is for you - you will probably enjoy the cold and dark ideas of this show.

            "content": "... And I'm enjoying every single second of it.\n Introduction For a long time, we, entertainment consumers, have been fed relatively conservative content steadily. For a while, Parent Guiding certification (PG-13, etc...) had been enough to the majority of mainstream production companies out of ''risky'' markets such as R-rated movies, TV-MA shows and the likes, because the consensus was that they were missing out on full market capitalization with their content ; Making movies/tv for a part of the market was less lucrative than targeting broader range of audiences.  However, today, because of the abundance of media content, we see a market that is split into multiple sub-genres with a loyal following that will often barely venture out it's own personal preferences, if at all ; If one of those sub-genre gets a large enough representation, However Niche and unusual it is, Content is gonna be produced and producers will capitalize on the market opportunity. \n \n What we get is a bunch of ruthless TV shows, like Black Mirror, like Game of Thrones, etc... Shows specifically engineered to satisfy our own sick desires and to fulfil our most deranged fantasies. The human mind is twisted, and companies like Netflix and HBO have understood and capitalized on it. \n \nAnd you know what ? I'm Grateful for it ; I came for entertainment and that's exactly what I get\n  Review Black Mirror, is a built on a bold concept. At it's core, the show takes contemporary concepts and technologies, enhances them and builds realistic, dystopian-societies, set in the near future, around those technologies. It's purpose is to demonstrate that technology and power are not good nor evil. They are simply tools, used as an extension of the wielder's will. ANY technology can and WILL be used for Creation and/or Destruction given the right circumstances. Being an Anthology series, it gives the show the ability to visit a lot of different worlds and societies. As a sci-fi fan, the opportunity to explore as much individual, unrelated universes as possible, each containing their own set of characters and stories to explore is a feeling that can't be explained. The show can be enjoyed for what it is, an explicit demonstrations of the eventual problems associated with modern day technology through dystopian societies closely resembling our own, misusing enhanced version of the devices we use everyday. In that sense, it plays as an original Sci-fi, Drama, Thriller with a lot of plot twists.\n \n However, It can also be enjoyed for what it represents, and that's the best way to enjoy it in my opinion. It's fascinating to see how a lot of the things we take for granted and assume is harmless or to improve society and human condition is merely a perspective, and the show makes a very good job a demonstrating that point ; I've never been more scared of X-factor, Facebook and Brain Electrodes...\n \n What's interesting is that even though a lot of these world feel incredibly alien, they still feel somewhat familiar and instinctive, because they are built around how the human race dealt with a concept or technology in the past, leading to such extreme changes in comparison with todays society, even though, they are not set that far appart in time. \n \n What's amazing, is that every one of those societies is a possible outcome for our own human race. The problems and dysfunctions at the root of each dystopian societies portrayed in Black Mirror are based on current issues, and the way we do or do not deal with them will help shape tomorrow's society into what could be an aberration of it's former self, as shown in Many Episodes of Black Mirror. I personally enjoyed the lack of a regular cast that appears in every episode. I think that ongoing character development associated with a recurring character in a TV show encourages lazy writing, because they can always change something or add some flash-back to fix an issue with character/plot. Being an anthology series, each episode is a definitive, final version of a story, including it's protagonists. It also plays as a motivator for actors to give good performances, as they only appear in a single episode (for the most part). I was also pleasantly surprised to see a lot of quality, established actors. The best episode of pretty much every season as been the finale, which to me, indicates that the show's producers are in touch with what makes their show successful and good, especially in an anthology series where the finale's appreciation is not influenced by plot cliff-hangers or events that have been built-up for a whole season. This means hey are likely going to be able to replicate their formula for years to come, and that they didn't just get lucky. On top of that, the Show's success could attract big name actors as the format of the show is not overwhelming on an actor's calendar This is the TV show I've been wanting for years without knowing it. I've seen so many movies/tv-shows that presented original, intelligent, ambitious concepts, but ended up compromising what made them special to comply to social conventions. Swapping their bold eccentricity, mid movie for sheer, bland normality. Thankfully, that time has come to an end we can finally see how alien, twisted, and scary the world could be or have been, with a push in the right direction.",

The characters is really intense and have been appealing enough to leave a mark despite having around an hour of screen time. The stories are well written, and the direction is par excellence. Not to forget the cinematography, it never fails to attract, yet is a bit not equally good in a few episodes. The solo one hour episode with no relation to any background story nor requiring an explanation ultimately immersing the viewer in the story makes this show stand aside.This show has indeed been one of my favorites and every episode has portrayed the sad yet actual face of our society which how in future could turn out to be a nightmare. This series also shows the beautiful impact of trchtechno on human lives, how it being crucial can some day turn out to be a bizzare spoilt mistake.

Sharing and hearing opinions about the episodes is the best, because people notice different things and have different takeaways from each. It broadens your horizons and gives you a new perspective on life and the future.SEASON 4\nIt's a shame it had to go mainstream and everything is now feeble and watered down for the masses. I know it can be f***ed up at times, but I actually watch BM for the bizarreness and the pig f***ing.Half of the episodes just didn't make sense (memories from DNA?) and the other half had weak twists or flat endings. Before this season, everything was outrageous, but believable and maybe not too far off into the future. Now it just doesn't make sense.I expected more from BM this season and it didn't live up to it, but it's still the best show I've ever watched.\nFavorite Season: 3\nFavorite Episode: Shut Up and Dance (Radiohead, duh)",

            "content": "My choice for the film review is Black Mirror - British science fiction anthology television series created by Charlie Brooker where the series are not related to each other by plot, actors, time or place of narration. According to Brooker, all the subjects unite only satire on the way of life that is prevalent in the modern society. The cross - cutting theme is the influence of information technology on human relations. The series shows the modern life of mankind and all the problems that technological innovations bring to people's lives. In each series, people can recognize themselves. Black Mirror shows the world where technology burst into human life and took a solid place. Without computers, TVs, laptops, phone and other electronic devices people cannot imagine their lives. This kind of technique is called the \"Black Mirror\" of mankind. The World Wide Web has captured the billions people in its networks. Social networks swallowed the youth up. And it has already reached the point close to the situation where people cannot see the difference between reality and virtuality. During watching Black Mirror, person will see a realistic picture of the modern world, where people are ruled by technology. In order to clearly show the world with its own norms which is shown in Black Mirror, I will provide as an example one of the episodes of this serial which is called \"Nosedive\" - Series 3, Episode 1, where the whole life revolves around the rating in the social networks. High rating gives you a discount on the purchase of the real estate, luxury seats in an airplane, and the possibility of rapid career growth. The rating defines to which social class person belongs to; the higher ratings person has the more respect, kindness and privilege he receives. But the issue is that people in that world are ready to go on with a strained smile and fake feelings all their lives and forget about sincerity only in order to make their ratings to be on the top. If draw the parallel between our world and the world, represented in the episode \"Nosedive\", it will be obvious that there is a huge difference in the ways of living. In these two different worlds people have different concepts of norms of behavior; what is normal for \"Nosedive\" world, it is abnormal for our world. For example, if we make friends for the reason that we love them and enjoy the time spent with them, in the world from the series people are communicating with you only because someone has the high ratings in the social network. The significance of the ratings in the social network is so high, that the world became feigned in all senses. These kinds of norms which are being followed by the world from the \"Nosedive\" episode are abnormal for the world we are living in. Norm it is a standard of appropriate behavior, but since different societies have different standards, it can be concluded that they follow different norms which could be abnormal for others but normal for themselves.",

There is no order between them.\nFor example, the episode \"nosedive\" the most realistic in the series, show a fictive world where everybody gives a rating using their phones.\nI like this episode because it seems crazy to live in this world, to depend of the rating for the work, activities, earn apartment ...\nIf you have a bad rating, you can't do this things.\nBryce Dallas Howard who's playing the main characters gives a fantastic performance.\nConcerning the realization of this part, the director wants to show us a perfect world with a catchy music and pastels colors.However, \"Hang the DJ\" is less interesting than the others, because it seems too long and too confuse. The plot talks about only a date between two persons.\nThe ending of this part doesn't come across convincing.In conclusion, I really recommend this series because there is a twist on every episodes. That's what makes this series unique.\nIt will change the way you see the new technology.\nIt's a must on Netflix, don't miss it!!!!",

To at least put some sense into that time invested, I decided to write my first (as far as I remember...) review here:This show is not for everyone.You need to be intelligent to enjoy this show.\nIf you're not ready to deal with seeing a man having sex with a pig, even if it's only in a fictional TV show, don't watch this. If you already have watched the first episode and got scared away, this simply wasn't right for YOU.\nIt helps to have some experience in still getting the point of a story despite of very disturbing scenes.\nYou could use at least a rough overview on technology trends to understand this show.\nDon't expect a story spanning several episodes. It doesn't, and that's INTETIONAL!\nThis is not a documentary. It's fictional. It uses \"unrealistic\", exaggerated elements.In my opinion, this show is outstandingly brilliant!I'm a software engineer, leading a team responsible for user interface development for machines aiming at innovation leadership. I can relate closely to many of the technological aspects Black Mirror deals with. Yet having watched up to S4E4, this show is a perfect match to what a person like me might expect from such a show.Black Mirror is very versatile in it's settings and moods, while I can see a lot of references to, or at least I'm often reminded of shows or movies I've seen. This makes it easy to dive deeply into each episode, even though they're so different.For me, personally, it's mentally stressful to see bad things happen to children. Even if I know it's only a fictional plot. So, for example episodes White Christmas and Crocodile were hard to take for me. Just be warned. On the other hand, I really, really, really like the chilly winter mood. Especially the frosty, yet steaming from underneath setting in Crocodile.Whatever. My 5 cents. I give it a 10. Every rating below let's say 7 comes from the wrong audience which proves the right audience right.",

The most stories approach dark themes, insisting to make a reflection about artificial intelligence and the ethical issues about it. Despite the sci-fi side, we can relate each plot treated with nowadays issues and really see in this memorable TV show a mirror of our society and people's reactions. The viewer can put himself in the character's place and try to imagine what choice would take in each situation.Using a mind blowing scene in the end of the episodes, Black Mirror makes you stop and think about right and wrong, where we will be and what we will be doing in the future, how the technology can affect us.

            "content": "\"Black Mirror\" is a science fiction series that opens a window and lets us peek into a future that seems to be getting closer and closer.\n I\u00b4m a fan of this show since it started in 2011 and despite its acquisition by Netflix in Season 3, nothing has been lost in terms of creativity and every episode of this Season 4 continues to offer us stories in a future that feels more and more present. By the way, this is the characteristic that I like the most in this show, the future is strangely familiar and plausible, as if what we are seeing can actually happen in an increasingly technological world that still keeps much of what we know today.\n Each episode presents us with a new story with new themes and characters, always maintaining the background that characterizes the series, a future that may be more or less black and dystopic and in which we are confronted with the consequences of the use of technology in the evolution of the society and the human being.\n There are always many and complex questions that stand at the end of each episode and insist on staying in our thoughts. Perhaps because of this, \"Black Mirror\" is a reference to the effect of a TV screen or computer that, when off gives a dark reflection of the viewer.\n My favorite episode continues to be \"Nosedive\" of Season 3, which shows a society that lives by the rules of a social network and where the success and happiness of each one is decided by the evaluations given by others (it does remind us of something familiar, does it not? ). \n This season, the episodes \"USS Callister\" and \"Hang the DJ\" are my favorites, the first being a satire to the classic sci-fi shows, full of black humor and that makes us think to what extent virtual clones are conscious beings, and the second a vision of relationships and soul mate search through algorithms of an advanced virtual dating system.Thanks Netflix for having started the year in the best way and I can only hope that this is just the beginning of a 2018 full of such good quality series.\nGOOD - creativity, innovation, black humor, the ability to surprise, reminiscences of \"The Twilight Zone\", thinking the future\nBAD - few episodes\nVERDICT - excellent, a must see",

            "content": "Black Mirror is a show that provides the important modern question that is very meaningful especially in this day and age. \"Can technology go 'too' far?\" To put it very simply, it's sort of a modern form of the Twilight Zone. The show is easier to comprehend if you treat each episode as it's own separate universe. It has somewhat of a formula. Each episode, there is a problem. However, there is a piece of new tech that perfectly tackles the problem. Or so you think. Unseen consequences come with this tech, creating a problem equal to/ worse than before. For a show that sometimes follows such a basic formula, the plot is always fresh, new, and most importantly, interesting and thought provoking.There's a sort of unique feeling you get while you're watching Black Mirror. A mixture of horror along with the morbid intrigue of watching a car accident. A wonderfully constructed car accident at that. The further you go, the more horrified you are, but at the same time, are presented with a plot that unfolds brilliantly. The only preventing me from giving this a 10/10 was the fact some episodes were slightly dull in production. In any other show it would've been a good episode, however in the standards that Black Mirror sets within itself, some were lackluster. Also, this show does not appeal to all. This is clearly visible even in this review section. There are either 8-10 ratings or 1-3 ratings. It's like geometry. You either like it, or you don't. Of course, there are complaints in this review section. A common complaint is about the first episode. In the first episode there is a scene where the Prime Minister is forced to rape a pig. That scene of course was very obscene. And I can imagine a good amount of people were disgusted by that. They immediately saw the scene, exited out of the Netflix and probably ranted online about how bad it was. They accuse Black Mirror of relying purely on shock value alone. This is far, far from the truth. The whole episode was to show how someone can influence a population with a few posts online, and how effective it can be. They essentially criticized Mob Mentality, showing how flawed it really is. If you cannot find a pretty clear message from a television show which explicitly states it's lesson, you're probably a bit to young to watch this show.",

            "content": "Something that I would like to discuss today is the television program Black Mirror, more specifically the episode \"Crocodile.\" Black Mirror is a show that depicts a dystopian future, showing how technologies affect the lives of citizens. Each episode is stand-alone, meaning they are completely independent of each other and there is no overlap. \"Crocodile,\" is an episode which follows architect Mia as she commits several murders to cover up her past crimes. A technological advancement that harvests memories prevents Mia from clearing her name. As a warning, this review will contain spoilers.In one scene, in a shed, when Mia is about to kill the insurance agent, Shazia, the camera cuts to directly outside of the shed, implying that Shazia is currently dying. After a few moments, Mia stumbles outside looking shooken. As you watch the entirety of the episode, you will notice that there is a pattern of what deaths are shown and what deaths aren't. In most cases, the director will show you Mia killing her victims. These include the biker, her ex-boyfriend, and Shazia's husband. All of these victims were men. The two deaths that weren't shown were Shazia and the baby. Is this because Shazia and the baby aren't men? I'm curious as to why the director chose not to show their deaths. Would their deaths be too gruesome to watch? While I think not showing the deaths creates a lot of suspense, the way only certain deaths are shown creates a narrative about what the viewer can handle.A notable feature of this episode is that it was filmed in Iceland. Iceland is notoriously a very cold country with a low population, centrally located around Reykjavik. In many scenes, we see the characters, Mia and Shazia especially, driving on rural roads across the Icelandic landscape, clear of trees or grass. The use of the Icelandic landscape is symbolic of the isolation that Mia experiences in trying to cover up her past. It also symbolizes the danger that exists for her victims, as there is nowhere to run to in the desolate and snowy landscape. Additionally, the openness of the landscape, with no trees to block sightlines, is symbolic of how there are so many eyes on Mia, hence why she needs to commit so many murders to stay clean.",
