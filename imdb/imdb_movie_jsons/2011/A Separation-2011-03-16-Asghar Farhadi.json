            "content": "In Tehran, the teacher Simin (Leila Hatami) has requested the divorce from her husband, the bank clerk Nader (Peyman Moadi). Simin wishes to live abroad to give a better life to her eleven year-old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) and Nader, who is a family man but very arrogant, wants to stay to take care of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) that has Alzheimer. Simin moves to the house of her mother and Nader hires the religious Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father while he is working. Razieh is pregnant but she does not tell her husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), who owes a large amount to the creditors, that she is working. When she arrives with her daughter Somayeh (Kimia Hosseini)at Nader's house, she distracts and Nader's father goes to the street and she goes and gets him back home. On the next day, when Nader arrives home with Termeh, they find Nader's father tied up to his bed and Razieh and Somayeh are not at home. When they arrive at home, Nader accuses Razieh of theft and expels her. Razieh feels offended and argues with him, and Nader pushes her out at the front door. Razieh falls and has an abortion. She goes to the court with her husband and the witnesses are summoned to testify. \"Jodaeiye Nader az Simin\" or the separation of Nader and Simin, is among the best Iranian films I have seen and is a fantastic drama that shows how flawed mankind is, no matter in Iran, Brazil, Europe or wherever. Despite the different values of the Iranian society comparing with the Westerns ones, all the characters are flawed; therefore, the plot is realistic. Nader is a family man that loves his father and his daughter, but commits perjury, is stubborn and arrogant and asks his acquaintances to lie. Simin uses the secret that Razieh had told her to take advantage. Termeh lies to save her father from justice. Razieh is religious and worried with Allah and sins, but she was capable to lie fearing the reaction of her husband. Hodjat is a rude and impulsive man that is violent. The direction is perfect and the acting is top-notch. The story is engaging and believable and differences of cultures between Iran and Brazil are intriguing. I really recommend this film for any cinema lover or people interested in learning a little about the Iranian culture. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"A Separa\u00e7\u00e3o\" (\"The Separation\")",

            "content": "Caught \"A Separation\" in Amsterdam last night, fully unprepared for its greatness. I hadn't been swept off my feet for a while, but this Iranian Hitchcockian drama sucked us in for 123 minutes and left us very, very impressed.I'm mainly writing this review to assure every non-Iranian IMDb-reader that you absolutely SHOULD see \"A Separation\". I will be shocked if this movie doesn't win an Academy Award. The acting is great, and the script is probably the best I've seen in five years. The genius of Asghar Farhadi's story is that it piles on the tension and drama without resorting to fireworks, trickery or shock and awe plot effects. It also manages to perfectly balance the plights of several protagonists. Very few screenwriters have this capacity.If this movie reminds me of anything, it is \"Ladri di Biciclette\" (Bicycle Thieves), which has a similar seemingly \"simple\" story setup. But then \"A Separation\" is much more developed, much more complex, much richer. Go see it.",

Well, anyway it's the best story, the best cutting, the best actors you've seen for long. And few films are that stomach-turning, although there's hardly any physical violence.A wife wants to go abroad. Her husband can't because he wants to take of his senile father. The wife moves and the husband hires a woman to look after his father.And then the screw turns, although most of the story takes place in everyday Iranian life. The center of it all is perhaps the daughter, who is nearly teared apart. But it takes time until you realize that. Anyway, I can almost guarantee you sit the film through, until the final post-texts has passed.So amazingly clever.",

            "review_title": "The Swan Song of Iranian cinema?",
            "content": "Asghar Farhadi's new film after the ingenious 'About Elly' is running for the Golden Bear at this year's Berlin Film Festival and, with half of the competition done and the rest of the program not looking too promising, appears to be an almost inevitable winner. Although maybe it won't for that very reason: Jahar Panahi's repeat inability to attend his jury duties because of Iran's government refusal to issue him a travel permit, a retrospective of his works including the 2006 Silver Bear-winning 'Offside', a variety of other Iranian productions and renewed demonstrations in Iran proper put the spotlight firmly on that country's elaborate, yet constrained film industry. All that buzz may outshine the film's artistic value, and prompt the jury to go for a less favored competitor. I should hope not, for Farhadi manages once again to embed lots of social criticism into a straight-laced, realistic narrative.As in 'About Elly', the story begins rather unassumingly and takes an abrupt turn into a spiral of increasingly dramatic events: Nader and Simin are a couple about to break up over the question of moving abroad, for which they have obtained a permit after waiting for 18 months. Nader, however, has his father to take care of, who is suffering from Alzheimer's. Sirin still wants to leave, but not without her daughter (yes, pun intended) Termeh, a somewhat shy, bespectacled 11-year-old who cannot accept her parents' break-up. She therefore decides to stay with her father, which prompts Simin not to leave the country, but move to her mother. Nader is thereby forced to hire someone to take care of his dad, and a colleague of Sirin recommends the pregnant Razieh. Being deeply religious, she should not work in a single man's household, but her husband has been out of a job for a long time and is threatened with jail by his creditors. Her pregnancy and the necessity to attend to her daughter additionally stress her out. When Nader comes home one day to find his father left alone and tied to his bed, a struggle with the returning Razieh ensues, with catastrophic consequences for everyone around...This is a much more complicated set-up than in 'About Elly', but it allows Farhadi to put a lot of additional information into his film as may be obvious to those who are just trying to follow the story (I hesitate to give examples because the film is as of yet to be released in Iran, which means an open-source comment such as this one needs to be carefully phrased). Much of the action takes place in courtrooms, where judges try to negotiate between the parties without any lawyers present. There's a lot of familiarity, and also a lot of menace, which succeeds to create the same climate of anxiety, accusation and deceit as in 'About Elly'. The realism of the narrative is embedded into a carefully planned scenography which makes almost every shot linger in the memory. And as in 'About Elly' the decisive moment, the one that solves the mystery is omitted in the picture, only to be explained verbally at the very end.What makes me feel even more for this film is the fact that it might be the last film of its kind from Iran for some time. Ali Samadi Ahadi, the German-Iranian director of the comedy 'Salami Aleikum' and the upcoming documentary on the July 2009 protests 'The Green Wave', wrote that the film industry has come to a virtual standstill. 'Nader and Simin' was in development at the time of the protests; since then, regulations have become far more repressive, with even established masters like Kiarostami or Makhmalbaf forced to work abroad, and others threatened with jail and work prohibitions, of whom Panahi is only the most famous example. All the more reason to give this film the credit it deserves - winning Berlin may cause Iran's bureaucrats to reconsider, for cinema is almost the last link remaining to our world. Without film, how could we understand that Iranians are a modern people with issues like our own, and not dangerous fanatics as some media and politicians would have us believe?",

            "content": "-- www.Ramascreen.com --Wow! I didn't have any expectation and that's what probably helped but A SEPARATION is a great drama. Foreign language film or not, this is just an excellent, excellent drama. You can't get a more Oscar worthy material than this. To me what makes A SEPARATION unique is that writer/director Asghar Farhadi takes conflict, secrets, relationships and other elements that we're familiar with and mixes them with the culture, religion and gender elements from that specific region. This film, to a certain extent, lets you in on how the justice system works in a place where some of us may be ignorant about. And it's really not about our way is better than theirs or vice versa, it's just how different some things are done\u0085And this is not just about a divorce or a separation of two individuals The film starts out that way and it ends on that note as well but what happens in between is more of a spin-off story or it stems from when the lead characters Nader and Simin stop being on the same page. A SEPARATION is a very dialogue-driven, a very character driven story, all the actors in this film are marvelous. When the tension is high, they're extremely convincing, I couldn't take my eyes off any of them, especially lead actress Leila Hatami who holds a certain photogenic beauty.On one spectrum, you have Nader and Simin with their daughter, on the other end of the spectrum you have Hodjat and Razieh with their little adorable daughter. Because Simin takes time off from her marriage with the intent to divorce her husband, Nader has to hire Razieh to take care of his father who suffers from Alzheimer's. An incident occurs that escalates into a courtroom drama but there is actually another incident or a card that Asghar Farhadi hides until it's time to show it further on in the story and the way everything progresses and eventually unravels keeps you intrigued. A big part of what draws me in is the film's depiction of Iranian law and traditions when it comes to divorces and allegations. What may be considered murder, how important it is for an individual to see someone swear on a Koran, how a judge deals with opposing alibis. I don't know how accurate it is but it's nothing short of interesting. It would certainly cause debate and discussion among the audiences as to the fairness of it all. And the story goes through those problems and makes a full round circle back to the separation of Simin from Nader. A highly engrossing film.-- www.Ramascreen.com --",

            "review_title": "A gripping and heart-pounding universal masterpiece ... made in Iran ...",
            "content": "\"A Separation\" is an intense and powerful examination of the eternal conflict between human emotions, personal convictions and Law, whether political or religious, and it happens to be \u2013I believe- the best film of 2011.The movie is set in Iran, in an upper-middle class area, and features a series of unfortunate incidents, all guided by sincere and genuine emotions, but that nonetheless end up judged by the Islamic Law. Written and directed by Ashgar Farhadi, the film is a triumph on the field of intelligence as it never patronizes the viewer by pointing a finger on an obvious 'antagonist'. Ultimately, the victims are not innocent, nor the accusers are wrongdoers, and the only 'responsible' is a Law that fails to take into consideration human feelings.Still, Law isn't negatively portrayed as it remains true to its obligatory neutrality, a notion hinted in the very first scene of the film. Indeed, the realism and intensity of the dialog, a back and forth verbal fight between a wife and a husband sets in the very first minutes what would be the enthralling tone of the film. The core of the conflict is not unusual in family dramas, it's about a child custody, Simin (Leila Hatami) wants a divorce because her husband Nader (Peyman Moadi) refuse to emigrate in a country that would \u2013in her opinion- provide a better education to her daughter Termeh, Sarina Farhadi as a strong-minded adolescent yet the hostage of an inextricable situation, even more ironic because the two parents don't want to divorce.But Nader gives legitimate reasons to his refusal: he must take care of his father, an old eighty-something man suffering from Alzheimer disease. \"But he doesn't know you!\" \"Yes, but I know him\", this brilliant exchange plays like the movie in microcosm; it's all about contradictory opinions guided by legitimate emotions or convictions. When the opening scene ends, those who agree with Simin's arguments understand Nader and vice-versa. If there is ever one, that's the greatest achievement of Farhadi's Oscar-nominated screenplay; still, the force of the script enough couldn't have elevated \"A Separation\" to such a universal and miraculously unanimous acclaim. The film works as a perfect combination of writing, acting and directing to such an extent that it could have easily been nominated to more than two Oscars without garnering much surprise.Farhadi's direction is perfect for this kind of narrative as it uses a hand-held camera work in many scenes, as to create the dizzying and uncomfortable effect of documentary-like realism. The film reminds of Cassavetes' naturalistic work in the way it conveys a sort of one-set room intimacy and place the viewer in the unsettling situation of a witness, caught in the middle of a scene, I mean by 'scene' an embarrassing and uncomfortable situation. We just see and watch, and our hearts pound from these displays of aggressiveness, hostility, cries, shouts and thankfully sometimes, love and affection. Farhadi's film is a masterpiece of storytelling on that level, proving that even plain dramas can be as emotionally engaging as thrillers, and the film does it so well that the content can invite any audience to question its own legal system, no more or no less immune from similar issues.Law has been established by men in order to find the truth within the chaotic succession of facts that can speak for two opposite sides, but the genius of \"A Separation\" is that it deals with a particular situation where no one is aware of all the facts, even the viewer is left with some hints and clues, and can only assemble them as the movie progresses. Razieh (Sareh Beyat) is a young religious mother hired as a caregiver for Nader's father. She has a miscarriage and pretends it was caused by Nader's brutality. Nader claims he didn't know anything about the pregnancy and was upset because she left his father alone. The domino's effect introduces the peripheral characters as Simin wants to protect Termeh from Razieh's hot tempered full-of-debts husband Hodjat (Shahab Hossein) who vents his anger on the system, and through his scene-stealing performance paints an indirect social commentary on actual Iran.The film is full of confrontations that are some of the most realistic ever: everything in the dialogs and the acting sounds true and make the whole experience so nerve-wracking that we never know if we're embarrassed to see these lives being destroyed or because the script didn't let us determine which side we're supposed to take. But \"A Separation\" is beyond these sterile considerations: it's not about sides to take or opinions to make, it's about the innate limits of Law. Law is even incarnated by a decent judge who shows some signs of reason and magnanimousness sometimes, and sometimes can't handle Hodjat's outbursts of anger. In a way, he embodies our position as the powerless observer of a situation that goes out of control because it engages a wide range of emotions, sometimes positive, sometimes negative but always sincere, creative a psychological cocktail about to explode if a resolution doesn't come to appease the nerves.The resolution, or let's say, the conclusion, is satisfying because it never betrays the film's 'philosophy' and leaves us with the penetrating sensation that we've just watched a miracle, a modest creation whose emotional and intellectual force spoke some uncomfortable truths about human nature and its antagonism with Law's cold realism. And on the surface, it also features an Iran far from the current stereotypes launched by the infamous \"Not Without My Daughter\", where women aren't all submissive chador-wearers and men macho wife-beaters.(I feel terrible to pollute this review with these comments because they insult the intelligence of the film, which already takes for granted that 'Iranian are normal people' but regarding the actual and scary political context, I guess it's necessary)",

            "review_title": "Iranian cinema lands in the west with a bang. Phenomenal.",
            "content": "I've never seen an Iranian move but the country has a rich movie culture that has broken through with A Separation which won the Golden Bear, best actor and best actress awards at Berlin earlier this year. And I can understand why.Don't go expecting lavish cinematography, this is shot on hand held cameras, or certainly on fairly shaky tripods throughout, often under the harsh glare of fluorescent lighting that throws a watery blue cast over the action at times. But that is highly appropriate because this movie has a creeping sense of voyeurism throughout as the intensely private happenings of a family, and perhaps country, in turmoil steadily build up into a furious climax.The plot is complex to say the least, but one can keep up by fully concentrating on each twist and turn of this micro-thriller.The oppression of the Koran in this staunchly Muslim country carries a heavy burden throughout the film and it's the most frequently used prop as one of the characters in particular, the victim of a central crime, seeks spiritual guidance throughout. It's importance and oppression is palpable.The story concerns the vain attempts of a wife (superbly acted by Leila Hatami) to leave Tehran with her husband to improve the life of their 12 year old daughter. But the husband cannot force himself to leave his Alzheimer's afflicted father behind and so stalemate ensues and divorce becomes the only alternative, this results in a separation and so the father (played to perfection by Peyman Moaadi) is forced to hire a nurse to look after his desperately sad father during the day.One thing leads to another and inadvertently the husband pushes the nurse so that she ends up aborting her child.This sets off a horrendous chain of events that I will not reveal here for fear of spoiling it for you.Suffice to say the tension mounts throughout the movie and culminates in a heartbreaking decision for the couple's 12 year old daughter that is resolved in a way that Michael Hanneke would applaud vigorously.This movie deals with important themes of family loyalty (more than love), duty, the oppression and folly of religion and pride.Without overbearing pride much of the consequences of this film would not happen. Time and again you silently shout at the screen \"just do the right thing and this mess will be resolved.\" They never do.It could almost be played for laughs so farcical are the the situations the main protagonists find themselves in. But this is no comedy, far from it. It's a tearjerker and feels bitterly real, believable and often futile.It's as good as its billing. See it.",

            "content": "It seems that a court room drama could be the best place for Frahadi to recreate his very own world and confront us with a short and somehow faraway situations and incidents in life. We think these kinds of happenings and conflicts would not take place in our lives but with his realistic world and characters they seem so close and possible to anyone. Asghar Farhadi loves to put his audience in place of judge, as his other pictures like About Eli or Fireworks Wednesday and here with no fear he takes us straight to a court room. But the thing is that the judge does not provide any help for us to make a clear judgment and surprisingly makes the situation even more complicated. Yes Farhadi doesn't want us to make a judgment, He makes us watch and observe and leave the theater with a big fork in front of us.It Seems that any single decision creates another world full of forks and not taken ways.when nobody is clearly guilty and the line between black and white is so dim. And again here we are in Frhadi's powerful hands surprised to the end of the movie. You can't leave your chair even for one second because the story never lets you to lose even a single moment. And like a tennis ball we're always being shot from this side to the other. And finally we are the daughter shocked and disable to make a decision. May be we haven't seen or we don't want to see this side of life, where nothing is clear, when small lies and unimportant undone things and unsaid words gang up against us and turn to a big disaster. Frahadi has found his own world and his own language and his own version of life. Something we'd never seen before. We appreciate that. He can easily bombard us with information and surprise us with tiny details that seem nothing but like a snowball rolling down a slope they can form a big drama.",

            "content": "Hearing how highly regarded A Separation was among my IMDb friends, I knew I had to see it. My only question is how on earth did it take so long for me to do so? I can only put it down to being behind with my film watching because of uni, because A Separation is a fantastic film and deserves all ounces of praise it gets and some. That is my opinion though, because I know people will find that it is not their cup of tea and have no problem with that. What was it I loved about A Separation? A lot of things actually. It was a very well made film. The scenery is striking and authentic, and the cinematography is intrusive and relentlessly, but this adds to the impact of the story rather than detracts from it. Asghar Farhadi's direction similarly is supremely controlled. A Separation is remarkably written as well. The writing is intelligent and insightful, avoiding any kind of melodrama or moralising. Not just that but it succeeds also in exploring the characters without any kind of prejudice, and that is including Hodjat. The story is quite a complicated set-up, but compelling and moving. It gives the audience time to breathe, but with the tension and drama that fuels what is happening in the storytelling I found myself never being able to look away. The characters are sensitively explored, and while I've not seen About Elly in a while I do remember that I didn't relate as much to the characters there than I did here. The acting is wonderful, Leila Hatami(especially good), Peyman Moadi, Shahab Hosseini and Sareh Bayat give performances that wholly justified the sharing of the Silver Berlin Bear. One mustn't forget Sarina Farhadi, whose increasing intensity in her acting is what makes A Separation's storytelling and the case it depicts even more engrossing. In conclusion, one of the best of 2011, considering how hit and miss that year was for films that's saying a bit. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I felt sympathy for all the characters, even the threatening Hodjat, full of misplaced rage which often erupts volcanically.

            "content": "Over the years, I have watched perhaps thousands of international films. And, I've come to be impressed by the films of three countries--France, Japan and, surprisingly, Iran. In fact, although I've seen far fewer Iranian films than either Japanese or French, the Iranian films have always been exceptional...always. Their track record with films you can see here in the States is amazing. Part of it is because the nation has produced Majid Majidi--a truly brilliant filmmaker who, oddly, has only received on Oscar nomination and no wins. Yet, easily, he could have won several times with such brilliant films as \"Chidlren of Heaven\", \"The Color of Paradise\", \"The Willow Tree\" and \"Baran\". I have also seen several other wonderful film by other Iranian directors. So, I was quite interested in seeing \"A Separation\" when it arrived at a local theater. And, I am glad I had a chance to see it.The film begins with a man and wife both seeing a judge (or more like a referee) to discuss a divorce. The wife wants to leave Iran (exactly why is never discussed, by the way--an interesting omission) but the husband is adamant--he won't leave his father, as the father has Alzheimer's. This is an odd reason to want a divorce and as the audience knew nothing about the family, it was easy to dislike the wife and side with the husband--especially since they have a daughter who is in the middle. But the wife insists--she WILL leave whether he divorces her or not.Most of the rest of the film centers on the husband. You have to feel for the guy--his wife insists on leaving, his father is in the mid-late stages of the disease and he is having a devil of a time finding someone to care for the man. His prayers seem to be answered when he finds a woman willing to watch him--and at the price he can afford. However, this is early in the film and there is LOTS to come. I'd say more about the plot, but there are so many surprises, I'd rather just leave it to you to see yourself.n The film is great to watch because there are so many surprises and so many situations where people are faced with very tough choices and yet they seem to make the wrong ones again and again--all due to stubbornness. Such simple things like apologizing or even talking out problems--all these seem beyond people. And, in the process, two children from two separate families are stuck in the middle--with HUGE pressures put on them by their parents. As a result of all this, I can guarantee that it's a film that will get you thinking and have a strong emotional impact. It's also a great film to see with friends because I could easily see the film stimulating a ton of discussion afterwords. Intelligent and very complex--the only reservation I have is that the film is unrelentingly sad and tough to watch. I could imagine some viewers just tiring of all this, as it's like an extended Bickerson's skit--without any jokes or levity--just anger, horrible decisions, selfishness and isolation. Sad but profound.",

            "content": "Today I had the pleasure of watching A Separation, a foreign film that has been critically-acclaimed for some time now. What we have here is definitely one of the year's best films. Intriguing, captivating, and ambiguous.I had no idea that this was going to turn out to be some sort of court drama. I just want to first talk about the direction. Farhadi masterfully constructs these characters, and we enter into a state in their lives where we serve as some sort of observant. Even before the actual plot of the film comes along, his tight screenplay and direction leave us trying to astutely observe what is happening around every corner of the frame. We barely know these characters, and yet, tension is arising from the simplest of every-day matters. Why? Why indeed, as it becomes apparent, the film gets more serious in its plot. It is here that the real reason as to why we are observing moments of these characters' lives comes into focus. Questions arise, as to who did what, and who saw what, and who heard this or that. The film takes a neutral ground in all of this, and yet we ourselves can't help but try to memorize even the smallest of details that could perhaps help us out in figuring out the actual truth. The film never judges its characters, which is why we also have to be sort of neutral in all of this, even when we don't want to, even when we think we know what really happened. This is a mystery in the most unusual and most natural way. We are hooked into the film's plot line, and as much as the film won't let us go, we don't want to let go. We want to hang on and catch up with it, and not miss one single beat of what is happening. Such precise and balanced filmmaking.I do want to take note of the fantastic performances. The entire cast is wonderful, especially the three main leads. Not one single moment is wasted in their portrayals. Overall, this is a near-perfect film, one of the most intriguing and engaging films of the year, and the ending serves entirely to what had come before, and is fully satisfying.",

I'm a fan of Kiarostami and Majidi, but I can't really say that I like all of their films. I watched Farhady's previous film (About Elly) about a year ago, and the first thing which struck me was how culturally detached the movie was in its depiction of an event. At the time, I believed this to have been the cause of this director's success. Watching Nader and Simin, however, proved that I was terribly mistaken.Asghar Farhady's obsession with the concept of judgment is once again the driving force behind his latest feature. The life-like depiction of the Iranian courtroom (which is in no way impartial) places the audience in the Judge's seat from the very beginning. The extremely believable acting and insanely complex script compel the viewer to make up his/her mind just like when reading a court case. As for the screenplay, I'm almost certain the events in this film actually happened in real life, because in no way could one fabricate such a chaotically complex series of events, so beautifully woven into a coherent whole.Despite being very Iranian in its narrative style and its depiction of Iranian culture (the sanctity of Family, faith, commitment towards parents and married life), I believe that this film could easily appeal to the Western audiences just like a film by Inaritu or Haneke (although I'm pretty sure it won't be nominated for an Oscar for political reasons).After seeing About Elly, I thought Farhady's success was just a one-time fling, but coming out of the theater, having watched Nader and Simin, I was proud to have another Iranian director added to my international list of favorites.",

Now, it's a film without any nudity, crime lords, drugs or swearing to pin me down for a breathless, profound two hours.What is morally right? What is morally wrong? What is legally right? What is legally wrong? It depends, is the film's answer. And do you know what? I agree. I agree with this answer from a film that comes from the other side of the world, from a country which I perceive to have religion and politics utterly different from mine. Because the film transcends the detail, it just shows the essence of being human. The characters just keep on trying to do the best for them or their family in credible situations which can apply to anyone and anywhere, but the choices they make will conflict at one time or another with some moral or legal tenet. The husband, the wife, the daughter, the old man's carer, the carer's husband, the daughter's teacher, even the judge \u2013 they all want to do the right thing, but they don't. Or do. Or don't. Or do. The beauty of this film is that it just tells the story. It doesn't take sides. It doesn't force on us an opinion on whether the choice was right or wrong. If it tried, I probably wouldn't have liked it as much, because it would have to conflict with some of my own views. Everyone has firm opinions, until life carries you to situations like this film's, and then nothing is black and white any more.For as long as there are creators like the director and writer of this film, there is hope for the independents. A story like this will beat any Hollywood-esque film to the punch. It's flawlessly played and it's technically well done. It doesn't need more to move me.",

Simin has red hair and determined eyes; Nader has an honest face.

The basic gist of the movie is how this moral conundrum affects every person.The movie is now particularly famous because it is the first Iranian movie to win Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Accepting his Oscar last Sunday, director Asghar Farhadi reminded viewers that when there is talk of war, we truly need to see Iran for its great history and not accept a one-dimensional view of it. That was without a doubt the most important part of the ceremony, and \"A Separation\" is one of the best movies that I've seen in a long time. Definitely worth seeing.",

            "content": "Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are a middle-class, modern, urban Iranian couple. They have been married for fourteen years, but they're separating. They were going to divorce, but the court ruled that their situation wasn't dire enough to warrant it. They each have their side of the story. Simin desires to leave their country, as she does not want her eleven-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), growing up under current conditions. Nader, on the other hand, wants to stay so that he can look after his elderly father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), now in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. Their situation becomes much more complicated after an incident, one directly involving the caregiver Nader hired to watch his father during the day. What begins as a simple argument between two people quickly escalates into arduous legal action and a heated battle over what really happened.\"A Separation\" is surely the best film of the year. Apart from being a portrait of characters that are just as fascinating as they are compelling, it's an intelligent and uncompromising examination of culture; within the course of what appears to be a simple narrative, we will have been told a thing or two about gender roles, parenting styles, personal values, the rule of law, and religious beliefs as they apply to present-day Iran. Although not a courtroom drama in the Hollywood sense, it has the superb plotting of a tightly-wound legal thriller, the characters in a desperate struggle to reconstruct a singular event out of several accounts. It is, above all, a timely and universally resonant story of responsibility and truth, the latter of which proves to be open for debate.I want to word the rest of my review as carefully as possible, as the incident in question is dependent on actions that shouldn't be spoiled. Based on Simin's recommendation, Nader hires a lower-class young woman named Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to be his father's caregiver. Deeply religious, Razieh went against her own traditions by applying for the job without the approval of her husband. She resorted to this only because her family is desperately in need of money. There are three reasons why she proves herself the wrong person for the job, although I will only reveal two of them. First, getting to Nader's apartment requires a grueling commute on several buses. Second, she's forced to bring along her daughter, who's clearly too young to be in an environment of a man with Alzheimer's. It's not just a question of exposure to something potentially traumatic; in her innocence, she doesn't see the harm of fiddling with the pressure knob of his oxygen tank.My careful wording will now devolve into maddening vagueness. Someone makes a very bad decision, leaving someone else's life at stake. Not long after, something goes missing. The person it belongs to immediately accuses someone else of stealing, and indeed, this someone else does have a motive. This leads to a verbal altercation, which then leads to ... the incident I've alluded to several times now. At this point, an already challenging film transcends itself by drawing us into a twisted moral quandary. Several pivotal characters are introduced as the incident turns legal. We meet Razieh's husband, Houjat (Shahab Hosseini), who has been unemployed for several months now and cannot speak without resorting to anger. We also meet an upstairs neighbor, who may have witnessed something important, and Termeh's teacher, who testifies on behalf of Nader.Caught in the middle is Termeh, who not only must endure her father's legal troubles but must also watch as both her parents continue to fight. We're repeatedly compelled to ask ourselves which of them truly has her best interests at heart, although that would be senseless simply because it's never as clear cut as we would like it to be. This is the kind of film in which we can identify with both sides of an issue; each character makes valid points, just as each character makes weak arguments. The more we learn about the situation, the murkier it becomes. That's because there's far more on the table than a series of actions.What it really comes down to are the beliefs with which we shape our lives. For Razieh, it's a matter of her faith, to which she is bound. Consider the fact that she's forbidden from touching a man other than her husband; when she discovers that Nader's father is incontinent and has peed in his pants, she must make a phone call to determine whether or not she can change him. For the secular Nader and Simin, it's a matter of personal pride. One will propose a financial settlement while the other will refuse to take part in it, as it will come off as an admission of guilt. They both think they know best, not just for their daughter but also for the situation at hand. By the end of \"A Separation,\" more than one person will be faced with making a difficult decision, one that will depend entirely on their understanding of what they perceive. And isn't that was truth is? Perception? -- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",

Universal human emotion set in an Islamic country. It is difficult for me to pinpoint what the theme(s) of this film. Yes, it begins with a separation of a couple after years of marriage and having a daughter in stake. But that was only a trigger. A trigger to a journey that seeks the boundaries of human existences. A journey where things are not black and white, but somewhere in between. The characters have their flaws but I somehow feel sympathy for them, even for the one who is violent. Perhaps the movie is about asking question what is a good person, in a situation where it is very difficult to be one.",

After it won the Golden Globes last week, you know it is a cinch to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film and most probably win the coveted prize for its country of origin, Iran.\"A Separation\" is about a middle-class Iranian family. In the first scene, husband and wife are divorcing after 14 years of marriage because of a disagreement on migration. Wife wants a better life abroad, while husband does not want to leave his Alzheimer-stricken dad. Caught in the middle is their 12-year old daughter. When wife leaves their home, the husband hires a poor woman to be his dad's caretaker while he is at work. From there, this harrowing family and societal drama evolves into situations you will not expect. The climax and the ending were so effectively executed. You will not want to leave even while the final credits are already rolling.It appears that director Azghar Farhadi is really a big name in Iran, and that he already has previous acclaimed films. I will want to check them out. His control of his story and his actors (who you would not even remember are acting) is amazing. You get sucked into the story, and you will not want to get to the bottom of things until the final resolution. It has an underlying allusion to the conflict between the old and the new customs. It is an interesting peek into the family dynamics, religion and criminal justice system in Iran. I have seen only one other nominee in the last Golden Globe, \"The Flowers of War.\" The scope and genre of the two films are vastly different and is hard to compare.

            "content": "\"Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking together in the same direction.\" ~Antoine de Saint-Exupery The ability to see events from different perspectives is one of the most important elements of a successful relationship, whether it involves a married couple, a parent and child, or a group of nations. Warring parties are always convinced that they have right or, in some cases, God on their side. To them, every action they take is fully justified and every act the other party takes is sinister. The failure to see other people's perspectives is in full view in Asqhar Farhadi's brilliant A Separation, winner of the Best Foreign Film award at the Golden Globes and nominated for an Oscar in the same category. Farhadi does not ask us to choose sides but to observe how decisions made with good intentions and for the alleged benefit of others often have the opposite effect.The film opens in a courtroom in Tehran as Simin (Leila Hatami) speaks to a judge, unseen by the camera, asking him to grant her a divorce from Nader (Peyman Moaadi) her husband of fourteen years. Simin wants to leave the country and take her 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), with her to seek better opportunities abroad. Nader, a bank employee, however, will not leave Iran because of his responsibility to care for his elderly father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) coping with Alzheimer's disease. Even though they have been married for fourteen years, there does not seem to be any hint of compromise. Unable to obtain the divorce because the judge deems the issues not \"serious\" enough, the couple agrees to separate with Simin going to her mother's house and Termeh staying with her father.To help care for his aging father, the well-off Nader hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a pregnant, less affluent young woman with a four-year-old daughter. Whether or not Nader knows she is pregnant will become a contentious issue later in the film. Razieh, a devout Muslim, who has not told her husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) about her employment, is conflicted when she has to change the clothes of the incontinent old man, and feels compelled to ask an Islamic authority if it would be considered a sin. Things become even worse when Nader returns from work and finds his father lying on the floor barely breathing with Razieh nowhere in sight. When Razieh returns home after she claimed she had to do an important errand, an angry Nader accuses her of stealing money and asks her to leave immediately.Resistant to leave, he pushes her out the front door, causing the pregnant woman to fall down the stairs. Events begin to spin out of control when Razieh has a miscarriage and her irate husband takes Nader to court for murder. As the case is presented in a preliminary hearing before a judge, the divide between the families escalates and each person is guilty of concealing the truth in order to protect themselves or a family member. A Separation may sound like a melodramatic soap opera, but it is far from it. It is a powerful, realistic, and beautifully acted drama full of constant tension and uncertainty, a film in which each person must confront the fact that the walls they have erected have not led to nurturing relationships.While the film is not overtly political, an underlying sub-text is the depiction of a male-dominated autocratic theocracy, a political system based on force, oppression and the alienation between gender and class. Eager to enhance their daughter's education, the couple hired Miss Ghahraii, a teacher (Merila Zare'i) from her school to come to their flat to provide coaching for her upcoming exams, but it is painfully clear to see how much more she is respected than Razieh, who stays in the kitchen during family gatherings. As the adults fight over perceived injustices, the children, as is often the case, endure the most pain, conflicted by their love and dependence on their parents and their desire for morality and justice.While Termeh seemingly hides her pain, her face reflects the terrible burden her parents have put on her by their inability to see the world from other points of view, the kind of tragedy that has plagued mankind for centuries. As Farhadi has wisely said \"What I hope is that the viewer will not know whose victory to wish for.\" When responsibility, love, and sacrifice are not present, there can be no victory for anyone.",

How does one give care to a loved one, especially if they're older and unaware where they are (as happens to the old grandfather in this film)? What about how things don't happen on-a-dime, so to speak, but feelings of betrayal and distrust grow eventually, piece by piece? In Farhadi's hands, and through his actors, people are trying to figure things out, trying to make sense of the people around them, about the trust, about people's behaviors, about things that can be taken for granted like love. There's not much, if at all, sentimentality in this approach, which makes it so affecting and effective.This is deeply felt and raw, no punches pulled filmmaking. The intensity comes off the screen in a direct way, piling on as it's a story where there are no clear \"good guys\" or \"villains\" take place. Even characters you'd think are more conniving than others have their reasons and dimensions, like the maid's family.This wouldn't be a script for a screen writing class. It's like life - complicated by what people try to do, when they do the wrong things but try to make them right, and visa-versa. It was also wise for Farhadi to not feature any music in the film until the end credits - it's almost as if we're finally released from the grip of the drama... and yet it's at a moment where we're on edge for what will happen next.Featuring Hatami and Moadi's soulful, harrowing performances, for Farhadi, by the end, he has another story being suggested to tell, probably one too painful to bear. It's about... well, it's about love, and compassion, and faith, not all having to do with religion (though it may pop up, just in the subtext). It's an \"M\" word: 'masterpiece'.",

The wife is asking for a divorce not because she doesn't love her husband but because she wants to leave the country to try for a better life for their 11-year-old daughter. Simin wants to go as well but not at the present time because he's dealing with his father who has Altiheimerz. While the two are trying to figure out what their future holds, they hire a caregiver (Sareh Bayat) who keeps the news of this job from her husband (Shahab Hosseini) and soon all four are in a courtroom. I won't spoil why they end up in a courtroom but I must say that I was really taken in by this film and it's easy to see why its gaining so much praise. I hate to throw out very strong statements about any movie I've just seen but I do feel this ranks right up there with some of the greatest courtroom movies out there but there's also so much more going on here. There's an entire bit about religious values, moral values and what one little lie can turn into. A SEPARATION tackles so many subjects but director Asghar Farhadi does an amazing job at keeping the film moving with raw emotion and passion. Add on some of the greatest acting you're going to see and you're left with a real masterpiece.What impressed me so much was how raw each of the characters were. Everyone had their secrets, their wants and their reasons for doing what they do yet each of them are so well-written and given so much detail that all of them feel like real humans and not just copies that you see in movies. The screenplay gives each of the principle characters their time in the spotlight to let their emotions out on every subject that comes up and it's just so fascinating to watch how one's statement can lead another to take a situation and run with it. The drama in this film is so tense that at times you feel as if you're watching a thriller because it really does leave you on the edge of your seat as you wonder where it's going to go next. I was literally sitting there hoping that the film would move on because of the tension it was building up to how things would play out. It also doesn't hurt that the four leads, as well as the actors playing the children, give some of the most raw and brutal performances that you're going to see. How these folks were overlooked at the Oscars is a real shame but I've always said that awards really don't mean much in the long run when you turn in great work for generations to come.A SEPARATION is certainly a film that lives up to its hype and I think that even the strongest words by the greatest critic really couldn't do it justice. The movie is a real accomplishment that covers so many different topics and looks at one thing in so many different ways that you really can't help but be impressed. The movie is certainly one of the best of its kind and is a must see.",

            "content": "Gripping, tense, heartfelt, powerful, painful, and stirring, Asghar Farhadi's A SEPARATION is an intense drama that captivates like a thriller by boasting astounding performances and a truly compelling narrative arc. It is an Iranian film that centers on intimate domestic issues in the midst of extremely difficult circumstances - a purely humanistic narrative that gets better and better as it progresses, building upon layer after layer after layer of dense situations in which these poor characters are helplessly engulfed within. In creating a plethora of deep emotions that are carried out honestly and never over-the-top by the ensemble's pitch-perfect performances, Farhadi manages to weave together multiple angles that are both morally complex and excruciatingly truthful into each and every one of his primary characters (all of whom exist in the middle-to-lower class) . The plot is patiently set up with its pieces slowly establishing in place in the first few scenes before snaring the audience into a wonderfully played 123-minute thrill ride that places viewers right beside its characters - a feat that is executed through its seemingly naturally-crafted hand- held cinematography in conjunction with genuine acting that rarely calls attention to itself. The film never resorts to flashy and glitzy elements to further its story - it absolutely has no need to - and proves that sincerity in all its forms whether it be in writing, acting, or directing, no matter the budget nor technical limitations, can result in work of the highest quality. To put it simply, A SEPARATION is (personally) not only the best film of 2011, but arguably one of the most impressive lower-budgeted dramas (under 1 million dollars) in the past decade.",

It was written, produced and directed by Asghar Farhadi. The movie stars Peyman Maadi and Leila Hatami as the couple and Sareh Bayat and Sarina Farhadi in key supporting roles. The movie is an all around grade A production and a powerful realistic drama about arguments and pride and how they can easily get the best of us.The movie revolves around Nader (Maadi) and Simin (Hatami) and their 11-year-old daughter Termeh (Farhadi). The three live in Tehran with Nader's father who has Alzheimer's disease. Simin wants to travel abroad in order to provide better opportunities for Termeh but Nader feels obligated to stay in Iran and take care of his father. So when Simin leaves home Nader is forced to hire a caregiver named Razieh (Bayat) to take care of his dad while he's at work. Many more complications and arguments arise when Razieh is hurt on the job.The movie is said to be an honest and accurate depiction of life in Iran but I found it to be a very honest and accurate depiction of people and life in general, showing how similar we all really are. The disagreements that so easily get out of control in this movie are ones I think we can all relate to. The characters in this movie represent so many in many ways. That's where I think the movie's biggest strength is. The acting, writing and directing are all top notch and combine together to give a very real portrayal of human life and how we all interact with each other.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj0JA1sJBzw",

            "content": "\u00a8What is wrong is wrong, no matter who said it or where it's written.\u00a8 Critics have been raving about this Iranian film and after finally getting the chance to see it I can see why they were so pleased with this social drama. It is a very well told story with great performances. Filmed mostly with a hand-held camera, the movie feels very authentic and real. At moments you forget you are seeing a movie, and feel like you are watching a real family with real problems. Iranian director, Asghar Farhadi, knows what he is doing and delivers a near perfect film. He captures a glimpse of an Iranian family and lets the camera tell the story. What at first seems like a movie that's going to focus on the separation between the husband and wife later becomes more complicated and interesting when the main character is charged for murder and we see the way the Iranian law system works. We also experience how the entire situation affects the different members of the family. I also liked the final reveal near the ending as I wasn't sure how the story was going to pay out, and it worked really well. Most foreign films tend to deal with social issues since these movies are cheaper to make and they don't count with the costly productions that Hollywood films have to create spectacular visual effects and action scenes. That is why more emphasize is put on the storytelling in order to capture the viewer's attention. The storytelling here is the center of the movie and we truly care for what the characters are going through. We can relate to these people despite their different culture and beliefs. They have to deal with similar issues that most families need to deal with, and that is what makes A Separation a universal movie.Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are getting a divorce because Simin wants to leave Iran and find better job opportunities in another country. They have been waiting over a year for their Visa to go through and once they finally get it Nader decides he doesn't want to leave the country because he has to take care of his father (Ali Asghar Shahbazi) who has Alzheimer. Simin won't leave without her daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), but she wants to stay with her father since she knows that if she stays her mother won't leave. Simin ends up moving to her mother's home and since she's gone Nader has to find someone that can take care of his father while he is at work. He hires a pregnant lady named Razieh (Sareh Bayat) who stays at the house while he's off to work. Razieh is very religious and she doesn't feel like she should be working at an adult male's home, but she has to take the job since her husband, Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), is in debt and without work. One day Nader arrives home only to find the door locked and no one answering. He finds a spare key and enters his home only to find his father lying on the floor tied to the bed. Nader unties his father and gives him respiration and fortunately he survives. In the middle of the chaos, Razieh returns to the house and Nader is so furious that he pushes her out of the door. The next day Nader is called to court since Razieh loses her baby and wants to charge him for murder. This is where the mystery of what really happened begins as both sides try to prove their point.A Separation recently won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign film and rightfully so because it's a powerful film. It will probably be one of the nominated films for the Oscars, and as much as I liked this movie I still didn't find it as powerful as other foreign films I've seen such as City of God, The Prophet, and The Secret in Their Eyes. This Iranian film is still great, but I don't think it would be on my top 5 list of the year. It's still a strong and memorable movie and probably the best foreign film of the year. The performances are also really great, I really loved these characters and they had real good material to work with. For those people who think everything in Iran has to do with terrorism, then they should definitely see this movie and realize that most Iranians are just normal citizens like everyone else. The one thing that director Farhadi does seem to criticize about his country is the way that the law system works. There aren't any lawyers involved, every man has to defend himself in front of a judge like if they were having a normal conversation. A Separation is a great film and no wonder it became the first ever film to win three Bears from the Berlin International Film Festival. This film is worth checking out, and I would really like to see Farhadi's previous work since I wasn't familiar with him before this.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

The movie tempts us with easy answers at first, suggesting that characters can readily be put into types when we first meet them, only to show us how quick we are to judge when things we learn later on, both about the people and about the things that happen to them, plunge us into shades of gray.There is a lot of plot in \"A Separation.\" Basically good people do bad things -- or if not bad, at least selfish or stupid things. But though there may not be a character in the film who's entirely easy to like (with the exception perhaps of one who sits mostly silently in the center, the biggest victim of the emotional carnage that rages around her), there's likewise no one who it's entirely easy to dislike either. And more than anything, the film suggests that, despite what legal institutions and churches would have us believe, the world for most of us doesn't fall readily into separate boxes for right and wrong.This is easily one of the best movies of the year.Grade: A+",

But it's not just his characters that really grab my attention, it's the themes and narratives that he showcases so smoothly that he only makes it look easy. He brings together a hefty number of universal themes not only of divorce and separation, but also of religion, neglect of responsibilities, and moral inconsistencies.Farhadi also does well with his actors. A talented ensemble cast which includes Peyman Maadi, Leila Hatami, Shahab Hosseini, and Sareh Bayat are all aces in their roles, and Farhadi brings everything they can give out of them, none of them ever being giving mediocre conviction.

That their religious beliefs were so different than ours that there was little hope of closing that gap. That reconciling those differences would forever cause us a chasm. Or at the very least a great tension.When I came to the movie I expected things to go very wrong. The screen writer leads us into deep tension in which most movies would treat differently. The characters treated us with how much compassion there could be amongst us all.If there was a lesson to learn it is that being right can be wrong, and being wrong can be right. Its a paradox that the movie respects the audience enough to come to their own conclusions.It is too bad that the movie could not be nominated for an Oscar as the best film of the year.

Almost as real-life as a documentary, \"A separation\" deals out more issues than you can think of \u2013 family relationship across three generations, social class separation, religion, politics, human frailty, selfishness and forgiving, tolerance and intolerance, rigid stubbornness and insecurity\u0085.the list goes on \u2013 through efficiently constructed scenes and clear, effective dialogue. The performance of the cast is uniformly excellent.The outwardly somewhat complicated plot and proliferation of characters can be deconstructed first into two core families of three. Middle-class Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami), husband and wife, plus 11-year-old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) comprise one. Working-class Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) and Razieh (Sareh Bayat) with a 4-year-old daughter is the other. The link is through Razieh being employed as a domestic assistant to look after Nader's dementia-inflicted father when Simin moves out to her parent's in protest of Nader's refusal to emigrate, placing the aged father's welfare before the daughter's future. A seasoned moviegoer would immediately see the vast dramatic potentials in this family for the script-writer and director.With the other family, the predicaments are familiar: a husband who cannot control his temper fails repeatedly to hold on to a job (remember \"Airport\"?) and turns anti-society, debtors constantly on their back, and a long suffering wife who is pregnant. The key plot element, the conflict between these two families, starts with Razieh's negligence on the job and escalates to her losing the baby and charging Nader with murder, as the foetus is more than a certain number of days old.While I mentioned Rashomon in my summary line, there is no contrived, convoluted plot. The gradual revelation of what really happened is matter-of-fact. The plot line is not the end, but only the means to anchor all the various human issues I mentioned. Throughout the movie, you'll be completely absorbed in the hopes and fears, aspirations and woes of these people, not because they are melodramatic but because they are convincing. And you'll talk about it long after the movie ends.This latest Oscar Best Foreign Film is a must-see.",

            "content": "A Separation is a film from Iran in Persian with English subtitles. The film takes a look at two families through the course of the film and a situation that develops between them. This situation will ultimately test all of them and their families and watching each individual and trying to ultimately piece together as a viewer on whether who is telling the truth, or not is a large part of the film, but by doing so and as time goes by we get to learn more about the characters in the process as they also get to learn and see different sides of themselves that perhaps they did not know were there. A Separation was an emotionally gripping film that takes hold of your attention very early on already and takes us through quite an ordeal. We can see the pain and frustration the characters in both families are dealing with in this film and how a lot of what they are feeling must really be bottled up, or internalized inside of them because each of them has so much stress and confusion going on, that it is hard to imagine them not finally reaching a breaking point. When the conflict between the two families enters the film it is done in quite an ingenious way. As viewers we don't quite see everything, so in trying to make up in our own minds of who is in the right and who is in the wrong, the film never allows us to do that because it keeps bringing forth evidence from both sides. The way these families act and up to their conclusion about how to settle this feud is done in rather a brilliant way also. We have characters here who are very stubborn and want to get back to just living their lives normally as well as characters who are strapped financially, so they may have to decide which move will best suit them. My favourite aspect of all is the devoted part of one's religion and culture playing a large role here as well. With one character wanting to tell the truth, or even perhaps bend the truth a little bit, but unsure of what to do with the situation their family is in and also doing what is right according to their culture and religion. The story told in this film is a story that basically could be told in any country using any two families basically, but I found that the fact that the film is set in Iran, where they have a different way of life and beliefs than say the Western countries made this all the more fascinating. The fact that a families honour and one's devotion to their religion were very admirable qualities. Please do not take what I say out of context when I say that Iran is different from Western civilizations because I am not trying to be racist in the least when I say that. In fact the characters in this film have such a loyalty to their families, their culture, religion and way of life that I actually found it quite admirable and I don't think it would work as well, or translate as well had it been done and told in an American film. The acting in A Separation is all superb from the entire cast. I have never seen any of these actors in previous films, but they all do such incredible jobs with their characters that I hope I will see them in other films one day soon. The amazing script and direction by Asghar Farhadi is utterly compelling. Some may find this film a little tough to watch because of all the grief and heartache these two families are going through in their day to day lives, but for me it was more of an eye opener than anything else and I could really empathize and sympathize with both families with the situations that they were both in. I think that is one of the best things about the script and film. It allows us to feel and ultimately to care about the situation and what is going on in both these families, so no matter what the final verdict is of their outcome and dispute we really do want to see it ended, but at the same time we want both families to be okay and move on to bigger and hopefully better things in life. We are not biased against one or the other, but rather just made to understood their situations and why they behave the way they do and instead of getting angry over these choices they have made we just as an audience feel pity for them and wish that things had gone a different way and didn't have to be this way. The film from start to finish was absolutely compelling and made us care because of well written characters that made us be allowed to identify and care for them. By allowing us to do so, we can look at their situations differently rather than if we hadn't been introduced to them in this way and just flat out did not care. But the thing is we do care and the subject of honesty is brought to the table here and altogether this is a morality play that will have you talking about it long after you see it. This is an emotionally powerful film with superb performances, a captivating and well developed screenplay that involves the viewer on so many levels and we thank them for that. This certainly did deserve the Academy Award it received for Best Foreign Language Film. One of the best films of last year and a true masterpiece and triumph of cinema.",

            "content": "Asghar Farhadi's A Separation is my first experience with Iranian cinema and it for sure won't be my last. It reminds me instantly of a quote said by American director Alexander Payne, \"...I think there may be a problem with a world in which making small, human[...]films is 'an achievement.' It should be the norm.\" Just from this film, I would be justified in saying that Farhadi is Iran's Payne.Here is a wonderfully made film that comes from a country that has been nothing but slandered for the last decade. We constantly hear horrible things are brewing in Iraq, such as suppression, inequality, unrest, and the increasing possibility of nuclear war, yet we see the tenderness and contemporary side of the country, where problems had by typical townfolk will mirror those of someone living in the United States. For a country so isolated and so different, it sure knows what notes to strike to hit home.The opening scene focuses on Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami), a couple who have been married for fourteen years and are now in court filing for divorce. The camera is positioned as if we are the judge, hearing both cases, with interruptions and simultaneous banter from each party. This gives us a great sense of angst, and the facial expressions on both characters are raw and authentic. They are divorcing because of grand contention when consulting their family's future, with Simin wanting to pack up and leave Iran in pursuit of a better life, wand Nader not wanting to leave his elderly father, who is tragically stricken with Alzheimer's.Another debate hovering over both of their heads is the future of their eleven year old daughter, Termeh (played magnificently by Sarina Farhadi). She chooses to live with her father, because by doing so, her mother will not leave Iran, and their family will still be somewhat close. No child, regardless of background or country, should ever need to make a decision like Termeh's.It dawns on Nader that because of work, he will need someone to watch his ailing father during the day. A woman named Razieh (Sareh Bayat) is hired as a caretaker for the man, who has limited his speaking to fragmented words and has now taken the life of a lion, laying in bed and sleeping for much of the day. One day, Nader and Termeh return home to an empty house to find the man lying on the floor unconscious, with one of his hands tied to the bedpost. Nader too discovers money missing from his home and when Razieh returns home, Nader erects an enormous argument which leads to harsh courtroom consequences after allegations raised by Razieh that she was physically assaulted.Razieh is pregnant and is married to the demanding, vindictive troublemaker Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), who only grows more and more demanding and agitated as time progresses. The two couples becomes unraveled by this tragedy, and the film begins to shed light on these character's decisions during this madness, following them on a relentless journey through the complications of marriage and impulsive decisions not meant to cause harm. I could label this Iran's version of Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing, a film where characters are faced with multiple decisions that need critical thinking in order to work out favorably, but I fear that would be an oversimplification.A Separation does not hesitate to dig deep into the separation of ethics, morality, religion, politics, and economics in present-day Iran. Writer/director Farhadi carefully examines the restraints both law and faith have within Iranians, whose lives are particularly foreign and difficult to comprehend for Americans, who are without a doubt living with restraints we do not usually recognize. It's admirable the film doesn't get stuck in stylistic clich\u00e9s, empty-headed aesthetics, and a list of cripplingly undeveloped characters. We see these characters with space and clarity, watching them as they travel along this unforgiving road of confusion none of them should be facing.One actress that is likely to go unnoticed with four remarkable talents taking center stage is Sarina Farhadi's terrific portrayal of a youth caught in the middle of tireless madness. She is not made out to be the precocious tike who knows way too much, but is drawn more confused than her parents, who are caught in the middle of unfortunate circumstance. Much like the facial expressions of her parents, Farhadi's character Termeh holds those of innocence lost and fear of increasingly destructive trouble brewing. The hard part is knowing there is almost nothing she can do to stop it. She is forced to take a backseat while the ugly bleakness of the world drives around a labyrinth of confusion.Farhadi's Iran in A Separation is the kind of nuanced one that must be seen. It shows its characters as humans, and not trigger-happy terrorists. It shows their problems as common, and not in an unconventional way that is impossible for audiences of other countries to not relate to or be unable to grasp. The film is a difficult one to thoroughly contemplate alone, and perhaps it's one of those that is better debated with close friends or acquaintances. Its morally complex and involving scenarios are overwhelming to try and fathom quietly.Starring: Leila Hatami, Peyman Moaadi, Shahab Hosseini, Sareh Bayat, and Sarina Farhadi.

            "content": "This film is highly recommended.Divorce is always a messy business. People who once loved now lash out at each other with an intensity that rivals the pain, hate tends to envelop each word, and every family members' lives are inexplicably changed. Sometimes time can heal the suffering and happiness can eventually be found, but that seems the rarest of commodities. In this year's well-earned Oscar-winning foreign film, A Separation, that possibility seems almost non-existent. Throughout our world, we rely on the court system to handle the legal and monetary matters and are left to personally handle the emotional toll as we access the damage we inflict on each other. Laws are made to protect its citizens from harm or injustice. And yet, sometimes these statutes have an opposite polarizing effect on its people. There was a time, in our own country, when women could not vote, alcohol was illegal, and education was deemed separate but equal. ( Granted, there still are disparities in our legal system, when same sex marriage is not sanctioned, woman's rights are again being questioned, and immigration laws are punishable, but let's try to stay on task. ) Any country must amend the laws and change its archaic rules if its society is to prosper. In this multi-layered drama, the Iranian court system is taken to task in a film so innovative and neo-realistic in its direct approach to a common problem experienced by many families. A Separation presents authentic characters with all of their human weaknesses suddenly thrown into dire situations that totally engage the movie-going audience in such a honest and straight forward way. In Asghar Farhadi's gripping Iranian import, the law sets up deliberate legal and moral repercussion in its separate but unequal treatment of a family caught in an unjust and emotional dilemma.Nader ( Peyman Maadi ) and Simin ( Leila Hatami ) are faced with problems that are tearing apart their marriage. Simin wants a better life for her daughter, Termeh, and wants to move away to another country while her disagreeing husband needs to care for his father who suffers from Alzheimers. Their break-up is inevitable, but the decision to separate leads to some devastating results. Nader hires a day nurse, Razieh ( Sareh Bayet ), an abused and deeply devout woman, to care for his father while he is working, never telling her hot- tempered husband Hodjat ( Shahab Hosseini ) of her plan. This arrangement leads to further complications amid the many secrets and lies compounded by everyone involved. Their strong personal will to survive a legal system bereft of any justice becomes a central issue in this compelling courtroom drama.These are flawed people faced with life and death decisions. The choices made by them have far-reaching cultural, political, and religious ramifications. Director Farhadi agilely sets up the plot and then purposely structures his film so that the viewer never really knows the exact circumstances that leads to the compounding of the issue at hand. His intricate screenplay has a Rashomon influence, as he edits the film to only show fragments of the case from differing points of view. This tends to complicate the viewer's own point of view as certain facts are left obscure and deliberately left to skew the outcome. ( There are some logistical factors that remain unexplained too.)That said, A Separation is still a thought-provoking and hard-hitting film, impeccably acted by its cast, especially Maadi as the proud and stubborn patriarch. Special kudos to Hatami and Bayet as the women caught up in this male dominated culture, trying to make sense of their purpose while protecting the children they love. The child actors also bring a wonderful naturalness to their roles. Farhadi's literate script examines their plight and ponders the ethical and religious connotations that weigh on its characters as they deal with truths and half-truths that, in turn, destroy each of their lives. Sometimes, the truth doesn't always set you free. A Separation is a must-see for any seriously-minded moviegoer. GRADE: B+NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com",

Matters begin to unravel because Simin wants to emigrate \"for a better life for their child,\" and Nader feels compelled to remain at home. Nader's father, played superbly by Ali-Asghar Shahbaz, has advanced Alzheimer's disease, and needs constant care. Ultimately, Simin moves out of the apartment, and matters go seriously downhill from there. Although, obviously, major differences exist between Iranian culture and U.S. culture, the movie is really universal. Without the language difference and the women's headscarves, this film could be taking place in the U.S. No one wants trouble, but once given an opening, trouble finds them. Each attempt to improve the situation brings only more trouble. Even if this type of serious discord has never happened to us, we can see and understand how it happened to this couple, and we can realize that none of us is immune.\"A Separation\" has not only received critical acclaim, but it has been popular with audiences as well. As I write this review, the IMDb rating is an astonishing 8.6, putting the movie within the category of \"Top 100 Films.\" To my amazement, a Rochester, NY reviewer found the film overly long and dull. His additional criticism--the movie didn't deal with Iran's nuclear program, and with the imminent threat of attack by Israel and/or the U.S. Apparently, the reviewer doesn't realize that most people, in most countries, most of the time, are caught up in their own lives and their own problems. When your father has Alzheimer's disease, and your wife has left you, those problems are where you put your energy. Foreign policy takes a back seat. This is a realistic domestic drama about realistic problems. That's its strength, not its weakness. It's a great film, and it's not boring! Don't miss it.",

            "review_title": "Superb Iranian domestic drama and suspense thriller deserves all the accolades heaped upon it!",
            "content": "With the release of the superb 'A Separation', director Ashgar Farhadi has done much to open peoples' eyes that Iran is a much more complex society than has generally been perceived in the West. The film's title might lead one to believe that this story is merely about the separation of a husband and wife but it's much more than that\u2014at times I felt I was watching a Hitchcock-like thriller, with all the attendant twists and turns associated with the suspense master himself.In a sense, the separation between Nader and Simin, the secular middle class couple who are seen at the beginning of the film in a divorce court, is the catalyst for all the stunning developments to come. Because the judge rejects Simin's application for a divorce, she returns to her parents' home and leaves Nader, along with their eleven year old daughter Termeh (magnificently played by Sarina Farhadi, the director's real-life daughter) to care for Nader's Alzheimer's-stricken father.Nader is the film's protagonist and should be seen as an admirable and complex character. Some may view him as foolhardy to continue taking care of his father, virtually on his own, but his decision is a testament to the strength and nobility of his character. Note the subtle scene where he orders Termeh to return a tip to a gas station attendant, after the attendant fails to perform a required service, thus teaching his daughter not only the value of hard work but also to be assertive (especially in a society where women are not always encouraged to be like that).The film's antagonist, Razieh, is also a complex character. She shows up at Nader's house with her young daughter, having agreed to work as a domestic, taking care of Nader's father. Razieh is from a lower middle class background, dresses in a conservation Chador and ends up consulting a religious phone hot line, asking for advice whether it's against Muslim religious law to wash Nader's father. Even when the Iman tells her that she's permitted to do so, she understandably has a very hard time performing such unsavory work.Nonetheless, Razieh uses remarkably poor judgment by tying up Nader's father and leaving the home to keep a doctor's appointment. Perhaps it's her unfamiliarity with elderly people stricken with Alzheimer's, that leads her to believe that such a senile man will be okay on his own, while she leaves the home. It's also quite understandable that Nader ends up quite upset to find Razieh gone and his father on the floor, hardly breathing. When Razieh returns, he berates her, discovers money missing and concludes that she was responsible for stealing it. What Nader wasn't aware of, was that Simin had earlier paid movers with the money. Now it's Razieh's turn to become upset as she's been falsely accused of theft and then makes things worse in Nader's eyes, by requesting her day's pay. We break into Act 2, when Nader pushes Razieh out the door, leading her to accuse him of causing the miscarriage of her baby.The ensuing complications are too detailed to list here but let me say that director Farhadi has done a masterful job in chronicling the day to day operations of the Iranian justice system. Again, it's a nuanced portrait of a Judge who seems almost bored by being forced to sit through one conflicting domestic situation after another as well as revealing an attitude of inflexibility in applying the vagaries of the Iranian penal code. Nonetheless, it's not a complete kangaroo court, as investigations do seem to be ordered and there is a modicum of an attempt to ascertain the true facts.While we do learn Nader is found to have lied to the court when he denies knowing that Razieh was pregnant, even Termeh realizes that sometimes 'white lies' are necessary and perjures herself before the Court, to ensure that her father doesn't go to prison and his life is not ruined.Equally fascinating is Razieh's husband Hodjat's machinations in his quest for justice, which ends up more like a thirst for revenge. Hodjat represents the dark side of the Iranian populace. He's a hothead, who will take extra-judicial steps including threatening Termeh's tutor, who testified in Nader's defense. Hodjat is so menacing that the tutor even changes her testimony which jeopardizes Nader's case. Hodjat still is operating under the mistaken belief that his wife's claims are legitimate but when we learn that Razieh lost the baby because she was hit by a car (while outside looking for Nader's father who had wandered out of the house), Razieh's honor becomes much more questionable than that of her husband. After all, Razieh refuses to swear on the Koran, not because she's ashamed of accusing an innocent man, but because she fears that by testifying falsely, Allah may seek revenge on her and her daughter for her sins.It's up to Simin to finally convince Nader to compensate Razieh's family. While Nader earlier casts Simin as someone who too easily runs away from difficult conflicts, he realizes the only way out is to compromise and pay compensation to Razieh's family. Of all the characters in the film, Simin is perhaps the most thinly drawn. Why does she want to leave Iran? Is it because she's tired of taking care of Nader's father? We don't find out that much about her but when she and Nader argue, the scenes are electric.Justice is finally served when Razieh refuses to swear on the Koran. As the legitimacy over Razieh's initial accusation and Nader's debt to her family is resolved, the subplot concerning the pending custody of Termeh is not. We're left to guess which parent Termeh chooses to live with at film's end.'A Separation' is a superb film which, if it only could be, should not only be nominated for Best Foreign language film but for the Academy's 'Best Picture' as well.",

            "review_title": "The Best Film of 2011",
            "content": "2011 was especially bleak for films in general with the exception of a few. This film however towers over all the few bright lights that emerged and gave it a kick in the chest to bring to life of what has otherwise been a forgettable year. \"A Separation\" is a film which hails from Iran, a country which despite it's oppressive regime has always managed to surprise the world with a few film gems of it's own, and this might be the jewel in the crown. Directed by Asghar Farhadi, the film talks about love, bitterness, sorrow and happiness that befall a family during it's arduous times. In this case the tumultuous period is personified by the separation that the two main characters are going through. This is not because that they are not in love with each other anymore, but because their circumstances and their goals are far apart from each other to achieve any hope for reconciliation. The wife wants to leave for America because she believes that the move will bring hope to their daughter's life. The husband does not want to go because he has to care for his ailing father who is suffering from Alzheimer. Both the causes are noble and are for the things they deeply care about, but it is also tearing them apart and brings forth further predicaments to all characters within the film as it puts into perspective the lengths people will go to protect, not only their families, but also themselves.The film is a return back to grounded realism and the influences to the film can be attributed to Ozu, Satyajit Ray who used simplicity to tell their story to enhance the aspect of reality. The directing in the film uses a perfect pace to piece together the events and the director creates a screen to personify his neutrality, as he engages the crowd to assess what they think. This was a technique used by Ozu with a certain guile which has never been matched, but I am sure even the Japanese Master would appreciate the feat achieved by the director. Farhadi did however use some aspects of fundamental camera grammar created in Hollywood film-making to express the varying reactions to the characters embroiled in it. The writing was ingenious and strayed as far away from melodrama as possible to create a scenario where the screen was inhabited by ordinary people and dealt with their feelings with a certain subtlety rarely seen today. The acting was unbelievable and it strengthened the mood for realism as the director got great performances from Peyman Moadi, Leila Hatami, Sareh Bayat and Shahab Hosseini. Their characters were very different and they dealt with their situations as such but the actors hit the note with their characters to show their desperation, their fear, their love in a way which was believable for them to do so. The star of the film was Sareh Bayat who should be nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Razieh, Nader's father's nurse, and it also brought to screen the genius of the young Sarina Farhadi (the daughter of the Director) who was on screen not because of her father, but because she deserved the merit on her own as proved. All in all, this is a great film and it would be a major crime if the Oscars do not recognize it's greatness simply because it is not in English. Nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Actor and Best Supporting Actress are certainly due unless the Academy loses it's brain once again. A great watch for everyone and if you haven't seen it, see it now so that you don't miss out on what has truly been the film of the year.",

            "content": "I think most people have experienced in life at least once the law of unintended consequences, where a number of moves, seemingly small and harmless in themselves, end up in an explosive and desperate situation when they add up. In this wonderful Iranian drama (I WILL DISCLOSE SOME SPOILERS), Nader and Simin, a middle class, westernized couple in Tehran, are divorcing. Nader, the wife, wants to leave Iran for abroad with their daughter; Simin (an extraordinary performance by Peyman Moaadi) wants to stay to take care of his Alzheimer disease ravaged father. Nader moves out of the house, and to take care of his father, Simin hires Razieh, a religious, working class woman, who is clearly out of her depth in having to take care of an incontinent, senile man. In her second day at work, she leaves for a moment the apartment, leaving the father tied at the bed. Simin soon arrives and finds his father has fallen from bed and is unconscious. Razieh returns, Simin angrily confronts her, he accuses her of negligence in caring for his father and (it turns out falsely) of stealing money, they start arguing and he ends up shoving her from the apartment. She falls and ends up losing her four months pregnancy. When her unemployed husband Hodjat learns of this, he pushes charges of murder toward Simin, and soon there is a huge legal confrontation between the couples. I will not reveal more, but we are less than half ways into the movie, and in the course of the trial, many things would turn out not to be what we supposed at first.Director Ashgar Farhadi intelligently does not take sides, and refrains from portraying one couple as good and the other couple as bad. Nevertheless, I think Western audiences will tend to sympathize with Nader and Simin, whose lives they would find easier to identify with. And Hodjat is such a hothead that is hard to feel any sympathy for him. But almost every character in the movie acts in a very selfish way (starting with Nader, wishing to leave Iran and her family without establishing a good reason). And almost every character would eventually lie to the judge when it fits their need. And it is the working class couple who has suffered the most grievous loss (though whose responsibility this was is not clear until the very end), and it is Simin who is probably the most smug character in the movie, though the movie makes clear that no one meant bad to anyone, and that they ended up up here due to an extraordinarily improbable chain of events.",

The film manages to grasp and reflect human nature which is complex and multi-faceted. You'd be left guessing and predicting the plot while trying to understand the characters and the choices they make. The film also aids us in understanding the roles of religion and culture... and more into human characteristics that go beyond those.

This one finally made it to Dallas and it's now clear why it is not only the Oscar favorite for Best Foreign Language Film, but also received a Best Original Screenplay nomination. It's truly that good ... and powerful ... and thought provoking. I caught myself changing my mind more than once on some of the issues these characters faced.The film opens with Nader and Simin (Peyman Moadi and Leila Hatami) in front of a judge to determine if they will be granted a divorce. Simin wants to take their daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi, the director's daughter) to study abroad. Nader doesn't disagree with the plan, only the timing. He refuses to leave his Dad, who suffers from Alzheimer's, alone in Iran. In a poignant moment, Nader points out that while his dad may not know him, he still certainly knows his dad. This is the first of a recurring theme throughout ... there are numerous ways to look at every issue.When Simin moves in with her mother, Nader hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to be his dad's caregiver. After a few days, Nader and Razieh have a heated argument and he pushes her out of the apartment. Next thing he knows, she is in the hospital after a miscarriage. She files a claim saying Nader pushed her down the stairs causing the miscarriage. The core of the story is the actions of the key characters during the inquisition by the judge/inspector. Nothing seems clear cut and each character's recall and statements vary from moment to moment.A key point is that these are all basically good and moral people. Muslim believers in various stages. None would purposefully sin, yet each is trying to protect something or someone. The script is fascinating in its detail and subtlety. It moves like real life rather than a movie trying to get crammed into a 2 hour window. Written and directed by Asghar Farhad, the film deserves all accolades and acclaim. Let's hope it finds an audience in the U.S. We could certainly use more stories and films like this.",

Furthermore strikingly yet expectedly, the most severe collateral damage has been put upon the two children, the most innocent onlookers of the dispute, the final staring between the two girls are hauntingly disturbing, there palpable wounds which will never heal planting inside both two's memories. Mostly enclosed settings (inside the bourgeois couple's apartment, their cars, the maid's low- end shack, his husband's cobbler's house, the classrooms, police office and hospital) and an almost score-free deployment (which I hardly noticed until the ending), the vortex of seeking for the justice is tormenting everyone who are directed or indirected embroiled in. As an inward- delving essay, it is compelling from A to Z and leaves an unanswered question which literally does not need one since its irrelevant at all after the separation evolves into a bona-fide divorce.All the major characters are potently organized and three of its four (Moadi, Bayat and Hosseini) all finish inside my top 10 performances of the year (sorry Hatami, rounding just outside the top tier), also the youngsters are tremendously great under their more compassion-arousing suits. The film presently is my silver medalist and Farhadi champions the BEST DIRECTOR stature in year 2011. So everything considered, the film has a sure fire to survive through the test of time of vindicating its niche in the masterpiece rank, which is my very sanguine appraisal.

And it also always keeps surprising me that a country, that is considered to be so conservative, keeps on delivering so many great movies, with also often a sort of social commentary in them, such as also this movie carries out.I'm often quite fond of these simplistic but very honest and straightforward type of drama's, that have a real sense of realism to them. You feel that nothing ever gets exaggerated with any of its drama and emotions and all of the characters and situations in it feel very real. But what I foremost liked about this movie was that it surprises. It surprises with its story and this movie can really catch you off guard. You think that the movie will be heading into a certain direction with its story and several of its independent plot lines but then things suddenly change, somewhere around the middle, when the story is taking a 180-degree turn and suddenly the movie starts to become about something totally different. Don't worry, I wont spoil it and say what it is but it is truly something that gives the movie more depth, emotion and tension, which makes the movie altogether an even more intriguing watch.I also loved how the story isn't always telling you everything and you are constantly wondering what is the truth and who is lying and why. This also makes the movie unpredictable and also provides it with plenty of surprising and interesting plot twists, in the movie its second half.It's also dealing with some delicate issues, for an Islamic movie that is. Issues such as divorce and Alzheimers are being handled, while you could also see this movie as one that is criticizing the Iranian legal system, by showing some of its flaws. But it's also definitely not afraid to show the flaws of us, human beings. This as well obviously adds to the overall realism of the entire movie.And it's definitely also a well put together movie, that is also a good looking one. The dynamic camera-work really gets you involved with all of the characters and events and the movie has a pleasant pace to it. There is nothing pretentious or overly artistic about this movie, like perhaps some similar movies often tend to do. It's really being an honest movie, about real people, dealing with real life- but not always ordinary, situations.It's always hard to judge the performance of actors that act in a language I just don't understand but all of the actors in this movie still managed to give me a feeling that their performance in it was really great and very natural. This goes for basically all actors, both young and old.Of course it's true that you need to be into these sort of movies to fully appreciate it but I just can't imaging someone not being taken by this movie.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The movie starts with an argument for divorce between Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moaadi) before a judge in an Iranian court. Through their argument, the main storyline of the movie becomes clear for us so that we become aware that Nader and Simin have been planning to move to a European country to provide better opportunities, as Simin claims in the court, for their only daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi).Although Nader was interested in the idea of living abroad a few months earlier, he refuses then because of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) who suffers from Alzheimer. When, in the court, Simin says to Nader \"your father does not even know you\" Nader answers \"\u0085but I know him.\" Here, the responsibility of a child toward his father is very tangible. During the movie, Simin insists on the idea of going abroad; when Nader refuses, she believes there is no other way for them except to divorce. Because Simin does not live with her husband and her daughter anymore, Nader decides to hire a reliable and responsible nurse for his father. Therefore, Razieh (Sareh Bayat) enters their house as the nurse.On the first day of her arrival, Nader's father forgot to say that he needed to go to rest room. Therefore, Razieh, as a woman who really believes in strict rules of religion, does not like to come again to take care of Nader's father. Actually, she does not want to help an old man to go to rest room and even wash him. On a second thought, Razieh agrees to become his nurse again just because she needs the money. One day Nader comes and sees that his father has fallen from his bed and does not move. He thinks his father just passed away. However, he is still alive and becomes OK after a few minutes. Nader becomes very angry of what he calls \" Razieh's irresponsibility\" because she left the house and there is no sign of her. When she comes back, Nader brawls with her and pushes her out of the house and Razieh falls on the stairs that causes the abortion of her baby and a new challenge for Nader and Simin appears.Nader is accused of killing Razieh's baby intentionally. Razieh claims that Nader pushed her though he knew she was pregnant; Nader denies it. In the court, Razieh's husband, Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), who is a nervous man and does not have any job and has many debts, fights several times with Nader and insults him harshly. Termeh knows that his father is lying because she is sure that Nader heard the story of Razieh's pregnancy when she was talking about it with Termeh's tutor, Miss Ghahraii (Merila Zare'i). She is right! Nader and Simin agree to give some money to them to finish the story democratically. However, Nader insists on the idea of being sure whether he was guilty or not. That is why Nader asks Razieh to swear if he is guilty of the abortion of her baby. Although Hodjat really wants to get the money, Razieh refuses to swear because she thinks she is not sure whether the abortion of her baby was because of Nader or the accident that she had on the same day. Due to her religious beliefs, she does not want to get blood money From Nader when she is not sure whether he is guilty or not.Finally, Nader and Simin agree to let Termeh choose her destiny by saying whether she prefers to live with her father or her mother. Like \"about Eli\", the previous film of Farhadi, the ending of the story is not clear and it is up to the audience to guess whether Termeh wants to live with her father or her mother.There are scenes in the movie that are very impressive: When Nader is washing his father's body, while crying deeply, it shows us how a child loves his father no matter he is too old or sick. In addition, when Termeh asks his father about the reason that he told a big lie to the court, we can understand once more how children monitor their parents' behavior as their reliable role models. In addition, when Nader's father holds Simin's hand strongly which shows that he knows her well and no one, even Razieh, can look after him like the way that his daughter-in-law did in the past. \"Nader and Simin, a Separation\" really deserves to be considered as one of the top 250 movies ever made. In the 21st century, when we are surrounded by thousands of science fiction movies, \"Nader and Simin, a Separation\" is a good example of a real-life movie which can help people to revise their ideas about important concepts like responsibility, love and sacrifice.",

            "content": "'A Separation' is quite simply one of the best films I think I've ever seen. Its a film you can't think stop thinking about, and it seems to live with you afterwards.The film opens with a married couple filing for divorce. Their names are Nader and Simin. Simin, the wife, wants to leave Iran to go to American with their daughter Termeh. She states that she doesn't want her daughter growing up in \"the circumstances\" of Iran. Nader, the husband, says he can't leave because his ill-father still lives with them in Iran. Right in the opening scene, we as the audience are already forced into a challenging moral dilemma. This is the one of many moral questions we are asked during 'A Separation.'Soon Simin goes to live with her mother, and Nader and Termeh stay in their house. To look out for his father, Nader hires Razieh, a devout follower of Islam who belongs to a lower class. One day when Nader and Termeh come home, they find Nader's father on the ground tied to the bed. Soon Razieh returns to the house. Nader forces Razieh and her daughter out of his house.Now it may clearly seem that Razieh is in the wrong. But there is still so much to learn about the characters and the mysteries revolving around this simple event. We learn that Razieh had a miscarriage, and Nader is accused of murdering her unborn child when he forced her out of the house. She claims Nader pushed her and she fell down the steps. 'A Separation' is a very character-driven film, but one thing special about it is its original narrative. We don't see all of what happens, and new pieces of information pop up organically and in inventive ways. 'A Separation' almost plays out as some sort of murder-mystery. In this film, there are no heroes or villains. These are just flawed everyday people. Asghar Farhadi does a great job of bouncing sympathy between his characters. At one point in the film, you may feel strongly about one character, but when you learn something important about them, you feel a different way. Everything is grey. There's no simplicity. And that is why 'A Separation' is a complex masterpiece. Its a film that forces you to determine what you think what is right, and what is wrong.",

            "content": "Iranian director Asghar Farhadi's \"A Separation\" is a truly remarkable film. It's more than a picture about two people who want to leave each other, rather it deals with many things that divide people, which isn't necessarily a bad thing per se - but what divides entails ramifications for either side. On the forefront of course there's the titular dispute between Nader and Simin, two Iranians. Undoubtedly they love each other, but are filing for divorce - Simin intends to leave the country with her daughter Termeh for the sake of Termeh's future, but Nader wants to stay in Iran taking care of his father, who suffers from Alzheimer. While his father doesn't recognize him, his son still does. But is the illness of the father only a pretext for Nader?Thus the moral conflict between the prospects the west offers and - literally - the fatherland, becomes a central theme from the get-go, yes, but it lingers only in the background until the decision between past and future cannot be avoided. The main part of the film features more dividing situations, tense confrontations and a dramatic incident, all of which highlight fractures in Iranian society: fundamentalist and moderate religion clash, middle class and lower class are played against each other, there's the constant fight between modernity vs. tradition, and pride often gets in the way. The film is full of nuances that can be picked up by attentive viewers which relate directly to Iranian life, but nevertheless the picture as a whole is more than just the sum of its parts and succeeds in resonating universally. Shot with hand-held camera Farhadi's film looks and feels real, provides intimate insights on both sides of whatever argument you're looking at and puts the problem right in your hand. What more can you ask from a movie?",

            "content": "I would be hard pressed to come up with another movie that keeps the viewer so conflicted and anxious about the characters over the course of it's run time. There's literally no down time to catch a breather here because virtually every scene involves the principal players bickering with each other, over matters that are not trivial. I was particularly intrigued by the daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi, daughter of director Asghar Faradi), caught between two parents who can't come to terms over mother Simin's (Leila Hatami) desire to leave Iran for a better life, and father Nader (Peyman Noadi), who harbors a strong sense of duty to remain and care for his own, Alzheimer's afflicted father.Following the incident with housekeeper Razieh (Sareh Bayat), Termeh acts as her father's conscience, constantly prodding him with questions about what happened and his culpability in Razieh's miscarriage. Though her best advice is for Nader to tell the truth in court, it was with great insecurity that she appeared before the judge to answer questions about what she knew or had observed or overheard among the various parties involved. She answered honestly about knowledge of a doctor's phone number shared between her tutor and Razieh, but for all that, she was able to evade the question of whether her father knew about Razieh's pregnancy, because the judge never asked her about it. That knowledge about the pregnancy was crucial to the judge's understanding of what happened and how he would deal with the case. So in effect, Termeh did not follow her own advice and was severely conflicted over her decision.As good and as tightly scripted this story was about the conflicts between the parties, the primary thing that bothered me about it was how the plaintiff's side (Razieh and husband Hojjat), consistently talked to the defendant's side (Nader and Simin) throughout the story. Sometimes the conversation was cordial, at other times confrontational. That did not resemble the American system of justice that I'm familiar with, and I can only assume that strictures among opposing parties are different in some way in Iran. Perhaps because each side was operating without an attorney before the judge had something to do with it. Still, it was odd to see how the parties came together to put together a monetary settlement, even if Nader was not going to go along with it.The picture concludes with as much ambiguity as everything leading up to it, and the viewer is challenged to come up with their own interpretation of who Termeh will agree to live with following this ordeal. There are compelling reasons why she would pick one parent over the other that work for either choice, so the question remains, what would you do? I have my idea, but you'll have to watch the film to come up with your own.",

One of the reasons the film works so intensely well is the directors ignoring the outside influences of musical score and cinematic effects, instead relying on person to person communication in claustrophobic confines that drives the story in an almost breathless pace that heightens the drama.Briefly, the story deals with husband and wife Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) who are arguing about living abroad. Simin prefers to live abroad to provide better opportunities for their only daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). However, Nader refuses to go because he thinks he must stay in Iran and takes care of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who suffers from Alzheimers. So committed is Simin to make this escape from the confines and turmoil of Iran that she decides to get a divorce and leave the country with her daughter. Nadar must work at the bank to support his father and Termeh who has decided to stay home in Iran with her father, so he hires a caregiver Razieh (Sareh Bayat) who comes to work with her 6 year old daughter: Razieh is pregnant, her unemployed cobbler husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) is in and out of debtors prison, and in general Hodjat and Razieh represent the agony of the struggling lower class. Razieh cannot cope with caring for the Alzheimer victim, stressors occur, Nader throws Razieh out of his house when he discovers his father's lack of care, and in the struggle Razieh has a miscarriage. The remainder of the film is the struggle between the two couples - middle class Nader and Simin and poverty lower class Razieh and Hodjat. The audience is placed in the 'courtroom' (actually a simple confrontation with a judge) concerning divorce, the accident that turns a miscarriage into an accusation of murder, and the battle between the two couples, which is a battle between classes. Religious issues are raised: philosophical issues are in focus. From all of these incidents we learn more about the current standards of life in Iran than any book has shared.It is rare when a film leaves the audience speechless. This one does.

            "content": "\"The most common lie is that which one lies to himself; lying to others is relatively an exception.\" Friedrich Nietzsche The Iranian selection to the 2012 Oscars, A Separation, is a rich character study of slow-moving catastrophe for a family that just can't avoid trouble. Although the film captures some of the cultural forces in contemporary Iran, it is much more about how individual choices can change everyone. Its Golden Globe and Berlin Film Festival Golden Bear awards are well deserved.A married couple must choose the future but alas not the same one. Simin hopes to go with her husband and daughter to live abroad to improve their life. Husband Nader will not leave his Alzheimer-afflicted father. Divorce is the only choice.Thus begins their journey through the courts, whose judges are prone to invoke cultural and personal criteria in making their choices. In the course of the tightly-framed mise en scene, and believe me both director Asghar Farhadi and Iranian living circumstances make it claustrophobic, other characters become involved in the split so that the courtroom occupies the stage for confrontations with potentially devastating results.Woven into this compact hornets' nest are themes of class distinctions that drive those decisions (one couple is middle-class comfortable and the other is poor), family loyalties (for instance, daughter is forced to lie for dad and to make a choice about which parent to live with), and the secrets and lies that irrevocably shape all lives. A Separation starts with a husband and wife splitting and ends with separations of multiple families.Now that's theater worthy of the big screen, where the smallest decision is writ large.",

Elly, which won Farhadi the best director award at Berlin two years ago and which went on to find release in many territories, it has the potential to engage Western audiences with the right handling. The movie is centered on a couple, Nader and Simin, and their 11-year old daughter, Termeh. Nader and Simin are about to leave the country for good; however, Nader has a change of heart and decides to stay and look after his father who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Simin is determined to get a divorce and leave the country with her daughter, but the court does not find in her favor. Simin goes to live with her mother and Termeh return Politics are ostensibly out of the picture, though the whole premise is based on a middle-class couple's divorce because the wife Simin (Iranian star Leila Hatami) wants to move abroad to find a better future for their 11-year-old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). But that may not be the real reason for the separation.Nader (Peyman Moaadi, seen in About Elly) is a decent man but a stubborn one, and he neglects his wife. Too proud to ask her to stay with him, he lets her move back to her mother's place while he and Termeh are left to look after his aged father with Alzheimer's disease. He hastily hires a poor woman named Razieh (Sareh Bayat) as a daytime caretaker, who signs on without telling him she's pregnant (or does she?). A few days later he fires her and shoves her out the door; she falls on the stairs (perhaps) and has a miscarriage. The rest of the film is a crescendo of tension as Razieh's hot-headed, debt-ridden husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) takes Nader to court for manslaughter. While the intricate screenplay ratchets up tension as it raises the stakes for its characters from scene to scene, its reliance on contrivance might irritate some viewers. Indeed, the conceit of Nader and Simin's separation occasionally appears as a petty battle of wills, something that undermines the weight of other events.after 30 min , new details are added that changes the moral perspective. Rather remarkably, Farhadi's screenplay doesn't take sides with any of the characters; on the contrary, everyone seems equally right and wrong at the same time. They are all caught in a web of pride and ego, morality and religion, money and honor.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: A Separation",
            "content": "You should already know a little bit about the much talked about film by now, with a storyline that's fairly straightforward, betraying little of its layered statements about life, the relationships we keep as well as our individual survival instinct striving to be the fittest in the jungle, coupled with the self motivated, selfish interests we pursue, and all these performed regardless of age, gender or culture. It's what makes us human, flaws, warts and all, that A Separation transcends beyond its celluloid shelf life, and lives on, way past its closing credits, putting up a mirror in front of ourselves, that we see similar values and intrinsic human behaviour that transcends country, language and race, to show how basic and common we humans behave no matter where we are.It starts with an impending divorce, where we face the couple Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) squarely, and learn that their matrimonial life is on the rocks. She wants a divorce given that her husband doesn't want to uproot the family and live overseas in order to provide for a better life for their daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). He on the other hand finds this demand quite unreasonable, given his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) suffering from severe Alzheimer's Disease, and he being the filial son having to care for a parent who had brought him up and nurtured him. Things don't improve in this very long take, with voices escalating and each side relentless in their stressing upon their respective points of view, that it results in a stalemate of sorts, lose-lose to all in what couldn't be a mediation done successfully.Now with his wife moved out to live with his in-laws, Nader struggles with the daily chores, having to take care of a sick elderly as well as tend to the needs of a growing child, that he hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat) through a recommendation by Simin as domestic help, a woman who is deeply religious, and the first signs of cracks appear when she has to call up the religious authorities to find out if she can handle a man she's employed to look after. And the problems extend to her having a hot tempered husband to complicate matters, where Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) is heavy in debt and his being jailed causes what would be the catalyst to a series of events involving his wife's continued employment in Nader's household, Nader's father wandering off because of her inattention, and Razieh being forced out of Nader's apartment by the latter when Nader discovers some ill treatment to his dad, ultimately resulting in a miscarriage suffered by Razieh that Hodjat soon escalates to the courts.Much of what A Separation then deals with, is pretty unpleasant stuff. Unpleasant being that all characters start to rear their ugly head of self preservation, and we witness first hand a lesson on morality and ethics that Asghar Farhadi so brilliantly weaved into his screenplay, and direction that doesn't distract us from his casts' wonderful performances. We also witness, if this is to be believed and true, how the justice system works in Iran, where the magistrate more often than not makes some questionable requests for eyewitnesses, in a process that won't fly in many other courts around the world, since it is subjected to, and very open to corruption and compromise in very blatant ways, providing opportunity to the obstruction of justice or to cover up what would be the truth, meddling in it, and serving to confuse if necessary.But just is how the Truth is defined, is also what makes A Separation such an ace. We don't get to see what the sequence of events is either, and have to rely on accounts by those involved, and other eyewitnesses present. We watch how society is really male dominated, and that certain professions give you an edge in being trustworthy, or how class also plays a part in the decision making process. If you're of reputation, chances are your account will hold more weight, and the converse is true as well. If anything, it is a very pointed argument and case made against how things operate in country, and a call for change since the audience is forced into also making the same decisions based on information, and misinformation that permeates through society, with every party being very conscious about how their account will have impact on the persons they are talking about, and worse of course if there's vested interest in the status quo of certain relationships. The truth becomes how you argue it, and how you define and defend your version, skewed naturally, against other versions thrown in your direction.A Separation is not an easy film to sit through, because it is taxing as much as it is emotionally draining having to deal with so much negativity that the characters display. Everyone is constantly raising their voices to force their points across with arguments getting very long drawn out affairs, and you're bound to notice characteristics you see in others, as well as oneself, that makes it really uncomfortable for cutting so close to home. But Asghar Farhadi forces you to acknowledge the truth in our selves, and by and large A Separation is a very well made film for its solid production, ending it in the best way possible and that's to be open for discussion and discourse. It requires patience and endurance, and is recommended stuff!",

Most movies rely heavily on music to evoke emotion, yet A Separation, with only one piece of music in the end credits, is compelling owing to its realism and a spate of moral dilemmas. We, the audience, are forced to serve as judges from beginning to end. (Please note the first scene in which we look at the couple talking to a judge.) Should we leave behind the father with Alzheimer's disease? Are there any circumstances in which lies are morally acceptable? Is it appropriate for parents to encourage their children to lie? Should a teacher shy away from telling the truth? Are there any problems when we behave purely in conformity with our religion? Has justice been done in Iran? As for the maid's miscarriage, whose fault is it? Herself because of her negligence? Her husband who owes people money? Her employer who allows a pregnant woman to work as a maid? Upon the outburst of the daughter's pent-up emotions, a tear rolled down my cheek. She is just a little girl whose parents separate, whose grandfather is sick, whose father is charged with murder, whose schoolmates gossip about her, whose life is threatened. She has tried to unite her family members, whereas she bursts into tears because of her father's stubbornness, which can be interpreted as Iran's conservative regime telling ties to cover its scandals and controlling its people with the use of religion. Her sadness is heartfelt because of the three-dimensional character.The movie is well cast and well acted. Honorable mention goes to Ali-Asghar Shahbazi, Nader's father in the film. Although he is not a trained actor, he gives a very convincing performance. The two daughters, who act naturally, also elicit great sympathy from the audience.Anyway, I highly recommend this beautiful Iran movie to all of you. It will be one of my top five movies in 2012.Spoiler Warning: Please note that the three family members also wear black at the end, which implies the death of the grandfather.

His camera doesn't judge it just records everything from the necessity to conform to the whims of petty bureaucrats to the way people are willing to compromise their beliefs when it's expedient to do so. The cast is uniformly great. Leila Hatami is superb as Simin, the disaffected wife who separates from her husband because she wishes to emigrate for the sake of her daughter. Peyman Moaadi is the picture of middle class rectitude as Nader, the husband who insists on remaining in the country because he cannot abandon his Alzheimer's afflicted father.

The screenplay was so exhilarating pushing the boundaries of such a simple premise into heart-pounding suspense. The ideology, the general mindset and day-to-day life in Iran was quite informative and fulfills your food for curiosity. Coming to performances, it is near perfect with none tampering into each other's space and doing the best in their zone. A special mention should go to the sweet little girl who plays Razieh's daughter as she conveys a lot through her big expressive eyes and hardly uttering a word. While the divorce story as advertised plays a poignant role, it mostly takes a backseat during the tense drama. Some scenes that were informative or packs an impact > When Razieh calls a religious helpline to check if she could change a helpless old man's pants > Razieh's daughter's eyes conveying and covering the facade of ugly spats > When Teremeh confronts Nader if he lied > Climax tussle between Razieh and Hojjat > Nader's unflinching love and support for his fatherSo simple a premise envelopes such a complex plot",

            "content": "This is certainly one of those rare movies of recent times where both elements of the genre Drama and Mystery shine brightly. The movie starts off with the couple Nader and Simin asking for a divorce over a comparatively light-hearted issue. Slowly but extremely engagingly the movie revolves around serious and religious issues. The truly great facet about the movie's story is that it has sub-plots which are interleaved in a very deft manner such that those eventually accelerates the main plot, which is the separation or divorce of the two protagonists. The other aspect of the movie which really captivated me is the way the director showed the mystery part along with the social drama of relatively upper and lower class Iranian families. Surprising truths are unraveled in the way they should be in a good mystery movie. Kudos to Asghar Farhadi for blending that with the emotional elements like the problems and dilemma of Nader and Simin's daughter. This explains that not for nothing the screenplay of the movie got an Oscar nod.The performance the entire cast is brilliant and just what the situations, created in the movie, needed. From the girl who played Termeh and Shahab Hosseini who played the volatile husband of the maid who Nader hired for household jobs to the lead actors Leila Hatami(Simin) and Peyman Moadi(Nader), everyone more or less excelled in their respective parts. This movie is rich with many cinematic elements which make this a movie a movie-lover would not want to miss.",

            "content": "A seemingly prosaic, mundane drama, A Separation didn't hook many people at first impression, for we're world that goes to the movies for escapism and not to be buffeted under a snow-storm of a ubitquitous quotidian lifestyle, coming straight from the particularly delightful land of Iran. However, this contemporary Iranian drama, when given the chance to, impresses one by its sheer simplicity and strikes a chord of mutual association with the viewers, turning it from a film about family grievances into a microcosm on life itself. The conundrums faced by the characters are not unheard of, their reactions not unexpected and the sequence of events not unforeseen. A Separation is a slice from the pie called everyday-life.Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) decide to call it quits after leading fourteen-years of a married life that has resulted in the birth of a female offspring, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). The woman is clearly more intent on the split of the two. She wants to leave the country, but her husband insists on staying, for he has an Alzheimer's- inflicted father to look after. The court rejects their application, and the impasse provokes Simin to leave Nader and Termeh, to reside with her parents. Being a working man, Nader hires a pregnant, devoutly religious maid, Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to look after the household and his father. However, things soon go awry, resulting in harrowing consequences, as the lives of entirely good people are mercilessly tossed into the storm. The characters, all fabulously acted out, are made up of real flesh-and- blood, who touch a deeply resonating chord. Despite a conflict being the chief motivator for the film, you find it difficult to choose sides, which is a sign of having endearing and genuinely human characters. Unlike most movies, where the central struggle is stretched to unrealistic proportions and the winner can be picked as easily as picking fallen money off the street, A Separation really makes you think as to who deserves your shower of sympathy. And ones you reach that conclusion the movie questions it, repeatedly, till you aren't very certain anymore. The film presents interesting observations on some stark dichotomies - initially one between the poor who work for others and the well-off who pay them. In the highly conservative Iran, the poor lead a desolate life. They must ensure that cleaning a really old man after he has just helplessly wet his pants isn't a sin. She must ask for her husband's permission before she can work at another household. A woman of the middle-class, on the other hand, can abandon her family and live with her parents without a God being there to chastise her. The two lead females, Simin and Razieh, display this contrast with finesse, not merely through their independent lifestyles, but also through the subtleties, like their attire and speaking mannerisms. The other dichotomy is between the judgement of the world from the perspective of an adult and a child. The former knows the ways of the world, and he must act accordingly, regardless of whether it appeals to his conscience or haunts him with guilt. A child, with all his innocence, takes everything at face value, and holds veracity in the utmost importance. This difference is shared by Nader and his daughter, Termeh, and shows just how much things vary with age rather beautifully.The deafening silence in the film resonates of the emptiness prevalent in the lives of each of its characters - a man without his wife, a daughter without her mother, a woman who's lost her child, a jobless man; everyone has a vacuum in their life. What the film captures adroitly, is the functioning of these flawed human beings in the equally scarred world. How we must bend the truth for the greater good, how misunderstandings snowball into disasters, and how a person is often forced to balance too many things on his plate, adopting different roles at different times, because circumstances compel him to do so. Director Asghar Farhadi plants each element into the film with subtle, artistic perfection. There are observations that are passed onto the viewers, despite remaining unsaid. The higlight of the movie remains the fact that A Separation isn't afraid to ask questions. Does an innocuous accident which results in a heart-rendering loss for the poor need to be heavily compensated by the rich perpetrator? I don't even think that question has a right answer.",

            "content": "An astonishing film. The best film of the last few years bar none and possibly the past decade. Why? Like the film's layered characters and ambiguous motives, it is perhaps difficult to articulate why. Perhaps its the twists are turns that deliver visceral emotional blows; in any culture, any language. Arguably, it combines superlative acting, writing and directing all seamlessly. The events are presented almost like court proceedings that mirror the film so you can make up your own mind about which character to side with, which actions are heroic and those which are deplorable. This is art portraying real life, a culture most of us are foreign to but the human needs are the same, life is grueling and ambiguous. What makes it fascinating is how the characters react, what would you do, do you agree? You are asked to be the jurors of the drama on screen. This is a devastating slow-burn of a drama, one in which the audience must participate. It's intelligent drama, but morally complex and opaque, and brilliant because of it.The magnetic and intriguing story appears straightforward but once you start to feel comfortable and know where the story is heading, prepare for some shocks: it brandishes some sharp twists and turns that make you continually think about the characters actions', and their motivations, and the future implications in search for the truth. In fact, as much as the characters attempt to find out the truth, each person it concealing something from one another, almost every relationship in the film has some opacity amongst the inherent trustThe two main actors Peyman Moaadi as Nader and Leila Hatami as Simin must be given their due credit, they are astounding. They both evolve in their characters so naturally and exhibit all the qualities of a father/mother, jaded lovers, carers, struggling against legal and social bureaucracies, probing for the truth and justice. They are neither saints nor villains and lot of the success in the portrayal is how much we see ourselves in them, as humans.It seems unfair not to mention the other principals: Sarina Farhadi as Termeh, also very good as the moral of sorts for the story observing the chaos around, questioning events and (in a clever touch) acting as the audience's conscience. Shahab Hosseini as Houjat and Sareh Bayat as Razieh as the contentious couple who instigate the film's second and substantial appearances in court texture the characters with deep layers, complex, passionate emotions and serve beautifully to contrast the different social classes, stages of family, religious beliefs and simply to create conflict.There are so many layers to the film, how each character is essence is trying to uncover the truth, which we as the audience are discovering at the same time; each person trusts someone else deeply yet is often deceiving their beloved (huband-wife-daughter). How what we perceive (whether truthfully or not) influences our judgments of others and how our ideas on religion and class colour that perception.What is ostensibly a family (melo)drama twists into riffs on father/daughter, father son relationships, class hierarchy, the role of women in an oppressive society, the family legal system and being a full-time carer. Part political-critique, part mystery, social-drama; this is absolutely mesmerising, masterful cinema. I can't wait to see it again.",

This is a high-level, fast-pace drama that deals with many controversial issues covering family, cultural differences, religion and legal boundaries all of which can happen particularly on a daily Iranian life.Acting performances are top-notch. In a modern way of living, decisions are forced to be promptly made, but at the same time carrying heavy consequences, whether it is better to be honest or to lie for the sake of the greater good. Even amongst decent, good-hearted individuals, things can get real ugly due to stubbornness, lack of communication and differences in opinion/principals, and consequences include adverse effects on relationships, family and society. This film encompasses all of that.Especially Termeh's role as the daughter who became the victim within the center of the catastrophic mess and who tried hard to remedy it her own way. And, the law does not favour everyone. Although there is some lack of character growth which was an element understandably sacrificed as everyone is too busy trying to solve various problems of their own, instead I think that is the purpose behind the film, for the viewers to finally look at themselves in the mirror and question about similar things happening daily but did not have time to stop and to contemplate on the bigger picture.

The second meaning relates to the effect this will have on their daughter, who will be separated from one or other of her parents and more importantly from the family unit she has always known. The mother also wishes to leave the country and will need her husband's permission to take their daughter. This is another imminent separation, a cultural estrangement, a break from one's nation of origin. Their daughter is also an adolescent and facing the separation between childhood and adulthood. Class separation forms the rest of the story when the break-up of the central protagonists marriage leads to a series of unfortunate events involving a low-class family.In fact, the theme of separation is almost obsessively imprinted throughout this film, and yet its emotional honesty and dynamic immediacy transcend mere theme. Moreover, as entertainment, 'A Separation' has the intensity and energy of a Hollywood thriller or classical courtroom drama such as '12 Angry Men'.The skill displayed in terms of film-making is never less than brilliant. In the choice of camera positioning, which uses foreground obstructions to spy on the action from a distance, the viewer is always implicated emotionally in the realistic twists and turns of the story which constantly arise from the characters.

They reached to the word \"Guaranty\", Termeh answered with an Arabic word, at this point Nader objected by saying that this is Arabic not Persian, so he offered a Persian word instead.

The story concerns a couple who divorces when the mother wants to leave Iran, but the father decides to stay behind with his Alzheimer's-suffering father. What follows is a compelling drama about divorce and its effect on the people involved, even how it can reach beyond the immediate family. There are many other complex issues discussed, and all of it is through the lens of Muslim culture, which I found fascinating. Thematically, the central issue is about making tough decisions in the context of a culture where religion and government are so intertwined. As far as acting is concerned, it was some of the best I've ever seen. Every performer gave their all, and it felt like I was watching a documentary with real people. This tone was also reinforced by the hand-held camera-work and (until the closing credits) a lack of music. Overall, this is not just one of the best foreign films I've ever seen, but one of the best period. The only minor issue I take is the rather ambiguous ending, but after watching the problems that the characters go through for two hours, it's probably just my personal desire for a more clear-cut resolution.

I love my World Cinema but usually too much politics and religion take over and gets too heavy, masking the story.However, this intelligently scripted (original, Oscar nominated script by director Asghar Farhadi, in the mainstream - that's 1 out 5 of ALL movies that year) soon grips and a personal story that is SO universal, then becomes shaped by Iran's religion and politics. This is done so superbly, you won't notice the join. Considering also that it's in Persian and even the end titles don't have any western writing, it's obviously not made with the U.S and Europe in mind.The story, surrounding the separation (as in the title) of Nadir and Simmin is complicated by Nadir's elderly father needing constant care due to his Alzheimers, making him vulnerable and a liability when he wanders. The couple have a young teenage daughter, who is intelligent, straight-forward and a good kid. The couple are both working, he in a bank.Most of the two hours deals with issues thrown up by these very ordinary, boring domestic situations but as in real life and to all who've been in such, there are big problems dealing with getting reliable care for the old man - and this is where the country's religion and economics come in.Issues on debt, debtors, birth, miscarriage, healthcare, theft, the legal system - even Tehran's traffic are all covered in a most natural and realistic way, leading to a complex scenario that culminates to a heart-rending and impossible situation. At times, it's straggly, as is the filming, which is for the better. Real life conversations aren't rehearsed and the camera looks around like the eye does - not shaky all the time like many modern films, nor smooth, but flitting to the subject being looked at and then holding that, making it all very realistic. The ending is also nicely straggly, too - you'll see what I mean - allowing the viewer to form their own opinion rather than it being neatly pigeon- holed.A Separation is not a film to see over and again; but watch it once and you'll learn more about real life Muslims in their own environment, with their own rules and how they deal with a big Life situation. That piece of drama is worth seeing for itself - that bit's universal as I said - as for the film, the only taint from the west are the added subtitles.",

            "content": "I'm having a hard time reviewing this film. I just can't help weighing my reaction to films against the consensus. It seems shallow, because, the thing is, I found this to be a very good film, but, compared to the general reaction, I found it merely that and not \"OMG BEST MOVIE EVERRRR!!!!\" The film is quite complex. Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) have reached an impasse in their marriage. She wants to leave the country with her daughter, but Nader cannot consider it at this point, because he's taking care of his disabled, Alzheimer's suffering father. After Simin leaves Nader, he must find someone to take care of his father while he is at work and his daughter is at school. Having little money with which to hire someone, he hits upon a desperate, pregnant woman, Razieh (Sareh Bayat), whose husband, Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), is unemployed. Hodjat is the one Nader wants to take care of his father (Razieh is, for religious reasons, not allowed to physically engage the old man when he needs to use the bathroom or whatever), but Razieh must do it for the first few days. Unfortunately, she's unable to handle to huge responsibilities that come with the job, and she quickly runs into some horrible troubles. Those horrible troubles lead to other horrible troubles, and soon she and her husband are in court suing Nader, with Nader counter-suing them. In some ways, the film plays like a really good episode of Iranian Law & Order. That's definitely of great interest, because Iranian courts are quite different than our own (some may say more corrupt, but, honestly, probably not by much; I think a lot of this situation would play identically if it happened in the United States). While the issues presented are quite interesting, and the moral and class issues are entertaining to contemplate, I had some fundamental problems with the story. First, no matter which way you slice it, Simin comes off as a terrible human being. Nader would have agreed to leave with her and their daughter if he hadn't been forced to take care of his father. Presumably, if Simin was still with Nader, she'd be the one caring for the old man. Now, we all know how much that would suck, but Simin really couldn't help take care of the father for a year or two until he passed? Instead, she dumps the entire crappy situation on her husband (and daughter, whom she wants to steal away, too) to deal with on his own. The film never provides Simin with a realistic reason for making this decision, instead treating her like she's being reasonable, just because the director wants to seem unbiased. And then there's the whole issue of the lower class Razieh and Hodjat. Without spoiling the story, I must say, I was always entirely on Nader's side for the whole court case. Sure, he made some poor decisions, but the accusations against him are fairly unjust. The film gives him some baggage when he lies about a key element of the story, but, really, the lies seem pretty minor compared to the other side's lies. It's all very intriguing, but, I must ask, where is this \"BEST FILM EVER!\" stuff coming from? It's very blandly filmed in a hand-held documentary style, with maybe only one or two good shots and edits. The performances are pretty good, especially Peyman Moadi.

Similarly to the way I went into this movie, I will try to leave you as unsure as I was. I was so surprised by this movie. I didn't even know what the ratings were, and I was a little surprised at how incredibly well done the plot is (and everything else). The characters are great. They feel like relatively real people by the end, and its actually kind of crazy. I found myself torn between characters, not knowing who to root for. Everyone is flawed in an incredibly human way. There's no clearly right or wrong character. It's all up to what you think. The soundtrack for this movie is fantastic. Funny thing is, there isn't one, and for the tone of this movie that fits perfectly. Where does this movie falter? The pacing. While it does get really intense, the first little bit is pretty slow. It doesn't help that I wasn't entirely sure what was actually happening. It clears that up pretty quickly, but nevertheless it was there, and it was a problem. Overall A Separation is a fantastic movie. While it's not completely flawless, it sure is close. One other thing that separates it from perfection is the amount of movies that I'd rather watch. While it is still extremely enjoyable, it is also a two hour Iranian drama, so it's not exactly the most fun movie to watch (for an English- speaker like me at least). Nevertheless, it's extremely well done and I still enjoyed it immensely. The plot is fantastic and the characters are amazing, but unfortunately the pacing at the beginning could use some work.

            "content": "I have always been in love with iranian movies since I saw Children of Heaven and The Color of Paradise. I was a little disappointed with Song of Sparrows, from the same director of both mentioned films and neither was I blown away with About Elly, despite its critical acclaim. But A separation reminded me why iranian films are among my favorites.It is true that the director doesn't make it easy for us to take sides, since all characters have their motives and are equally flawed. But I did find myself sympathizing with the husband Nader, which some reviewers called arrogant and stubborn...because he doesn't want to leave his sick father alone and run overseas to start a new life?? Simin on the other hand, seems a pretty selfish and cold woman. I can understand that she was tired of taking care of her father in law, it was quite a difficult job as we can see when Razieh, the new nurse, takes over. But it's obvious there was a bond between the old man and Simin when she was leaving and he gripped her finger and wouldn't let go...How could she not care??Moreover, when Nader was accused of murder, Simin never supported him and used the incident to get their daughter against him. When Razieh confessed to her that the miscarriage was caused by the car accident and not by falling down the stairs, Simin still made him pay the money because she knew it would make it look guilty in front of her daughter and everyone else. That said, I don't think Nader was without fault, he was selfish too...He made their daughter lie for his sake and was very manipulative of her.Finally I want to praise the acting, it was all top notch, but the performance of the actress that plays the nurse Razieh was just spellbinding. She was a desperate, poor woman with a conflicted soul and in pain and she really made sure she showed every detail of that soul to us...WOW.",

A Great And Intense Movie along with a great and realistic script and great direction by Writer-Director Asghar Farhadi, boosted by excellent performances from the whole cast to make this into one of the best movies of 2011.The Story is very good and realistic about a married couple who are faced with a difficult decision, with the Wife Simmin(Leila Hatami) wanting to take their child out of the country to improve their child's life, but the Husband Nadar(Peyman Maadi) wanting to stay and look after his father who has Alzheimers. But things go very bad suddenly, when the maid Razieh( Sareh Bayat)looking after Nadar's father accuses Nadar of being the cause of her miscarriage. The Acting from the whole cast is superb and everyone has portrayed their respective roles perfectly, but i thought Sareh Bayet, Peyman Maadi and Leila Hatami were the standout performers in the movie. The Other cast also did a great job,including Nadar's father and The daughter of Nadar and Simmin,and The Husband of Razieh.The Director has done a great job in directing this movie utilizing a great and realistic story written by himself also, helping the actors with their characters, and looking after the other aspects of the film perfectly to make this into one of the best films of 2011.Amazing Thing about this movie is that it practically does'nt have any background music in between the movie, it is probably what it is due to the great acting by the cast, an excellent story and great work from the director.Finally, i think this deserves the Oscar nods it has got and influenced me to see the foreign movies more in my future, and arguebly one of the best movies of 2011.My Rating: 8/10.",

The religious, societal, and family issues that they go through. Also, what I liked in the movie is that it had nothing to do with the Iranian politics, but of course you will be able to see how the regime affects the people.",

This remarkable opening is impressive, and I can safely say that this momentum is maintained throughout the rest of the film The plot is followed by a battle of morality and self interest. The two couples concerned all react differently to the situation, sparking an interesting character analysis. What seemingly decent individuals would do to protect their honour and self interest, and how far desperate individuals would fight for perceived justice. These complex character portrayals are so engrossing and through provoking. There is not a moment of slack. The ending twist is surprising, and adds to the brilliance of this film. \"A Separation\" is a must watch film.",

At the onset of the film, we have a family being driven apart by the wife's desire to fulfill the family's dream of moving to the United States while her husband wishes to remain in Iran to care for his senile father. However, we are soon spellbound by an enticing, complex story of interpersonal conflicts, legal wranglings, and just a dash of mystery.Indeed, this is an Iranian film but not necessarily a film about Iran. The themes and questions here are universal, and the storytelling and dialogue transcend culture. That said, Iran provides a unique social milieu for the story to develop, and the setting plays a significant part in the plot itself.There is nothing terribly novel here. In fact, we are faced with age- old questions: What really is the truth? How do you define justice? What sets A Separation apart is how palpable the conflict feels. Like a friend torn between two quarreling mates, you will find yourself constantly pulled in different directions.The movie is flawless. It is superbly acted, written tightly, and expertly directed.

Farhadi is highly respected Iranian filmmaker who has in the past ten years gathered over 20 international awards and was this year ranked among Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. A Separation is the story of an ordinary Iranian family. Mother (Simin) believes that it is better for the life of their daughter to leave Iran and move to the west, while the father (Nader) wants to stay in Iran and take care of his sick father. Conflict leads to the separation of Simin and Nader. Then father's new guardian steps into the story. She accuses Nader for a physical attack in which she lost a child. Although story is seemingly very simple, screenplay is definitely one of the best in recent times. Deep, complex, with great characters that are hard to forget and with authentic depiction of lately demonized Iran. Although a good portion of the cast is relatively amateurish, except Leila Hatami (Simin) and Shahab Hossein (guardian's husband), acting is flawless. The technical part is just as we expect form Farhadi, almost no complaints. One of complaints that goes to technical part is unuse of music, but although some scenes would made better impression no one can say that Farhadi's movies aren't great just as they are. Special strong scenes are the ones from courtroom, starting from the first scene of dialogue between Simin and Nader with the judge which lasts for more than three and a half minutes and which immediately announces way of filming that is only possible with perfect acting. Characters that look so realistically is almost impossible to find. Brilliant movie that is definitely one of the best of 2011.",

Even the title is misleading, because only the first and last scene have something to do with the actual separation. We see Simin (the wife) and Nader (the husband) in front of a judge debating the reasons why they want to split. Actually, Simin wants to split, Nader seems not to care one way or the other \u2013 which certainly does not give much motivation to continue a marriage.The two have a child \u2013 Termeh - who is staying with Nader, while Simin moved back with her family, waiting for Termeh to decide if she wants to leave the country with her or stay with Nader. After the introduction of the main characters, the story derails. The in-between two hours of excruciating boredom are filled with the story of Razieh, an ignorant and over-religious woman hired to take care of Nader's father, who suffers from Alzheimer and is the main reason why Nader wants to stay put.Razieh makes a total mess out of a relatively simple job and ends up creating more trouble for herself and everybody around her, including her jobless and irresponsible husband.What has this to do with the separation of the title? Little or nothing. The movie goes on and on about Razieh and her troubles, loosing track of the alleged main characters. To make it worse, even the ending is a total let-down. A smug, \"I-am-clever-than-you\" joke played on the audience. Therefore, \"A separation\" starts slowly and goes nowhere just as slow, in a fake-documentary style.I am sure such a story based in Europe or the US would not have won an Oscar, but it is not the first time \u2013 nor will be the last \u2013 that a movie wins a prize for obscure reasons that have nothing to do with cinematography.Finally, I read some of the other reviews mentioning \"tension and drama\", \"phenomenal\", \" best movie of the year\" and more gushing and hyperbolic positive remarks.

When we watch those types of movies we know that the events we see will never happen to us so we can sit back and enjoy them.I think the reason I got so \"into\" this movie is that the events portrayed in it very easily could happen to me or my friends and family. It is basically a domestic drama, starting with a marriage breakdown.The amazing opening scene shows an Iranian woman and her husband speaking to a judge. She wants a divorce as she has a visa to settle in another country but he says he can't leave, as he has to look after his elderly father, who has Alzheimer's. It's sadly obvious that their relationship has completely broken down. The judge doesn't agree to the divorce but the wife goes to live with her mother. Their teenage daughter decides to stay with her father and he employs woman to look after his father when there is no one else at home.From there on a series of seemingly insignificant events have major consequences. Giving any more details of the plot might spoil your enjoyment of the movie.However if you have ever had a sick relative, been angry at your spouse/partner, been unhappy with work someone has done for you or told a lie for what you thought was a good reason I think this movie will affect you greatly.",

Foreign Language is usually a favourtie of mine since foreign films seem to capture the genuineness of human character so much better than ordinary American films. A separation is no exception.Although different movies in their own respect, I find myself compelled to compare this movie to Oscar nominated \"The Descendants.\" The story and plot may be different, but they are both character driven and accordingly a comparison is necessary, especially considering that the quality of character study in both movies has considerable disparity. In short, A separation succeeded in every respect The Descendants failed.The Descendants felt like it forced comedy into a drama, which did not fit well at all. Although comedy may stem from drama itself, having it as a separate theme in the movie was a big downfall in my opinion.A separation, in comparison, focuses on drama. It is a much more realistic portrayal of human character and potential actions and choices they may make. Occasional comedic comments are made, but not to the extent that it is \"comedy\" per se, but rather you laugh at the situation itself. For instance, in one scene, the father tells his daughter that what her teachers at school have taught her is wrong (from an academic perspective, not moral). The daughter replies that she must however write the \"wrong\" answer in the test otherwise she would be deducted marks off her paper, to which the father replies \"let them.\" It's a moment where we get to both smirk at the situation and also understand the sense of beliefs and values of the family.The true gem of this movie lies within its script, plot and acting. The acting is superb. The script is marvelous. And the plot evolves in such a manner that it questions our very own beliefs of what is right and wrong in one of the most complicated scenarios ever created in a realistic drama. I have never seen so much \"gray\" in a film. The right and wrong actions of characters are blurred to such an extent we end up sympathizing with them all. That is the beauty of this film. No one is better than the other. Everyone is wrong and justified at the same time. Everyone is human.I will be showing this movie to as many people as I can. I was truly touched.",

It's clear that both parents love their daughter, and that they love each other, too. Then why do they want a divorce? And what changed the judge's verdict? The answers to those two questions are simple enough: the mother wants a better life of the next generation; the father doesn't want to abandon the last generation. So that's a clear conflict. And that conflict led to another family in a lower class coming into their life, That's when the story gets truly fascinating. It pushes the two families to the edge.

A Separation is a triumph of the art of storytelling over the glitz and gloss of these other elements that are so much easier to find in today's films. The film is not for children, but it is about children, and about children who grow up into people who look like adults, but whose conflicts are enlarged versions of playground scuffles, but with much more serious consequences. A couple decides to separate, and there is a child involved, as well as an ill parent. How formulaic this could have been. But Farhadi has created, with these basic elements, a narrative of such power and meaning that it carries the viewer with him. It is impossible to remain detached while watching this film, which is as much a commentary on class and gender in modern-day Iran as it is on the power (and spaces outside) of the state, and on changing dynamics in modern families. Simin, the wife who wants to leave Iran, never spells out clearly her reasons for wanting to do so; her claustrophobia is implied, and her husband is not the major cause. Simin has choices of which Razieh, the maid, cannot dream. Yet, Razieh for all her troubles, is less troubled that Simin. Nader, played brilliantly by Payam Moadi, is clearly a good man, but his actions are questionable at times. This a film about the human condition, its dilemmas and conflicts; it is not about resolution of these, but rather about the impossibility of resolution.I first saw this film in in Farsi with German subtitles, and despite faint familiarity with one language and absolute ignorance of the other, I could understand the broad contours of the film. I have just seen it again with English subtitles, and the magic of this film is such that although understanding the dialogues (many of them subtle political commentary)adds detail to the narrative, the narrative has the power to move even when the actors' lines were 'felt' rather than 'understood'.",

The facts are simple enough and the film takes on the task to peel this onion and show us the layers of the story. Nader is an intransigent and moral human being who doesn't want to leave his father and his country(the Alzheimer stricken father is such a symbol for a country that lost its way and identity). He cant't relinquish the past in order to build the future(the daughter,)he wants to reconcile them. Simin, on the other hand is portrayed as more materialistic( she counts the money)and superficial(she wants to leave everything behind and start anew. In the end Nader is forced to realize that he doesn't live in a Greek tragedy,that life is full of compromise,that you need the support of the others that truth is not absolute and being a hero seems impossible in the modern world. Simin, on the other hand reveals her humanity, her love of her husband and daughter but she ignores Razeh's plea,either from selfishness or disdain for her superstitious type of religion. The child is the one to chose in the end what kind of future to have, what country to live in, what kind of human being she wants to be.Whichever way she goes I feel that she understands better than her parents that we,human beings,have to struggle to remain pure but cannot do so at the expense of our compassion and humanity.",

The central performances are amazingly affective and it is almost as if we were a fly on wall and as for everyone around the main characters are as if part of a documentary. It reminded me of some of Ingmar Bergman's work in that the drama seems to come out of the very people we are watching and we find ourselves struggling to get a firm grip on what is truly going on and what has really happened. Remarkably effective and affecting film making.",

Every character is well implemented in the story and it just keeps you in front of the screen until the end. Please see this movie, you won't regret it :) Iran seems to have very talented actors and directors. I'd give 10 to the acting, especially to the young girl Somayah and Peyman Moadi as well. I'm glad I discovered this actor and I hope so to see him in more movies. Really really talented. I promise you, you'll enjoy it.

            "content": "Where there is limitation, lurks beauty and art. This best justifies why \"A Separation\" engulfs the viewer to contemplate on more than meets the eye on screen. In a cinema (Iran), which barely leaves any room to openly debate, or perhaps pitch into beliefs and disbelieves, this gem ingeniously sneaks out from dilemmas involved in matrimony state of a couple, depreciated and devastated enough to take refuge in a separation. \"A Separation\" is about inability of judiciary system when it comes to moral phenomenons, while ironically implies on corrupted legal systems and its vicious regression. We are being asked by many complicated questions during the entire movie. A predicament where an immaculate child is condemned to confess what is not ethically right, nor is true, just in order to sustain the union of her semi-disjointed family viable. Farhadi masters the story while developing it in such a way which incapacitates the viewer to make unequivocal and straightforward judgments by asking labyrinth-like questions within a situation where all of us could have been through. Last but not least, through the entire movie the viewer is somehow being interrogated about the inevitable intersection of religion, faith and beliefs.",

The result could have been dizzying and confusing, but \"A Separation\" is so well-written, and the characters so vividly portrayed, that the course of events is clear and the outcome inevitable.The source of much of the trouble in the story is male pride--pride of a kind that flourishes in a culture like Iran's, in which authority is inherently male and women have little choice but to accept it and give in to it. You can see it in the utter confidence of the husband Nader in his dealings with his wife Simin and with Razieh, the woman who comes to work for him. And you can see it in the demanding and irrational behavior of Razieh's husband Hojjat. Because Razieh fears Hojjat's angry reprisal--first for taking a job without his permission, then for losing their child in the course of doing that job--she sets in motion a series of legal battles that threaten to tear both families apart. In the end, as the film makes unmistakably clear, it is their two daughters who suffer.Yet even with this examination of the consequences of male pride, \"A Separation\" is not a political film or an argument for female liberation. It is a tragedy of people acting in the only way they know how, and in the process creating misery after misery.",

            "content": "At the time of this writing there are twenty-seven five-star reviews of this movie (twenty-eight including this one) and no zero-stars. There is little this reviewer can add to the reviews already on this website without repeating what has been said. This work is an inspired masterpiece. It hosts a well-written and constructed script; full dimensional characters which are not cardboard caricatures given to us by Hollywood; real-life situations that are totally believable and to which anyone can identify; the acting is; perfectly executed and convincing acting; and strong direction.This is an amazing film by any standard. The fact that it was made at all is a miracle. The Iranian government initially would not allow the film to be made, for political reasons. Deft diplomacy by the director allowed the green light for this film to be made.On a deeper level this film underscores that differences in politics or government or society in the present age are largely irrelevant. This is a couple everyone can identify with; the situations faced by this family could have happened in Europe, North America, or the Far East. This film tends to contradict a saying attributed to Leo Tolstoy, That happy people are happy for the same reason, but unhappy people have their own individual reasons for that unhappiness. Here, the cause of the family tension in Simin and Nadar's marriage could have existed in California, yet the locale of the movie is in Teheran. The anguish experienced by their daughter Termeh could be shared with any adolescent. Simin's and Nadar's use of Termeh as a bargaining chip to leverage control in their divorce is sadly not uncommon in dissolution matters. Add to this mix issues of integrity, pride, personal responsibility and honesty, and the final result is a compelling family drama.This movie is not meant for casual viewing. While a fine film in its own right, Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage is far too cerebral and rarified, even though the subject matter is completely different. In that movie you can fall asleep listening to Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson talk. Here, the story of Nadar and Simin will grab you and pull you in. Scene after compelling scene will force you to pay attention and watch the drama playing out before your eyes. This movie won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film for 2011. It should have been nominated and won the Oscar for Best Picture.",

            "content": "In the opening sequence of Asghar Farhadi's terrific film, we see a couple, who are about to get divorced, sitting quietly. And then, without warning, the terse conversation about their lives and family escalates into a fire-spewing argument. The camera sensibly does not focus anywhere else during that sequence and after everything is said and done, every argument is brushed upon, the scene cuts away, not before vividly capturing the animosity between its lead characters. And that one sequence merits a deserving round of applause for Farhadi's 'A Separation', a scorchingly intense drama about conscience and moral ethics. Farhadi tactfully dissects the human mind by challenging us to confront ourselves as human beings with his beauty of a script and immensely complex characters but breathes real emotions while tension sears through the tightly-wound plot. It's something miraculous this, for the film is something so familiar because these are like the characters we have encountered at some point in our lives and we have heard them have conversations like the ones they have in the film. Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) have been married for fourteen years and have a 11-year old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). Tensions arise in their marriage when Simin decides o shift abroad for the sake of providing their daughter with a better life which Nader isn't willing to accept. He wants to stay in Iran to care for his father who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Frustrated by her husband's lack of interest, Simin decides to stay with her mother for a while. In her absence, Nader hires a pregnant caretaker Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father while he's working. One day, when Razieh has to leave the house on some urgent business, she ties Nader's father up to prevent him from leaving the house. When Nader returns only to find his father's condition has worsened because of Razieh's actions, he pushes her in a fit of rage. What happens next changes the lives of everyone involved. Apart from being a drama about the disintegration of a relationship, the film could also be passed off as a suspense-thriller, solely because of the sharp wit Farhadi so wonderfully weaves into the tense setting. Of the rousing babel that breaks at many points throughout the film, Farhadi is able to articulate himself through his writing, because the characters emote the precise emotions we expect them to. The film intently tries to comprehend the reasons for the actions of the characters it talks about and that's one skill that's hard to perfect. The direction is top-notch, because Farhadi is a remarkable observer of little details. Of the performances, Peyman Moaadi and Shahab Hosseini, who plays Razieh's debt-ridden husband, are standout. Moaadi, playing the grim father and husband, is outstanding. Leila Hatami, who is left out for most of the film, does supremely well in a small role. Sareh Bayat hands in a convincing performance of a complex character and it's easy to relate to her portrayal of a grieving mother.As far as dramas go, 'A Separation' is a nearly-perfect one, and an intelligent film that tragically depicts the depths human nature can sink to, if provoked. It's one film that can compel you to change the way you look at yourself. It's fascinating to see how a few well-chosen words and characters can chisel you into a better human being.",

This is a complex, layered film about human nature, and it takes place in Iran. There is no good vs evil here. Everyone has some good and some bad in him/her. The wife (Simin)who wants to move abroad with her daughter, while ignoring her father in law with Alzheimers, the husband (Nader)who loves his family so much that he cannot tell the whole truth in a court of law, a maid (Razieh)who is too afraid to tell her husband she is working for a family.There are so many shades of gray in this movie, and despite the seriousness of the subject, it never become melodramatic. I felt sympathy for all the characters- even Hojjat the hot tempered husband of the maid. The 11 year old girl Termeh is caught in the middle of it all, and she sees the lie more easily than the adults. The maid's little daughter is very cute.The acting is top notch by everyone; the screenplay is one of the best. The characters are not only vivid but very realistic. The direction is very good. So why did I give it 9 and not 10? It's a personal preference that I like to see a real end to a story. After putting us through the roller coaster for 2 hours I wanted to know which parent the daughter decided to live with. The fact that we did not get an answer seemed like a cop out to me. OTOH I have my own theory about who she will choose. Some people like generating discussion like that after a movie ends.I have not seen the other foreign films nominated for the Oscar this year, so I can't say if this is the best movie in that category, but I have to say it's one of the best and one of the most interesting movie I have seen in the last few years.If you don't see it, you will miss something very special.",

The actors even the little girl are marvelous, you can feel their emotions and understand their motives every second of the movie and the editing is just superb.

            "content": "This is a masterful, unblinking, documentary-like description of the incredibly delicate relationships that exist between the members of any family. It should appeal to any adult who has ever a) been married; b) been a parent; c) cared for an elderly person; d) had a serious difference of opinion with a mate; e) tried to be a good person and do the right thing but was thwarted by circumstances and dilemmas; and f) tried to keep the peace at home by telling a white lie that eventually had unintended consequences.In other words, the very mature subject matter and plot should be of interest to just about any adult anywhere in the world. I wonder why Hollywood is unable to do the same. (\"The Kids Are All Right\" tried and it was very good but only touched on a tenth of the issues that \"A Separation\" does.)The subtitles were not distracting at all. The sympathetic depiction of Alzheimer's and its effects on all family members is very real, but not at all \"in your face\". When living in Cairo for five years our family resided in three separate apartment buildings similar to those in this film. From time to time we'd hear a domestic dispute underway somewhere in the building, and, because the raised voices were in Arabic, we could only imagine what the dispute was about. This film showed me that what was going on in those Cairo apartments was not much different than what's found in just about any American home at some point in time. Strangely, after the movie ended, the audience remained in their seats and watched the very lengthy credits that are in untranslated Farsi.

Nader has a fight with Razieh over his father's treatment. He pushes the pregnant Razieh and she has a miscarriage.This is a film about angry characters in an infuriating system. It is interesting to see modern Iranian society. At first, I figured that this is a satire on the system. Then I thought that Razieh could be a comedic character. Nader is such an angry man and quite frankly so is everybody. I don't care about these people and I don't want to spend time in this society.

The screenplay, while basic, is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Lines are fired back from top-notch actors/actresses with either sass or intelligence:\"I didn't hit her.\" \"Then why is she in the hospital?\"This \"then why\" kind of wise-guy response appears often, and grips you into the suspenseful story even more. Contrary to the beliefs of some, the film is not necessarily depressing, but it relies heavily on dialogue, lots of which is spoken loudly (like in arguments). 'A Separation' focuses on each character, to develop them and make you feel for all of them at the same time, even when two primary characters completely detest each other. In other words, there's not a single person who's just \"there\".Overall, one would think the constant use of hand-held camera could become very irritating and make the film look low-budget, but it really doesn't. In fact, the minimalist approach to film-making in this movie helps evoke emotion. There's no music in the background, not that many stationary camera shots; the film is delivered entirely through realism: almost as if we're watching it through someone's eyes.That's a lot to say about a movie, as most films DO rely on musical accompaniment to manipulate the emotions of viewers. But no, this one is not melodrama. It's REAL sorrow. REAL feelings.

            "content": "A tragic story about how good intentions can start off a snowball that turns into an avalanche of conflict, moral self-betrayal and tragedy in a context whose cultural, social and political oppressions feed into and off this downward slide. Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moaadi) are a middle-class couple fighting over the future of their daughter, Termeh: Simin wants to take her overseas so the girl will not have to grow up in a misogynistic theocracy but Nader can't leave his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who is in an advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease, behind and Termeh won't leave without Dad. Simin files for divorce and leaves Nader and Termeh to care for the elderly man but Nader also has to work so on Simin's recommendation he hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a young working-class woman, to look after Grandpa. The work of looking after Nader's dad is too much for the pregnant Razieh who also has a small girl, Somayeh, in tow and so a series of mishaps occurs which escalate into confrontations that have the effect of straining Simin and Nader's fragile marriage further and roping in other innocent parties such as Termeh's tutor, various neighbours and Razieh and her husband Hojjat's relatives and his creditors. Along the way, Termeh, perhaps the wisest and sanest person in the film, learns a hard lesson about moral ambiguity, the class divide between herself and Somayeh, the oppressive role that religion is made to play in Iranian society, and how living in Iran with all its restrictions simply grinds good people like her parents, Razieh and others into situations where they abase themselves and one another.So many problems as highlighted in this film exist in modern Iranian society due to its police-state nature and ham-fisted interpretation of Islamic principles and shari'a law. If the theocracy weren't so oppressive towards women, Simin would never have thought of leaving the country and Razieh might have left overbearing and violent Hojjat ages ago. If the government would allow free exchanges between medical professionals and scientists, help for Alzheimer's disease sufferers would be more available and Simin and Nader would know enough to realise that Nader's father is deteriorating rapidly and that he needs to be in a nursing home to receive 24/7 care. If the government weren't so strict and narrow-minded in structuring society along religious lines, the officials in charge of mediating disputes could offer better advice to parties in conflict other than rely on simplistic interpretations of Islam. Farhadi's genius in \"A Separation\" is to show at once how a theocratic society such as Iran's with its structures and ideology is ill-equipped to deal with day-to-day problems that Nader, Simin, Razieh and Hojjat encounter, and how they all end up not only coming to blows with one another but meaner and baser as a result.Some people might believe that Islam is being criticised in this film but I disagree; true, Razieh relies too much on the Phone-a-mullah Helpline service for advice as to whether it's OK for a woman to wash an unrelated man's privates but her example is not all that different from those North Americans who rely on \"What would Jesus do?\" agony aunts on radio and cable TV for advice on losing weight, how to deal with kids skipping Bible classes and getting little Ebenezer or Jayleigh to do their creationist science homework (because the kids figured out they were being lied to). It's likely that Razieh has turned to an Allah-of- the-gaps religion for comfort from hot-tempered Hojjat, coping with his family and the pressure of poverty which forces her into accepting a job that's beyond her ability to cope with and requires a long commute as well. The real criticism should be aimed at the government for abusing Islam and its principles in such a way as to alienate Simin, Nader and Termeh from it and to reduce Razieh to a child incapable of making independent moral decisions. There is a suggestion in the film that Simin has told Nader that Razieh has confided in her of her (Razieh's) doubts about the cause of her miscarriage and that Nader uses what Razieh has told Simin and Razieh's own simple religious faith to blackmail both Razieh and Hojjat and make them look bad in front of Hojjat's family.The acting all round is top class and viewers will sympathise deeply with the characters and above all Termeh and Somayeh. Moaadi especially gives a great performance as Nader and Sarina Farhadi as the intelligent and sensitive Termeh is also a stand-out performer. Filming with a hand-held camera throughout gives the movie a voyeuristic intimacy that involves the audience, particularly in its opening scene in which the audience is placed in the position of the court judge mediating between Simin and Nader as Simin applies for divorce. Viewers will see something of the daily grinding pressure on Nader, Razieh and the rest of the cast placed by the strictures of Iranian theocratic society as they try to do the best they can to survive and raise their children; the film clearly demonstrates this pressure is not unique to those characters but applies to all Iranians as they try to negotiate and organise their lives under and around the restrictions the government places on them. No wonder so many people are so desperate to leave the country, so much so that they are willing to pay smugglers and risk dangerous sea voyages to countries such as Australia and Canada.",

So Termeh must lie, and in that silent, tear streaked face, we are told much more than a line of dialogue could ever do. The subtext shines through, as her impartiality is marred. The opening shot of A Separation is a two-shot long-take that places us within the judge, presiding over the less dramatic concern of Simin and Nader's divorce. I think this choice has a certain cinematic value to it that could have been replicated in that stuffy little courtroom later for the more important plot-line. The shot-reverse-shot cuts up the tension that is maintained by the character's excellent performances, fuses that burn bit by bit as they struggle to get their word in, their own version of the truth. The dialogue is furious, overlapping, full of hostility and authenticity that matches the body language. When Razieh is called upon to explain why she has left an elderly grandfather with Alzheimers alone and tied up, her entire body trembles with a nervousness and fright that plants a little seed of moral disbelief in our minds. Nader cleans a man who doesn't know who he is, and perhaps that fact is the straw that sees him collapse sobbing into his father's shoulder, puncturing the solemn silence. The sets are modest middle class, which has an even more sobering effect when we finally enter the low class family home of Razieh and Hodjat, the rusty wrinkling walls and crumpled couches a symbol of poverty that neither party is willing to consciously address. Kalari shoots with plenty of hand-held that is intimate, restless and unnerving, without being needlessly jerky. The settings play a living role within the film; closed doors signal privacy, a tense conversation, Termeh as the younger child always shut out or framed from behind a glass partition or window. In that final scene, we see two parents now the victims of this technique, so close and yet so far away. And then the shouts of another domestic drama echoes through the crowded corridor, that in itself a captivating story. There is no score here, the silence magnifying the scope of emotion. Orchestration does not drown out our characters; they do that to themselves in their arguments.It would be right in calling some of our characters petty, yet Farhadi takes these notions of pride and justice and honour and presents such a shifting and evolving case that never truly tells you what to think. Little details are unearthed slowly, forcing us to again and again realign our moral perspectives and evaluate these people based on new information. Hodjat spends more time in jail than out of it due to his debt, and is depressed due to his unemployment. Razieh is uncertain about the cause of her miscarriage, but fears to reveal the truth after her sin of seeking work without informing her husband. I am reminded of Kurosawa's Rash\u00f4mon, which subverted expectations that flashbacks had to be objective and truthful. Many times I express frustration at character actions or emotional responses that seem logically flawed, irrational or just plain dumb. Even in the world of fiction, we seek explanation and coherency. I am frustrated because of the religious stranglehold of Razieh that has her terrified of touching an elderly man without first phoning a helpline, or when she lies to people's faces but cannot do so while swearing on the Quran. I am frustrated that Nader's ego and pride initially prevents him from admitting responsibility for his push, even at the expense of his family's safety and unity. But I fully and unequivocally understand why they make these decisions. A great film is able to push you to empathise with these flawed decisions, these prideful decisions, in our eyes even wrong decisions. This is a great film.",

A Separation is way beyond great than any other movie released in 2011 (movies which I have seen).Its a long time since I have seen a drama which is both realistic and gripping. Asghar Farhadi has succeeded in bringing out the true colors of each and every human and it is portrayed so brilliant by the characters on screen. Everyone of the cast deserves a huge applause for their perfect 10/10 acting skills. It was not just like watching a movie, but going places everywhere with each and every character and watching their activities.Even the youngest character in the movie, the small kid ('Somayeh' character) in the movie has done so well.The movie ideally explores the human and inhuman attitudes of all people. All the events in the movie seemed so real.We may just say a lie so easily, even if it were a serious thing. But the aftermath, is depicted so clearly and truthfully in the movie.The screenplay and dialogs were so good that I feel like these things can happen in anybody's life. Having seen many Hollywood movies, the one thing that always amuses me is that, most good dialogs in acclaimed movies,seem unreal to occur to the mind to such a person(the character) in such a condition (an exception being Tarantino's movie dialogs). But in this movie, the dialogs are so real,heart-felt and clear (I hope the subtitles with which I watched gave the correct translation).A superb movie with content that each and everyone of the family can watch.Great direction that makes you ask for more.And I feel bad for people who gave a negative review to this movie cos they are really nuts.Oscar worthy stuff and this movie should feature in the top 50 of every movie list ever made.",

            "content": "At a time of great ignorance in the west of life in modern Iran this film provides some useful insights. I was struck by how similar the issues are in some ways to those of a British couple facing separation, yet also by the extent of the cultural differences. The wife wants to leave the country with her daughter, but her husband has the power to forbid it. The perceptive teenage daughter is caught between her parents, and chooses at first to stay with her father in a desperate attempt to keep her parents together. The wife goes off to live with her own parents, leaving her estranged husband with the problem of how to obtain day care for his father, who suffers from dementia. The woman who is hired for this task through a casual arrangement proves unable to cope. There is a fascinating scene in which, concerned for the old man who is incontinent, she phones an imam for advice as to whether it is permissible for her to help her charge to clean himself. The husband returns home to find the flat empty and his father in a state, and matters turn violent when the carer comes back without a good explanation. In the ongoing dispute, the complexity of the issues is clearly shown, with right on both sides, and one's sympathies are divided.This is a tightly plotted and entertaining drama, despite the at times grim theme - a kind of middle eastern update of Kramer versus Kramer (American film about a divorced couple with Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman) and in my view much deeper. We are thrust into the midst of some very convincing dramatic exchanges. The Iranian justice system is intriguing as we see the various protagonists crammed into an office, arguing loudly with each other and with the official whose task it is to decide on what seems an arbitrary basis who should be charged and who should be held in jail pending trial. Although harsh, Iranian society seems in some ways more deeply moral and concerned with fairness and right versus wrong than our own. Ironically, as in Britain, the better educated and wealthier couple's rights win out over those of the poorer family.\"Separation\" is not just a drama with an appeal which crosses cultural boundaries. It also increased my understanding of Iranian culture and deserves to be more widely viewed to break down our ill-founded prejudices.",

The caretaker is negligent so she is fired, but she refuses to leave the house without pay. Nader pushes the caretaker out the door. She has a miscarriage and files criminal murder charges against him. Nader also files charges for the mistreatment of his father. Everyone in the movie lies about the circumstances surrounding the criminal charges. Subsequently, all charges are dropped, and Nader goes back to focusing on his divorce and custody battle. I will admit that the caretaker, her husband, and Nader's daughter performed their roles phenomenally. But this plot is just not juicy enough to film a movie about. There were so many filler scenes, like watching Nader's daughter read, watching the sick dad sit in confusion, and watching everyone sit in the courthouse with their heads down. If the plot had some substance, then the viewer wouldn't end up watching people do boring things. 5/10 for the acting and realism, but I still would not recommend this.",

A Separation is as good as an emotional drama and as nail biting thriller. The story, screenplay and characterization are masterpiece in itself. There are very few movies which surprises you with their honesty and purity. A SEPARATION is a compelling drama about the dissolution of a marriage. Simin wants to leave Iran with her husband Nader and daughter Termeh. Simin sues for divorce when Nader refuses to leave behind his Alzheimer-suffering father. Her request having failed, Simin returns to her parents' home, but Termeh decides to stay with Nader. When Nader hires a young woman to assist with his father in his wife's absence, he hopes that his life will return to a normal state. However, when he discovers that the new maid has been lying to him, he realizes that there is more on the line than just his marriage. The complexity of the story and emotions in the movie is really hard to describe. The performances by Peyman Moadi and Leila Hatami are excellent and truly deserved all the accolades. The performances by supporting cast Sareh Bayat, Shahab Hosseini & Sarina Farhadi are excellent. The movie completely relies on its realistic approach to the situation and heart hitting performances by each and everyone. Overall, A Separation is highly recommended Oscar Winning Iranian movie, which will surly leaves you speechless. Brilliant, Brilliant and simply Brilliant.",

            "content": "Written and directed by Asghar Farhadi, \"A Separation\" watches as Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moaadi), an Iranian husband and wife, drift toward divorce. The film then switches gears and becomes a murder mystery, Nader accused of inducing a miscarriage in Raziah, his employee.Much of Farhadi's film watches as Termeh, the couple's daughter, struggles with issues of truth, justice and family loyalty. Should she support her father, who may have accidentally killed a child, or her mother, who longs to leave Iran? As Termeh pines for connection and reconciliation, the rest of Farhadi's cast seem hell-bent on drifting apart. They're separated along economic and cultural lines, some bank clerks, some houseworkers, some unemployed, some wrestling with questions of finance and faith. Farhadi's blocking and editing also stress a certain exclusion, characters separated by doorways, veils, staircases and windowpanes.Farhadi's previous film, \"About Elly\", was preoccupied with class divisions. With \"A Separation\" we see semi-secular urbanites (Nader and Simin) clashing with a more conservative, God-fearing couple (Raziah and her husband, Hodjat). But though a portrait of an Iran that is in the throes of an identity crisis, seemingly pulling in two different directions at once (\"What is so wrong with Iran?\" a judge asks), Farhadi is careful not to taint either side. Simin, a strong, modern woman, is initially chastised for wanting to leave Iran, her husband and his dying father, but becomes a hero of sorts later on. Raziah and Hodjat's relationship, meanwhile, may seem volatile, a parody of patriarchal domesticity, but he worships her, defers to her judgement, and it is her God which gives Raziah a sense of ethics which surpasses even the morality of the more self-serving Nader. Even Hodjat's violent outbursts throughout the film are portrayed sympathetically; the guy's just lost his child.\"A Separation\" won the foreign-language film Oscar, as well as a slew of other awards (the Golden Bear at Berlin). With much of the Western world (UK, US, France) and elsewhere (Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey etc) hell-bent on nuking Iran and sucking on its resources, \"A Separation\" does well to contest, albeit unintentionally, various racist stereotypes. One must remember that Iran has essentially been subject to a sixty year propaganda campaign and covert war (as well as the West's backing of Saddam Hussein in his overt, eight year war against Iran). To many, the perception is that Iran is a backward land populated by sexist lunatics, snarling bogeymen and homophobes (the UK \"legalized homosexuality\" in 1967, the US essentially did the same in 2003 by repealing sodomy laws). That she's a modern nation state which houses people of all shades and beliefs is a fact lost on many. Even her much disparaged civil rights records \u2013 Iran's government is indefensible, moronic and brutally repressive - puts many Western puppets/allies to shame, is in many ways causally related to British/CIA actions, and betters the contemporary and past human rights track-records of most major superpowers.Interestingly, Iran's government has a conflicted relationship with \"A Separation\". They praise it for its oversees success, and even some of its writing, but also chastise it for drifting from the party-line. Like the characters in Farhadi's film, Iran's censors aren't quite sure where to stand. Farhadi's film itself contains various judicial figures who epitomise Iran's ideological hypersensitivity. These judges preside over lies, absurdities, are unconcerned about truth, and spring into action only when their authority is challenged.Fittingly, the film ends with Termeh faced with a choice: to leave Iran or to stay with daddy. Farhadi's hinting at a nation's uncertain future, but we know with some certainty how history unfolds. Months after Farhadi's Oscar win, Hassan Rouhani was elected President of Iran, a \"moderate\" cleric who marks another small step toward further human rights and gender equality. It took Britain hundreds of years to separate church, state, monarchs and overthrow the Divine Right Principles (the country is still symbolically theocratic). The United States skipped all that and went straight to cigars, oval office fellatio and bombing for Jesus. How long will Iran's theocratic Assembly of Experts last? And more importantly, how much will progress depend on Iran's real-life Simins and Termehs fighting rather then fleeing? It's a question which Farhadi himself asks. \"Every time you face trouble, you give in rather than confront it,\" Nader tells his wife, a tactful woman whom Farhadi eventually reveals to be expert at diffusing dangerous situations.8/10 \u2013 See Mohsen Makhmalbaf's \"Kandahar\" and Zhang Yimou's \"The Story of Qiu Ju\".",

            "content": "Going strictly by its press releases, one might conclude that the Oscar-winning \"A Separation\" is mainly about the difficulties Iranian couples face in procuring a divorce. But that turns out to be a fairly small part of the movie, actually. In fact, on a political level, the film is more of an indictment of a legal system wherein a person who inadvertently causes a woman to have a miscarriage can be charged with the murder of that child.But politics and social reform take a back seat in the movie to its human drama, as writer/director Asghar Farhadi provides us with a naturalistic tale of ordinary, decent people trying - but often failing - to lead ordinary, decent lives in a world too often ruled by the cruel exigencies of random chance.Simin (Leila Hatami) is seeking a divorce from her husband, Nader (Peyman Moaddi). It's not that she really wants a divorce; it's that she wants the two of them to move out of the country with their 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Fahadi), to seek a more promising future for themselves somewhere else, but Nader wants to stay in the country to take care of his father who is suffering from Alzheimer's. However, the judge deems that there are not sufficient grounds in this case to grant a divorce. When Simin moves back in with her parents, Nader is forced to hire a woman (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father during the day while he's at work. It is at that point that the real trouble begins.I don't want to give much more of the plot away than that; suffice it to say, the movie is a realistic drama made up of characters who are neither heroes nor villains, sinners nor saints. There's plenty of blame to go around for what happens in the story - and at times it feels a bit like an episode of Adults Behaving Badly - but Farhadi always make us aware of just how flawed but well-intentioned these wholly recognizable figures are. Their customs and religious beliefs may seem a bit foreign to Western eyes, but the issues of marital discord, of caring for an elderly parent, of trying but often failing at being a role model for one's children, and of refusing to accept the consequences of one's actions are universal in their scope and nature.There's a certain redundancy in the narrative and an occasional flatness in the storytelling, but excellent performances and a bravely inconclusive, lady-or-the-tiger fadeout hold us in the movie's thrall.",

If you connect with these characters and get invested with them, I'm sure it could be a shattering work, but I didn't care much about anyone involved and therefore often found myself wondering when they were going to get to the \"good part\". The story presented some solid explorations into morality, pride, religion and the sacrifices people make for their children but I never felt it delved deep enough into any of them to leave much of an impression on me.The acting was universally quite good, with Peyman Moaddi and Sarina Farhadi being the standouts for me, but no one got a chance to amaze me to the degree I was hoping for. The characters essentially stay locked into their one expression for the entire film and don't ever budge from it. Naader is stoic, Simin is graceful, Razieh is beaten, Hodjat is erratic, et cetera. I kept wanting these characters to express something different, but writer/director Asghar Farhadi never gives them the opportunity to. I suppose that was my main complaint with the film, but there were a few other things that just didn't work for me.The film book-ends with this debate between Naader and Simin over where to move or not and what to do with their daughter as a result, but it almost immediately takes a backseat to the primary story, and stays that way until randomly becoming the focal point again at the end. It felt relatively tacked on and I wish they had delved more into it throughout the film, instead of lightly tapping back on it every half hour or so.That was the most interesting dynamic for me, but they spent the majority of the time on what I found to be a relatively uninteresting dispute over an act of aggression. The dispute between the two families feels very one-sided and Farhadi leverages the audience far too much into one direction, when it seems like he's trying to keep things in a gray area; he just completely fails to do. One side is wild and frustratingly emotional, while the other is reasoned and calm. For a while I thought this was the intention of the film, which could have been a smart move if the final act had gone in a different way, but with an eleventh hour semi-twist it kind of put that positive aspect in the can.I'll wrap up by saying again that the acting is well-worth watching, despite the characters not having much room to expand themselves, but overall this felt like a film with a lot of interesting areas that just weren't properly handled.",

As we go deeper in the narrative the face of truth is peeled layer by layer and allows the viewer to be a part of all the events occurring on the screen. Performances are so good that I can assure you that you can mirror each character with people You know. Farhadi seems to have complete authority over this masterpiece.i don't want to reveal any plot details. All I want to say is If you like serious movies dealing with real people and you like 'Character Study'in movies then your wait is over. This is It. The one.If you like 'A Separation' then 'About Elly' is definitely recommended.At the end i would like to quote some lines from 'Schism' By 'Tool'.\"Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion between supposed lovers, between supposed brothers.\"",

            "content": "Director Asghar Farhadi has his own style of storytelling; one where the narrative is crafted to the smallest detail, all of which ultimately end up impacting the movie significantly. And much like in his previous film \"About Elly\", director Farhadhi uses the candidness of the Iranian social fabric to build up moral dilemas of great nuance and complexity.The simplistic style of \"A Separation\" and its groundedness makes the movie all the more personal and relatable; where it's an almost mirror-like reflection of ourselves and our behaviors in relations to our family, our society and ourselves. Each mistake, each frustration and each moment of introspection in this no-antagonist story of situational conflict, makes us all the more sympathetic and empathetic to the positions that people could find themselves in.A Seperation is nothing short of brilliance. It's a movie that's deserving of all the praise and acclaim it has acquired since its release. It's the type of movie that makes me appreciate this medium of cinema all the more sincerely. I'm glad I loved it as much as I thought I would.",

            "content": "A Separation is so deeply moving, so human, that it feels downright blasphemous to be enthusiastic about it. I wish I could write a review with just the words \"go see this movie\" in it. But since I can't do that, you should consider the rest of this review as nothing but context.A Separation is an Iranian movie with three large female roles. It's the sort of description that might make you think it's a political allegory, or at least a movie with some pretty hefty subtext. Nothing could be further from the truth. None of the characters in the movie worry about politics. They have their own problems to deal with. This might have become hypocritical in an Iranian movie, but it actually works as a strong point. The characters don't represent their gender, social class or religion. They just represent themselves, and are plenty busy with that. It makes the outcome of the movie purely based on the actions of persons, not on the side of any one issue the filmmaker wants to impose on us. Let's not forget, after all, that even some of the most repressed people in the world still have to find their own ways to get along with one another. A government can only set the conditions under which people have to live. With what kind of misery the citizens fill in the blanks is up to them. Nader and Termeh return home one day to find the old man alone in the house. He has fallen from his bed and is tied to the bedstand. He doesn't seem to be breathing. Termeh loses it, while Nader quickly puts him back on the bed. He is still alive. Razieh sneaks into the house. Nader flips out. He throws Razieh and her daughter out the door and slams it shut. He walks back to his father, but then hears noises outside and checks what is happening. Razieh has fallen down the stairs, and some neighbors are helping her up. Nader returns to his father. Later that day, Simin calls him. He rings at her mothers door, who looks at him with a look of ill-hidden contempt. Nader tries to start talking, but Simin cuts him off and tells him that Raziehs husband had called and insulted her. She asks him to explain himself. He says he doesn't know what she is talking about. She tells him Razieh is in the hospital. They rush there. Razieh has had a miscarriage.At this point we've finally reached the central conflict of the rest of the movie. Was it or was it not Nader's fault? It might sound like a simple question of guilt, but everyone involved views the situation differently. Nader wants to protect Termeh. Simin doesn't know whether to trust Nader anymore and wants to find out the truth. Razieh is heartbroken at the loss of her child. Raziehs husband is unemployed, depressed and ill-tempered, and the loss of his son feels like a final draw to him. Each one of them tries to handle the situation as well as they can, but how well can a situation like this be handled anyway? Morality is a lot more complicated when the future of your family is at stake. The lives of people who just want to be left in peace to sort out their personal problems get entangled further and further. Even the judge seems to find the situation exasperating. Although the atmosphere of A Separation is something I've never seen on the screen, it still felt familiar. I've seen it in other places; At the family dining table during my parents divorce. In restaurants where couples at other tables got into a fight. In the company of old people who recount the tales of woe from their lives. A Separation snubs the melodramatic for something a lot more direct: the truth. It doesn't rely on the sort of tension that gets you to the edge of your seat. It works by means of different kind of tension. The sort that slowly builds in your shoulders during a time of stress, the sort you don't even notice until it's too late. The kind of tension that can simmer in you for days, months, even years, before making you explode. The tension of life.You have read over a thousand words at this point, and I have written and scraped many more. And there is so much more that can be said about the movie. How good the screenplay is, and how great the acting. How beautiful the Farsi dialogues sounded. How much the movie resonated with me personally. But all of that is secondary. The main thing is that this movie works because it's real. Go see it. It will stay with you for the rest of your life.",

            "review_title": "Best Movie of 2011?",
            "content": "Iranian writer/director Asghar Farhadi's A Separation is one of the best films, if not the best, of 2011. I totally loved it, and it moves to the top of my list of best films of the year. It's been nominated for two Oscars (best foreign film and best original screenplay), having already won a slew of other awards. A Separation is a small, carefully observed, exquisitely rendered motion picture about \u2013 well, it's about a lot of things.The title refers, most explicitly, to one of these: the depiction of an apparently irreconcilable disagreement between Nader, a thirty-ish bank officer, and his wife, Simin; their resulting separation; and the effect of all this on their family, including most particularly their daughter, Termeh, who's caught in the middle. The picture presents one of the most honest portrayals of a family's marital dissolution ever portrayed in a feature film. As a matrimonial lawyer, I know a little something about this.His wife gone, Nader hires a caretaker, Razieh, to take of his dad, while he is at work and Termeh is at school. Whereas Nader and Simin are educated, secular and solidly middle class (or perhaps upper middle class), Razieh is none of those things; her husband is an unemployed cobbler, she is devoutly religious, and she comes from a different cultural milieu entirely. Everyone speaks Farsi, but really, they do not speak the same language. Within a few days, Nader comes home early to find his father tied to his bed and Razieh absent. When she returns, an argument ensues, during which Razieh's reticence about the reason for her absence and Nader's angry refusal to allow her the opportunity to explain, culminates in her being fired. Nader has to literally throw her out of his flat. A lawsuit ensues.Communication and its limits are a major theme of the movie. Without honest, open communication, there can be no connection and no understanding, only misunderstanding. Misunderstanding breeds conflict, which impedes honesty and communication. Pretty soon there are multiple levels of separation: within the nuclear family, and by extension within the extended family of relatives, friends, and acquaintances (even Termeh's teacher gets drawn in); between the white collar and the blue-collar classes, between the secular and the devout and between people and their government (limited here to the judicial system \u2013 for political reasons).The film opens with Simin and Nader in domestic court, where each explains why his/her position is the most reasonable. Faryabi keeps the magistrate offscreen - the camera is where he would be - so the couple seem to be pleading directly to us. Later, there are several scenes at the courthouse, where we eavesdrop on the proceedings between Razieh and her husband on one hand versus Nader on the other. Accusations fly wantonly; Razieh's husband, a hothead, gets disturbingly yet credibly hotheaded; and the hearing officer, sweating, in shirtsleeves, tries to hold it together while seeking to winnow out the truth. But which truth, whose truth? From the start and throughout this perceptive and moving picture, our sympathies for the characters constantly shift, because we are getting acquainted with basically good people, acting badly at times, but trying to do the best they can under trying circumstances. There are no heroes, no villains. None of the characters are perfect, all are wholly believable. The actors dissolve into their roles in the most naturalistic way, so we forget they are actors.The themes of separation and impaired communication are augmented by the creative cinematography. Conversations occur through half-closed doors, characters are viewed through panes of glass, or in enclosed vehicles. We get extreme close ups of faces struggling with awful dilemmas: what do I say? Do I tell the truth? The whole truth? Then there is the haunting, heartbreaking final scene, back at the courthouse. - spoiler alert - Mom and Dad can't agree on custody. They both sorely love their daughter. The magistrate has asked Termeh if she has made a decision who she wants to live with. She has, but she doesn't want to say so in their presence. It's just too painful. Nader and Simin are asked to leave the room. They go out into the hall. They do not speak. Simin sits on one side of a glass partition, Nader is on the other. They wait. Eventually, the credits roll.Through the lives of these characters, through a relatively simple narrative, with the aid of an honest screenplay and great acting, photography and direction, Faryabi demonstrates a compassionate understanding of human behavior and the forces with which ordinary people sometimes must struggle, navigating between empathy and self-righteousness, principle and compromise, self-protection and honesty, anger and compassion, love and duty. He has given us a moving, thought provoking, intelligent masterpiece.For us in the US, there is another dimension of A Separation to savor. After months and years of political conversation about the dangers of a nuclear Iran, and the extremism of the Islamic regime running that country, we tend to forget that this is a country of people. And these people, it turns out are remarkably like us, notwithstanding their government. Startling so, to my sensibility. They drive cars, they have jobs, they dress like us (notwithstanding the mandatory headscarves for the ladies and the occasional birqa), the furnishings in their flats and public buildings look pretty 'Western.' At several moments, we get glimpses of 'the people' of Iran as a community. When the caretaker, Razieh, almost faints on a bus, the reaction of the community is remarkably supportive, trying to help in an any way they can. Even the magistrate in the legal action between the families shows signs of compassion, constrained though he is by Shariah law. I do not know what I was expecting, but somehow this glimpse into urban Iranian life and of the Persian people was a fascinating and reassuring bonus.",

This is also due to the art of creating true characters, characters that feel so real, so human, not just some plain figures at the end of the good vs. evil specter. And this art is everywhere in Ashgar Farhadi's 'Separation''.I pity those poor people, of course, but pity is such a mundane feeling these days. What impressed me is the movie's quality of making me care and be deeply immersed into their desperation. I don't know anything about how losing a child feels like, how giving up major parts of your life for someone you live is or women's condition in Iran but it wasn't really necessary to know. I just instinctively managed to feel those people's frustration, anger, guilt, fear, shame. Maybe not at maximum intensity but still intense enough.A 9,6 out of 10 from me.",

I thought the movie was very well-crafted by Writer-Director Asghar Farhadi and was very deserving of its Best Foreign Language Oscar nomination, but I would not separate \"A Separation\" as one of the best screenplays of the year; so yea, I do not think it was worthy of its Best Original Screenplay nomination. Hey \"A Separation\" lovers- before you separate from my review, please let me explain why. Before I do that, I have to do the \"explain the movie plot thing\" in my review. \"A Separation\" is primarily about Nader and Simin, an Iranian couple on the verge of a separation (ya, that is the title of the movie) because Simin says that she wants to flee from Iran to a better land, and Nader does not want to join his cousin Ralph Nader in America and therefore wants to stay put in Iran to take care of his ailing father. Due to the separation, Nader hires the deeply-religious Razieh to take care of his father. An argument between Nader and Razier on the caring of the father turns \"A Separation\" into a tailspin of turmoil for the characters involved. Director Asghar Farhadi directs this downward spiral with cerebral supremacy an authenticity; I did enjoy Farhadi's direction far more than his screenplay, which was solid but not of Oscar nomination material due to its basic verbal exchange between the film's characters. Peyman Maadi and Leila Hatami excelled with their starring performances as Nader and Simin. And teen actress Sarina Farhadi was astounding as their teenage daughter Termeh, who does not want to be the Termehnator of her parent's marriage. I am going to give you the good fortune of a separation from my puns as I end this review, but please do not separate yourself from \"A Separation\" viewing. **** Good",

You would normally say this is character development, but in this case it just seemed over-indulgent micro- detailing.Once it does get going, it is not overly compelling. The ins and outs of the court case make you feel the writer-director is manipulating you into choosing a certain side, and being quite judgemental in their manipulation. The more this went on, the more disinterested I became, as I felt the writer-director was going to let their own views and prejudices dictate the outcome.This said, the movie resolves itself well.

Many of the pivotal scenes happen in a courthouse, in small, cramped rooms where an overworked judge is trying to decide what should be done and what is right under the law.And it is fascinating to watch. Iran has been painted with a heavy-handed brush in Western media. But when you're watching this film, made by actual Iranian people, you start to realize that the truth is much more multi-faceted than we've been allowed to understand. Certainly some of it is absolutely alien to us, but there are also a lot of things that seem surprisingly close to our expectations of a society. And a realization like that breeds understanding.On the technical side of things, the film is very clean. Almost clinical, even. There's very little music, the camerawork is purposefully claustrophobic and almost voyeuristic in order to make us feel like we're really there, peeking around the corner, and the whole film has this crispness to it.Want to broaden your horizons?

Farhadi's Fireworks Wednesday is an easier film to understand: within the movie you struggle to find the truth and in the end everything's clear, somehow nothing to doubt. About Elly, the second movie in trilogy is more complicated: it's hard to find out the truth, relationships in families are more complex and the movie ends with almost an open ending and many answers to questions in viewer's mind remain unknown. A Separation, which has more powerful ethical and social context, is the most complicated and mind-involving one. After watching the whole movie even several times, it's almost impossible to blame anyone and it's Farhadi's goal to create not easy to judge characters, just like the real world. What is the truth? What is happening through Nader and Simin's minds that leads them to divorce? What if Simin is right about Nader's changed emotions? These questions are still with me when I think about A Separation.

Except nothing is played for laughs.It completely baffles my mind why this film wasn't more focused on its central plot, instead we get a badly paced debacle that feels a lot longer than it is. Every scene looks the same, sounds the same and plays out more or less the same with very few exceptions. It quickly becomes obvious no care at all was given to ways in which set design, audio and environmental cues could be used to move the film along.If this were a school project I'd be impressed, there's solid acting and the basic shot structure is competent.

The plot, above all, is breathtaking. It just get getting more complicated, and you never know whose side to be with, and somehow you feel pity for every single one of its character! This is a very sad movie; but realistically sad. It's not sad in the way movies like Life is Beautiful or 12 Years a Slave are sad; the pain that the characters of those movies go through is somewhat spectacular. But the pain of this movie's characters is much more easy to relate with; is as painful as life itself. Because the problems they face are not Hollywood-esque; they are real-life problems. I guess that, being myself a child of divorced parents, I could really relate to the problems involved in the characters' separation.Another thing that stood out; though I'm not sure if it was the director's intention or the mere consequence of being watched from a Western perspective, is the theme of religion. Though not the main topic of the movie, it is always there. It affects' the character's behavior tremendously, but I guess that's just the way it happens in real life. The theme of social inequity is also present, with the family that sues the main character being considerable poorer, which makes their behaviour much more justifiable.This is one of the best non-American movies I've ever watched, and it rightfully deserved its Oscar.

First of all it was very heavy on dialogue which made keeping up with the subtitles a little tricky. More than once I had to go back so I could properly understand a passage. Secondly, I did find it a little too long, it has quite a slow pace but I felt certain things could have been moved along slightly quicker. By the end I was looking at my watch\u0085 never a good sign. Having said that I did find it quite compelling with an interesting insight into the legal system of a country we know little about here in the West. Over all, despite these few shortcomings, still a worthy watch with some excellent performances\u0085 RECOMMENDED.My Score 8.3/10IMDb Score: 8.6/10 (based on 56,371 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 95/100: (Based on 41 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 99/100 (based on 141 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 93/100 'Liked It' (based on 14,327 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",

In the midst of this trouble the husband is accused of assaulting the woman he had hired to look after his elderly father (with Alzheimer's). There is a lot of arguing and crying. There is a lot of helplessness. Basically this movie is just one upsetting situation after another.Normally, I'm not a fan of movies where nothing good/happy happens. I'm a sucker for happy endings when it really comes down to it. This movie was incredibly depressing, yet I didn't hate it. I guess it was because it was just so well done. The acting was some of the best I've ever seen. The way the movie was shot was brilliant. It was intimate and really honest, no fluff. There was no music to amplify or suggest a mood for the scenes; you had just the actors to feed off of. That was enough. Wonderful movie-making.I was not surprised that this movie was nominated for two Academy Awards, one for Best Foreign Film and one for Best Original Screenplay. It was excellent. Upsetting and excellent. Would I recommend this movie? Well... I guess it depends on what kind of movie-watcher you are. If you're an Oscar junkie/movie buff, YES YES YES! It was so worth seeing. If you watch movies to escape from reality into feel-good land, don't see this film. You will NOT feel good at all.",

I've watched lots of movies and series and I just can say, I've never seen anything like this in a long time, at least amongst Iranian movies! As an Iranian I was watching a part of my country people having their daily life and problems. Everyone from their point of view, thinking their problem is more important than the others. I had the pleasure of watching it on DVD (unfortunately I missed it when it was on big screen) and I couldn't believe that it was just a movie and the characters weren't real or they were just acting! Actually, I have to say that they weren't acting, they were living their roles in front of the camera. All of the cast from the little girl to the ill old man, they were real to me as my family members are. As the movie was approaching to the ending minutes I was just wishing that it didn't end. I don't want to spoil anything and I want everyone of you to watch this masterpiece and live every second of every minute of it. I assure you, it will remain on your mind for a long time.

            "content": "Wow! Foreign language film or not, this is just an excellent, excellent drama. You can't get a more Oscar worthy material than this. To me what makes A SEPARATION unique is that writer/director Asghar Farhadi takes conflict, secrets, relationships and other elements that we're familiar with and mixes them with the culture, religion and gender elements from that specific region. This film, to a certain extent, lets you in on how the justice system works in a place where some of us may be ignorant about. And it's really not about our way is better than theirs or vice versa, it's just how different some things are done.And this is not just about a divorce or a separation of two individuals The film starts out that way and it ends on that note as well but what happens in between is more of a spin-off story or it stems from when the lead characters Nader and Simin stop being on the same page. A SEPARATION is a very dialogue-driven, a very character driven story, all the actors in this film are marvelous. When the tension is high, they're extremely convincing, I couldn't take my eyes off any of them, especially lead actress Leila Hatami who holds a certain photogenic beauty.The other thing I liked about this movie is it's ending . This is the perfect ending the audience could ask for. Initially it starts off leading us to believe the mother is the one leaving the family and the father is the epitome of goodness and decency. The red hair, the cigarette, etc make us establish the mother as a modern woman who would jump ship to survive but the father is a man in the past and would rather die with honor. Later it is beautifully unfolded how there is fault in him too when he lies(I believe, under oath) and Termeh's respect for him diminishes. Its perfectly logical, he is a human too. Everyone in the movie has their own share of faults. There wasn't actually A separation, there were many separations- mother and child, father and child , etc. In the end both the parents were essentially wolves fighting each other, trying to win their prey (Termeh). None was ready to compromise. In this separation, Termeh didn't lose one of her parents but both...",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I had heard it was about a divorce at the end of a relationship and I had therefore assumed it would be an exploration of the emotional aspects of that. I had also heard every critic saying it was a triumph and seen it awarded the Oscar too, so there was a part of me that expected greatness just to happen, even though I did try to come to the film with my own open mind. The plot does start with a separation as the title suggests but it uses this as the base to tell a story leading up to and after an event and it is mostly around this that the film orientates itself.The telling of this story and the investigation into the event is very tightly focused and it isn't really driven by revelations or plot twists, although in a way it does have these. The main driver for the film is how information and situations change character's perceptions of other and also the viewer's perception of them and their actions and motivations. This is what kept me engaged because it wasn't just a matter of \"someone did something\" but that this new information cast a light onto a character that made everyone think slightly differently. It sounds simple but it works very well because it means it is constantly subtly changing and shifting as you watch. The actual event itself does have certainly cultural aspects which may mean it will not make total sense to people such as myself who are not familiar with the culture, so there will be cases where the viewer finds themselves with thoughts such as \"why doesn't he/she just etc\"; there is a certain need to go with these and in the cases I had, there are cultural things that the film doesn't explain (and nor should it really).With such a focus on characters and their motivations and actions, it is important that the performances are good and by and large they are. Everyone convinces in their characters and, despite cultural differences, makes things recognizable as being associated with people generally \u2013 not Iranians specifically. Maadi is probably the best here as he makes his actions and feelings very clear and even as perception of him changes, his character technically doesn't \u2013 he is the same person. Although Hatami has the posters, I think that Bayat did the better job as her character is more complex and more engaging \u2013 although Hatami is still very good and tells us a lot about her character with very small touches. Hosseini is also very good and his character is difficult but engages because he makes sense, he seems real \u2013 you may not like him as a person, but you can understand why he is the way he is without it being overly explained. The two children (Farhadi and the little girl) were also very good \u2013 very natural and convincing. Direction of the performances is strong but the film still has plenty of very well framed shots and it looks crisp and clean throughout.Overall this film probably has been a bit too over-hyped for its own good because it isn't the second coming or a film that will blow you away and as such some expecting this may be disappointed. However it is a strong engaging story that works because of how well written and performed the characters are and how the drama keeps the perception of them and their actions changing and moving. It is very well made and it impressed me by how such a small domestic drama could hold me like it was a much bigger thriller of sorts.",

            "content": "This is what all drama films should be. I went into this movie not knowing anything. The intro credits showed some names, I didn't recognize a single one of them. Doesn't matter.I take it back, this film is what all movies should be. It's built around a script and a solid story, not on bankable names, famous faces and such. It's a story about something entirely new, not something that is en vogue right now (zombies, terrorism, vampires, etc.) It tells a universal story, one of marriage and divorce, one of loyalty to one's principles or to one's family, making the characters having to choose between very difficult choices - father or wife for Nader, mother or father for his daughter, debtor's jail and financial ruin or blood money and sin, truth or lies, and all the dancing in the gray in the middle.This film is specifically set in a particular context, modern-day Iran, not something that is set in anywhereville, devoid of any references, nor does it choose Iran just as a backdrop to tell a story. Iran, its culture and legal system, is the setting and so the characters have to play within the rules of that game. Iran here is the chessboard. Setting the story elsewhere would've made it an entirely different film, even if the ideas of this film are universal.There are so many layers here - a legal system that puts the accusers and defendants front and center without any lawyers, courts that do swear in witnesses before testimony, letting them tell the court the truth, half-truths and lies with the judge to decide, there's the legal power of the judge to hold people in contempt but also the informal power of people to beg for clemency, there's a completely informal, cultural system of settlements done outside the legal system, then there's religion and the Quran, where defendants who may lie to their spouses, friends or the court system have serious reservations about lying under oath or accepting blood money.Note: The subtitles I read used the word \"blood money\" to refer to the payment made by a defendant to a victim or victim's family to settle a case, in this case a miscarriage. The term \"blood money\" is also used (in some translations) for bad or cursed money that was gained through criminal means or deceit. In this case, the victim refused to accept a settlement because she could not swear under oath that she lost her fetus in the confrontation. Lying under oath would, in this culture, risk her living daughter's health or well-being. You do not need to know all these cultural details because the film presents them to you, not in an expositional way, but in a real life way. \"I can't take that (bad) money, what if something happens to my daughter?\" The intertwining of all these layers, customs, laws and traditions, makes this a really interesting story. A purely legal drama done with courts and lawyers would not have been that interesting. A purely mediator-based story about two parties arguing for settlement would not have been better. I wish more filmmakers would watch this film and learn. I see a lot of mediocre films and directors hiding behind the excuse of small budgets.",

The acting of the two male lead roles is particularly excellent, with some moments of genuinely convincing and sudden violence.Likewise the cinematography is excellent with impressive shooting taking place in all parts of the film, and you really do become immersed in the conflict, thanks to a flowing and coherent narrative and an engaging story.So why do I not agree with the average 8.5 current rating on IMDb? Well, despite the film dealing with its subject matter with flair, the story itself falls a little bit flat in that ultimately its just a story about a domestic conflict that, for want of a better term, grows arms and legs and becomes bigger than the sum of its parts. Its just a story about an accident where the parties disagree and therefore it never takes off in any meaningful sense but rather ambles along in a plodding fashion until the film ends, suddenly, without anything having really been resolved.Some might argue this is representative of the complexity of the issues involved and I wouldn't disagree with that, but as a viewer this is a little unsatisfying and although I enjoyed it, this film does not warrant the place among the 'greats' that its current rating affords it. I would recommend it to anyone and it will provide ample food for thought, but then so does an episode of Big Brother if you're determined to think about why people do what they do in complex social situations involving different people with different opinions.You won't regret watching this film, but I'd be surprised if you are blown away as well.",

It made me feel uncomfortable, though there is no violence of even one discomforting scene, it did make me feel a little untruthful and left me with a quilt of being dishonest too at times.It's a film that is realistic all through and thanks to the makers and actors. Oh, so fine realistic acting is something which is rare. And thanks to the director Asghar Farhadi who has given us a film that is very honest in making and in portrayal too. To envision the whole reaction of a character is first, we must be in that character's position to empathise with him/her and then write the emotion. Then get some actor to show us exactly what we need from him. Now Asghar had envisioned the whole of it and did it brilliantly.It's unbelievably real right form the word go and thanks for the cameraman who has done an outstanding job. Just look at the beginning scene where the couple walk out and we understand that it is a real place and not a set. It's difficult to make films in a country that is typically still fundamental and fanatical like Iran. I don't mean to offend Iran people but I seriously think Iran has to come to terms with freedom of speech and expression. Now, the whole film that looks so real is made with a shoe string budget of $25000 that is just nearly 12.5 lakh rupees. How many stories can we tell with such money, very very few. So it's all in writing and planning of execution and that's what this film shows. Casting is greatly done and acting is supreme by the cast.Yet, above all that, it's honesty that the film is meant with. It's hard to bequeath any emotion that any character underwent in this trial of \"A Separation\". Editing is supremely done and even as the credits kept on rolling, it made me yearn for more. I wanted to know whom the girl chose, is it the father or the mother. It's a real tough deal to get a whole story being revolved around an accident and then try to make it really engaging. All it takes is good writing and good acting. 'Separation has now I believe deserved all the accolades it has won, and I wish such films to be coming out more from Iran.A separation is not a film that separates you from it. It's a film that makes you a part of it and engages you as a viewer.

            "content": "A Separation is an Iranian drama following the breakdown of a marriage. The wife wants to leave Iran with their daughter for a better life, while the husband refuses to go since he needs to look after his father, who has Alzheimers. Just read that simple set up and watch it. A Separation will knock you off your feet. It looks like just another marriage drama. It is so much more than that. The film is slightly slow paced at first, but once it gets going it doesn't pause for breath. Despite being a simple story with no big shocks, no massive emotional breakdowns, no explosions and a story which stays entirely grounded in the real world, it's more intense than most action films and more compelling than any Summer Blockbuster. The film is realistic and everything feels like it could happen, and this is enhanced by the excellent direction. The strength of the direction is that it's completely invisible and its devastating effects hit the audience with brilliant subtlety. Even if you don't normally watch foreign language films you should be able to relate to this. It's a universal film with, thanks to its complexity, something for everyone.The acting is outstanding and brilliantly raw, even from the young actress. What needs to be talked about the most is the script. Every character is fully developed, believable and sympathetic to the very end. Even when you don't agree with their choices, you can understand them. The characters are hardly even characters in the end. They're human. The film is morally complex, consistently unpredictable, endlessly tense and emotionally devastating. It's a very rewarding film to watch, but it's no easy ride. It is a pretty extraordinary movie and it completely deserved the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 2011. It's one of the better films of the decade so far and far better than many films nominated for Best Picture in the decade so far. Although not a perfect movie, in some ways that makes it more effective as it catches you off guard and then once the drama gets going it becomes really hard to watch. This is intense stuff, but it's well worth watching.9/10",

            "content": "This year's Oscar winning film in the Best Foreign Language category is Asghar Farhadi's fifth feature, the absolutely thrilling 'A Separation'. The victory in February marked the first time a director has taken an Academy Award back to Iran.Set in modern day Tehran, Nader (Peyam Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are on the verge of divorce. Simin wants to leave Iran with her daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) after struggling for 18 months to get a visa. Nader wants to stay with his father, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Unable to compromise, Simin leaves her husband to live with her parents. Termeh, played by the director's daughter, decides to lead the battle her way. Staying with her dad, she hopes, will force her mother to remain in the country and return to the family home.Feeling solitude's pressure, Nader hires the pregnant, lower-class Razieh to take care of his ailing, demanding father. Razieh works against her husband's will and knowledge. In contrast to Simin, she's a religious woman desperate to support her unemployed spouse who is, if it couldn't get any worse, weakened by the threat of jail by his creditors.One day Nader returns home from work to find his father tied up to his bed, on the floor and about to die. Razieh (Sareh Bayat) is nowhere to be found. When she returns to her now furious employer, they engage in a struggle with unexpected and unfortunate consequences.'A Separation' is a simple yet layered drama, paced like a thriller. Each memorable scene is spectacularly acted and so naturally that audiences will feel like these characters could be their next door neighbors.It's a separation of a couple with different priorities; Simin's future is up against Nader's bitter reality. The only character trying to hold everything together is the torn-between-parents Termeh, an almost universal and familiar fate for crumbling families. It's a separation of classes; the educated elite vs. religious laborers. Both struggle to survive regardless of the moral or physical conditions that may threaten them. In between the troubled tales, Farhadi drops in events which provide a glimpse into what lies beneath society's cover.'A Separation' is like a literary masterpiece printed on film. It triggers different interpretations and is a genuine reflection on the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other. Questions abound over honesty, compromise, total innocence and guilt. It's also a portrait of a city, misinterpreted by many as purely fanatic and radical.This is 2012's best film so far, the kind that you probably won't be able to separate from, maybe forever.Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

Basically middle class Iranian couple Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are on the verge of divorce, despite still loving each other somewhat Simin has exit visa valid for only forty days and he wants to move for a better life with ten year old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), but Nader will not leave his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) who suffering Alzheimer's disease, despite him not knowing who he is most of the time. Simin eventually moves out and goes to live with her parents, Termeh stays with her father in an action to try and bring her per divorcing parents back together, and he meanwhile follows advice from Simin hires a man called Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini) to be his father's carer while during the day he is at work, but Hojjat can't make it on the first day. Instead Hojjat's wife Razieh (Sareh Bayat) is desperate for the money, being mother to infant daughter Somayeh (Kimia Hosseini), and shows up to do the work, a few days pass and she continues in her husband's continued absence, and between her and Nader an incident occurs that could threaten their place in the community. Eventually all adults and children make their decisions as what is the best thing to do for themselves, of course the decisions bring justice, humanity and well-being into consideration as well, the poignant end of the film is the divorce between Nader and Simin being finalised, and Termeh is left alone to decide which parent she wants to live, the parents waiting in the character lasts through the end credits. Also starring Shirin Yazdanbakhsh as Simin's Mother, Kimia Hosseini as Somayeh and Merila Zare'i as Miss Ghahraii. The performances are all fine, I admit I lost my way a little with what was going on between particular characters, but overall I got the gist of the story, it is an interesting take on a domestic situation and how all facets of it will change and affect others in the mix, a watchable drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

I never felt so uninvolved in a movie like in this one Even the (praised) parts related to the Iranian culture and religion weren't something illuminating.

            "content": "*Spoilers Contained Within*The first hour or so of this film had me a bit skeptical of the high praise lavished on this film- the plot seemed to trudge along with no real twists or surprises. Yet director Asghar Farhadi is no slouch and knows exactly why every scene plays out for the exact duration that it does, and the pay-offs come in the second hour.Still, this isn't just a typical suspense film where the trick lies in the \"reveal\" of the third act, as those reveals are only one piece of the puzzle. Indeed, my impression is that the moral ambiguity brimming under the surface as a result of the narrative twists and turns is the real substance of the film. No character is without his or her foibles- even the relatively innocent children make decisions that arguably make complicated matters even more labyrinthine. Because of this, the viewer can never truly be sure which character to side with and I suspect this is one reason why it was initially hard for me to become engrossed in the movie. That the filmmakers managed to create an engaging story in which each character makes complicated/morally tenuous decisions for completely understandable reasons is a major feat- I can think of only a handful of movies lacking a protagonist to \"root for,\" while still utterly engaging their audience, and even fewer still which do so successfully.There's a lot to digest after the film, though no big action scenes or Oscar-baity breakdowns. The issues raised may be indicative of the issues facing Iranian society, but can be generalized to reflect societal issues in any community globally. The acting is also top-notch and not overly showy and I feel it benefits from not featuring any recognizable actors (to an American audience, at any rate) in more fully immersing the viewer.This isn't a knockout film that wows and dazzles, but it is an intricately built work that deftly pulls viewers' allegiances from one character to another in an incredibly understated way.",

Mr Kalari (movie's Director of Photography) has an extremely important role (which may be neglected) in this film; His pictures are very real and generally have a fast tempo that corresponds to actors' acting. But one of the few faults of this movie in my view is insignificant role of music , although it (lack of music power) can not be felt easily and director have filled the gap with good dialogues and excellent acting. Mr Farhadi's movies go deep in the heart of Iranian lifestyle and generally are true representatives of this complex society, so if you can watch \"Jodayie Nader az Simin\", never miss it.",

            "content": "Farhadi is not only the best filmmaker in Iranian cinema of today, but he is also one of the most important currently active directors in the world. His last film before \"A Separation\", \"About Eli\" (original title: Darbareye Eli), was surely a very good film (perhaps even better than \"A Separation\"), but I had understood that I adore it much more than a very good film. After watching \"A Separation\" (Originally known as \"Jodayiye Nader az Simin\", literally means \"The Separation of Nader and Simin\"), I know why I respect these films so much.The reason is that Farhadi's movies are not the best of their genre; They seem the only films in their genre. Farhadi, An avant-garde director/auteur, both in content and style, is the inventor of situation dramas which are made in a way that you think you are watching a noir movie or a thriller. His instrument in shocking you is so simple; the reality. If Italian New-realists and Iranian great director, Abbas Kiarostami, used reality to gain the passions of the viewers, Farhadi used it to shock them. Unlike Michael Haneke, who uses the elements of horror and violence in his dramas, Farhadi uses simple daily behaviors of people to terrify the viewers from simple things which are really terrifying; things such as prejudice, anger, distances, egoism, misunderstanding, fear and perhaps the most important one, lie.Perhaps the most interesting thing, is that the reality which is shown by Farhadi, is in a very dramatic and cinematic form. Unlike most of the realist filmmakers, Farhadi is not careless to the power of classic storytelling and film making. Directors such as Kiarostami uses simple camera working and unprofessional actors which sometimes seems a little pretentious. They are genius by their own, but it is a fact that they cannot make realist film if they are forced to make a classic movie. Unlike them, Farhadi works with the usual elements of classic cinema but in a way that you get it so surprisingly real. His mastery in obtaining realistic performances from professional actors, his obsessive attention to the details and his strong attention to camera and editing, are unique.It is not important what is the name of the film, \"A Separation\" or \"About Eli\". Any film of Farhadi is a Unique valuable peace of art. It is the singer, not the song.",

            "content": "2012 Academy award winner for best foreign language picture, Iranian social drama A SEPARATION follows the legal struggle between apparently wealthy, middle class Nader (Peyman Moadi) and housekeeper Razieh (Sareh Bayat), after a dispute leads to tragic consequences. Recently separated from wife Simin (Leila Hatami), juggling a career and responsibility to his 11 year old daughter, and caring for his alzheimer's stricken father, Nader is a man with a very full plate. Razieh is equally burdened by her pregnancy and the need to earn money following her husband's redundancy, while her incredibly devout religious beliefs only seem to make things more difficult. Ultimately when their two lives clash, such a frustrating situation is born that the film is at times exhausting to watch, yet always completely compelling.A SEPARATION is a glimpse into a world not often seen by foreign audiences, the day to day minutiae of life in relatively affluent Iranian society, where class and religious beliefs come into conflict in unexpected ways. There's something so absurd and darkly humorous about so many of the realities these people must endure, particularly in regards to religion, yet never does the film feel phony or forced. As each character gets drawn into the dilemma more and more and the blame game spirals out of control, so too does the narrative style constantly circle back on itself while never nearing any kind of resolution. A SEPARATION is maddening by design, representative of what seems to be an incredibly intricate and baffling bureaucratic system, compounded by archaic religious doctrine and difficult social politics. It's by no means an easy film, but for anyone willing to step outside their comfort zone, it's a rewarding experience, with much to take in and no doubt discuss afterwards.tinribs27.wordpress.com",

It flows really well and the simplicity of the events (and the script as a whole) makes the movie very believable and close to one's emotion and experience. It also shows that you don't need millions of dollars (which is generally spent on blowing up buildings, shooting a whole bunch of 'bad' guys, and stripping an 18 year old somewhere along the storyline) to make a good movie.

            "content": "With the massive availability of entertainment at the click of a mouse, all national cinemas need to innovate in order to stay in the race as the competition to produce 'excellent films' is becoming tougher day by day. This is also true about many Asian cinemas which have hitherto relied heavily on exotic elements in order to win awards at film festivals as well as viewers in cinemas. At this juncture, it is a positive news that Iranian cinema has moved from its ubiquitous depiction of children. This is a constructive development for those who closely monitor its development as there are other better stories to be told than producing feature films about the lives of cute little ones. After watching the initial five minutes of \"A Separation\" nobody would fail to understand the reason why a large part of Western world got interested in it. For a vast majority, it clicked as it has 'divorce' as its main focus. However, the film doesn't waste any time to change its principal focus to concentrate more on mistakes made by two protagonists : a man who cares more about his father and his independent wife who has her own beliefs. What is important to note is that both the parties are equally right about issues related to modernity and tradition. The film presents a primordial ethical dilemma : What to choose, How to choose and Why to choose ? More and more Asian societies are confronted with dilemma of this kind because as small children, it is extremely difficult to take proper care of old people. As a screen writer, director Asghar Farhadi has superb imagination as there are various twists and turns in the story but his film is dotted with moments where minor yet crucial things don't seem to fit well. Like all films, \"A Separation\" too has its fair share of glaring inconsistencies : How can a young girl child have the kind of maturity which one expects from grown up children especially in her manner of answering questions and putting questions ? How can a physically feeble old man suffering from Alzheimer's disease have the ability to go out all alone on a busy street ? Apart from these minor glitches, there are some scenes where deliberate padding is equally evident which somewhat lessens the seriousness of this film. For example : The adolescent girl reading a passage about class differences in Iranian society. Although the film is replete with 'd\u00e9nouements', one better than the other, the film doesn't have any other \"wow factor\". Nevertheless, it succeeds in winning numerous hearts due to its humane subject matter. As a film is the subjective affair of viewers, it can be rightly said that generalizations wouldn't work in the case of his film as all people have the right to behave in the manner which suits their personalities. In hindsight, this film is a grim reminder of all the family issues which the Western world seems to have forgotten. It doesn't shy away in presenting its philosophical underpinnings. It is as if all the 'ifs' and 'buts' of ordinary people's mundane lives have been rolled in a single story to deal with ethical issues which director Asghar Farhadi valiantly attempts to tackle. On a lighter note, if a humorous \"Making Of\" is appended to end credits, there is all possibility of seeing everybody involved in the production of this film especially actors laughing with joy over the phenomenal success achieved by this film. Finally, no review will do justice to this film if one doesn't mention the plight of two innocent, little girls who have to suffer a lot in this film due to their parents' capricious as well as irresponsible behavior. May the children never suffer anywhere in the world !!!!",

The only thing I would say is that the film is a bit long, and seemed to go in circles for a bit, but is otherwise engaging.The acting is amazing, with the actors and actresses really giving emotion to their performances. Moaadi and Hatami as the separated husband and wife show the tension between their characters really well. Moaadi does really well with the debating scenes, as he has to argue before a judge multiple times. Hatami is also really good at delivering her lines, and the portrayal of her character's emotions definitely shines through. Bayat does a pretty good job too, though I did not really connect with her character.The script is well written and gives me more of a sense of Iranian culture. The film has a lot of speech and it was pretty incredible to watch them argue and debate about various events. The delivery was key, and they managed to pull it off. But because of the many arguments, it can be a bit hard to follow and at times is a bit heavy.Also, the story is pretty complex because of the many plots involved, and like the few International movies I watched before, there is no real conclusion. I was pretty peeved at the ending, but once I thought over it, I realized how conditioned I am to Hollywood films that I want a sense of closure every time.

I was utterly enthralled with this movie, a tale from Iran that showed us that all societies work much the same at the family level. People get fed up with each other, children complicate loving relationships and the legal system is an almost impenetrable maze.I learned that Iranians suffer just the same way we do in the Western World and that government ideologists don't really impact our day to day lives as much as the maniacal press would have us believe.In this touching and poignant tale we are treated to a level of quality in the acting that I didn't think was possible from this country. There is a gentleness to it that carries you along, helping you identify with the characters and the emotions that they are able to transfer to you.A truly transformative film with everything presented in an understated, yet paradoxically stark, style.If the director can keep his head after all of the acclamation heaped on him, we should be lining up to see his next effort. For fans of this type of movie I would recommend trolling through some of the Chinese movies that have been released in the past few years. Many deal with real relationships like this and the impact of the incredible social changes that have knocked them sideways.

            "content": "\"Jodaeiye Nader az Simin\" is an Iranian movie from 2011, so these slightly over two hours will have their 10th anniversary next year already. How time flies! And probably it happened already depending on when you read this review. Feels like yesterday that this came out. The writer and director here is of course Asghar Farhadi, who launched his career back at the end of the 20th century and has turned into one of the most renowned filmmakers from his country now. Many immediately think of Jafar Panahi when it comes to Iran, but well Farhadi, who will soon turn 50, managed the impressive achievement that two of his films won the Best Foreign Language Oscar and that is really something to be proud of, no matter if you care about awards or not. This one here was the film that did so first and I think it is also better-received than the second, but yeah, only because this one here got an extremely good reception and \"The Salesman\" \"only\" got a strong recepption you could say. But we talked about that one on another occasion I think, so now let's focus on this one here. The English title \"A Separation\" is much easier to remember by the way and does not include the names like the original Iranian title. Although it may be a bit misleading because, aside from the male being named first, you could think that these two are equals in this film. The poster here implies the same. Well, it is certainly not the case because the male lead has far more screen time and is without a doubt the only lead performance in this film. There is also at least one other female character who has as much screen time and probably even more significance than the (ex-)wife character. Maybe it was Leila Hatami's memorable red hair in here that put more emphasis on her. The male lead is Payman Maadi. Sorry for not going much into detail about these two and barely mentioning their names even, but I cannot say at all that I am familiar with Iranian cinema and what they have done before and after this film. Just check out the cast list for that. And their bodies of work if you care. As for Farhadi, his successes in Iran also resulted in an international breakthrough and he got to work with the like of B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo or also more recently the Oscar-winning couple Javier Bardem and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. Never realized how close her name is to Bejo's, in terms of letter amount and accents too, even if she has only in her first name. But they are also almost the same age. Okay. Now really back to this film, let's not get drifted away here. Obviously it's in Iranian, which means you will need subtitles if you want to enjoy the whole thing. I mean it is really unusual to see a film from this part of the world so high in the imdb top250, almost inside the top100 even, and also, probably partially as a consequence, have over 200k ratings on the most western of all movie website. Is it justified? Maybe not. It is a good film and certainly closer to the attribute \"great\" than to the attribute \"mediocre\" or even \"weak\", but still a bit on the overrated site. As you can see from my rating. Nonetheless I do not bear a grudge or anything. There are worse films out there having received the same degree of accolades and recognition.Now let me discuss a bit the contents of the film. As you can see from the title of my review already, this is absolutelly not a feel-good movie from any perspective. On the contrary, you could say that some pretty depressing events take place here. One would be a woman losing her baby. Then we have a demented old man who almost dies and does not really perceive the world around him anymore. At least not the way he once did. Then we have a marriage in ruins. Then we have constant legal trouble and people potentially having to go to jail. Then we have all kinds of lies. Also we have people with such severe financial problems that they must be scared somebody could do something to their daughter. We have an emotionally struggling teenager who has to pick between mom and dad because he can stay only with one of them. This is basically the ending of the film. We do not find out the exact decision, but it is still alright and maybe even a better ending this way. Some kind of open ending. It also came a bit surprising because you do not really see the parents vying for the girl's affection or so. But maybe they respect each other too much for that and just go on with their lives. There is enough happening anyway. And it was the epitome of a family drama film really and the good news is that almost all of it feels very realistic. I struggled a bit with the moment/sequence when we have the woman who lost the baby talk to the female title character about the truth and what happened exactly. Why would she? Anyway, it kinds shows that everybody is just a victim of their situation and they do not truly hate each other. Oh well, maybe the father of the unborn sometimes carries hate inside. He is an aggressive and emotional guy for sure and I wondered if he would maybe commit a crime ith a gun or so eventually, maybe against the protagonist, maybe against his child in an act of revenge, but Farhadi does not go down that route, instead keeps the aggressions mostly non-physical. Good choice probably. I found that one statement interesting when he says something to the male protagonist that he cannot speak like him. They are just from very different parts of society. Also when near the end he says something like what he thinks the female title character thinks about him. It was tense all along and the film did not feel as long as it actually was. I mean it did not fly by either, but it's alright. Most of it felt very authentic, also that there is no closure at all and every time one challenge is mastered or at least over, then the next (drama) is waiting right around the corner. I must say I struggle a bit here with mentioning specific scenes or plot twists to further elaborate on and that is not too often the case, but I would not say it is a negative criticism or anything. The film did feel smooth overall. Maybe it was one twist too many with how she could not have fallen down like that physically or with how she may have been to a doctor or with how the car accident probably caused it etc. but it's alright. I think the girl was perhaps a bit too smart for her own good with how she realizes what actually happened, but that is fine too. This film also shows us there are no saints. The male protagonist seemed kind too initially, but we find out he really knew about the pregnancy which he denies at court. So everybody is \"guilty\" one way or the other, even the old demented man because his running away was the reason why she lost the baby. Or the female title character because she simply left the apartment and this way only made it necessary to find somebody else to take care of the old man. But yeah, \"guilt\" is definitely too much in this context. let's just say that everybody added their share to this misery, some more others less. Also you can debate what the international title implies the most. From the plot summary here on imdb it could sound as if it can only be the separation between Nader and Simin, but I think there are other options too. The girl's separation at the end from one of her parents plays a big role. The mother's separation from her unborn child palys a big role. And you could certainly mention one or two more possibilities. By the way, who stole the money actually? My guess was the teenage daughter, also with how fond she was when her dad allowed her to keep a small amount earlier, but somehow I missed that. Did the woman really take it? She seemd so eager to prove her innocence. Anyway, does it really matter. This was basically a domino effect to catastrophe you could say. One final thing before I finish the review: I think this film's biggest strength is maybe that it ellaborates on issues that also could have happened in other countries, but still gives us some smart background information about the Iranian context. The best example here is how somebody responsible for a woman losing her child could be prosecuted for manslaughter. Tough story. By the way, the judge was so calm in a funny manner. Unintentionally funny. Or how they struggle a lot with getting divorced actually with the very first scene. I like that prologue by the way. Nice introduction. I still wondered why they get divorced. I guess staying married despite the physical distance is not an option in Iran. Maybe in other countries the same. Of course, also the situation in which a woman works at a single man's home and how that is morally questionable. Not only when her man gets really mad as he finds out, but also how she did not tell her husband because she knew what would happen. And then of course the final scene with the Koran. No elaboration from my side here. It is pretty self-explanatory in terms of the role religion plays. However, there are also many moments and segments when Iran feels more progressive than I would have thought. It's not an anarchist country or anything. There are clean rules and structures. So it is also a decent watch if you want to find out a bit about the country and its citizens. Overall, this was the second time I watched this movie, first time on the big screen I believe and I do not regret it one bit. I give it a positive recommendation without any hesitation. Also it is probably a film that is not much better at a big theater screen (even if I am glad that is where I saw it today and boo for nobody else being there, even if I like having the room for myself) than on your local television. Most important thing is you watch it, no matter where. Thumbs-up for everything here, including Farhadi's efforts and also Maadi's lead performance. But all the actors were good.",

            "content": "A Separation is an Iranian drama film about Nader and Simin who have been married for 14 years and together they have the eleven-year-old daughter Termeh. Simin wants to emigrate, as Nader did not want when he has his father who suffers from Alzheimer's in Iran. Simin applying for a divorce, but the application is rejected, and then she moved back to her parents. When Nader working on day and Simin moved so there is no one to take care of his father. Nader hires Razieh then, a young pregnant woman that should take care of his father on the day. One day Nader comes home to find his father unconscious on the floor with one arm tied to the bed, Razieh is not in sight of the house, she will be back later, but then Nader throw her out, he does not want to do with her. Razieh must go into the emergency room because she gets severe pain in the stomach, it turns out that she had a miscarriage and Nader is accused of the murder of the fetus but he denies knowing that he knew Razieh was pregnant.This movie is really well made \u200b\u200bwith fantastic actor. It feels a little different with a movie in Farsi and they take a while before you get used to it. This whole movie is filmed in absolutely fantastic angles, every scene is a work of art in itself, this will increase the score significantly! Almost every actor is impressive and there's actually not a bad actor. The film was a hit with critics and gained a lot of positive reviews, it has for example 95 MetaCore on 41 reviews, making it the film with the best ratings in 2011.Best actor according to me: Ali-Asghar Shahbazi for the role of Nader's father.",

But people are people and their troubles and heartaches might seem surprisingly familiar no matter where they come from. Iran with it's fundamentalist approach to Islam, definitely seems a mind-boggling place for a Westerner, but in spite of hijabs, chadors and religious beards, there is so much more than that. Intellectual couple torn by the duty towards a child and a senile parent, and another struggling, in debt couple who's last resort seems to be drowning in the boiling cauldron of showy piety. And with them and next to them just people trying to live normal life in less than normal circumstances. The same could apply to many countries, including ours, but this movie shows this single story with focused, almost brutal calm. When it all ends with the final separation, the viewer feels that gentle throb in his chest, the one that makes eyes misty. A slice of humanity.",

            "content": "There is only one thing that is extraordinary in this film: the ubiquitous prevalence of the colour grey, or of subdued colours like brown or green. The faces are greyish, the houses are grey inside and outside, the cars are grey, the hospital's waiting room is grey, the dresses and chadors are grey or at least black (!). All female persons, including the 5 years old daughter of the cleaning lady, wear a chador. It is only at the very end, while the camera depicts the scenery in the hospital, at least one young women appears in normal street gown.I don't believe that this colour reduction was the intention of the director or cameraman. This grey here is not really a symbol for the hopeless position of the protagonists, it is not like the blueish prevalence in Jean-Pierre Melville's \"Le samoura\u00ef\" with Alain Delon.This film is an intimate play, and not a bad one; however the absence of suspense at least half of the time creates some mild boredom in the spectator and the wish to see some setting in the nature - and not only the ones with battling and chopping adults.I remember another Iranian film, a much better on i.m.o., wherein a man goes to the hillside to commit suicide. There is currently some hype about NADER AND SIMIN, but I remain convinced that it will be forgotten in a few years.",

            "content": "\"I've lost everything -- and you're scaring me of a sentence? Fear God!\" This line appears to be taken out of an ancient anecdote, but it's taken from this very movie. A masterpiece, a bitter drama, comparable to Hollywood dramas. It's shot like a documentary, and focuses on a \"very recent\" issue, according to the director: Divorce. Although divorce is not a \"recent\" thing, it was a taboo and stigmatic not many years ago, not only in Iran, but almost in every country. These days divorce is something that happened at least to one person you're closely related too. Some people, especially divorce attorneys, make thousands out of it. \"Post-divorce drama\" is a newly-coined term, cured by a weekend in Thailand or drinking to death -- it's not the only \"trauma\" that comes with divorce. Divorce is a change of lifestyle, and a very bad change, and this movie is trying to depict what might happen if someone can't overcome it -- divorce may significantly affect other people's lives too. For that matter, everyone can empathize with this movie, no matter where he's been bred or what he has been taught. And that's the beauty of this movie.But this movie has an extra bonus for people from countries with decaying economy, such as most eastern-Europe countries, Iran itself and various other places that failed the battle with imperialism. And another extra bonus for people who experienced divorce or a very dysfunctional family, like the reviewer himself.And finally I'd like to point out that if it wasn't for Hosseini's brilliant performance, this movie wouldn't be a success.",

            "content": "I believe one of the main causes that make us award the so called \"Foreign movie\" is their fresh cultural perspective of life that it adds to the cinema heritage. we can't but appreciate and honor those who present us this great gift to cinema combining it with artistic achievement. and that was the case with Fahradi and his (A Separation). the Iranian cinema is well known of it's excellent cinema, even though it could be regarded globally as not popular, but I believe that the effort made such as the one in \"a separation\" shades a lot of light to this original cinema. A separation is an original movie, I guess that at less is a fact beyond discussion. It's simply had every thing a good movie can present; it's engaging, vivid, well written, and had a marvelous acting cast and screenplay.. the movie is a social drama prospect, a movie that forges out questions more than answers, and even though it puts the audience form the first scene in the judge chair,I don't believe that was to ask for our presumption or judgment, rather it seeks to have us only as a witnesses. As audience we are in a very difficult position in this case, for the fact that we witness a very complicated case of constant dispute between the couples Simin and Nadar over their daughter, and then it got more complicated when another couple shows up and accuse Nadar to be the cause of the wife apportion. I should admit that, the intensity of the movie may bather me a little bit, because it keeps the one intense all through the movie, in fact we may notice that the movies scenario is built mainly on these disputing dialogs. Yet, there's so much things fascinated me as well, the things that attracts me the most was first of all is the screenplay; the camera shouts are very intentional and expressive,the acting is superb, thank god not over reacted nether cold and flat, a thing even great movies slip in sometimes. the writing and scenario deserve no doubt an award, because event thought the story is basically simple and linear, the movie's threads are well compose, so it may keep the ones breath on hold to the last minuet of the play. No doubt Fahradi presents a very committed serious cinema, and the best testimony of this fact is its frequent understatement such as \"-I'd prefer that my child do not grow up under these circumstances, as a mother I has this right -under what conditions? what conditions ma'am??\" the work as a whole implies a lot of figurative elements, and could bears a lot of different interpretations. at last I guess I have to say something about the thematic point of the work, as a social drama, the movie presents two ways of life that we might lead and leaves to us and Terma (the daughter) to chose between them, which are; \"N- she had to stay to learn! S- to learn about what stubbornness and confrontations! N- No, so she could learn not to be cowered like u!!\" what dazzle me the most in these dialogs is it's strikingly honesty. the ending of the movie leave the parents at the door of the court room waiting to know the decision of their daughter of which of them she will chose to live with... who would you think she'll chose? what would' you chose?",

            "review_title": "Cinema doesn't get more realistic than this !!!!!",
            "content": "I think it will be slightly unfair to call A Separation just a film. This for me was more than a film, it was an experience. The film is littered with moments where the line dividing fiction and reality in the minds of the viewers get completely dissolved. Any one of us can be involved in the situations that the characters in the movie have to deal with. Any one of us can picture ourselves in the shoes of any of the characters. The director Asghar Farhadi excels in making us a part of their lives and putting us firmly in the middle of the struggles and dilemmas that the characters go through and compels us to mentally imagine what we would have done in a similar situation. The film at the basic level is a family drama about a husband and wife going through tough times in their marriage with their young teenage daughter caught in the middle. Both the parties have arguments which are completely understandable. Every character is real and the points of views can be easily felt by the viewers due to the masterful storytelling. However Farhadi elevates the film from being just a drama to a subtle social commentary of life in Iranian society in the 21st century which is still tightly enveloped by religious practices and beliefs. Farhadi subtly shows the status and the position of women in his country's society. He shows how even progressive thinkers are bound to feel suffocated at times due to the boundaries and barriers that they are subjected to. What is a sin and what is not in the eyes of God, is a question that looms large in the conscience of the general mass. What he shows is how people can hold assumptions about certain people because of the class of society that they belong to.The brilliant screenplay puts characters in positions where class and background get distorted and they engage in conversations and quarrels by bringing all the issues at the forefront. Farhadi asks us to make up our mind without giving answers himself, and he does so without making any character tough to sympathise with.A Separation boasts of one of the most masterful performances that I have ever seen from an entire cast. Everyone is brilliant , but for me this film belongs to Payman Maadi and Sarina Farhadi. Both of them convey everything that they have to with their eyes and gestures and when they have to speak, their vocal delivery is perfect.The film is an absolute treat with masterful directing, masterful acting and an absolutely amazing script. I generally don't use this word very loosely, but for A Separation, I think the word 'masterpeice' can be justifiably used.",

Her husband, Nader, cannot bring himself to leave his father, who has Alzheimer's disease and is being cared for by the family. Simin seeks a divorce and appears before a magistrate/\"interrogator\" who denies her request and encourages her to stay and try to work out the problems. Instead, she leaves (temporarily?). Nader tries one caretaker who doesn't work out, and then hires a woman (Razeh) who needs the money for her own marriage but is hampered by her Islamic orthodoxy (e.g., helping the father change after being incontinent, let alone being in the apartment with him absent male supervision) and hampered by other initially vague problems. Razeh's husband is upset about this arrangement, but needs the income to keep him from prison after being pursued by debtors. I'll stop here for the sake of not revealing spoilers that should be experienced in viewing this remarkable film. As all have noted, the acting is superb at an Academy Award level- what struck me the most was the 11yo girl's ability to show a range of emotions from tween hostility/angst to deep despair. The two men, who end up antagonists, barely keep their anger at bay, and the actors convey their emotions in vivid intensity. The director, Asghar Farhadi, uses a hand-held camera, and frames so many scenes in a manner that accentuates the tension (e.g., a shot will continue lingering on a character without other action as they process the emotions that had just been evoked). Adding to the tension is the lack of a soundtrack, which Farhadi uses in other films.Throughout, the traditional mores of Islamic culture - alien to most Americans except, ironically, those from or knowledgeable of Haredi families- are depicted honestly and accurately, neither downplayed or exaggerated (per an Iranian friend with whom I watched this masterpiece). The magistrate comes across as fair, even-handed and trying his best to make sense of complex situations and adjudicate appropriately to Shariah law and to the lives of those before him. The film helps Westerners perceive Iran as a complex society that is far from the terrorist hoopla and erroneous impression of medieval justice. I suspect most Americans would be surprised to see how all this plays out- from their own experiences.From a film making perspective, I was reminded of Bergman's best in portraying relationships- between women, women vs. Men, psyche vs. Reality- with cinematic brilliance and emotional intensity. This work was well-deserved in winning the Academy Award for best foreign film, and in fact, some reviewers even suggested it was worthy of Best Picture, period. Wow.",

The story is universal, yet grounded in the reality of Iranian life, and the notions of Islamic justice. The central (father) figure is a quiet and superficially reasonable man, but utterly proud and self-contained; his wife, who originally appears less sympathetic, actually possesses the social skills to (possibly) save their situation: the gradual transfer of sympathy evoked is one of the film's achievements.

The setting was the best place in the whole world. Iran! which is show the world differences between their judge and the real thing in current. I think Farhadi is brave enough to face all probable problems, only to show what people suffer in current Tehran. The movie has a very deep emotion to show universal family problems, which may replace by other things instead of immigration and staying in homeland. I wish him the best, and I enjoy the film very much. Thanks.",

I will admit even though I knew the story was fascinating from the beginning, it does take about 15-20 minutes to finally get started. The drama between families feels so real, and to be honest I really couldn't decide who to root for. I love when movies give you decides to every coin and make it nearly impossible to root for either side. The film deserves all of the many accolades it was getting. It's a movie that will stick with you for a long time. It also makes you really appreciate the peacefulness I have in my life and how one decision can destroy your life.The title tells us the movie involves a separation, but to what extent does this separation really effect them. Well the decision for Simin to leave her husband is about as impactful as a choice as she could make. It caused a ripple effect and in return we could a family-courtroom drama that nearly rips both families apart for good. Once Nader gets accused of murder, the drama really begins. Secrets are kept and uncovered in the next hour as we all try and figure out what really has happened and who is to blame.The film is pretty much a masterpiece because of the incredible screenplay and the impeccable lead performances from the main leads. In particular I thought the daughter and mother shared some of the best scenes and the most impressive performances.+Great Drama +Thought Provoking +Who do I root for? -Bit of a slow start 8.5/10",

Another remarking fact is that I could not force my self to take sides, for Nader or Razieh who lost her child, even though we get some truths such as Razieh's confession or Termeh's intuitive thinking.

It also manages to perfectly balance the plights of several protagonists. Very few screenwriters have this capacity.If this movie reminds me of anything, it is \"Ladri di Biciclette\" (Bicycle Thieves), which has a similar seemingly \"simple\" story setup.

            "content": "A Separation (2011) :An Iranian Masterpiece attends what Kramer vs Kramer missed. I remember watching Ocsar Winner Kramer vs Kramer couple of months back and i found it little overhyped (A Very Good Film though) because the film did not really explained the real life theory between Husband and Wife and secondly the child never gets involved in thier legal fight (of course that's reasonable because he was too small). But i would have like it more if the kid had been involved in thier differences and had spoken to them personally with whatever innocence and IQ level that age of kid could have had. See, in the film the father loses his job and struggles because his wife left him and then he becomes a good and caring father but have we ever thought what if his wife had never left him? What if he had left his wife and kid? How would have they survived without him? After all he was the one who lost a standard job to take care of his child but here nobody pointed out on the mother for quitting it all of sudden without caring about her own child. That's what Kramer vs Kramer missed and that's what A Seperation attended. The story is more complex than Kramer vs Kramer for sure so there is no comparison between these 2 flicks. But the theory is correct and connected to real life and cannot be overlooked. A Separation is about a married couple Nader and Simin. Simin wants a divorce because her husband Nadir is not ready to cime with her leaving his deceased father, and thier daughter Termeh decides to stay with her father because she knows her mother will never leave without her. The plot turns into a legal case and Nadir fights to prove his innocence against charges of being responsible for a miscarriage of his Father's caretaker. At the end it's proven but then Termeh had to make a decision about with whom she want to stay, father or mother? The film ends on metaphorical and intellectual note without giving an answer but if you are smart enough you know the answer. Every conflict and issue in this film are highly realistic and intelligent. Nadir is quite a fella, i mean Bravo. The man who cares for his Father, he knows his responsibility as a son and also as a Father so he's even ready to make any sacrifice. But when he was asked to settle things pretending that he was actually guilty, he refuses like a Brave Man, even though it causes him a lot like losing his own daughter. He says, \"Termeh, if you think i am guilty then go get your mother we will pay them\". The Principles of a Man were never seen in this form. His wife was quite a confused woman because she insisted him and her daughter to leave the City, she was never seen making a clear Stand against odds. She was little coward to give in quickly because of her sentiments and thats why she was bashed couple of times by her husband and daughter as well (thats what Kramer missed). The daughter's role is fantastically written. She always chose the right path whether it is about staying with her father or lieing for him or even while leaving him when she felt he was guilty. At last she had to make a decision and that's a masterstroke from the writer leaving the scenario unanswered. But like i said if you are a smart movie buff you know her decision that she will stay with the father for 2 valid and strong reasons, one is she knows he's not guilty and he always cared for her, he even asked her to leave him for her own betterment and she knows that her Father is a real Man with Principles. And second reason is she knows that her mother will never leave the city without her. That's how you write an intelligent and brilliant film with no Errors. That's how you direct the the film by leaving a decision to audience so that they could figure it out with thier own intelligence. That's how you make a film on a relatable subject keeping everything complex, accurate yet realistic and that's how a Masterpiece is made. If you call yourself a Movie Buff who understands 'Art and Science' of Filmmaking then missing this film is a Crime.RATING - 9/10*",

Instead it's portrayed in absolute subtility.Entire movie goes in a fast pace, as I mentioned earlier the movie tells a husband and wife story, they are on the verge of their SEPARATION.

Simin wants to go abroad, but Nader feels himself unable to follow as he has to look after his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who has Alzheimer's. Daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) stays with Nader, but still wants her parents to be together. Nader hires Razieh to come and look after his house while he (Nader) is out at work, but things do not go according to plan. Razieh loses her unborn child, and her husband Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini) accuses Nader of contributing to the tragedy. The conflicts between the two families - those of Nader and Hojjat - end up in the courts, involving issues not just of justice but religious and social traditions as well. Asghar Farhadi's film is shot in documentary- style, with no musical accompaniment. Its structure can be described as elliptical; the end mirrors the beginning, depicting the difficulties of family life in a society where women have to act according to certain prescribed social and moral guidelines, while their male partners often allow belief in tradition to influence their judgment. Such attitudes are not peculiar to Farhadi's context; they prevail in other territories as well. A SEPARATION is a study in non-communication: both families are articulate, and can express their feelings through well-crafted dialog, but they do not listen to one another.

            "content": "After the breakthrough of Abbas Kiarostami and Moshen Makhmalbaf in the '90s Asghar Farhadi took over as leading man of Iranian cinema at the beginning of the new century. His film \"About Elly\" (2009) was nominated for the Oscar of best foreign language film, but did not win. \"A seperation\" (2011) had more luck and won the Oscar. This gave Farhadi access to foreign capital. His film \"Le pass\u00e9\" (2013) was financed with French capital.Central in \"A seperation\" is a couple asking for a divorce. They still love each other, but the woman wants to emigrate for the sake of their daughters future and the man wants to stay in Iran to take care of his demented father. Remarkable is the prominent place emigration has in some Iranian movies, not only in \"A seperation\" but for example also in \"Persepolis\" (2007, Marjane Satrapi). After all the wish te emigrate is not really a recommendation for the country from which one wants to emigrate. However, one has to keep in mind that in Iran there is a rather strict seperation between art house cinema for the export (giving cultural prestige) and mass cinema for the home market. The latest category consists for an important part of Rambo like films in which the United States is the empire of evil.\"A seperation\" is rich in beautiful scenes that may not be essential for the story line but gives us insight in the chracters . I think of the scene in which the father tutors his daughter. She has been shortchanged at the petrol station. The father insists that she goes back to settle the bill. After she has done that (very ashamed and nervously) as a reward she is allowed to keep the change.Some scenes seem to be cut off prematurely. After a while the movie elaborates on things that have happened after the cut off point. Telling the story this way requires the constant attenion of the viewer.

            "content": "What led me to watch 'A Separation' was in fact last year's Best Foreign Language Film Oscar Winner 'The Salesman' which had of course, made me take notice of the man behind the craft - Asghar Farhadi. While Iranian cinema as such remained relatively unknown to me, I was astonished by the way he had portrayed the events of 'The Salesman' carrying an element of suspense even while grounding the characters as realistically as possible.Boy, was I impressed with his 2011 directorial! It tells the story of a couple who are at loggerheads with each other over the decision of moving abroad for the betterment of their child or staying back to look after the husband's Alzheimer-diagnosed father. The plot line is as simple as it gets. An average viewer would even wonder what could be so path-breaking in a film with a synopsis such as this. Yet, the unfurling of incidents and how one thing leads to another is so well-cooked and meticulously crafted that every minute detail is bought into, including the reactions and expressions of each character with respect to various circumstances. Asghar does not let his screenplay flounder for one second. At 2h 3 min, the film is not what one would call a 'breezy watch' but it lets the viewer delve into the grayness associated with each human being. Asghar tries to say that even so-called rational human beings illustrate unexpected forms of behavior based on the context. The series of incidents that play out are simply repercussions of decisions taken by the lead characters and how the people in their life are forced to react due to the same. For example, the couple's only daughter (played by Asghar's own daughter Sarina) is coerced into deciding who she wants to stay with, on more than one occasion. It is (obviously!) not her call. She is only given the option of choosing between dad or mom. She knows she cannot have both, but still doesn't want to give up hope on them. The caregiver character (played by Sareh Bayat) who unintentionally infuses herself into the life of the couple is one that's written so carefully and depicted with an intensity that can match no other. She has her own reasons for the way she's acting, similar to the rest of the characters around her. But not for one moment does the cast go over-the-top. Peymaan Moaadi and Leila Hatami (who play the couple) are never observed to be \"acting\" at all..they're simply living the life of their characters and leaving their imprints behind. Even the sick dad character who barely speaks has left such a big impact with his presence. Kimia Hosseini who plays the caregiver's little daughter is spectacular with her expressions. Shahab Hosseini plays the distressed, unemployed husband of the caregiver to perfection. I can proudly say that there are countless number of stand-out scenes that are bound to stay with the viewer long after one has finished watching 'A Separation'. A few ones that immediately come to mind include the argument between Nader(the husband) and Razieh(the caregiver), the exchange between Nader and his daughter at the judge's office, the climax sequence where the caregiver's husband just implodes and storms out of the house, the powerful opening and closing scenes..the list is pretty huge.Even the message is not clear-cut. It is left for the viewer to formulate based on their own standpoint. Each time a (twisty) revelation is made, the viewer (along with the characters) goes into shell-shock. This indeed says a lot about the film and the impact that it leaves on its viewers. The theme is a depressing one, but the treatment is not. It does not attempt to employ the grim nature of the proceedings to affect the viewer into believing that a character is unabashedly right or wrong. They could be both right and wrong, depending on how you look at things. A masterpiece by all means, this film is highly recommended for all those who'd want to enjoy minimalist cinema at its purest. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing his 2006 venture 'Fireworks Wednesday'. (my viewing timeline is moving backwards but the quality seems to be going forward!)",

The plot bais is very simple. In modern Iran a wife wants to go abroad for proffessional motives and wants her husband to go with her. He doesn't want to go because he must stay to take care of his father who has got Alzheimer disease. The wife then asks for a divorce in court and leaves to stay with her parents. They have a young daughter for whom this situation becomes a psychological problem. The husband must hire a woman to take permanent care of his father. The situation however gets too complicated by mutual accusations: the man accusing her of having abandoned his father for some time at a given moment and he fell to the ground when alone and hurt himself and also of having stolen money from there; the woman accuses him of having pushed her out of the house which made her to fall on the stairs and suffer an abortion since she was pregnant. This brings all of them to the court of justice and other people enter in scene including the woman's husband who didn't know she had been hired to take care of the old man. The plot develops itself in severel conflicts of lies and truths and sayings and retractions that lead to severe somewhat unexpected complications. Since we are in a Muslim country where most people are deeply religious the invocations of and oaths on the Koran are frequent.\nA movie full of realistic authenticity in terms of people, scenes and situations.",

            "review_title": "Divorce Iranian Style",
            "content": "This contemporary Iranian movie starts with Simin appealing for a divorce from her husband Nader in front of a judge. Both actors played this scene with such conviction that I found it to be an attention grabber. The scene is cleverly filmed from the point of view of the judge. The upshot is that divorce in Iran must be rare, since the judge denies the appeal for lack of evidence of major mistreatment, like beatings.Being from the United States a good deal of the interest in this for me was to get a glimpse into personal lives in Iran. In spite of the political situation between America and Iran being so fraught I have understood that the Iranian people are for the most part altogether intelligent and reasonable. It was of value to have this movie put a human face on that. Director Farhadi seems to want to downplay international politics, in spite of the opening scene where Simin wants to leave the country for, as she says, a better future for her daughter. There is no mention of the circumstances that have led her to want to leave, and I would really have liked to have heard what she had to say on that. Once the basic premise is established the movie moves on to a family drama where the daughter, Termeh, becomes a pawn in the ongoing disagreement between Simin and Nader. As with most major node points in life, what ensues from conflict is not predictable or expected. There are elements of courtroom drama and thriller here. Samir and Nader appear to be living a comfortable middle class life in a well furnished apartment, their physical circumstances are similar to what a middle class family would have in the United States. Even with the many differences between the culture I am familiar with and what is presented here, I could well understand the actions and motivations of all the characters. Religion plays a an essential role, e.g. the housekeeper consults a religious authority to determine if bathing Nader's senile father would be a sin. Swearing to anything on the Koran would be a serious offense. It was touching to see how much love Nader had for his father, who would probably be placed in a nursing home in the United States. There is one highly emotional scene that has Nader hugging his father at length and crying.",

It doesn't even come close to that category.The directing in itself is pretty second rate and amateurish. But then comes the plot... It follows a common thread I have seen before in Iranian films where stories are often focused on the imaginary ethics of the human character. Self glorification of the male character, that is. But rarely of the women.Nader and his wife Simin are a married couple who argue about living abroad. Simin prefers to live abroad to provide better opportunities for their only daughter. However, Nader refuses to go because he thinks he must stay in Iran and take care of his father, who suffers from Alzheimers. Simin is determined to get a divorce and leave the country. Not only is she willing to leave the country, but she is even willing to leave her own daughter behind. None of this makes any sense in the actual story.I saw this film with friends. What struck us is how misogynist it is. Every problem that Nader experiences is, of course, solely the fault of his wife Simin. He is always the good one, innocent and pure. He cooks, cleans, works, takes care of his daughter like a modern day single dad and looks after his father and is the one who is the gentle and demure one while his wife basically does nothing except put demands and create problems. He is basically the wife but with a beard. Wow! Where in the world do we find such amazing men? In the middle east? I think not.And if its not his wife, the next bad person who creates even more problems is, surprise surprise, one more woman: the troublesome cleaning lady. She lies and creates devastating legal problems for her own and Simin's family while both the husbands are honest, sacrificing and basically saints.Does no one see how utterly ridiculous and laughable the story truly is? It's middle eastern science fiction to the extreme. The plot makes no sense. How many women would abandon a man who is basically a saint? In this movie, the wife not only wants to abandon her husband but her own child. And there is no clear message as to why she want to do so. Her explanation of wanting to live abroad feels lame and staged. What the film actually shows is how female-hostile the director's own country is although I don't think it was intended that way. Had the film not been so exaggerated on the saintliness of the husband, and had a more valid reason for his wife's constant refusal to cooperate, it may have felt more believable. The film does, however, reveal a bit of the complexities of Iranian society.If this movie gets an Oscar, the Academy should be ashamed of themselves.",

The couple has recently separated and one of them has an elderly parent that needs constant care. The other family is poor, devoutly religious and very much in debt.This was the last movie on my to-see list for movies released in 2011. Unintentionally, the best was saved for last.Firstly, this film has a rare blessing among modern films: a superb screenplay that is intense, has plot twists, and poses difficult moral questions. Despite the conflicts, it is easy to sympathize with and judge both sides equally. This is due to a superb cast of actors all of whom do a great job. Most scenes are done in long single takes which gives an extra challenge to the actors and they all come off with flying colours.While sitting on the edge of one's seat, one wonders what the truth of the situation is especially when some characters might possibly be lying. In their circumstances, many of us would be tempted to lie as well.The effects of this movie linger long after its completion. It is difficult to fully take sides as compassion could be given to everyone in difficult circumstances.What is most amazing is that this great film is made on a small budget. Many of the camera movements were hand-held but thankfully not dizzying.This is not only the best movie of 2011; it's the best modern movie seen in the five year that preceded it. It can join the ranks of other great Iranian films since the 1990s: \"The Colour of Paradise\", \"The Circle\", and \"A Moment of Innocence\". I look forward to seeing it again. - dbamateurcriticRating: 10 out of 10Award-worthy Achievements:1) Screenplay by Asghar Farhadi2) Acting Ensemble",

            "content": "Regardless of where you live on this planet, plenty of scenarios are just as likely to happen in Tehran as they are in Toledo. This is where A Separation (2011) pulls its strength. Set in a mostly modern Iran, A Separation is a series of dramatic twists that could probably happen to anyone. After all, tons of people have to deal with elderly parents with Alzheimer's. There are plenty of divorces for trivial and non-trivial reasons. Good help is hard to find and even harder to afford. The combination of these things results in a gripping narrative that's only given a distinctive Iranian flavor by its cultural limitations.If anything, A Separation shows how difficult it is to be a woman in a Muslim country. It's not impossible, but certain limitations become evident when the strict religious rules of the Quoran come into play. It was nice to see a more liberal version of Islam represented in this film, as it felt closer to a society I could understand as someone who is not part of that religion. That being said, I found the amount of time spent in the court system in this movie was a bit much, even if it was necessary to get to the bottom of what happened.The drama in A Separation is quite intense, with allegations of theft, murder, and neglect flying between the main characters. Making these things seem natural and realistic was a triumph and likely why this film won the Best Foreign Film Oscar for that year. The visual style felt very intimate, almost like it was a reality show or a documentary. Perhaps this style is what lends itself to the everyday struggles of A Separation's characters and how universal they are across the borders of all countries in the world.A universal family drama with an Iranian twist, I give A Separation 4.5 stars out of 5.",

Farhadi does not make it black or white which is too simple for his capacity. Rather than demonizing the upper class, Nader is a good and decent person, and that incident itself would not be his fault. However, the process and the result are not in favor of Razeih's family. Her family is the one destroyed at the end financially and taken away dignity.It's hard to find any leap of logic or hole in the story, zero! I am generous with small mistakes if the whole picture at the end makes sense, and it happens so many times and too much commonly in films. However, when there's zero mistake, that alone can be powerful and amplify the effect of direction and dominance of message.",

I watched it recently (2017) and I thank myself for making that decision because it opens up new vocabulary of cinema to students like us.The director Asghar Farhadi had seen a visual of a young man washing an old man \u2013 most probably his father, and that image stuck Asghar's mind that set the ball rolling to develop a story around it. This was the first Iranian movie to win an Oscar. It appeared in the top 250 films IMDb list and is mentioned in 1000 movies to see before you die.For those who are can't understand Persian I am including spoilers to understand and enjoy the movie better because the dialogues are fast and lengthy and it is difficult to catch them and keep track on first viewing.Simin (Leila Hatami) wants to leave Iran \u2013 either her husband Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and their daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi \u2013 director's real life daughter) come along with her or else she will divorce her husband. But husband can't leave his ailing egging father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease.Nader hires a pregnant Razieh (Sareh Bayat) who comes along with her daughter Somayeh (Kimla Hosseni) as a care-taker.An incident happens when Nader pushes care-taker Razieh out of the house on accusation of not properly taking care of his Dad and for robbing money. Razieh undergoes abortion and her husband Hojjat (Shahbad Hosseini) puts a case of murder against Nader.How all these characters interact and accuse each other, and each try to protect relationships, show humanity, and seek justice makes the rest of the movie.Each character has its own convincing persona that we can empathize with. Who is right? Who is wrong? How the events unfold the way they do \u2013 whom to blame \u2013 it is so beautifully presented with a fluid story telling.The plot is simple but the treatment is complex in terms of the facets of underlying human and cultural nuances popping up every now and then. The actors are top class. There is no music in the movie except the end titles. The movie is shot with hand-held camera. Editing is superb. The dialogues are layered and runs sub-plots that the audience have to weave together. Thus the movie makes the audience part of the proceeding \u2013 putting the view in middle of the family as a witness and observer. Superb..!The screenplay the way it unfolds is like a thriller, and lots of questions remain unanswered till the end of the movie but the movie surely leaves a few signs for the viewers to detect the missing clues.As the movie is already 6 years old, I am leaving a few spoilers for filling up the missing clues - that are not shown in the movie...First, the robbing of money accusation is false because Nader's wife Simin might have paid the money to workers who charges her extra for a work. Second, Nader pushing Razieh does not kill the child, but the child is killed a few days earlier when Razieh is hit by a car on the road in an attempt to bring Nader's father home. Third, the end of the movie showing both Nader and Simin wearing black clothes signify that the father is now dead and still they are going for divorce. Fourth, the ending is open \u2013 as the daughter's decision of - with whom she will go \u2013 father or mother - is not revealed and it is kept for the audience to guess based on what is shown in the movie.This was Director Asghar's fifth movie. Recently in 2017 his movie Salesman again won the Best Foreign Film award at the Oscars - his second Oscar.A movie is a must see for all movie buffs in terms understanding the art of cinema on how to integrate complex cultural pathos and broken human relationships with empathy where we as audience do not find fault with any character.I give it 8 out of 10",

The Separation movie is about a couple trying to get a divorce or that's what it looks at first. The movie is well-scripted and there are no repetitive dialogues. The movie starts as a simple one and transcends into a court-room drama. The fact that the camera doesn't change much adding with the expressions on all the characters makes it so natural and the viewers can feel as if its happening before them.A Separation questions our ethics and puts us in a moral dilemma. The characterization is noteworthy, every character has a certain trait they are related with. Nadar, the lead character is a responsible person and never fails to serve his ailing father with Alzheimer's, he also has the trait of thinking clearly under duress without clouding his judgement. His wife Simin on the other hand,always tries her best to control every situation. Termeh, is their daughter who is under a lot of pressure undergoing puberty and tries very hard to unite her parents from getting divorced.The viewers attention is required as the movie is kinda fast-paced and the dialogues are dynamic. the movie is full of uncertainity and unpredictable actions . The dialogues always stirs some kind of emotions in us.The climax scene was worth mentioning, how Temreh was put in a tough spot to choose between her parents, it will bring tears to anybody's face. And of course, Asghar Farhadi didn't fail to use hi cliff- hanger ending here also. The movie won an Oscar for the best foreign film 2012 and was nominated for the best screenplay and best writing.

He returns home from work one day to find the nanny out and his father fallen off the bed, with one arm tied to the bedpost. There is a confrontation with the nanny, and the next day Nader finds himself in court, accused of being responsible for her miscarriage.It is a film where emotions run high, countless lies are told, and justice threatens to unravel, presented in such a way that the audience is not aware who they ought to be cheering for, until the climatic truth is revealed. Set in Iran, but being mostly apartment indoors and surrounding streets, it is not a drastic leap for Western viewers to make, and presents the similarities of our cultures, more than the differences. Replace casual wear with head coverings, the Bible with the Koran, and a few quirks of the law. In its tone and handheld style it reminds me much of Mexican director Alejandro Inarritu's early work, giving a documentary like depiction of reality. The acting is very good.The complex relationships and motivations, and how they could influence the legal outcomes, is quite fascinating, while themes on divorce and child ownership, power struggles, desperation for money, and the courage it takes to uphold righteousness, are all strong. In the climax, uncomfortable religious themes are added to the mix. Our nanny is forced to swear on the Koran that Nader is responsible for her miscarriage, but because she knows its a lie, and fears a curse will be placed upon her healthy child, she can't do it. In this way we learn religion has not made her righteous, as she respects not the truth, rather fears Godly punishment. This is the same lie she's been telling the whole story, that's landed everyone in such a bad position, and could potentially land an innocent man in jail. To wait until the climax for this oath to occur, after the stakes have risen sky high, does reveal the scripted nature of things, and may seem illogical to those who don't understand the religion - I admit, I am uncertain myself - but it is apt thematically, for the complexity of influences the characters are trying to balance.",

Much like most divorces in real life, the movie makes it very clear that there is no good outcome for any character involved. While I admire the filmmakers for perfectly capturing the hopeless destruction a divorce can cause, I won't be quick to rewatch this movie and subject myself to that depression again.Also, the movie was made in a country where women don't have as many rights as men and used to not be allowed to request a divorce. The woman in this movie initiated the divorce, and bad things happened as a result, which made me question the male director's motives for making this movie.

            "content": "I have mixed feelings about this movie. I think that the story was complex in a beautiful way but on the other hand some parts were even too complicated for me.There were a lot of serious topics (islam, justice system, divorce, lying vs. telling the truth, alzheimer's disease etc.) handled at the same time which left me overwhelmed at the end. With this many themes none of them were handled thoroughly and there were a couple of holes and questions left unanswered in the story. When the movie ended I was surprised because I still had many questions left.The pacing was quite fast and there's a lot happening. This fact goes in hand with the amount of topics this movie was trying to tackle. Again this left me overwhelmed at times.I liked how there were these little hints throughout the movie. Some things were never explained directly but rather showed discreetly. When a director succeeds in this it's always a good sign.Another amazing aspect was the acting. I thought that every actor managed to pass all the emotions the characters were feeling to the viewers.I loved how the story made me feel. Even at the end I can't say with certainty whose side I was on. Every one had a good reason to defend themselves and I wanted everybody to get out of the situation in the best possible way. I enjoy stories like this: they force the viewer to think about their life and actions the most.I can't say what my final thoughts about this movie are. I loved how it made me feel: it compelled me to think and it made me feel many emotions at the same time. I also hate how it made me feel: overwhelmed, confused and torn between two rights. I don't even know if the good things I felt can be seen as bad things and vice versa.These were just my initial thoughts. I need to rewatch this movie at some point.",

Why is this so?Because the story line of this movie is a little scattered, my first feeling when watching the movie is that the movie wants to talk about two things. One is where the marriage of the couple, the male and female owner, will go. The director seems to want to use this line Deconstruction of marriage; the other line is the entanglement between the male and female couples and another couple. This line seems to be intended to expose human nature and the human nature to religion (faith).So, if you want to get emotion from the movie, you can get a lot of different emotions. It doesn't matter whether it's a belief or a religion; it's a matter of whether human nature is a lie, and what the bottom people are to society. Even the film involves the relationship between law and human relations. But won't such a big bag of movies come loose?In fact, my own movie watching feeling is that this is indeed a very loose movie, but in the end, with the tears of your daughter, you will find that the reason why life is very tired, it seems that life is very \"loose\", All kinds of restraints make you uneasy, but these restraints still influence each other and make each other more difficult. It is almost impossible for you to concentrate on solving one thing and looking at the next one, but it is pulled over and dragged over. Any discomfort in the movie turned into a real experience in the end, this is the most wonderful thing in this film!",

First, we agreed that the couple showed no love for each other, so it didn't seem all that tragic that they were separated. I thought the point might be showing the Dominoe effect of how one thing leads to another until things get really out of hand. My father thought the point could either be showing the consequences of several people lying or the consequences of the father's stubbornness in not asking his wife to stay. Perhaps the point of the movie was simply to serve as a vehicle for making social commentaries.We were also very disappointed that there was no ending to the story. There was more than one unanswered question. In the end we never found out which parent the daughter chose to live with, nor, in fact, whether or not the couple would get back together. We also never found out what happened to the missing money. At one point the father said that it was the exact amount of the caretaker's salary. However, both my father and I thought the caretaker was sincere about not taking the money. Did the mother take it when we saw her counting money near the beginning of the movie? If so, why would it be the same amount as the caretaker's salary. Another unanswered question is why the caretaker's husband allowed her to keep returning to take care of the elderly father instead of doing it himself as it appeared he had agreed to do. Had he gotten another job at a motorcycle shop?",

But when terrence malick came close to science and dissed covery, and woody Allen dropped his book bag and went to Paris, it was a rare, quiet, story-telling movie. With a budget of $300,000, it is estimated that tintin will cost less than a second.But it is not a contradiction that the master's films still survive among his fans, and that poor iranians still toil under the cover of the Koran. Just as you may be used to the wealth of the second generation of money spent on the rich, I can always find a warm in a soup day. That's life. Simplicity has its power.So ashar farhadi, a simple man, calmly turns the camera on two Iranian families, who seem to be ordinary, but the waves are rolling in, and let them brush each other off. In the end, but also let the audience chest distress, empathy, estimated that the film to, also so much fun.Count the scenes, nothing more than the naders, the simeons, the ritzes, the hospital and the courthouse, and a few car shots. Count the costumes, a few cars and a Koran. Most of the film is shot with hand-held cameras, and there is no soundtrack and only music plays when the credits rise at the end. What's more interesting is that playing the 11-year-old daughter of nader and Simon is the director's own daughter.However, such an understated film won the golden bear and other awards at the 2011 Berlin film festival, and will represent Iran in the best foreign language film competition at the 84th Academy Awards in 2012.Simple film, but still full of sharp editing, intelligent dialogue, solid dramatic conflict. The director's eye - level view does not completely praise or condemn any of the characters, just as everyone in the movie is lying and everyone has a good nature. Just one encounter between the two families reveals the tip of the iceberg on the big screen for a thoughtful viewer to see. In the film, grandmother temey and temey's historical knowledge of the Iranian (Persian) sassanid period goes back to this line: \"in the sassanid period, people were divided into two classes... The upper privileged and the ordinary.\" \"Common people,\" she said. From the sassanid period of the Persian dynasty to the present Iran, we can see from the recitation of history that this hierarchy still exists, with only a few words, and a profound irony of the Iranian status quo. The director never makes the characters wailing against the social system and the management class, but focuses on how the two families should behave in the social reality and religious constraints.Although the fuse of the movie plot is \"separation\", in fact, the thread of the movie is \"kinship\". < / p > < p > nader and Simon clearly love each other, but for the sake of happiness, their mutual love for their daughter let them suffer, a stone stirred up a thousand waves, and the involvement of another family caused a tragedy. The director does not deliberately exaggerate the pain of the characters and incite the audience's tears in an extreme way. Therefore, when innocent people have to lie and fight for their own happiness, the pain felt by the audience is more real. The indifferent treatment of the film contains deep humanistic care. When the music at the end of the film sounds, the subtitles rise, and the ending is still far away, we understand the meaning of the film: this is their life.At least, they have faith.PS: Loli in the movie is so good, adorable! The last hate in the eyes of the gun, too lethal",

The wife wants to move, the husband wants to stay to take care of his elderly father, the young daughter gets caught in the middle of the parents quarrels, the caretaker chains the elderly father to the bed and leaves the house for the day, and then she blames her miscarriage on the husband when in reality she ran into the street only to be hit by a car, go figure.

And the audience went back over the film frame by frame and each according to his or her religious belief, cultural background, philosophical persuasion and social class would come to a different conclusion. Who is right and who is wrong? Or is there a winner no matter what is the decision? The film starts with a choice- personal fulfillment or filial duty overlaid with matrimonial complications. People from the west would vote for individual freedom and aspirations-maybe and folks from the east would frown upon a dereliction of filial obligations-maybe. Then the film introduced a compromise by a religious woman to earn income for her family. Again certain religious people would forbid such an arrangement- woman taking care of a man no matter how elderly or infirm and lay people would approve of her diligence. Then the film brought in a civil matter. Was he guilty and deserving the harsh sentence imposed by the law of the land and if not was the victim not deserving to be compensated? Did the parties involved not stretch the truth or hide the truth? Folks with European background might prefer the truth and nothing but the absolute truth and likewise folks with less stringent legal culture might prefer a folksy conclusion. Then there is the social class angle. Does the victim from poor background have the right to resort to violence or the well-off can hide behind legal wrangling? Then there is the middle ground but religion would complicate it and civil laws would not recognize it. And the teenage daughter with all the innocence of a newborn and the conscience of a common man would be required to make a choice and she is us the audience. The film did give us a hint. A man might win the war but lose the world and that might be the universal truth \u2013east, west or middle east. A must see film.",

I only watch Iranian films when they win awards or receive international recognition. I'm a fan of Kiarostami and Majidi, but I can't really say that I like all of their films. I watched Farhady's previous film (About Elly) about a year ago, and the first thing which struck me was how culturally detached the movie was in its depiction of an event. At the time, I believed this to have been the cause of this director's success. Watching Nader and Simin, however, proved that I was terribly mistaken.Asghar Farhady's obsession with the concept of judgment is once again the driving force behind his latest feature. The life-like depiction of the Iranian courtroom (which is in no way impartial) places the audience in the Judge's seat from the very beginning. The extremely believable acting and insanely complex script compel the viewer to make up his/her mind just like when reading a court case. As for the screenplay, I'm almost certain the events in this film actually happened in real life, because in no way could one fabricate such a chaotically complex series of events, so beautifully woven into a coherent whole.Despite being very Iranian in its narrative style and its depiction of Iranian culture (the sanctity of Family, faith, commitment towards parents and married life), I believe that this film could easily appeal to the Western audiences just like a film by Inaritu or Haneke (although I'm pretty sure it won't be nominated for an Oscar for political reasons).After seeing About Elly, I thought Farhady's success was just a one-time fling, but coming out of the theater, having watched Nader and Simin, I was proud to have another Iranian director added to my international list of favorites.",

In my opinion, the producer couldn't implicate the viewer to be a accomplice in his project of depicting the under world of the Iranian family, namely, the ghost of divorce. What are we supposed to do as viewers? the cast didn't let us in. Also, the climax was a little mountain that took but minutes. Added to that, the movie hints at the cultural breach or xenophobic trend toward what is Arabic. In one of the scenes when the daughter was rehearsing some vocabulary with the help of the father she came across some words that are from Arabic and she chose them. The reaction of the father was negative by stating that it should not be Arabic. Yes, Farsi is considered among the oldest languages in the world but that didn't prevent it from borrowing or loaning new words like \" mother\", \"father\",..etc.",

What it takes to make it work just like any other job.\nEarlier I used to think the marriages were simple and smooth and the movie debunks that myth so clearly. Explains the behaviour of my parents some years back. But overall it's a big change from the bachelorhood to the family thing. And one should go for it only when one is prepared for that other wise it'll make life worse, if not the same.\nWell! back to the movie. The storyline was amazing, especially the way some different plots were intertwined together. The story transitions so smoothly between the plots and at one point one is hardly able to tell the one from the another. The movie feels whole and complete with no loose ends left. At the end what we are left with are our own expectations and decision with the corresponding consequences be these good or bad. It's shocking to see that people still make the wrong choices many times despite the obvious consequences. Nothing can put it so good as this movie. It's like a mirror to the family life.\nThe characters were so perfect to tell if they were acting at all or may were so natural that they didn't need that. Living and stuck in an orthodox country run by the religion, where you have to call the priest to ask for permission to help one elderly incapacitated man. The pain of the same was so clearly visible on the faces of the characters, especially Simin's. In this case, for the unprepared the choices can get really tough and confusing. 8/10 for #ASeperation2011 8/10.",

Some of the critics on this site seem to expect more from it because it's a foreign language production or a 'world' movie; but that's subjective. If I was Iranian, and I went to the local cinema and saw this I would be very proud. Also, I disagree with those who say it's sexist; the male characters portrayed are flawed to say the least.When I say it's 'realistic' I admit I can't say how accurate the portrait of the Iranian justice system is, I have never been there, but I was left with an indelible insight.

            "content": "Iranian film Jodaeiye Nader az Simin is a drama, which emphasizes on social struggle with telling a story about separation of a couple. Way of storytelling in the film has a really wide and realistic perspective. Asghar Farhadi who is the director and writer of the film gives us an opportunity to focus on sociological subjects which are about class struggle and gender issues in the society with this rich script. All characters in the movie are really life-based and realistic. So, it's really useful to examine female characters' role in this movie from the different feminist views which brings us this question; \"Are some specific women experiences common to all women or are they also shaped by other facts?\"My comment about this question is Farhadi's view about women experiences more suits with the post-modernist feminist ideas which emphasizes on women's experiences are shaped by other facts, such as class, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation. Women characters of the movie are the examples of that. However, it also fits with the common women experiences idea in some ways too. Considering women's position in Iran, just because they are women, movie gives us an idea about common women experience: Abiding man domination.However, as I said because of the characters it seems it more focuses on the shaped women experiences idea. Mary Wollstonecraft's critique against the view that treated everyone implicitly as males, and regarding their sex could be helpful to compare female characters in the movie. Mary Wollstonecraft's emphasizes that differences between men and women were largely cultural and can be altered by education. In the movie, differences between characters of Simin and Razieh are mostly based on that reason. The character of Simin, as presented in the movie, is more liberal one. The relationship between her husband shows that, she simply doesn't accept male domination in the institute of marriage. Her attitude is more liberal than Razieh who has more conservative tendencies. Such as relationship between her husband Hojjat. Their relationship suits more the way of patriarchy, than Simin's marriage. Even their ways of dressing are really different. Considering they live in the same country, under the same rules, it would be expected they would be more similar, but they are not. For the explanation of this situation, Wollstonecraft's theory could be helpful. As I see, their differences are mostly cultural which are caused because of their environment, and the level of education. Because we know different experiences bring different standpoints. It's also fixes with Patricia Hill-Collins theory too.To sum up, Jodaeiye Nader az Simin is such a modern time classic, with its rich script and successfully directing. It gives us an opportunity to examine society from different points. My examination is more focus on the idea that women experiences are shaped by the other factors which are mostly cultural and educational in this movie.",

You are experiencing a clear picture of the wisely and pure logically knitted incidents without any intervention and comment by director/narrator/writer.

What can be a concrete reason to a divorce passing over abstract reasons and the shared past to stay together. 4. Elder-care at home 5.

This is a movie about how two people grow apart, how a relationship deteriorates because of the circumstances and communication gives way to misunderstandings, about how hope and a project together turn into disappointment and exasperation. And this is told in a way that makes the film so original and thrilling I'm still thinking about it some days after I watched it.

To make a long story short, the film was more or less disappointing. It's not that it was not good, but that it had nothing to offer internationally. I've seen movies by Fellini, Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Bergman, Korosawa, Tykwer, Kubrick, Lynch, Fincher, Burton, Allen and other genius minds in the universe of the seventh art; and this movie didn't even have the potential to be compared to their works. \"A Separation\" had a better script in comparison to \"About Elly\", though, to my idea, the ending was pretty immature and not as sophisticated as the rest of the film. Acting was OK, but cinematography, mis-en-scene, editing, and direction still needed massive improvement. Sound, music, use of colors and etc. have utterly been neglected by the director.Honestly, I believe the voting for this film is absolutely political and has been given blind, and in no way, this movie could be placed in the top 250 films of all time; if you take a look at that list, you see Fellini's \"8 1/2\" below this film. I mean anyone who's seen \"8 1/2\" knows that \"A Separation\" doesn't hold a candle to it at all. So I ask all of you patriotic Iranians not to mingle art and politics and take off your hallucination glasses and see this movie where it stands. I give it 5 out of 10 for the screenplay and the acting.",

            "content": "Don't go expecting lavish cinematography, this is shot on hand held cameras, or certainly on fairly shaky tripods throughout, often under the harsh glare of fluorescent lighting that throws a watery blue cast over the action at times. But that is highly appropriate because this movie has a creeping sense of voyeurism throughout as the intensely private happenings of a family, and perhaps country, in turmoil steadily build up into a furious climax.The plot is complex to say the least, but one can keep up by fully concentrating on each twist and turn of this micro-thriller.The oppression of the Koran in this staunchly Muslim country carries a heavy burden throughout the film and it's the most frequently used prop as one of the characters in particular, the victim of a central crime, seeks spiritual guidance throughout. It's importance and oppression is palpable.The story concerns the vain attempts of a wife (superbly acted by Leila Hatami) to leave Tehran with her husband to improve the life of their 12 year old daughter. But the husband cannot force himself to leave his Alzheimer's afflicted father behind and so stalemate ensues and divorce becomes the only alternative, this results in a separation and so the father (played to perfection by Peyman Moaadi) is forced to hire a nurse to look after his desperately sad father during the day.One thing leads to another and inadvertently the husband pushes the nurse so that she ends up aborting her child.This sets off a horrendous chain of events that I will not reveal here for fear of spoiling it for you.Suffice to say the tension mounts throughout the movie and culminates in a heartbreaking decision for the couple's 12 year old daughter that is resolved in a way that Michael Hanneke would applaud vigorously.This movie deals with important themes of family loyalty (more than love), duty, the oppression and folly of religion and pride.Without overbearing pride much of the consequences of this film would not happen. Time and again you silently shout at the screen \"just do the right thing and this mess will be resolved.\" They never do.",

            "content": "Hidlren of Heaven\", \"The Color of Paradise\", \"The Willow Tree\" and \"Baran\". I have also seen several other wonderful film by other Iranian directors. So, I was quite interested in seeing \"A Separation\" when it arrived at a local theater. And, I am glad I had a chance to see it. The film begins with a man and wife both seeing a judge (or more like a referee) to discuss a divorce. The wife wants to leave Iran (exactly why is never discussed, by the way--an interesting omission) but the husband is adamant--he won't leave his father, as the father has Alzheimer's. This is an odd reason to want a divorce and as the audience knew nothing about the family, it was easy to dislike the wife and side with the husband--especially since they have a daughter who is in the middle. But the wife insists--she WILL leave whether he divorces her or not. Most of the rest of the film centers on the husband. You have to feel for the guy--his wife insists on leaving, his father is in the mid-late stages of the disease and he is having a devil of a time finding someone to care for the man. His prayers seem to be answered when he finds a woman willing to watch him--and at the price he can afford. However, this is early in the film and there is LOTS to come. I'd say more about the plot, but there are so many surprises, I'd rather just leave it to you to see yourself.n The film is great to watch because there are so many surprises and so many situations where people are faced with very tough choices and yet they seem to make the wrong ones again and again--all due to stubbornness. Such simple things like apologizing or even talking out problems--all these seem beyond people. And, in the process, two children from two separate families are stuck in the middle--with HUGE pressures put on them by their parents. As a result of all this, I can guarantee that it's a film that will get you thinking and have a strong emotional impact. It's also a great film to see with friends because I could easily see the film stimulating a ton of discussion afterwords. Intelligent and very complex--the only reservation I have is that the film is unrelentingly sad and tough to watch. I could imagine some viewers just tiring of all this, as it's like an extended Bickerson's skit--without any jokes or levity--just anger, horrible decisions, selfishness and isolation.

Leila Hatami, though having less showtime, but every moment of her screen time was utilized to its full potential. The rest of the cast wouldn't be off the same praise.Alongside its raw performances, the Farhady's touch should not be ignored.

I think, that's the one of the biggest problem modern era..And then, story is going on..I strongly recommend this movie because of deeply touched to the human soul..I strongly recommend this movie because of people have to understand that, a separation between parents is mostly hurting the children..",

Direction could be better ; especially if an Iranian director is making film for an international audience he must keep in mind to show especially those things which are limited to Iranian customs and tradition and show them with more clarity for non- Iranians to understand and make a balanced judgment.Once again the ending is disappointing. Plus there are some lose ends in between where in I guess we being an international audience can't really make out sense of things which otherwise for a native Iranian would make sense. Anyway, that apart movie was indeed worth a one time watch. Did it deserve an Oscar is debatable. For that I need to see other films of that category. Or may be they gave it based only on the plot which is of course unique and matchless.To be honest, I was expecting this kind of ending where once again the DIRECTOR seems confused and is not sure what ending to show and hence leave it for the audience to decide the same and every individual viewer can have his own judgment on the same. Frankly it does not make sense to me.May be we Indians are use to a proper ending ; which may / may not make sense to all the audience but at least we know for sure what the Director has in mind. There after audiences can debate on the same and give their own opinion on what other ending were possible if any. But in case of Iranian films we don't know what ending the director has in mind so we are left in the dark and frankly don't know which way to go. On similar plot an Indian filmmaker would have produced a block buster.KHODA HAFEZ.SS",

The family together.\nThe wife Sirin demanded divorce to go abroad, so divorced the husband, but ended up living down the road anyway. She had nothing against her husband, she was hurt that he didn't ask her to stay. So she didn't really need to leave the house, but did so out of pride and stubbornness.\nThe husband Nader, was too proud to ask her back.\nHe was too hard headed to ask the pregnant helper woman why she left the house and his father alone.\nHe would not listen when she insisted that she did not take the money.\nShe didn't steal it, so he pushed her for no reason... the money was used by the wife before she moved out to pay the piano movers!\nAll the circumstances that led to unnecessary consequences were based in issues of pride and hard headedness, and carried a message that people need to be honest, and share what is in their heart and keep the family together...\nThis movie was full of subtle communication and a very sweet connection between the father and his daughter. He was hard with everyone except her. He was willing to go to jail if she wanted him to confess... they had a beautiful honest respect. Lovely, amazing movie.",

And, more importantly perhaps, a problem that is typical for our age.\nThe story is about a separation of a married couple which was in turn influenced by a previous separation, i.e. a division into richer and poorer classes. In the foreground are two families, from one social class each as well as the jurisdictional authority. The rich and the poor have in common that they are both seeking the guilt in the outside world. Particularly tragical is that they point they are pointing their finger at those who are closest to them.\nYet, here we can see even the third separation: the young ones are withdrawing from the old ones, because they were already as children probably not really taken into account. Such an attitude does not bring any improvement and, as the things get even more complicated, eventually the judicature must intervene. Nevertheless, exactly in the person of the judge (Your Holiness) with whom they are dealing with the whole corruptness is reavealed - althouigh there should be no room for it there in the first place. Lacking any deeper reflection, the latter is prepared to put a man behind bars. The row in front of the door is long. But as soon as the one who has money pays the bail he can already be set free, as if he had not been considered dangerous to the society even a moment before.\nThe cast ist excellent, while the denouement of the film is left to each viewer. I was shocked by the appalingly open question of responsibility - so evident to all, so close to us all, yet so easy to overlook. In any case, well worth watching!",

In the international comparison it would fall a bit farther behind, and that's fully natural.About the content, without intention of spoiling, the film gives you quite a good insight about some very actual problems of Iranian society and has a subtle political point, and certainly it is worth watching from educational point of view. Watch it to see how totally different interests, circumstances, restrictions, hopes, and emotions clash in a society that is longing for freedom as a human right.

The raw emotion expressed by the characters portrays the gravity of the film. We feel like the type of audience that would enjoy this movie are people who like drama and some intensity. While the film bounces around inconsistently to different characters, we think that this was done in a way that does not subtract from the feel of the film. The chaos of the lives of the characters are reflected in the chaos of the film itself. You could say say that there are times when some scenes were either be repetitive or mundane, but this only takes up a small part of the film. The movie is able to constantly throw unexpected twists up until the last scenes of the movie, and as viewers that is an element that we particularly enjoyed. Overall, the movie is very good and there's not much we can fault it on, the reason this is not a ten is because we would never say this our my favorite movie, or even a contender of it, it doesn't stick out enough or leave with that feeling of satisfaction you would get from a favorite movie.

It's also playing with so many ideas like family, class, morality, gender roles, political climate, that's what really gives it its breadth. The story unfolds so naturally too, nothing feeling forced or heavy handed, which can be tough when a story is always moving like this.The performances were incredible. The four members of the main family were all impeccable, sometimes I wonder if I judge acting less harshly in foreign films because I'm not attuned to the specific mannerisms and inflections that come with each language/country, but these were without a doubt incredible performances. They really feel like real people. The realism achieved was powerful, even foregoing score altogether until the final credit scene.Above all, I loved that no one is the \"bad guy\" in this.

            "content": "an unhappily married couple break up in this complex, painful, fascinating Iranian drama by writer-director Asghar Farhadi, with explosive results that expose a network of personal and social faultlines. A Separation is a portrait of a fractured relationship and an examination of theocracy, domestic rule and the politics of sex and class \u2013 and it reveals a terrible, pervasive sadness that seems to well up through the asphalt and the brickwork. In its depiction of national alienation in Iran, it's comparable to the work of Jafar Panahi and Mohammad Rasoulof. But there is a distinct western strand. The film shows a middle-class household under siege from an angry outsider; there are semi-unsolved mysteries, angry confrontations and family burdens: an ageing parent and two children from warring camps appearing to make friends. All these things surely show the influence of Michael Haneke's 2005 film Hidden. Farhadi, like Haneke, takes a scalpel to his bourgeois homeland.These are modern people with modern problems. After 14 years of marriage, Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moaadi) want to split. They live in a flat with their intelligent, sensitive 11- year-old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), and with Nader's elderly father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who suffers from Alzheimer's and is in need of constant care.Both of them work, and, ambitious for their daughter's education, they have hired a teacher from her school to come to this crowded flat to give her extra coaching for her imminent and crucial exams. But now Simin wants to leave Iran for a country where there are more opportunities for women generally and for her daughter in particular; Nader says it is out of the question. They must stay in Iran to look after his father.This debate has escalated into a demand for divorce. The very first scene shows the pair petitioning the equivalent of a magistrate for permission to proceed. This figure is not shown; the couple look directly into the camera and make their case, as it were, to us, the audience. In courtroom terms, this is something like an opening address to the jury, and the audience is invited not to decide who is right and who is wrong, but to see afresh that in such cases there is no right and wrong. Both have some justice on their side.AdvertisementAs the movie progresses, terrible things happen in a succession of unintended consequences. Flawed people behave badly and they will make ferocious appeals to justice and to law in preliminary hearings very similar to the divorce court, heard by harassed, careworn officials oppressed by the knowledge that there is no black and white, but numberless shades of grey. Despite the angry denunciations flying back and forth and the fizzing sense of grievance being nursed on both sides, the messy, difficult truth is that both parties can be justified, that all-or-nothing judicial war will bring destruction, and that some sort of face-saving compromise will somehow have to be patched up. The women see this, but not the men.When Simin and Nader part, and Simin leaves to live with her mother, an instant question presents itself \u2013 with no wife in the picture, who is to do the woman's work? Which is to say, who is to do the drab, menial work of cleaning the flat, and looking after Nader's poor, incapable father? Nader already has a modern wife who has a professional career and wants to go her own way. Now he needs a traditional wife, in all but name \u2013 a drudge. So through Simin's connections, they engage Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a woman with one small daughter, whom she will have to bring to work every day, and who also has a secret she is keeping from her prospective employer. Despite the tough work involved \u2013 a 90- minute commute and the necessity of looking after a confused and incontinent old man with no special training \u2013 Nader quibbles with her about pay and this humiliating exchange is to involve Nader in the lives of both Razieh and her own prickly husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini). The stage is set for a terrible confrontation.Class matters, as much as gender. One scene shows a group of people at the flat, relaxing and having fun, playing table football. Friends can join in, as well as family. But not Razieh. She is shown rather miserably getting on with something in the kitchen. When Termeh's teacher Miss Ghahraii (Merila Zare'i) comes round, she is treated as an honoured guest. She is, after all, teaching their daughter. But how about Razieh? She has an important family responsibility, too, looking after Nader's father. But she gets no respect. And she is further oppressed by her own religious sense.",

Movie shows image of today's Iran i.e. a father allows his daughter to fill petrol in their car and she talks with the man at petrol/gas station. Another thing to notice relevant to movie, the med \"cleans the old man\" which seems to be an odd job in Iran for a woman. [ I can assume that Iran as being Islamic republic country ]. Few more things to notice, the wife of accused man still supports him though they are separated. Over all this movie is worth to watch but with English subtitles otherwise very difficult to understand \"important\" conversations if you don't understand \"Farsi\" language. Also if observed the man tells her daughter not to say \"Arabic\" word for an English word which she want to answer in school. He insists her to use \"Farsi\" word. :-) Slow movie.

Hence, after watching the movie what you have is a sensation of how partial and biased one can be. The narrative has a great pace, so you never fall into senseless loops. There's always something being added to the plot, thus the viewer is adding blocks evenly into each character without loosing side of the connections between them.Definitively a must see. I have given more than 8 points to very few movies. I strongly suggest it to watch it and disregard anything that can bias you (name it, foreign film, Iranian film, not in English, etc). enjoy a great plot and a master conception of characters.",

The movie won an Oscar in 2012 for Best Foreign Language film. The movie is set in Iran in 2012. It was filmed on location in Tehran.It's about a family that the wife of family (Simin) wishes to live abroad to give a better life to her eleven year-old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) but Nader wants to stay to take care of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) that has Alzheimer. Simin moves to the house of her mother and Nader hires the Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father while he is working. Razieh is pregnant but she does not tell her husband Hodjat, who owes large amount to the creditors, that she is working. When she arrives with her daughter Somayeh (Kimia Hosseini) at Nader's house, she distracts and Nader's father goes to the street and she goes and gets him back home. On the next day, when Nader arrives home with Termeh, they find Nader's father tied up to his bed and Razieh and Somayeh are not at home. When they arrive at home, Nader accuses Razieh of theft and expels her. Razieh feels offended and argues with him, and Nader pushes her out at the front door. Razieh falls and has an abortion. She goes to the court with her husband and the witnesses are summoned to testify. I strongly recommended \"A Separation\" for any cinema lover or people who are interested in learning a little about the Iranian culture. If you like great acting, directing, writing and editing see this film.",

            "content": "The ability to see events from different perspectives is one of the most important elements of a successful relationship, whether it involves a married couple, a parent and child, or a group of nations. Warring parties are always convinced that they have right or, in some cases, God on their side. To them, every action they take is fully justified and every act the other party takes is sinister. The failure to see other people's perspectives is in full view in Asqhar Farhadi's brilliant A Separation, winner of the Best Foreign Film award at the Golden Globes and nominated for an Oscar in the same category. Farhadi does not ask us to choose sides but to observe how decisions made with good intentions and for the alleged benefit of others often have the opposite effect. The film opens in a courtroom in Tehran as Simin (Leila Hatami) speaks to a judge, unseen by the camera, asking him to grant her a divorce from Nader (Peyman Moaadi) her husband of fourteen years. Simin wants to leave the country and take her 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), with her to seek better opportunities abroad. Nader, a bank employee, however, will not leave Iran because of his responsibility to care for his elderly father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) coping with Alzheimer's disease. Even though they have been married for fourteen years, there does not seem to be any hint of compromise. Unable to obtain the divorce because the judge deems the issues not \"serious\" enough, the couple agrees to separate with Simin going to her mother's house and Termeh staying with her father. To help care for his aging father, the well-off Nader hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a pregnant, less affluent young woman with a four- year-old daughter. Whether or not Nader knows she is pregnant will become a contentious issue later in the film. Razieh, a devout Muslim, who has not told her husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) about her employment, is conflicted when she has to change the clothes of the incontinent old man, and feels compelled to ask an Islamic authority if it would be considered a sin. Things become even worse when Nader returns from work and finds his father lying on the floor barely breathing with Razieh nowhere in sight. When Razieh returns home after she claimed she had to do an important errand, an angry Nader accuses her of stealing money and asks her to leave immediately. Resistant to leave, he pushes her out the front door, causing the pregnant woman to fall down the stairs. Events begin to spin out of control when Razieh has a miscarriage and her irate husband takes Nader to court for murder. As the case is presented in a preliminary hearing before a judge, the divide between the families escalates and each person is guilty of concealing the truth in order to protect themselves or a family member. A Separation may sound like a melodramatic soap opera, but it is far from it. It is a powerful, realistic, and beautifully acted drama full of constant tension and uncertainty, a film in which each person must confront the fact that the walls they have erected have not led to nurturing relationships. While the film is not overtly political, an underlying sub-text is the depiction of a male-dominated autocratic theocracy, a political system based on force, oppression and the alienation between gender and class. Eager to enhance their daughter's education, the couple hired Miss Ghahraii, a teacher (Merila Zare'i) from her school to come to their flat to provide coaching for her upcoming exams, but it is painfully clear to see how much more she is respected than Razieh, who stays in the kitchen during family gatherings. As the adults fight over perceived injustices, the children, as is often the case, endure the most pain, conflicted by their love and dependence on their parents and their desire for morality and justice. While Termeh seemingly hides her pain, her face reflects the terrible burden her parents have put on her by their inability to see the world from other points of view, the kind of tragedy that has plagued mankind for centuries. As Farhadi has wisely said \"What I hope is that the viewer will not know whose victory to wish for.\" When responsibility, love, and sacrifice are not present, there can be no victory for anyone.
