Martin Lawrence made quite a lot of money with this series and not only a few would wonder how this could happen in the first place.While this isn't complete waste (you might be able to laugh or chuckle at some of the silly jokes), this really is by the numbers and has no surprising element whatsoever to elevate it over other movies with similar themes. Not only that, it isn't really that well executed either. But what would you expect from a movie when it reaches its second sequel (part 3 that is)?! So while the (general) census suggests that you won't like the movie, you might see it otherwise (especially if you liked both prior movies)!",

            "content": "To live in the world of Big Momma, it helps if you have the intelligence of a box of instant potatoes. That way, Detective Malcolm Turner (Martin Lawrence) and now his 17-year-old stepson Trey (Brandon T. Jackson) can pass themselves off as women, despite both of them looking like they escaped from a bad Saturday Night Live sketch, and not arouse suspicion. That both of them are able to fool an entire girl's college campus is one mental hurdle the movie asked of me that I just could not accomplish.Of course, given the attempts at humor on display in Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son, it probably wouldn't hurt if the audience shared the same IQ as the characters up on the screen. There's not a single laugh to be had. Believe me, I counted. But then, that's not surprising when the film's sole joke was explored to its fullest in 2000's Big Momma's House. That was the movie where Lawrence went undercover as a 300 pound Southern granny in order to crack a crime. Somehow, this idea struck a chord with enough people to see the movie gross over $100 million, which led to 2006's Big Momma's House 2. It was less successful at the box office, but here we are with the third film. Not only does the Big Momma disguise that Lawrence dons look a little more worn out than before, but Lawrence himself seems confused as to what he's doing back in the role. It's an encore performance that no one, not even the star, asked for.Lawrence is back as Malcolm, although his love interest (played in the previous two films by Nia Long) is nowhere to be seen. I guess they couldn't pay her enough to come back, so they explain in dialogue that she's away at a retreat. This leaves Malcolm to deal with family problems on his own, such as stepson Trey wanting to ditch a college education at Duke University, so that he can become a rap artist. Trey is underage, and needs his dad's signature in order to sign a contract with a music producer. In what is probably not the brightest of ideas, Trey decides to follow Malcolm on a bust of some Russian gangsters, hoping he can corner him and convince him to sign the contract. (I told you these characters were dumb.) This leads to Trey witnessing a murder, and having the gangsters gunning after him. Malcolm decides that the best way for his stepson and him to remain inconspicuous is to dress in drag, a fat suit, and clothes that look like they were stolen from a circus clown's wardrobe.They head for the Georgia All Girl's School for the Performing Arts, where incriminating evidence against the mobsters has been conveniently hidden, and even more conveniently, a position for housemother has opened up. No need for any real credentials or background checks, apparently. \"Big Momma\", with Trey posing as her granddaughter, show up and immediately get wrapped up in campus life, and the various emotional problems (boys, the stress to be popular and \"perfect\") that the students face. The movie can't think of a single funny thing to do with its premise. Every scene ends with either a tired physical gag (Big Momma poses nude for an art class!), or sometimes no laugh at all, just an awkward transition to the next scene. I guess we're supposed to get caught up in the subplot of how Trey falls for one of the girls at the school (Jessica Lucas), and is forced to keep his feelings and identity a secret. All I could think about is how does this girl not realize that Trey and his female disguise are one and the same person, especially since she spends ample personal time with both of his identities? I don't think I'm spoiling much by revealing that Big Mommas ends with the gangsters getting what they deserve, and father and son bonding during their time in drag together. This is an unwanted and miscalculated comedy that is so lacking in energy and entertainment, it's mind boggling. Nobody up on the screen looks like they want to be there, and as the movie dragged on through its overlong 107 minutes, I felt a connection with them. At least I was feeling something.",

            "content": "We get this every January/February, one movie comes around that reminds us all how good Oscar season was, 2 months prior. In 2009 we had Bride Wars. In 2010 we had When in Rome. This year it's Big Momma 3.Absolutely nothing in this film was funny, nor I or the audience of about 40 people laughed once at this cataclysmic attempt at a comedy. Martin Lawrence sets the art of humour back an entire decade with this go-nowhere performance, he's practically sleep-walking through the entire movie, are things really that bad Martin? how badly do you need a check? the last thing i remember seeing him in was Wild Hogs 4 years ago and that was a masterpiece compared to this slop.The plot circles around Lawrence's stepson (Brandon T. Jackson) being targeted by some Russian mafia for witnessing a murder. Lawrence's character is a respected FBI agent, is the only thing he can think of to hide his stepson; dressing him in drag and enrolling he and himself as members of an all girls school? This obviously paves the way for a ton of teen-sex jokes, alas there are barely any attempts at this (got to keep that precious PG-13 rating guys).A comedy that fails to get a single laugh out of some 40 people is a huge failure in my eyes. Let's not let this film be forgotten because it came out so early on in the year, critics at the end of 2011 need to be prepared to put this on their list of worst films of the year. If not - then any of the films that beat it will have to be spectacularly awful.",

            "content": "\"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son\" is the third movie in the series, and honestly, they might have considered stopping after the second movie. The first one was hilarious, the second one not so much. And now the third one has been unleashed upon us movie-lovers.For a comedy, then \"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son\" is rather weak, because there is only a handful of situations that proved to be funny. And even less so actually managed to make me laugh. I think I laughed once or twice throughout the entire movie. So it was a disappointing experience to watch this movie.The storyline is somewhat simple, so even your family's dog can keep up with it. Some incriminating evidence is stored on a USB key, evidence that can bring down some big criminals. Yeah, very original there already. And the USB key is hidden in an all-girls school, and it is up to detective Malcolm to find it and bring the criminals to justice. Only this time he brings his son into it! Yeah, his son. Now, what father in his right mind would bring his own flesh and blood into a situation where his life is in danger, and much more so bring his son into cross-dressing? Back it up right there! The storyline was weak and very hard to believe and get into, because it was so over the top.Now, Martin Lawrence does a good job as Malcolm and Big Momma, as he did in the previous two movies. So if you are familiar with those two, you know what you will be getting. This is good, but at the same time it is also bad. Why keep squeezing the lemon when there is no more juice to come out? Brandon T. Jackson (playing Trent/Charmaine) did a good job as well, except for when he portrayed Charmaine; I found that strenuous to watch. Ken Jeong (playing the mailman) was a hilarious spot to the movie, despite he was there for only a few minutes. And for a noticeable performance of the younger talents, then Michelle Ang (playing Mia) brought a good deal of spark and comedy to the movie. In overall, the acting was good and the performances were well enough. The movie was just suffering from being a movie that had a weak story.I suppose for hardcore fans of Martin Lawrence, then \"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son\" will be a blast. But for the ones that watched part 1 and 2, then part 3 is a very dull and humorless movie.",

There is only one way to complete this...become Big Momma again. After watching the first two I was actually kind of looking forward to this one. The first one was a good movie, but I thought the second one was funnier. This one took all that was funny about the first two and replaced it with \"High School Musical\" aspects. A lot of choreographed dance sequences and a lot of singing, not what I expected to see in this movie. Although there were a few funny parts, the movie was a re-hash of the same jokes from the first two, but not as funny. This is a perfect example of Hollywood running out of ideas and only doing re-makes, turning TV shows into movies, prequels and sequels that don't need to be made. After a five year break another sequel to Big Momma didn't seem to be needed, and after watching this it only made that fact more clear. Overall this movie does for the Big Momma series what \"Batman & Robin\" did to the \"Batman\" series, or what \"Rocky 5\" did to the \"Rocky\" series. Makes you think...why didn't they stop at the last one? I give it a C-.Would I watch again? - No way, but like the other series I mentioned I would watch the others before this one if they were on TV.*Also try - Big Mommas House 1 & 2",

I don't remember them though being as bad as this one, which is one of the worst movies of the year so far in my opinion. The film doesn't look anything special visually, likewise with the soundtrack which was nice to listen to but forgettable not long after. The direction is often unfocused and while Martin Lawrence is good Brandon T.Jackson tries too hard and ends up over-compensating. It was the humour, characters and the story that sinks the film. The story is rushed and predictable, the characters are annoying and little more than irritating stereotypes-some of whom also verge on offensive- and the script is dire and the jokes tasteless. All in all, really quite dire. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "It's funny how an FBI agent goes under the guise of a fat woman (or more precisely, a Big Momma) and uses it as his modus operandi during the bigger missions. The second time on doing so was inconsequential and by the end of the unendurable, unnecessary stay in Big Momma's House, he gave the family a farewell letter which was a dreadful debacle made worse by the promise on it \u2013 'Keep a lookout. You never know when Big Momma might be back.\" So Big Momma is back but the subject is changed to plural.Big Mommas: Like Father Like Son is exactly what it says on the title. Brandon T. Jackson, Alpa Chino from Tropic Thunder, supersedes Jascha Washington as the teenage stepson Trent, alias Charmaine Daisy Pierce when undercover who is Big Momma's great niece. The film, as well as sequel, is a reboot to the series by initiating Trent as the lead character and opting to appeal to a teenage audience instead of a mature or family-friendly one like the predecessors. Trent predominates on-screen time here hence gives some room for character development, seeing Malcolm is at it for the third time and his antics have become predictable.The hindrance that Charmaine suffers from is his romantic susceptibility with his irresistible urge to enunciate a sound in such a way that shows his impression of the lady. Unable to adapt to a lady without having sexual desires, this state of affairs sets up the film's subplot of him dating school colleague Haley \u2013 like Malcolm and Sherry in the first film hence this film's title. Over the course of the film, Trent develops from conceited rapper to a more mature man comprehending and appreciating women in a greater manner. The side of Trent that isn't established as well as it should have been is his goal of becoming a rapper. It becomes sceptical to an audience when Trent transfers his identity that he wants to become a rapper. No fighting back with Malcolm to prevent himself from entering undercover mode nor an attitude showing commitment to achieving his aspiration. After that, several references are scattered throughout that he already is his own rapper despite a record label contract pending from the start and all throughout. The idea that I got was that being a rapper was just a background to quickly import his character into the story and as something to identify him.Brandon T. Jackson is literally indistinguishable as his female alter ego. The wardrobe team went to town on make up with the character like they did with Big Momma. It's ludicrous how the father and son manage to dress and undress as their other half with an outrageous amount of fully body prosthetics in a terribly short amount of time when they're on the run. Often it could be wondered, are they undercover FBI agents or lame superheroes? Not even Mrs Doubtfire could prepare so quickly, and Robin Williams didn't spawn any sequels to wreck his amiable disguised character.If credit is due for any character in this film, it belongs to Kurtis Kool, played by Faizon Love (video game buffs must remember Sweet from GTA: San Andreas whom Love voiced). By far the most entertaining character in the film, the only character sustaining the comedy the film intended for, even if its just the way he says \"Momma said knock you out!\" The character's crazy crush on Big Momma makes for a hilarious little sub-plot that is perhaps the best bit of the film, ranging from his funny feelings for her to an amusing game of Twister between the two.This is the third time unlucky for Martin Lawrence as a single character. The first was merely decent, second went down like a lead balloon, and this part definitely shows signs of a universal panning. The injury added to the insult that this film is that there was no positive production changes - no new director and more importantly, there is still not a good screenplay which was a calamity in the previous films. On the other hand, the first two rocketed in grossing at the box office. Judging from the financial success of the first two, Big Mommas: Like Father Like Son may be another surprise hit but in this dead zone of cinema, there are far better alternates to view.Verdict: Martin Lawrence should seriously stop. For Brandon T. Jackson, if there's another instalment, the production will need to be fixed a lot before the crimes are looked into. And I guess you were hoping for a positive review but sorry, I'm only being honest.",

            "content": "Ahh, what can I say? It's weak and dry. At times, I wanted to leave my seat. And instead of laughing, I suffered the absence of laughing or even smiling!To know why it was like that; I have one fair answer to you: The Script. This story is worn away, and the writing didn't spend much effort on renewing it a bit. I recalled (Some Like it Hot - 1959) all the way, (White Chicks - 2004) for some time, and the original Big Momma's movie; (Big Momma's House - 2000), naturally. Though, it isn't bad for a movie to be like older movies, the real bad is being anything else their qualities as well. And that's what this movie pulled off perfectly!I saw all the events miles before happening, and to add a ton of fuel, the comedy didn't compensate. In fact, I didn't run into comedy in the first place. All what this movie had to make laughs was couple of situations, which you could call, truthfully, nauseating and unfunny!So there was no new story, new dealing or any comedy. The third alone is sad for a comedy to achieve. Add to that, side bugging notes. To instance: While the sight of Big Momma is horrible, she always finds a man who falls for her. And, this time, the man who fell for her before then knew her secret as a man, does it again??!! The teacher of the fine art class sure got enough time to know Big Momma's fact as a man, though the movie rushed that moment strangely. It tells a lot that there was something wrong with the comic sense of the movie's directing or editing!Nevertheless, it wasn't all bad. It had some, rather a few, merits. It preferred not to use the nasty stuff that every comedy nowadays obligatorily has (sex jokes, rude language, and - yes - farting). Although it contained an unnecessary urinating scene, but thank god it was just one! (Brandon T. Jackson) gave so right performance. Dancing with (Martin Lawrence), in one scene, was done without any artificiality. And the moment of writing a song during the first date was inspired and sweet. However, these were the only \"original\" moments of this ceremony of failed rehashing!I was sad the most for (Martin Lawrence). That guy assures, with many movies, that his mentality is poor. Look at him choosing no daring project, no original idea, one after another. And he just doesn't work it out smartly. Thus, here, I messed him on screen. There was no actual funny stuff for him to perform, and clearly he didn't come up with a material of his own. This is one of his least enjoyable comedies. The thing is, you can say the same about most of his comedies lately!I have always said that (Lawrence) doesn't have it to do pure action, drama, romance like his fellow (Will Smith). But according to movies like (Big Momma 3), I knew that he doesn't have the clever mentality of (Smith) too! So he must learn himself a lesson and think twice, or think, about the scripts which he selects, since there is nothing uglier than non funny comic star!The problem of (Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son) isn't about having no originality with the formulaic plot; it's about having no juice inside this formulaic plot, as if the writers didn't have time to make any creative situations or amusing lines; I bet, this movie doesn't make its own makers laugh! So with another script, or true script, it could have been comic and memorable. Because being the way it is, makes it a disposable movie to be watched and forgotten. Dully watched and quickly forgotten to be precise!",

            "content": "In the vein of films like \"Boys Don't Cry\" and \"Transamerica\", \"Big Momma's Like Father Like Son\" dares to take on the taboo subject of transgenderism, a subject so often dodged by both mainstream and independent cinema. Yet this film dares to travel further into the taboo by displaying this theme with a backdrop of the relationship between an urban African- American father and son (a community that often shuns or ignores LGBT issues).This dramatic comedy stars Martin Lawrence as Malcolm Turner, a frustrated man stuck behind his tough machismo identity, as both an FBI agent and African-American father. But the viewer quickly learns that the machismo displayed by Turner is guise to the true identity that liberates him, that of Hattie Mae Pierce, a confident large elderly black woman.Unable to connect with his rapper son, brilliantly played by Brandon T. Jackson, the younger Turner is invited into his fathers secret world, when Hattie Mae Pierce takes a job at an all girls school, and insists he join him as a student under the guise of a female identity. But the line of Turner/Pierce's life between housemother and FBI agent becomes complicatedly blurred while trying to give her son a first hand understanding of her chosen lifestyle. Meanwhile the son grows increasingly tired of masking his true identity (thus finally understanding how his father feels) and ends up rejecting the transgender lifestyle for a cisgender one after falling in love with a female classmate. As the film closes with Malcolm Turner finishing a final FBI case, father and son, n\u00e9e, mother and son, head back home, both equipped with a better understanding of who they and each other are and what their relationship truly means to one another. Bravo to director John Whitesell for making such an inspiring addition to LGBT cinema! 5/5 stars.",

It felt like it was more for 11 year old girls rather then a movie that you and your buddy can enjoy. However sometimes these \"corny\" movies can pull it off and i think this one did just that!Ignore the low rating, I don't think it was really that bad. It may not be Martin Laurence at his best, but take into account that he was doing a more \"kiddy\" movie this time. It did manage to keep me entertained, even though the plot was flat and predictable, I did laugh along with the crowd at Big Mommas wittiness. Also action wise, i would say it was kept at a mediocre level but you can't expect much from a PG movie!You know when people say \"watch it with an open mind and you will enjoy it\" Sorry but this is most definitely one of those movies. What disappointed me the most was i expected a storyline just like the first Big Momma, that's why i was so let down. One other thing is, at times i thought i was watching \"High School Musical\" (you will understand what i mean if you've seen it!)It could most definitely fall under the category, \"It's so bad, that it's good\" But i think the whole purpose of this film was aimed at a younger audience, you can tell that automatically by looking at the cast. It's not the easiest to review because when the film ended i was neither disappointed or satisfied, it was more like a good way to kill a hour or two.Chances are your kids will love it and you won't be to tortured because it will bring out a couple of giggles and I must admit it, the songs were very catchy and quite nicely done.

In an effort to retrieve some valued evidence and also to protect his son's life, Malcolm aka Big Momma enters an all-girl school dragging along his son Trent aka Charmaine with him. It gets into all kind of crazy when that young boy ends up in an all-girls dorm. Boys will be boys.John Whitesell should have left the franchise be. He just revived it and it fell harder than it did during the 2nd movie back in 2006. Everything was not right in the movie. I will shine some light on a few.The Cast.You can't bring in amateurs alongside a star comedian. Martin Lawrence aced his way through the movie. He was brilliant as Malcolm and he was even better as Big Momma. I wish I could have said better about Brandon T Jackson. He was good, but Lawrence was just too good for him. It was not Just Jackson the entire cast I felt was too weak to be up beside a great like Lawrence. Imagine watching \"Wild Hogs\" with Martin Lawrence and this same cast. Wild Hogs was a hit, but if the cast was not right, it just won't fly well. Jessica Lucas was gorgeous but her performance was not very convincing either. It was a good strategy to cast in Lawrence to boost the ticket sales, but it just won't fly without support. The ScriptThis was the only good thing out of the bad. The script was written with a lot of fast moving and slapstick comedy. This is a good sign. When a script is average this means with the right talent behind the camera and the right talent in front of the camera, the production will scrape to come above average. A good effort by the writers. Sadly yet again, it will not fly without the support.DirectionJohn Whitesell is no newbie. He has been around for some time. Although he is not household as many of the big fish in the industry, he did give us \"Malibu's Most Wanted\". Although not a soaring success story on its own, it was watchable and it was funny. It's sometimes felt as if this was done on a very low budget. A very low one indeed.I am so glad I didn't waste any money buying tickets to go watch this, but I indeed regret the time I lost.",

            "content": "Even though it's only been three months into the year, it's almost certain that this third Big Momma movie will end up as one of the worst reviewed movies of 2011. The hostility it has received from critics is utterly perplexing to say the least, for it is to this reviewer perfectly genial entertainment- even though it may have gotten a little derivative of itself after exploiting what essentially was a one-note joke. Yes, it was more than ten years ago when Martin Lawrence first debuted as the F.B.I. agent Malcolm Turner, whose idea of undercover was to don fat suits, fake breasts and plus-size women's clothes for a getup known as Big Momma. And surprise, surprise- the first movie become an unexpected success at the box office, prompting another sequel which didn't do as well but still made money, and here we are five years after the first sequel for what many have called an unnecessary threequel. True, it is unnecessary in the strictest sense of the word, but so are the inexplicably successful Tyler Perry films where he appears in granny-drag as Madea, or even the intellectually challenged \"White Chicks\" which was pure bimbo/himbo fun. Still, there's no denying Martin Lawrence is amusing in what has become the most famous character of his career, and \"Big Mommas: Like Father Like Son\" was just another excuse to watch him do what he does best. It is with that expectation that you'll learn to look past the lazy plotting by Matthew Fogel and Don Rhymer, setting up a laughably bad premise involving a Russian mobster (Tony Curran) and a flash drive with incriminating evidence acquired by Malcolm's snitch. It is also with that expectation that you'll look past the uninspired direction of returning director John Whitesell, who doesn't know how to stage an action scene or for that matter a car chase to save his life. If the film remains watchable right till the end, it is surely because of Martin Lawrence remains just as funny- even the third time round. You can already get a sneak peek of the funniest gags in the trailer, but it is still hilarious to see Big Momma attempt to dance on top of a table in the middle of the boarding school's dining room, or model butt naked sans a white cloth across his/her chest like the Romans did, or attempt to fend off the advances of the school's hulking security guard (an uncredited Faizon Love). Lawrence also gets a drag partner in the form of his rapper-stepson Trent (Brandon T. Jackson), whom he tries to protect while looking for that crucial piece of evidence in the up-scale all-girls boarding school. Trent's Charmaine doesn't share many scenes with Big Momma, spending most of her time amidst the other nubile girls in the same house, including getting romantic ideas on one of them, singer- songwriter Haley (Jessica Lucas). Jackson proves just as effective a comedian in drag as Lawrence, and is especially a hoot when confronting his co-eds in their nighties. And ultimately, it is the lively performances of Lawrence and Jackson who make this Big Mommas sequel worth its weight. Sure, it won't go down as a comedy classic any time, and you probably won't remember much about it by the time it ends, but it is still funny while it lasts, and will leave you in a pleasant mood. Admittedly, this won't be everyone's definition of humour but hey if you enjoyed Big Mommas 1 and 2, you'll definitely find this just as amusing.www.moviexclusive.com",

Trent witnesses a murder and together with his father, they are trying to locate the killer. Malcolm tries to find evidence against the murderer and with Trent, they make lots of adventures at school!Content: Trent passed the high school and was accepted at Duke University. His stepfather, Turner wants him to continue studying, but he wants to be a rapper. He tries to sign him a contract after his mother is on vacation, but he refuses. To get the signature, Trent chases his father and witnesses a murder, committed by the Russian Chirkoff. Therefore, they dress up as women and go to the \"Georgia girls school for the arts\". Malcolm is looking for a USB stick containing evidence against the killer Chirkoff. He discovers that the USB stick is in a music box, which was stolen from the library. Trent screws up the undercover mission when he was seen by friends during a date with Haley, as himself. The gang members of Chirkoff introduced themselves as record producers to Trent's friends and asked to inform them if they saw him. The members can not find him when he goes undercover as Charmaine Daisy Pierce. Unfortunately ,Trent exposes himself when he sings a song with his own voice. Therefore, he escapes with Turner and Haley but get caught by Chirkoff. The school guard, Kurtis shoots him and rescues them at the last moment. Finally, the killer and his accomplices are arrested. They return to their house and then, the movie ends.Opinion: Big Mommas: Like Father, Like son is an American comedy movie which contains American humor. The passage in which Turner talks with a white person on the phone occurs a typical American humor scene. The white person calls him chocolate and this is a situation humor. Turner, as Big Momma is pretty and gives spontaneous reactions. His jokes are simple and you don't require any background knowledge. So I think that this is a great American comedy movie because the jokes were easy and it amused me. From my viewpoint, this is a must-watch movie!",

Basically Malcolm Turner (Martin Lawrence, nominated the Razzie for Worst Actress as Big Momma) is still hard at work with the FBI, and his stepson Trent 'Prodi-G' (Brandon T. Jackson) has grown up to be an aspiring rapper despite being accepted into Duke University. One night Malcolm is caught in the middle of a gang raid, and Trent witnesses the leader Chirkoff (Doctor Who's Tony Curran) killing someone, and this forces him and his stepfather to hide somewhere to stop him finding them. So naturally Malcolm has once again donned the Hattie Mae 'Big Momma' Pierce outfit and disguise, and Trent has done the same to become her great niece Charmaine, and they are entering all-girls performing arts school. While hiding out they are also looking for a flash drive hidden somewhere in the school, Big Momma is the head of the house (of course), and she gains a slight enemy in Jasmine (Portia Doubleday), and Trent is gaining a crush on Haley Robinson (Jessica Lucas). Trent's feelings soon go over his head, and he almost forgets that he is meant to stay in disguise and hide from any possible gangsters, but he cannot stop his feelings taking over and wanting to be himself for Haley. After lots of trouble, near-misses, concern from principal Gail (My Name Is Earl's Ana Ortiz) and a big talent contest, the gangsters eventually find out where Malcolm and Trent are, and the flash drive is found as well, but in the end the bad guys are caught, Haley stays with Trent, who also decides to go with the advice of \"father\" Malcolm and go to University after all. Also starring Faizon Love as janitor Kurtis Kool, Michelle Ang as Mia, Emily Rios as Isabelle, Henri Lubatti as Vlad and The Hangover's Razzie nominated Ken Jeong as Mailman.

Directed by John Whitesell whose Malibu's Most Wanted had its laughs, but after directing the pathetic Big Momma's House 2 you would think he would have learned his lesson. This film only adds one more person to the concept of going in drag. Lawrence has this role down pat, which is to say that it is standard and routine. He hides his son while he searches for the criminals. Jackson actually elevates above the material. He desires to be a rap singer but in the midst of getting his father's approval he witnesses a shooting. In drag he does have his moments of amusement despite an ending where he cannot be two people at once. Jessica Lucas has the boring role of piano player whom Jackson falls for despite the fact that she thinks he is a female. Portia Doubleday plays the snide stuck up sorority sister who seems to call the shots. It is a boring role played countless times before. Tony Curran has the thankless role of Russian gang leader and it has all the ambition of countless roles just like it. While this is a slight improvement over the first two disastrous Big Momma movies, it is still pretty much the same crap over again. It is slightly better only due too Jackson's contribution, otherwise it is a big fat waste of time. Score: 1 \u00bd / 10",

            "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Agent Malcolm (Martin Lawrence) returns, this time with seventeen year old son Trent (Brandon T. Jackson) in tow, who's trying to pursue a rap career, but his father has little faith. But things change when a Russian mob boss gets it in his head that Trent saw him kill someone, and the pair are forced to go undercover at an all girls performing arts school, with Trent taking the guise of singing sensation Charmaine and Malcolm reprising his guise of the indomitable 'Big Momma.' The original Big Momma's House presumably gained a bit of a cult following in spite of what couldn't exactly have been amazing reviews, since two sequels were spawned, the latest being this, erm, questionable piece of work that is one of the sadder products of the sequel reliant recession era times. Though it might get success with it's target audience when the absurdity and slapstick works at it's best, for the most part it just drags a tired set up out without enough laughs to keep it going. And it's at least ten minutes too long, but really, this review has been about five lines too long. *",

So, they need to go into hiding and to find some kind of computer drive. They know it is at an all girls school for the performing arts. So Malcolm becomes Big Momma and Trent is Charmaine. There is a really funny scene where the hot girl Trent likes, Haley, sings in the cafeteria, and everyone joins in and Big Momma gets her grove on and crashes a table. Then there is the security guard that has the hots for Big Momma. His scenes where funny, especially Twister. Then Big Momma becomes a nude model, did we really need to see that! FINAL VERDICT: If you liked the other sequels, you'll like this one.",

Trent would rather be a rapper by the name of Prodi-G. So one day he's approached by a record label but the contract needs a guardian's signature since he's only 17. Malcolm (Martin Lawrence) doesn't sign the paper since he thinks it would be better if Trent (Brandon T. Jackson) stays in school. So Trent follows Malcolm on a stake-out to see if he can force him to sign the record contract, but finds himself witnessing a murder by a Russian bad guy. Malcolm has a plan to hide the both of them until they catch the murder at the Georgia Girls School of the Arts. Hilarious. All around great comedy/crime story for all ages, but it is pg-13. I think this one is the funniest out of the franchise. I think people will now have confidence in watching another Martin Lawrence Film. Loved it 4 out of 5 stars.",

The plan? Go undercover as Big Momma (again) only this time Trent (in the guise of great-niece Charmaine) is forced to tag along as part of a package deal. Does more really need to be said? Fully grown Jackson is miscast, and never a bit believable in the role of Lawrence's college-aged son, and the flimsy plot about a criminal and his elaborate scheme are just a ploy for the two stars to don the makeup and accessories. Viewers would likely give all this nonsense a pass if the film were actually funny--too bad it's not. The epitome of an unnecessary third entry if there ever was one, the coup de gr\u00e2ce to an overlong franchise. *\u00bd",

            "content": "It's interesting that the week after I saw a movie where male actors play female characters, I saw another movie where the same thing happens, only the male actors are playing male character pretending to be female. So the difference is that in the movie I saw earlier, the audience is supposed to believe the characters are female. In this one, only the other characters are supposed to believe this.I believe I have seen one, if not two, Big Momma movies. I was getting this mixed up with Madea, But I like both franchises.The disguises work really well. I would have believed these were women, more so than in the other movie. Malcolm makes a really good house mother as \"she\" deals with basically good but rebellious teens at a girls' arts school. Trent, his stepson, is not quite as convincing when he tries to talk, and his attraction to women is clear, and quite funny, at least to me. But one wonders in those situations how Trent can pass for a girl except for the fact that Charmaine COULD be a lesbian. And while no one mentions Charmaine's obvious appreciation for the female body, perhaps that would have worked.Wait until you see Big Momma get nekkid for art class. No, with her fat suit, she can't really do that, but she comes quite close. The fat suit is really convincing.Trent's reckless behavior in the face of danger is a constant presence. Malcolm's hardest job is keeping his stepson safe as Trent takes risks in order to be with the beautiful Haley. Actually, his hardest job may be fighting off the advances of the overweight security guard Kurtis Kool, who is strangely attracted to Big Momma. But Kurtis may be the key to finding the important flash drive that will solve the case for the FBI, and save him and his stepson from being killed by the bad guys. And even Charmaine has the opportunity to ask the right questions of the other girls.While the other movie is clearly superior, I thought this one was pretty good and quite entertaining. Martin Lawrence gives a good performance (I mean for this material) both as Malcolm and even better as Big Momma. No one will win Oscars here, but several of the performances are equally good or better.Jessica Lucas is quite appealing as an actress and a talented singer and pianist (I assume she is the one playing). Her romance with Trent is bumpy but somewhat appealing, and does have some positive results. Though I think you can predict what will happen later. The question is how.Faizon Love is very entertaining as well. I wasn't crazy about him but I believe he will appeal to others.Brandon Jackson is better when trying to be Charmaine than he is as Trent, but he is also a good rapper, if there is such a thing. Seriously, I do like old school in some cases. Speaking of which, there is a nice moment as Trent and Malcolm try to mix The Temptations with rap.Ken Jeong has a sort of humorous cameo as a mailman being attacked by Malcolm, who has no right to do what he did to a postal worker, even if he is FBI. I think both professions should have been shown more respect than this scene gave. But Malcolm was desperate to learn if his son got into Duke. If you can forget about the ethical issues, just enjoy it.I'm sorry to say that, while this movie has a Heather like the other movie did, the nasty anorexic ballet dancer only manages a few genuinely funny lines and turns out not to be nearly as bad as we first thought.Luckily for our heroes, the bad guys are bumbling idiots, but still quite dangerous.If you immediately hate the idea of watching either Big Momma or Madea, don't bother. But if you find this sort of thing appealing, this just may be for you.",

There is this girl who i like very much. She is the type of woman who i would love to marry someday, but unfortunately she goes to a college in a city about 3 hours away form my university, so i rarely get to see her. We managed to develop something of a friendly relationship this summer, and so we keep up by texting and skyping regularly, and such. She came in to town this weekend, so i was very excited to do everything i could to impress her and show her that the boys at her school cant compare to my undeniable swag. Everyhting was going perfect. we met up, we hung out at a football game with some friends, went to sonic, and decided to rent a movie.... For some reason, the two of us and the three other friends we were with thought that \"Big Mamas house: like father like son\" might be a wise movie choice. We couldn't have been further from the truth. The movie is not even 'so stupid its funny' funny. We all sat in my living room with no expression on our faces and headaches and glazed eyes. My evening was ruined. She is never going to come to my house again. Thank you big mama for ruining my potential satisfaction in life. don't see this movie, under any circumstances, but particularly if you care about anyone around you.",

Very outdated and I would recommend White Chicks over this any day, that's actually got some spirit to it. I think Martin Lawrence tries too hard with his comedy, I've never really liked him, but that's just my opinion. He's not a \"funny\" guy and can never get the balance right between action/police cop star and comedian. The Wayans brothers are \"funny\" and pull it off naturally.",

Nia Long's character has been written out of the film.The punchless fighting between Momma and an attitude dancer doesn't assist the listless comedy.

I thought Charmaine was very sweet and Jackson really brought home that endearing quality to this character. Mia was a good lesson to all young women to believe in themselves and know they are more than their relationships (& know when to ditch a fool girl!). Kurtis Cool is a riot with his dope sham and car wash! LOL! There are, of course, a few corny parts but it only adds to the movie's charm. Its a comedy worth watching again and again!
