            "content": "I've seen movies that have plot holes big enough to drive trucks through, some big enough to drive aircraft carriers through, but this has got to be the first movie that I've seen that an entire planet could get through the myriad of plot holes.*****Oh Yes there be SPOILERS***** Plot Hole 1 So, let me understand this correctly, the ENTIRE Detroit Police Department has gone on vacation for this movie.We start out with 3 guys pulling over a car in downtown Detroit in the middle of the morning by jumping out of their vehicle and just rattling off a whole bunch of rounds with automatic weapons. LITERALLY hundreds, perhaps thousands of bystanders, and not ONE of them thinks to call 911? Oh, and of course there isn't a police car within 1 or 2 miles of this location? Plot Hole 2 The boys speed away in a vehicle that is completely discreet, practically invisible... a brand new Chrysler White Van with a logo on it, to some location down near the river to wait for their contact to show up. Now of course, one of the 3 bad guys turns on his two friends that he grew up with and shoots them, leaving one of them alive of course, otherwise the movie would end there...wouldn't that have been NICE? Then we have plot holes that I cannot understand because they're so strange.The Shooter has a sister that NEITHER one of his BEST BOYHOOD friends know about and she just happens to be the DRIVER for the guy they robbed.Oh, the guy that got killed and was OBVIOUSLY one of the three guys that pulled off the robbery just gets collected by ???? and has a nice funeral instead of perhaps a cop or two determining who he was and looking for his friends, etc. (Maybe in the cutbacks in Detroit there's no homicide department or violent crimes department or robbery department) Then we have a hit-man (we don't ever learn who he works for) and we have Bruce Willis entering as the Mob Boss who magically finds the guy who got shot (50 cent) and wants to hire him to do a job for him which has NOTHING to do with the earlier things.I watched this because I LIKE Bruce Willis, he's a good actor and does a lot of really good movies, but really Bruce, did they offer you THAT much money you couldn't walk away from this one? You cannot watch this movie without going WTF at least a dozen times. I've reviewed some movies that I've advised you to just enjoy and go along for the ride because of the great action sequences, THIS is NOT going to be one of them. PLEASE give this a pass and let it end up in the BARGAIN BIN of some obscure convenience store as soon as possible.",

Unfortunately this was not the case. I found the film to be poorly directed, the acting wooden and the storyline predictable if slightly erratic. After reading the synopsis I kind of thought I would be in for a decent hour and a half. I found myself dropping off 55 minutes into the film which for an action film is pretty poor. Of course, I say action but the truth is there was very little action in it. Add to it a strange religious undertone which I suppose is to signify the lead role is looking for redemption and you get a complete mismatch/ conflict of interests. I give it a generous four out of ten but take into consideration this is about the lowest I have ever scored a film.",

I could describe this movie as a \"wanna be movie\"...the director wants to be Guy Ritchie but he is not...50 cent wants to be an actor but he is not, Ryan Phillipe wants to be a bad guy but he is not, because of his baby face...when you see Bruce Willis on the cover you expect him to be actually present in the movie but he is not...everything in this project is poor...i really gave it a chance and watched all 90 min but it was a waste of time. The act was too slow, it tried to build up characters but it failed...many things were simply not there as script and acting. I had hard time understanding the words of 50 cent, Ryan Phillipe was OK but this character was simply not for him...he matches other roles much better...Bruce Willis was OK too but he had a very small and insignificant role.",

It's just a over hyped B grader by using a few big name actors, sure Ryan Phillippe is in it here and there but Bruce Willis is in it only for the name, as he is in this film for around 20 minutes, Bruce is only in it to prop up this film. 50 cents is just not credible as an actor, and Bruce and Ryan can't help him raise the bar past the level of B grade.The story is nothing new, it's predictable and plain boring, and that music score! they are really trying to make this sound like a serious crime drama, but they failed, it just proves again it takes more then well know actors to make a good film.Would I recommend this film? yeah sure if I did not like you! give it a miss, walk your dog instead, wash your car, ring your mum! as this film is not worth wasting your time on.Solid 1 out of 10, it would have been a zero but I did love that GTO, the main high light of the film.",

No, you are entirely wrong.I've never seen such an amateurish film with such high-profile actors. It seems like out of $22 million spent on this flick, $20 million have been spent on actors' fees, and the remaining trifling sum of money was spent on production.This film lacks everything - what you get is very bad acting, an incoherent unrealistic plot. Basically, you cannot help but wonder why everything happens the way it's portrayed because most of the scenes in the movie make no sense at all.",

            "content": "Barely interesting since this scenario already have been used thousand times. A heist, then betrayal (a necessary twist, without it the storyline simply wouldn't take off), then the guy who was betrayed and gun down miraculously survived, then seeking revenge, then the party that has been robbed sending out pros to seek out the robbers....then another 3rd party suddenly budged in, then things getting complicated (this we usually call a twist in the plot), then blah, blah, and blah. You know it and I know it where this story would end, you don't need me to show the direction, do you? The performance of Bruce Willis is so 1-dimensional stereotyped without any feeling like watching a dead fish pretends to be a human being. His acting is so pretentious with limited emotions and passions, without even trying to break some new ground for his later day acting transcendence or enhancement. There are more better senior actors to play this role but the casting agency seemed still believe this guy got some box office attraction. Believe you me, dude, he's not, because he can only play the same dead fish like character in different titled movies.The other two young actors indeed tried very hard to play the roles but since the screenplay is so formulaic and so predictable, they are just two very uninteresting characters in a very boring predictable movie. The only thing that needs to be recommended to these two younger actors is that they have shown been working out daily, so the long chase in the busy business area didn't show any fatigue or heavy breaths in the end. Obviously, the chase have been shot and edited together scene by scene, so they could still look so tireless.This is a very predictable and very forgettable old movie with a new title and different actors. Did you ever try to drink a lukewarm water?",

They reunite to successfully heist 5 million dollars in diamonds in a daring operation. However, Sonny and Dave are betrayed by Vincent that shots them and steel the diamonds. Sonny miraculously saves and seeks revenge against Vincent. Meanwhile the owner of the diamonds sends a hit-man to find Sonny and Vincent while the powerful mobster Biggs (Bruce Willis) forces Sonny to steal 2 million dollars from a Russian mafia. Sonny seeks out Vincent not only to revenge, but also to get rid off Biggs and his gangsters. \"Setup\" is a disappointing film with a poor screenplay. Bruce Willis, Ryan Phillippe and James Remar have minor participations and the character of 50 Cent is not well developed with an ambiguous personality. The director Mike Gunther makes another weak rip-off of Guy Ritchie's style and this comedy-action movie does not work. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): \"Sem Lei\" (\"Without Law\")",

            "content": "OK, so I didn't have particularly high expectations for this, and I'm not going to bother emphasising Curtis Jackson's flat performance, since it's likely you've seen how \"expressive\" this guy is in everything else he's ever done, as it is, if I know he's in a movie, I already have a pretty good clue that he won't be the highlight.So what else have we got? Ryan Phillippe, and Bruce Willis... OK, Bruce pulls out a reasonable performance, but he really doesn't have much to work with, due to a muddled, thin script.So of course the same difficulties apply to Ryan Phillippe, however, since he has a much larger part in this it's difficult to see that his performance is OK, and really he's let down by the poor script.Well, look, Curtis Jackson, I'm not sure why this guy wants to be an actor, for the moment he'll have to keep wanting, because he hasn't pulled anything out the sack with this one. It's not that his performance is dreadful, it's just ... empty, and he really isn't bringing any soul to his character, and I've got to say, I really hope he gets better than this, because I know he's going to keep trying.Anyway, if you watch this, brush the sick off yourself and go watch Way of the Gun so you can forgive Ryan Phillippe.In summary even casting a lead that could act probably wouldn't have save this shoddy script, but there's a few good moments that will entertain.",

I forgave the cheesy film look, figuring it was intended to be part of the look and feel of calibre of these characters - low grade hoodlums and unprofessional professionals. The sequencing of events is clumsy. The believability of what each of the characters is doing is way low. How one of the mob guys shoots himself in the head while waiting for \"a bag\" (was it pot? big deal!) is highly questionable. That the diamond guy (\"hit man\") finds our protagonist so easily, then tells him he's got a week (a week!?) to make good...well it was about there I began to consider to quitting this movie. How did they get Bruce Willis to sign on? Willis as the \"mob boss\" was...well, what can I say. His smirk just didn't convey Godfather. This movie is not worth watching.",

The script is just really dumb and it's clear none of the writers thought things through. It's just poorly written and doesn't make much sense. 50 cent is a horrible actor and I don't know why he keeps getting roles. He is the protagonist in this and it's difficult to sit through his acting. I am not sure if it's intentional but some scenes came off more humorous than serious and intimidating. It's tries to be cool and slick but just comes off dull, corny, lame and boring. And tries to copy Guy Ritchie's trademark movies but fails miserably. This is a skip. Not even worth a rental.1/10",

The plot can't decide what type of action movie it wants to be. It feels like the writers just strung a series of their favorite movie scenes from all their favorite movies randomly together. There is no action leading to the next action, just 50 running around sticking a gun in everyone's face and explaining the plot over and over again. Question: WHY ARE ALL THE CHARACTERS EXPLAINING TO ME WHAT I'M WATCH?! Answer: it's a dumbed-down movie for those people who are always asking questions during a movie.

Watching Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson act somewhat subservient to this guy ruins the movie early on. The third \"thug\" being Brett Granstaff was a terrible choice as his character is just this side of Ward Cleaver. Too \"goodie two-shoes\"-acting for that character to be part of any criminal setup. Unless, of course, he had been the brains of the outfit. Apparently, there were no brains at all.Guy betrays his partners in crime and to eliminate them, shoots each of them once in their shoulder, killing one of them instantly.

But our hero who is also a bad man gets off lucky; he lives to fight another day because he is just a lucky man as previously stated.

Okay, a story involving a bunch of characters that make no sense enfolds before our eyes. In the story that enfolds before us we experience bad acting, bad directing, bad cinematography, bad action, bad story, bad plot, bad dialogue, bad editing, bad camera-work, and bad everything...

            "content": "You know, if your going to pinpoint one person as being symbolic of everything that is wrong with straight-to-video movies, it's pretty much ridiculous. I mean, they're straight-to-video movies. Nobody expects anything worthy of mention for them. Yet, that is exactly what I am going to do.Rapper 50 Cent is symbolic of much of what is wrong with straight-to-video movies. It's funny how this guy went from being one of the biggest rappers on earth to a regular in such movies, but he's got a s#!t load of money, so he act/produce these movies. With \"Setup\", he somehow brings in two bigger stars-Ryan Phillipe and Bruce Willis of all people-into his world of mediocrity.Mr. Cent stars as Sonny, who along with his best friend, is shot (way to be subtle about one of your claims to fame) by Vincent Long (Phillipe) after a heist gone wrong, and now wants revenge. To get this revenge, he teams with the mob, which always works well in these movies. When the mob's muscle Petey (Randy Courture, in a rather thankless role) is shot, and things start to go south, mob boss Biggs (Willis) wants something done about all this.I will say these two things: Willis is good (though only around for like 10 minutes total) and the production values look much better than most straight-to-video movies. Then again, this did cost $20 million to make, which seems like a bit much for something like this, but hey. Apart from that, this is your typical bad cop/heist/whatever movie from Lionsgate and Grindstone Entertainment. That means there's a bad soundtrack made up of dull rock and uninteresting rap, badly written character drama, mostly bad acting (Phillipe's performance could be called bipolar, as he goes from committed to looking like he doesn't want to be there), plot points like a pseudo-religious angle that go nowhere, plot holes the size of craters, and no reason to care about anyone or anything that happens.Then there's 50 Cent. Look, there are rappers that have proved themselves to be good to decent actors. Look at Ice Cube, Ice T, RZA and Mos Def for example. 50 Cent is not one of those good actors. Next to Master P, he's the worst rapper trying his hand at acting I've ever seen. This is a man who is completely void of anything resembling dramatic chops, charisma or screen presence, and serves more as a vacuum than he does an actor. And that's one of the reasons why he's so bad for these kinds of movies. Sure, Phillipe and Willis are clearly there for the paycheck-that or they were blackmailed or owed somebody a favor-but guys like James Remar are talented guys. Yet, this is a vanity project for a man who couldn't act to save his life.If you are a hardcore 50 Cent fan (though I doubt that kind of thing still exists), you will want to see this.

            "content": "This film begins with three friends in Detroit named \"Vincent Long\" (Ryan Phillippe), \"Dave Hall\" (Brett Granstaff) and \"Sonny\" (Curtis Jackson) setting out to ambush a car carrying a stash of diamonds. However, during the heist-and for no particular reason--Vincent shoots and kills the unarmed man carrying the diamonds and then fires his pistol at point-blank range at both Dave and Sonny before speeding away with the driver of the other vehicle. What Vincent doesn't realize, however, is that the bullet intended for Sonny was deflected by a crucifix he was wearing and upon recovering a minute later has filled him with a intense desire for revenge upon the man who betrayed him. To make matters even worse for Vincent is the fact that there are other parties interested in retrieving the diamonds and Sonny has further complicated things by getting the mob boss of Detroit named \"Jack Biggs\" (Bruce Willis) also involved. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay film for the most part which could have been better with some added suspense or possibly a little more character development here and there. Be that as it may, while it wasn't a bad film necessarily, it wasn't nearly as good as it could have been and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",

This movie is not recommended even if you are watching it for free on blue-ray. If you are looking to have a laugh at 50 cent's acting then this might be the film for you but it's the sort which leaves you regretting that you watched it, I mean it's so bad that you can't even laugh at how terrible it is rather than feeling sorry for yourself and your money.",

Unfortunately it doesn't.The script is abysmal, and includes some genuinely laughable moments - which would have been a plus except for the fact that they occur in scenes which appear to be serious (Im referring to the dialogues between Sonny and the priest, which are ridiculously contrived). There's more, but I will keep this short.For me the worst aspect of the film was the 'acting' by Rapper 50 Cent. This guy really has nothing going for him on screen. Sorry, Mr Cent, but not OK to try to render a character in a single tone of voice and facial expression. To be honest, they could have got one of the crew to run around with a life-sized photo of this guy playing the part instead of the actor himself and it would have been more animated.Fundamentally this is a revenge tale that works by creating sympathy for the protagonist and therefore promising some retributive element to compensate for his plight. I wont give away any plot details in case you are actually unlucky enough to see this film, but I will say that in this regard the content isn't there either. In other words, the ending sucks.... which would be forgivable if the rest of the film leading up to it had any merit whatsoever. But it doesn't. It really is a total waste of time.

            "content": "\"Beatdown\" writer & director Mike Gunther's \"Set Up\" qualifies as a fair to middling crime thriller with characters who are lucky if they live and stupid because they die. A volatile young hood betrays two life-long friends after they pull off a daring daylight diamond heist in the middle of downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan, in the winter. \"Way of the Gun\" actor Ryan Phillippe is splendidly cast as a double-crossing villain named Vincent Long who kills his two best friends without a qualm. Unfortunately, Vincent doesn't finish the job with coup de graces for both of his old pals. Predictably, Sonny (a subdued Curtis '50 Cents' Jackson) survives the shooting with a slug stuck in his collarbone that his tattoo artist friend Joey extracts. Afterward, our protagonist sets out to exact vengeance on the psychotic Vincent. Wrecking revenge is more complicated that Sonny imagined. Acting on a tip from Joey, Sonny interrupts a poker game among wiseguys. Since they know nothing about Vincent, Sonny makes a mistake and robs them. Sonny encounters a ruthless mob boss, Mr. Biggs (Bruce Willis in a cameo) and tangles with Russian mobsters as well as the Italian gunsels. Gunther never wears out his welcome with this trim 85-minute opus, but it is formula from fade-in to fade-out done with more finesse than is customary. This is another one of those thrillers that opens in the present and then flashes back into the past and ultimately goes full circle back to the present. We learn that Vincent decided to take the diamonds to bribe the warden at the prison where his dastardly dad is serving time to keep him out of the general population. Veteran character actor James Remar of \"48 HRS\" makes a strong impression as a racist prison inmate who is Vincent's father. Randy Couture of \"The Expendables\" has a minor role as Petey, a lame-brained thug who accidentally shoots himself when he is playing with gun. Shaun Toub plays a mysterious hit-man who skulks about on the periphery searching for the stolen diamonds. His first encounter with Vincent yields an amusing surprise. Gunther contrives some interesting dialogue, but after 45 minutes it looks like he is channeling Quentin Tarantino. Every time that a new character is introduced, we see a graphic that identifies them. During one scene, a criminal sells marijuana that has been smuggled into the United States in the intestinal track of a boa constrictor; the dealer calls it 'snakeweed' because customs doesn't want to X-ray a snake. \"Punisher: War Zone\" lenser Steve Gainer has an annoying habit of abruptly zooming in fractionally in most scenes as if to endow this film with a sense of spontaneity.",

If you consider that a great loss to your lifetime archive of experience then I must also warn you that you will be missing out on some absolutely astounding performances from both 50 Cent and Phillipe, who have each individually found a new and unique way of taking something that was awful and turning it into an absolute cock up.Granted, this is not the usual thoughtful and eloquent type of review I would like to write for a film, but I just don't see the point in taking my time when the film makers clearly didn't. There is nothing in this film that even makes it worth spell-checking the review.Want a good Bruce Willis film, go watch 12 monkeys. Want a good 50 cent film? ...You'll have to wait for it to be made.",

The story feels half hearted and the greyed-out look works against it, giving it a cookie cutter feel. However, the film isn't quite as bad as I was fearing, and at least it's short and fast-paced, which means you won't really get bored about it.The story is about the familiar fall-out among thieves that takes place early on. The heist scene is well shot and brings to mind HEAT in its depiction of a large-scale shoot-out, definitely the best part of the movie. However, 50 Cent is a poor choice for the lead and quite unlikeable, while Ryan Philippe is miscast for his part. Bruce Willis is prominently featured on the cover but gets little screen time other than to intone gruff dialogue in a room for ten minutes or so. Randy Couture has a very small role too. At least the action's okay, with a foot chase in the second half that really captivates.",

But when things turn pear shaped, he finds himself on the run from him, whilst pursuing his own personal mission of vengeance against Vincent.Whether it's the victim of recession era Hollywood, a poor US box office performance or simply not viewed as good enough, Setup is one such film that's arrived straight to DVD on these shores. It's certainly received quite a critical mauling from certain quarters, and doesn't seem to have much of a superior IMDb rating. In light of this, I must admit I didn't have that big an interest in getting round to seeing it, but while I'm not ecstatic that I did, it was certainly a decent enough way to spend a bit of time. It's a compelling and engaging enough little film, clocking in at just under an hour and a half, that does require you to pay attention and keep up with everything going on, not exactly LA Confidential but interesting enough.It may simply have been written off as another one of 'Fiddy' Cent's dud straight to DVD entries, after the likes of Blood Out and Gun, with his big screen career now practically none existent, and he's certainly as wooden in this as he's always been, with a supporting cast including Phillipe and Remar not lifting the bar any higher than you would expect. Willis, the most surprising cast member of all, is probably the most enthralling member of the, ahem, set up, doing his wise cracking character thing to entertaining effect.I suppose it is a bit of a dismissible effort when all is said and done, not likely to linger in your memory for long after you've seen it but not worthy of the really harsh things said about it. ***",

            "content": "This flick straight aggravated me - from about 10 minutes into the film I started questioning what I was seeing, how things didn't match up, how incoherent the story goes. Sequences don't match up and they never get summed up later in the film. The acting was downright horrible, as if the people (note, didn't say actors) come in to work, read their lines, go home. There's no actual acting in the movie sans Bruce Willis! And if you come to see Brucie as a crazy Mob Boss, you're in for a disappointment because not only is he not a significant character, he's barely in the flick! Granted, the few times he does grace the screen its about the best lines - like when his boys are torturing a Russian Mob agent, he says 'This defeats the whole point of f--- interrogating somebody, how are you going to get anything out of him when he's dead? You brought me all the way down for this? Now you have to go get another Russian!\" Classic! Ryan Phillips presented another dull performance similar to others he's done recently, Curtis 50 Cent Jackson merely played another version of himself he does in all his movies. Have no idea why they always have him do unnecessary narration in every film he's involved with? He mumbles mainly, might as well had him rap the narration, would have been more fitting. He's trying to act, but obviously needs lessons. Newer gangsta oriented flicks seem to be stuck in the doldrums, same ol' plot, same twist, same backstabber's. You knew who was snitching, you knew who was chasing from the moment you saw them. And no police, anywhere? All this blatant crime going on, chases and gunshots raining down on the streets of Detroit - and no police anywhere? Come on, like a vampire movie with no fangs. And not to mention the story line moved along like peanut butter swimming in milk, lumpy and chunky. They skip certain things that would have gave the characters more dimension, hurried up dramatic scenes to push in some more action, and put in unnecessary stuff to draw away from the horrible script (Such as the butcher character - really?)The friendship between Sonny and Vinnie wasn't even close to being believable, I would have never picked them out as buddies, as dull as both of their performances were. Funny, Sonny's relationship with Dave was stronger and Dave well... does not last long lol. Note to new filmmakers, if you want to do classic gangsta flicks study Godfather, The Untouchables, Goodfellas, Scarface, even Boyz in the Hood - and don't copy the formula - make something new, innovative, build the characters, give us something or somebody to root for! This piece, for all the hoopla, fails miserably!",

But as fate would have it, things never go as planned. Sonny (50 Cent) as an \"honorable\" bad guy is the wild card.The movie has some good twists. The slow religious scenes involving 50 Cent should have been left on the cutting room floor. They seemed awkward and forced. There are scenes with 50 Cent where his non-acting ability are far to obvious such as those religious scenes, his scene riding in the car with Willis and his final scene with Vincent.

Written by stunt man/quasi-director Mike Gunther and his partner Mike Behrman, it is a wonder the film found funding to make it to DVD at least. Not only is the 'story' derivative at best, bu tit is acted by a group of actors how should know better.Three crime-addicted friends (Ryan Phillippe, Brett Granstaff, and 50 Cent) have a crime gig that is a diamond heist that goes wrong because Phillippe makes it a set up to get all the money for himself: his father (James Remar from 'Dexter') is a violent prisoner who is marked for killing in the prison unless Phillippe can get the money for is protection. Phillippe kills Granstaff and shoots 50 Cent (who survives). 50 cent then aligns with crime boss Bruce Willis to get back the money from the heist, chases Phillippe interminably, Phillippe's father is killed, and 50 Cent must make some crucial decision about how to make this story end.Fortunately, most of the 'dialogue' is covered by an obnoxiously loud music score. Everyone gives phone-in acting style performances except incredibly miscast and talentless actor Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson. The film probably was made thinking that the names of Wills and Phillippe could save it, but alas, that was a bad set up. Grady Harp",

It was not. This was mostly a waste of time. Willis, despite the top billing on the poster is hardly in the movie and Phillippe just doesn't cut it as the bad guy despite all his tattoos. The script is weak, and the double crossed thief revenge thriller has been done way too many times before.50 does a decent enough job but he's just not a very good actor and the plot for the most part is based around his act of vengeance after his former partner in crime and childhood friend attempts to take him out after a major diamond heist. 'Sonny' then employs the help of a feared (but laughably stereotypical) mob boss (Willis)to help him recover the cash.There are a couple of other sub-plots running regarding Philippe's jailed father (James Remar), Jenna Dewan has a great scene with a glass table, we also get Randy Couture as a lame-brained thug and Shaun Toub as a mysterious hit-man who skulks about searching for the stolen diamonds -I actually enjoyed him.There are moments of Guy Ritchie-ness here too in the way they introduce \"the muscle\" 'the hit man\" \"the mob boss\" and I suppose also in how all the story arc's connect and go awry.Ultimately a bit of a fail and not a movie I will remember anything about come tomorrow. 7/26/15",

His scenes with Willis highlight how far the rapper-turned-actor is from being a bona fide movie star, even if the Die Hard actor looks uninterested. Gunther also brings in odd direction, with sudden, jerky camera movements giving the feel of a television drama. There are plus points, such as the occasional humour in the script, but overall, awkward is probably a good adjective to describe this disjointed and strained film.

The main character, or at least who I think was supposed to be the main character - I had a lot of trouble deciphering what the f**k was going on - is played by 50 cent. Fifty and his two palls have to make a heist, but we're given no back story as to why they need the money. The heist is clich\u00e9 number one as it is one of those \"Rear end car with truck, shoot stuff, say bad ass sh*t, and get out\" sort of heists. The scene is also the worst f**king action scene I've ever seen. After the heist the movie goes \"WE NEED SOME Italian JOB UP IN THIS HIZZAH\" so Pall 1 shoots Mr. Cent and Pall 2, and takes the heist money for himself. Pall 2 dies (Fcuk yes, one less asshole to worry about). Apparently Pall 2 has a wife or some sh*t, and we have to worry about her because we see the two of them kissing in the beginning of the movie, I just want her to die as well. Of cause 50-in-da-club cent survives, not because he is 50, and bullets just bounce off him, but because of clich\u00e9 number 2: He is saved by the cross he wears around his neck. Oh, and why the f**k would you only shoot fifty cent once? You need to cut him in half if you want to be sure he is dead! The scene now fades and we hear Fifty's voice, clearly spoken into a cheap studio microphone, about how god has given him another chance or some sh*t - and get used to the bible bullsh*t, because it is a theme recurring every 15 minutes in this movie. At this point I just wanted to slit my wrist and get over with it (maybe you feel the same reading this sh*tty excuse for a review, sorry). Now clich\u00e9 3 can take place: The hunt for revenge! But not before clich\u00e9 number 4: The doctor who is not a doctor, because doctors call the cops. The doctor heals Fitty and tells him where he should go to get his revenge and sh*t. I'm unclear about what happens next, because at this point I had started playing word feud. Enter clich\u00e9 number 5: the \"muscle\". The guy playing the muscle is of cause dwarfed by Half Dollar, but some how he manages to boss Fifty around. Fifty now has to attack some guys who have now got the heist money. Don't ask me how they got the money, no one knows. Mr. G-unit get's the money and of cause they now go to smoke some pot (This is clearly just to put \"pot smoking\" in the tag line of this movie so that stoners will watch it). At the dealer Mr. muscle shoots himself in the face, the idea is stolen from the excellent movie \"Pulp Fiction\". At this point I wish it was my brains plastered all over the wall (You might feel the same if you are still reading, again, I apologize). I don't know how, 'cause I had dozed off for a moment, but clich\u00e9 number 6 will now appear: The hardcore gangster boss. The boss is played by Bruce Willies, but it doesn't matter as he is only in the movie for 5 minutes, his character is boring, and his lines could just as well have been written by a tween. Together Willies and birthday boy track down Pall 2. Fifty now has to chase him in another boring action scene. Fifty only shoots Pall 2 in the leg, because he is better than him. Now fifty is the hero and he sends all the money to the wife of Pall 2, how come she get's $2mil? I still just want the c**t to die. OH! And there is also some side story about how Pall 1 has a bad-ass father in prison, but it makes no sense what so ever, and I think it is only a poor attempt at fitting another high profile actor into the movie, namely the dude who plays Dexter's dad.Summary of my summary:The plot of \"Setup\" is almost nonexistent and tedious from beginning till end. There is absolutely no consistency and the scenes seem as they have just been thrown together randomly. Every character is bland, unappealing, and onedimentional. I just wanted everybody in the movie to die. The only good thing about this movie is that it ends.If you want to spend your time more productively, google \"Man swimming in septic tank\" and put it on repeat for 90 mins.",

It travels a well-trodden path of heist-gone-wrong plots, and initially promises twists and turns as the \"set up\" of the title unravels.Unfortunately it just ties itself in knots as you attempt to understand who has been set up and why, until you're past caring. It has far too many clich\u00e9s (the white masks of the armed robbers, the subtitles identifying the various gangland players, the rudely interrupted poker game etc. etc.) but none of them work because this movie simply doesn't flow.The plot is confusing, the characters shallow, the dialogue mediocre. I would not even attempt to distinguish this film by comparison to others, it is that bad.Let's face it, a movie that can't even be saved by the presence of Bruce Willis has to be an abject failure.",

However, this has no apparent story.If there is action, I slept through it.For most of the movie so far is watching people walk calmly from one place to another, then swear at each other, then walk some more. There is no reason to care about them at all. Nor should you bother to watch it, I'm sorry I started.Really, it is so awful, I can't believe it got made this way.\"Mean Guns\" is a lot better.",

Bruce Willis and Ryan Phillipe are probably the biggest reason I found myself enjoying this film, while Bruce Willis is pretty much kept at arms length for most of the film Ryan Phillipe gets a pretty good amount of screen time. Jame Remar also appears in the film and also does a good job with what he got, but I feel like there was an entire subplot taken out and all we saw the epilogue to that(the father being killed at the end). Many people on here have just sh** all over this film and while I can understand where they are coming from, I found myself entertained.

            "content": "Memo to Bruce Willis, please read the script before signing up to star in any future movies. I can't help but wonder why the former star of the Die Hard series, Pulp Fiction and the Sixth Sense, would agree to be in such a poorly written, poorly acted and most importantly poorly directed movie. I'm not sure how much director Michael Gunther paid Willis, but he should not have accepted, it was not worth the loss of his reputation.This pseudo action flick is difficult to describe in terms of a plot line. It starts out with three friends robbing a guy carrying jewels in the middle of Detroit city. Things go wrong when Vincent Long (Ryan Phillippe) turns on his two friends after the heist. Long shoots one of his friends dead and grazes the other. This is rather unfortunate because if he had killed him the movie would have ended there, putting the innocent viewers out of their misery. Instead Sonny (50 cent) manages to crawl away and survive the shooting.The remainder of the movie is filled with confusing, poorly explained, overlapping plot lines. You have Sonny who is trying to deal with his Christianity which is never explained. Then there is Biggs (Bruce Willis) who is dealing with the Russian mafia who has 2 million dollars of his money. There is a French assassin who is trying to find his diamonds. The prison administrators are trying to get money from Vincent to keep his father in a secure jail section. Of course, the main plot, we have Sonny trying to kill Vincent throughout the whole movie.The problem with the plot lines is that there is lots of holes and they do not connect. For instance, I'm not sure what Detroit police have on their hands as to just dismiss this whole case. There are hundreds of witnesses to the shooting and robbery yet no one thinks it might be logical to call 911. Then the driver of the victim just happens to be the sister of Vincent yet his two best friends don't ever recognize her during the robbery. How about the French assassin we never find out who he works for, or what he has to do with the plot line. He just shows up at random trying to kill people. Also, there was the Russian problem which had nothing to do with the movie. All that does is get Biggs to hire Sonny, who he has never met, to take on this important task. It's all just a jumble of plots that don't make sense.Those weren't the only problems, the actors weren't good, 50 cent lacked emotion. 50 cent please stick to rapping, the next time he acts in a movie 50 cents should be the price of admission. The writing wasn't very good either. If you are still watching this movie after 30 minutes skip to the end and watch the horrible exchange between Sonny and Vincent. That's not how I would talk to a guy I just tried to kill. The directing was also terrible. Right near the end there is a chase between Vincent and Sonny where half way through Sonny all of a sudden has a gun. During the chase the distance between the two will vary immensely without any explanation. How is this film an action film, we have 3 action scenes in this movie and they are all terribly setup. For example, we have a gun fight scene, where miraculously everyone dies except Sonny and Vincent. Sadly the only real actor, Bruce Willis, gets killed at the start of this fight. So my final conclusion is that this movie is a waste of time, money and space. The overall acting was terrible, actors would change/lose accents throughout the film. The movie was all over the place jumping from it's various plots, which made it very difficult to watch. I give this film 1 star and suggest that no one ever wastes their time watching it. Thankfully those younger kids, because its an 18A movie, do not have to go through the pain of watching this film.",

Curtis Jackson played another role of the gangster who has the good heart, and Ryan Phillippe played the backstabber. Jackson did a good job but when he tries to show emotion it's just poor acting. Phillippe should pick some roles that fit him better, not ones where he has to be the bad guy, just not believable. Overall this movie gets a 5 only because the script was decent. The acting was too quick and the conversations weren't too in-depth. Every scene with Willis in it slowed down to film speed, where you could actually pay attention.

            "content": "This is quite possibly one of the best examples you could find of film making at its worst. I managed 35 minutes and the insult to my intelligence could not take anymore. How any of the seasoned actors (and there are a few) who appear in this did not question the shoddy dialogue is a mystery. At first I thought the sound recording was poor - then I realised that its just Curtis 'fiddy cent' s voice is completely monotone - when his mate gets shot, when he gets shot, when he's about to shoot somebody.... it's like he's reading aloud a menu at the drive thru. And whats with the Guy Ritchie stuff - the spinning freeze frame and the cartoon script - not to mention the scenarios pretty much exactly stolen from lock stock and snatch - very lazy. One scene I have to mention is a point where they hijack some Russian gangsters who are digging buried loot from a grave. 50 and another guy literally roll up in a truck, come to a halt, look out of the window and go - 'okay-there they are', then they run over and knock them out stealing the booty. Now I don't know about you, but if I was a professional mobster from Russia who had gone halfway around the world and carved a corrupt empire into a foreign country, I would not let two muppets driving a van into the middle of a cemetery at night with the radio blasting and headlights on 'sneak' up to 15 yards away, park, and then 'surprise' me. I imagine much of the 20million budget of this movie was spent hiring Bruce Willis for one afternoon so they could get his face on the poster.",

Better skip this movie and search for another one.Was this the last movie of Bruce Willis? This is not Bruce Willis worthy.",

I have never reviewed a movie but i had to do this - to save someone else from watching this.Where do i even start - There was no single cop on the ground through the entire the movie (Did the Mafia boss pay them to lie low?). How were we supposed to be kept on the edge if there's no cop chasing or at least trying to chase the bad guys. After a couple of let downs i shall not watch a movie with 50ct in the cast! Responding to Huump's comment: \"Have an open mind when watching movies...enjoy them for what they are and quit looking for what's \"wrong\" with them \" - We cannot enjoy watching what isn't good. The bar has been set so high that it's unbearable watching movies that aren't up to par!",

If you've never understood the phrase 'he can't act his way out of a paper bag' then it's worth a watch. Fiddy spits wood planks for dialog and Bruce rolls his eyes. Is that a spoiler? The true and fine mark of a Real Crumby Movie is \"IT JUST ENDS AND I\"M LIKE WHAAA?\" I can't fill 10 lines with how bad this 'movie' is. if you like directors who work in two dimensions, this is for you. The Set-Up is the Let-Down and a true example of a film that is 'poser.' with films like THE Italian JOB, SNATCH, TRAINING DAY and the resume of Ray Liotta, who needs this junk? I want my $1.07 and 80 minutes of life back.",

            "content": "****Spoiler Alert****Read This AFTER Watching The Movie****Okay... The movie overall was GOOD. Yes, the acting could have been better, and yes, the script could have been better, but if you stop CRITIQUING everything and just watch the movie, I'm sure you'll be satisfied by the end. A few things didn't make sense (baseball in the winter, the cops not investigating the death of the third friend, the child-hood friends not knowing that their shooter had a sister, etc)I admit, but the sequence of events ARE believable. I can believe a muscle man for the mob would shoot himself while playing with guns THAT AREN'T HIS, thinking he's such an \"expert\" on weapons. I can believe a hit man found the protagonist in two days...HE'S A FREAKING HIT MAN! THAT'S HIS JOB AND HE'S GOOD AT IT!! I can believe the mob boss found his thief so soon...HE'S A MOB BOSS!! HE KNOWS EVERYTHING (criminal & high-paying) THAT TAKES PLACE IN HIS TOWN OR CUTS INTO HIS MONEY!! As for there being a religious under-tone... I don't think so. It can't be an \"undertone\" considering that he's robbing people the whole movie, but I believe it has a subliminal message---Pray. Sonny survived situations that most wouldn't have, because he prays. He never kills anyone in the film, because he (although doubtful at times) believes in the word. I think THAT'S what the religious pieces of the film wanted you to see. NO, there wasn't much action in the film, but the movie manages to keep your attention with other things, such as the characters themselves, the mystery of whats next and how everything ties together, and things of that nature. 50 Cent normally plays a tough guy or the boss type, but in this film he's just an average Joe who happens to know how to handle himself. He's not a \"bad ass\" or a \"shooter\", but he (having grown up in Detroit and being a thief) knows how to protect himself as well as strike fear in others. He's trying something new, so I don't expect him to be GREAT at it, but he DID make the character believable. Overall, I think the movie is pretty good and a good past-time. Good actors, a decent storyline, nice visuals, and a righteous ending. I'd definitely watch it again. After all, it's definitely not the worst action/crime film I've seen. I mean, hell, THE TOWN was over-rated, dry, and slow as hell!...the robbery scenes were the only good ones, and it aired in theaters! Just because a movie has a lower budget doesn't mean it's worse, and just because a movie has a bunch of hype doesn't mean it's great (look at Green Lantern...horrible). Have an open mind when watching movies...enjoy them for what they are and quit looking for what's \"wrong\" with them.---------------Huump",

There is no need for that. He is just getting out of a car. This continues throughout the film. No matter what happens, there is some brooding, emotional violin accompanying the cast. As for the writing, the dialogue was absolutely atrocious. There was never a moment where you actually felt anything but nothing for the characters in this film. I've seen bad films before, but this million dollar juggernaut of dismal plop has the tax-payers moving along the dole lines, wondering why they can't feed their kids, whilst others can happily spend their money on some tripe. There are starving people in the world that would gladly stay hungry, if you would stop making these rubbish films. Yours sincerely, Some bloke from Ireland",

As far as I know most people know about the plot before watching a movie so you know it contains all these flaws before watching it. So don't watch it if you're like: 'this has been done.' If you're a fan of crime/heist movies: watch it!The acting isn't bad at all (but then again I like the acting of Dwayne Johnson). The actors aren't Robert De Niro or Al Pacino but they get the job done.All in all, the movie kept me entertained throughout.",
