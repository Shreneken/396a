            "review_title": "A movie with absolutely no life whatsoever",
            "content": "How does a movie like Bucky Larson get made? Here is a movie that appeals to no audience I can think of, and yet it is playing on thousands of screens. The only logical explanation I can come to for this movie's existence is that Mr. Sandler has some very incriminating photos of someone at Columbia Pictures.Our title hero, Bucky (played by comedian Nick Swardson), is a dweeb. Not a funny one, or a likable one, but a pathetic dweeb who seems to live in his own world. Bucky hails from a small Midwest farm town, where he works as a bag boy at a grocery store, until he's fired about two minutes after the opening movie credits. He goes to a friend's house, where they decide to cheer him up by showing him a classic porno film starring a pair of legendary porn stars named Rosie Bush and Jim Spraysium. Seconds into watching the film, Bucky recognizes the stars as being his parents. Rather than be horrified, he is entranced by the idea that his parents were once in movies. It's at that moment he decides that it's his destiny to be a star as well, and decides to head to California and make it in \"nude movies\".Bucky arrives in Hollywood with big dreams, but seemingly little common sense, as when he auditions for a mac and cheese commercial, and immediately drops his pants and starts jerking off in front of the horrified director and casting crew. Fortunately, the director on the commercial shoot used to work in the porn business, and directs Bucky to someone who can help him. The first person Bucky meets is the porn star Dick Shadow (Stephen Dorff), who is currently the biggest thing in the movies (in more ways than one), and immediately shuns him. He's later introduced to Miles Deep (Don Johnson, looking particularly embarrassed here), a down on his luck porn director who is so desperate to make a movie, he's even willing to give Bucky a shot. The audition does not go well, as when Bucky drops his pants, his \"manhood\" is revealed to be literally microscopic. He also has a tendency to start screeching like a monkey whenever he sees a woman take her shirt off, and starts shooting off blasts of his \"man juice\" like a shotgun all over the room and ceiling.Let me stop this plot synopsis, and ask a simple question - Does this sound like a movie you would want to see? Does it even sound like a movie to begin with? I find myself returning to my original question, how does a movie like Bucky Larson get made? It holds absolutely no laughs, its lead character is an unlikable schmuck with an overbite and not a shred of knowledge of how to behave in social situations, and there's literally no plot to speak of. Just one situation after another for Bucky to humiliate himself. As the movie dragged on for nearly 100 interminable minutes, I came to realize that the entire screenplay revolves around three basic jokes. 1:) Bucky has buck teeth and talks funny. 2:) Bucky has a small dick. 3:) Bucky orgasms instantly every time he sees a woman take her shirt off. The movie repeats these same jokes many times, as if it thinks if it repeats them enough, it will wear down our defenses, and we'll eventually start laughing.Back to the plot - Bucky's disastrous audition winds up on the Internet, and becomes a sensation. This inspires Miles Deep to give the guy another chance, and come up with a new form of porn that is non-threatening to guys (because they know they're better than Bucky), and is reassuring to women, since they know they are sleeping with a better guy than Bucky. Somehow, this idea takes off, and Bucky becomes a major star in the porn industry. He even sweeps the porn film awards, which is hosted by Pauly Shore, who plays himself in a cameo. It also means that this is probably the worst movie Pauly Shore has ever appeared in. (And no, I'm not forgetting BioDome.) While all this is happening, Bucky also strikes up a relationship with a sweet young waitress named Kathy (Christina Ricci). Kathy seems like a bright young woman, and Ricci plays her with charm. So, why is she hanging around Bucky to begin with? Looking back over my review, I see that I have left very little out. This literally is all there is to the movie. There's no real conflict, other than a very halfhearted falling out between Bucky and Kathy that exists solely because the movie was nearly 90 minutes old, and nothing had really happened so far. This is nothing more than a story of an insufferable schmuck who goes to Hollywood, gets a job in porn, and falls in love with a nice girl. That's all. There's a hint of a subplot concerning the jealous porn star, Dick Shadow, trying to ruin Bucky's career. But this is so unmemorable, it could be cut from the film without anyone noticing. Why did it take three people to write a movie where virtually nothing happens? A movie that's quite clearly dead.Yes, Bucky Larson is a dead movie. It shows no signs of life or inspiration. It doesn't even have the decency to be a lively or memorable bad movie. It just sort of lies there, not doing anything, and then asks us to leave 100 minutes later. Those who know me know that I never wish ill will upon anyone, but I seriously think that a movie like this could end careers. I hope that doesn't happen. I'm sure Nick Swardson is a nice and funny guy in real life. I'm also sure he'll be apologizing for this one for a long time to come.",

            "content": "I like Nick Swardson. His show \"Pretend time\" on Comedy Central is hilarious and he's usually good in supporting roles (\"Grandma's boy\" & \"Just go with it\"). But wow, did this movie suck. \"Bucky Larson\" is flat. The jokes aren't funny and the acting for the most part is uninspired. Don Johnson was the highlight of the film and Christina Ricci did what she could but there are no redeeming qualities in this film.I went in with low expectations because of the bad reviews and word of mouth, and yet I was still disappointed. This film deserves to be in the bottom 250 on IMDb. With the talent that was involved in the project and the premise of a porn comedy, \"Bucky Larson\" should have been funny. But instead I found myself wishing it was never made. I feel sorry for the chumps who paid $10 to see this garbage in theaters.",

            "content": "...And not in a good way! I love movies, regardless of its age or genre. I love comedies and admire those with inspiration. When I saw Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star out of curiosity- though I did have reservations about seeing it starting with the trailer and Adam Sandler co-penning the script- online, I found next to nothing to love or admire about it.The film looks cheap for starters, more in the slapdash editing and cinematography and dull lighting than the scenery. The soundtrack didn't have anything I'd deem memorable. Then there is the direction. Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star has some of the worst direction I have seen in a movie in quite a while, as all the basic tools of direction like camera placement and continuity Brady seems to be ignoring here.Story-wise this just didn't engage. Some might say it is a predictable movie, in many ways yes it is. A movie that is predictable isn't bad as such, but for me it is when the film in question is not at all inspiring and just doesn't have any point to it. That for me is the case with Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star. Even worse is the writing, which is horrendous. It is not funny at all, just dumb, puerile and irritating, with no heart whatsoever.When it comes to the pace, the film has no life to it, because the dialogue and jokes are so bad(seriously the penis that was so small you could use a straw for a condom idea was incredibly stupid) and no effort is made in regards to the characters, who are little more than stiff caricatures at best. The acting is really poor, Nicky Swardson is just annoying and abrasive while Christina Ricci who I like actually is cute but bland. In fact only Don Johnson actually tries to do anything fresh with his character. As for comic timing, in regard to this film, why bother really, most of it is basically saying a line and standing around aimlessly waiting for someone to say their bit.Overall, irritating, woefully directed and pointless. Of a very hit-and-miss year so far, I think I now have my new contender for the worst of the bunch. 0/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "This should have NEVER been born.",
            "content": "There is very little to say about Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star other than \"I hated it ... I hated ALL of it!\" The film is not funny and it is repellent.I cannot criticize it for being about porn because Boogie Nights was exclusively about the world of porn and I think it was one of the BEST film of the 1990's. Boogie Nights treated its characters as flawed human beings searching for acceptance and a feeling of belonging -- Bucky Larson's characters are all supposed to be laughed at and there are just too many times throughout the movie which had me wanting to rush to the bathroom to vomit as 89% of the film is stomach-churning.This should pretty-much END the career of anybody involved and I am actually surprised that Adam Sandler's name is attached as both a writer and a producer of this trash (Sandler also gave us Jack and Jill and Just Go With It this year -- the latter film is only saved b/c of the over-the-top performance of the unlikely physical comedienne Nicole Kidman -- so I question whether or not his days are numbered?).An unfunny-to-me Nick Swardson (Just Go With It, 30 Minutes or Less, Blades of Glory) -- who's career is mostly stand-up comedy -- stars as the grotesquely buck-toothed Bucky Larson (who must've been born with buck-teeth?) who believes he is destined for a glorious career in porn after discovering his parents were au natural (meaning: unshaven, un-waxed, un-spray-tanned, un-fit etc) porn stars of the 1970's. Bucky leaves behind an insulting-to-mid-westerners existence in Iowa (only found in the movies -- he didn't attend high school because his town didn't have one ... whatever), the RIDICULOUSLY-accented Bucky (that is NOT an Iowa accent ... but let's throw-out another stupid laugh at the expense of the heartland) heads to LA where his dreams can come true.Bucky luckily meets a nice, big-hearted waitress (Christina Ricci - Sleepy Hollow, Penelope, Monster ... and after this is it any wonder she seeked out employment on television as Pan-Am is Oscar-caliber compared to this!) at a random diner who befriends him, finds him a place to live (with crazy-jerk roommate Kevin Nealon - \"SNL\", \"Weeds\", Just Go With It) and sets him in the right direction of finding work. Don Johnson (Tin Cup, Machete ... who's short-lived career rebirth must be over) is porn director Miles Deep who sees something \"special\" in Bucky and decides to exploit the freak (it's explained in the film ... but I don't recommend watching this to figure out the \"freak-tag\" that has NOTHING to do with his teeth!) and Stephen Dorff (who's stellar \"comeback\" with the excellent film Somewhere must have been a fluke!!) plays a jealous porn-star rival.As vulgar and repulsive as this film is, there is surprisingly little flesh on display. It would be difficult to pick-out the worst part of this film as that would pretty-much be the whole thing. Just as impossible would be finding \"the best\" part. This film isn't bad because it is offensive -- we've had Bridesmaids and two Hangover films -- it is just terrible bad. What works with those 3 films is that they are \"equal-opportunity offenders\" ... this one -- NOT so much. It is rank and rancid and beyond mere words for criticism. I NEVER want to see something like this again.",

It uses the same three jokes the entire movie: Bucky has buck teeth, he shoots semen at the mere sight of a naked girl, and he has a tiny penis covered with a bush of hair. Boom, that's it. That's the movie. Game over man, game over.If I could give this film zero stars, I would. Not even Stephen Dorff can save this penguin excrement.",

            "content": "This is extremely heavy stuff, made for specialists in comedy. Most people will not get Tarkovsky's The Mirror and in the same way most people will not get Bucky Larson. There are few that get The Mirror and a few that get Bucky Larson and these two groups of people do not intersect easily. I rated The Mirror, 10/10, and Bucky Larson, I rate it 9/10, the same ratings I gave for Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Rear Window, Fanny and Alexander and Vertigo.I personally think that Bucky Larson is vastly superior to most comedies. Take another random comedy, House Bunny, that was a plain bad movie but this is much more than that, if you are able to get it, of course. One needs to be able to fully master the art of watching crappy comedies before trying this kind of stuff which was made for the specialists. I have already watched hundreds of bad comedies and about 20 Adam Sandler movies and this operates on another league of greatness. I would say that I got a lot of fun from watching this impressive work of art that defies convention and goes where no other movie has gone before. It was a \"bad movie\" done entirely on purpose by the director and writers. Just like the porn movies Bucky made in the movie, this is innovation and film critics, people who were brainwashed in film school to like 1940's stuff, cannot simply understand the genius of this film, as did the people on the porn business which were shown Bucky film's.My ratings would be:9/10 - Specialists 0/10 - Most peopleI wouldn't recommend this movie for regular people. They will not understand it.",

            "content": "I'm totally confused. I'm completely lost. Did the world famous \"Jack and Jill\" (co-writer) Adam Sandler and Going-Nowhere-Fast Nick Swardson INTENTIONALLY set out to make the world's worst comedy?Seriously. Think about it. The horribly clich\u00e9d and unoriginal Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star was so god-awful and incredibly offensive with its decades-old bad stereotypes it was flat-out unfunny. In fact, if you dare, watch it with the sound off and turn on the 24/7 Comedy IHEARTRADIO Station. At least you'll laugh for 90 minutes. It may even coincide with the scenes on the screen.I used to like Swardson, especially as Terry on Reno 911! But, damn, ever since then \u2013 Just Go With It, 30: Minutes or Less, Jack and Jill \u2013 c'mon now. Enough is enough. I understand most of his \"appearances\" take place because he's in bed with Adam Sandler and it's no secret I loathe that whiney little man, but this feature length, his first, I believe, is just a tragedy. That all said, the worst offender was Christina Ricci. YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS AND YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!Ah-hem, I'm calm now. Where was I? Bucky is a buck-toothed (ha, get it? Really?) son of two 70s porn stars and heads to Hollywood to become one himself. His only gift is that he makes other small-penis guys feel better about themselves. Oh, and an outrageously blind girl (Ricci) falls for him.The movie, which in reverse, wouldn't even work as a 5-minute SNL sketch. Hell, it doesn't work as a comedy, spoof, drama or a relevant piece of farce in 2011. I'm seriously considering adding a \"\u00bd Star to 0 Stars\" to my rating board, if it weren't actually professionally shot. Sure, it wasn't amateurishly made, but that's like buying an old Ford Pinto and when people's eyes turn away, you say: \"Hey, it runs!\"I don't normally focus on Box Office Receipts for movies, because they can go either way in regards to quality and money made \u2013 note: the Twilight series, but just for shits and giggles, I looked it up: $1.4 million opening weekend and $2.5 overall. That's a lot more than I imagined. And more than this is worthy of. (It did, however, open at #15 behind The Smurfs. Please, PLEASE, Adam & Nick, see this as a sign not everything you touch turns to gold.)One final note to end these rants: My prayer is that Adam Sandler is done soon. I know he'll dish 'em out as long as he has an audience dumb enough to pay his salary, but I do pray he has a Mel Gibson rant and disappears. He'll still have all the money he didn't deserve, but at least he'll go away. Nick, on the other hand, his days HAVE to be numbered. Even Adam isn't as stupid as to keep him under his wing. Or is he?",

It may have been because it was released in the beginning of September, when there are few people going to movie theaters. It may have been because the movie is about the porn industry, which has never been a popular movie topic for mainstream moviegoers. It may have also been because the relentless television commercials for the movie were very annoying. But I think the main reason why it bombed was that the audience smelled it for the stinker that it was. There are no laughs anywhere to be found in the movie, for one thing. But it also has a weird tone, like it was written by a dirty-minded and mean-spirited eight year old. It's not very audience-friendly, to put it mildly. The cast is spirited, but they can do absolutely nothing with the terrible script.Oh, one more piece of evidence for its badness: The end credits for this 2011 release list a 2010 copyright, suggesting that Columbia Pictures didn't know what to do with the movie for quite some time.",

There are some genuine laugh out loud moments in this movie IF it's your sense of humour. If it isn't, then why are you watching it? Sandler isn't exactly world renowned for his subtlety or his sensitive handling of subject matter. He has a team of friends around him who obviously get together over a few drinks and spin out some ideas that make them laugh. I like that about him. And I always get the impression that everybody making one of his movies has a real laugh doing it. And that's what I'm after when I'm watching one.

I couldn't stop laughing when I first saw his face and the bucked teeth with bowl cut. Coming in to this movie you knew it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. If you can't handle comedies that are stupid and funny you should avoid them. I think the people giving Buck Larson a 1/10 were the same ones giving Warrior 10 and comparing it to Rocky, but let's stick to the review anyways. With Happy Madison movies it's either always a hit or miss. I think Sandler gave us another great dark comedy that will be loved by a small group of people, and hated by most. The dark humour in Bucky Larson is very dirty, so be prepared for that. I think it appeals to mostly men who are 18-35. If you saw Grandmas Boy that would be the best way I could describe the very dark humour of this movie. I was disappointed Allen Covert didn't have a bigger role in Bucky Larson but im sure Sandler has other plans for him. At the end of the day this was Swardson at his absolute best. Christina Ricci also did a great job with the role she was given. Stephen Dorff was good as always, but Kevin Nealon (bull dance guy from Happy Gilmore) had me in tears. I have never heard him swear before so when he goes off it's priceless and unexpected. I think Bucky Larson Born To Be A Star deserves an 8/10 and it's unfortunate that people these days can't handle a great comedy just because it's dirty. No dirty isn't the word for it, this movie is filthy. I am laughing again just thinking about the concept. At least Sandler gave us something really filthy for a change, finally back to his roots.",

While I wouldn't consider this one of the worst in my opinion, I can see exactly why the film was hated by so many. The writing simply is awful....with not even a single laugh in the movie even though it's supposed to be a comedy. Instead of humor, the film resorts to crudeness. Crude CAN be funny....such as the cute film \"Stepbrothers\". But crude with no humor whatsoever is simply annoying and boorish....and this film has that in spades.Bucky (Nick Swardson) is a guy from Iowa who is intensely stupid as well as possessing teeth like Bugs Bunny.....a joke that wears thin very quickly. After discovering that his parents used to be porn stars, instead of being repulsed or embarrassed, he thinks it's cool. So, his folks encourage him to trek to California to be a part of the porn industry. Hillarity SHOULD ensue...but it doesn't.Unfunny, very crude and ample evidence that Adam Sandler (yes, THAT Adam Sandler) should not write films. Overall, an unfunny and disgusting film that held no interest at all to me as I tried to watch. I could mention all the various offensive things featured in the film...but I am pretty sure IMDB would not allow me to mention them.",

Her acting is great, she is super saccharine while giving an electrifying look with her eyes. Her character accepts Bucky Larson unconditionally, which is a virtue and gives some food for thought.

            "content": "I admire Swardson's defense for this film because I imagine it was an unbelievable challenge to market. Here we have a character, unseen anywhere else, played by a second rate actor who hasn't quite made a household name yet. To market an unknown character with antics like the ones present in this movie isn't as much hard as it is devotion. To go through with a project of this magnitude means you must have a lot of faith in the material.In Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star, there is no faith, hope, wit, soul, or even a sign that this was taken to a remote extent of seriousness. All the actors seem to be laughing at their own joke shamelessly - nearly all of them equally unfunny and sad. Adam Sandler hit a landmark year in 2011. Not only did he work on four movies this whole year, he starred in two of them. Out of the four released, Just Go With It, Zookeeper, Bucky Larson, and Jack and Jill, three of them you can simply look at the film's poster and decide if you want to pay to see it. They're films that almost don't even care that they're bad.I've seen four films where Nick Swardson plays one of the lead actors or a supporting actor. Three of them easily dismissible, and one that wouldn't be considered mediocre if he was carefully extracted from the film entirely. He simply is not funny. I think it's honestly the material that makes him unfunny. I've seen scattered clips of his standup and he is slightly funny. Maybe he works better when he writes his own lines. Yet, that can't be. This was co-written by Swardson himself, who I assume wrote most, if not, all of the dialog for his character. Maybe he works best with himself and himself only locked in a sound-proof room where he can be alone with his thoughts.Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison Productions company have now just given me one of the least ambitious comedies I have ever seen. This movie doesn't even feel like it's trying to be funny. It seems to be a series of cheap shots taken at a character that was made for that one purpose. Why not make a character who has some likability? Nope. Go straight to the drawing board and come up with a desperately unfunny character with no shining qualities, give him a desperately unforgiving plot to work with where he can get himself into lame, uninspired situations, and to top him all off, make him the most gullible, pathetic title character in the last few decades of film.The fact I'm using the phrase \"least ambitious\" for a comedy film reminds me of a group of films in the last years that have also stopped trying. Parody films. They have been drab, tiresome works of dreck, glazed with immaturity and held together by such a simple, lackluster plot it almost doesn't matter. It becomes a competition for how many pop culture references can we throw into one film.The same thing sort of occurs in Bucky Larson. It's a competition to see how many unconvincing gags we can put this pathetically embarrassing protagonist in. The story centers around a misfit with an annoying overbite named Bucky Larson (Swardson). Upon discovering his parents are ex-porn star legends, he travels to Hollywood, hoping that since he is the son (hopefully) of two icons he can make a living as one as well.Let me say there is nothing funny about a man-child who pulls down his pants in front of a camera, grunting, moaning, and screaming before ejaculating. Absolutely, positively nothing funny about that scenario. Yet the film does it three, if not four times within its ninety minute runtime. If it's not funny the first time, it definitely won't be the second, the third, or even the forth time around.Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star didn't upset me as much as some would think. It actually was rather typical of Happy Madison. We've seen this goofy, oddball style before. But that is no excuse for a terrible movie. The jokes are terribly flat, the lead character we are expected to sympathize with is wretched in his presentation, the setups are typical, the writing is labored, and we are offered nothing new in the terms of layout or formula. It's a movie experience of deplorable, unforgivable quality.Starring: Nick Swardson, Christina Ricci, Don Johnson, and Stephen Dorff. Directed by: Tom Brady.",

When that scene appears in the film, someone involved in the production said \"hmm, that looks like a good place for a fart. Stick one in there if you can.\" So while the driver is smiling at Bucky's amazement over being able to stand in a car, there's an arbitrary \"FLERNT!\". You can't tell who farted or even where the fart came from. It sounds like it came from in between them in the back seat. Like Sandler was lying on the floor of the car with a whoopee cushion.That's pretty much all there is to say about Bucky Larson. It's just painfully, tragically lazy. There aren't any real \"jokes\". Jokes have a setup and a payoff. They have to conform to even the loosest of rhythms or structure. Presenting Bucky's hick appearance, Fargo accent and tiny penis as \"jokes\" doesn't qualify. There just kind of there, pointed out endlessly to no real comic effect. His prosthetic teeth also look so cheap and fake you want to rip them out of his mouth, smack him on the back of the head and bellow \"Swardson! Go to your room!\"That's really it. Don't bother picking this up even for Bad Movie Night. It's insufferably childish, lazy and boring. It marks a new low for Happy Madison, which I didn't think could be achieved. It was so depressing, I had to turn away after Bucky bursts in on Kevin Nealon when he's on the can. I had to try and find funny in the world again.",

And I wasn't disappointed. This simplistic comedy centres around the buck teeth-challenged Bucky Larson (Nick Swardson) and his dream to become a famous porn star, irregardless of his minuscule manhood. Inspired by his parents, who were once famous genre actors of the 70s, Bucky decides to challenge his destiny moving from small town Iowa to the Hollywood boulevards. Despite his physical deficiencies Bucky soon manages to enter into the business, mainly thanks to a chance meeting with rundown porn director Miles Deep (Don Johnson) and the backing of waitress Kathy McGee (Christina Ricci). Insert random below the belt jokes and off we go...The gags arrive in bundles, yet surprisingly all of them are poorly construed and remarkably flat. Honestly, not a single joke even manages to register a positive chuckle or giggle, making it a whole other level of lame comedy, surpassing the feats of the Wayan brothers, who despite all their crass lewdness register a few successful hits in each movie. Chaotic timing does not help the overall poor level of constructed gags, while actor Nicky Swardson has famously put off any future interest in him as a lead, lacking charisma and delivering a dissuasive anti-performance offering Bucky Larson no sympathetic appeal whatsoever. Somewhere in this mix decent actors show up and offer half-hearted performances, that fail to liven up proceedings. Don Johnson possibly needed the money, but the presence of Christina Ricci and Stephen Dorff in this bona fide turd is a true mystery.Lumbering along with tirades of trite jokes, this monstrosity of a movie does not even invoke laughter as to how bad it is, instead imbuing an overbearing notion of boredom.

The whole movie lacks an actual story, it's just a bunch of bad penis jokes and \"point and laugh at the freak\" jokes as well. A lot of great actors wasted (Christina Ricci, Mike O'Connell, Don Johnson) and the humor doesn't work here. It tries too hard to mix sentimental and mean-spirited stuff, which both fail. When Bucky gets a roommate, the dude (Kevin Nealon) is such a jerk that you wish he hung himself and left the poor guy alone.The entire film is predictable and Stephen Dorff looks like Bret Michaels, which isn't a good thing. I smiled several times but didn't laugh at all. I don't understand why they couldn't put more effort into it.

This is without a doubt the worst film of the year and one of the worst films ever made and, yet, he thinks he made a good movie. I would hate to see what comes next from him because \"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star\" sucks on so many levels of shameful stupidity, it is sad. I managed to sit through \"Freddy Got Fingered\" back in 2001 but this garbage made me walk out the theater door and not look back.It's about a dorky kid, Bucky Larson (Nick Swardson) who discovers his weird parents were porn stars at one point and he decides to rid his sheltered life and become a porn star like them.Nick Swardson is that guy from \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.\" He played the gay butterfly and he showed he is funny, can play funny characters and he is talented even if that role was limited. Well, this is his big jump and Nick is the star of this picture and if this is his starting point, he has a long sad career ahead of him. Or, maybe this film will sink him because not only is this film cringe-worthy and good at dulling your intelligence, it is awkward to the point where you realize your wasted time was of greater importance and you feel stupid for watching it. The easy way to some up this film would be: \"A boring kid with buck teeth, hence \"Bucky\" becomes a pornstar when directors see him masturbate and screech like a monkey.\" How does that sound?Would it surprise you if you knew Adam Sandler was the writer to this s**t? It shouldn't. His career has been in the Jon for over ten years now and he still can't write a story that is funny or interesting, instead settling on crude humor and fart jokes. His company Happy Madison can't seem to produce a good movie either or anything funny. That's a shame when his movies still make money but I bet you this picture won't. Oh, and that guy who directed the equally cringe- worthy \"The Hot Chick\" with the bumbling Rob Schinder, who can't act his way out of a paper bag, directed this. We got an all-star team here folks. If it seems like I am being very harsh, I am. If they want to attempt to dull my intelligence with this, I am going to burn them as well for making an awful movie that no one should have to see.Nick plays the titular character who is a manchild and lives with his mom and dad in some small town and Bucky comes off as this innocent kid, to which he is, but he doesn't seem all that smart. He is an awkward kid who has been sheltered by his parents and he works at a local grocery store. You remember that character, \"Booger\" from \"Revenge of the Nerds\" back in 1984? Well, the actor, Curtis Armstrong, shows up at the beginning of the picture as Bucky's boss as a way for the producers to attempt to sell the film because of Armstrong's memorable character. Too bad, his character here is a brain-dead idiot that shows you the extent of the misery you're about to endure as the picture begins.So, this kid that doesn't seem to know anything finds his parents porn stash, yes, they were awkward porn stars back in the 1970's and all the sudden, Bucky's mission is to travel to L.A. and become a porn star. Yeah...Okay. Through a series of misunderstandings, Bucky gets a job as a porn star for a failing director, Miles Deep (that name doesn't sound sexual at all). Bucky becomes a star when the director sees his, oh god..., his small penis and somehow screeching like a monkey when he masturbates, makes women want to sleep with him. Does that sound normal to you? No! it sounds like something an idiot wrote thinking they were funny to suck the dollars out of audiences. Enter all of Adam Sandler's moron friends, because they only star in his movies, and the film has gone to total s**t. Christina Ricci shows up as bucky's new girlfriend, of course, she is, and Stephen Doriff shows up as a jerk-off porn star called, Dick Shadow, how nice. He is the typical dummy with a tough attitude who becomes threatened by the dorky kid and hides a secret but who cares? I am not going to even bother with the rest of the picture because I don't want to waste your time. As i said before, It takes a lot for me to walk out of a movie and this picture made me want to run. There is nothing salvageable from it at all and Nick needs to look elsewhere if he thinks he made a funny comedy with the crew that is responsible for \"Deuce Bigalow,\" \"The Animal\" and, the wretched \"Waterboy.\" Also, I would like to know from Nick what he thinks was funny about this picture because he attempted to defend it by calling critics, \"Morons.\" Well, I consider myself an intelligent person and an experience movie critic to which I say to Nick, \"You movie sucked! Try a better screenplay that doesn't make you look like an unintelligent idiot or maybe a career change is better for you?\"Zero/10",

Going in I saw the reviews for this (2.2 out of 10 on IMDb, 33 out of 100 on Rotten Tomatoes) and I am usually skeptical of bad reviews. Like most good ones they tend to exaggerate how good or bad a movie is. This is did not. This is awful. A few funny parts mixed in with the same joke over and over and over. The best part of this movie hands down is Kevin Nealon but he is not in it enough. I will say that I have seen worse, but this is a movie that people will watch out of curiosity and may regret it. Overall, not the worst comedy I have seen, but without Nealon it may have been. I give it a D+.",

            "content": "The Adam Sandler-produced Nick Swardson vehicle \"Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star\" is arguably one of the most dead-on-arrival comedies of the past decade. The film is an attempt to make a fun, quirky, raunchy comedy based on the idea of a clueless, semi-ugly nice-guy who gets pulled into the world of the adult film industry, but the material is all too basic, and it doesn't take advantage at all of the situation. Jokes are all phoned-in and are the sort 13-year-old boys snicker at to each other, and the writing is downright offensively bad.Nick Swardson plays Bucky Larson, a simpleton with an outlandish set of buck-teeth. Upon discovering that his parents were famous porn-stars in the 70's, he sets off to travel to Hollywood and break into the family business, intent on becoming a star. Along the way, he meets a failing director (Don Johnson), an adorable waitress (Christina Ricci) and an antagonistic male porn star. (Stephen Dorff)The film is a definite mess. The writing is very basic. (With the most basic sexual jokes about \"size\", \"stamina\", etc imaginable) And the few attempts at raunchy, gross-out humor are poorly conveyed and equally basic and unfunny. And characters are alternating gratingly boring, or breath-takingly over-the-top. Although some of the performances give a few characters a likable edge. Particularly Ricci as Kathy, an absolutely gorgeous waitress Bucky falls for. Swardson is also not bad for the role, and despite the absolute mess, Bucky is well-played. In addition, his constantly-aggressive roommate is an absolute blast, yelling at Bucky for absolutely everything.Everything in this film is sub-par. as I said, the writing is far too basic and uninspired. The director is also bland and boring, supporting roles are underdeveloped. There are almost no laughs in the film, and the conflicts of the characters are completely and utterly unrelatable, and therefore not funny or sensical by any stretch.This is just an example of a film where everything is fundamentally underwhelming and basic to the point where it's tedious to watch. You may notice this review is pretty anemic, and that's because I simply have not been able to finish the film. I've only watched about 45 minutes of it, in pieces, fast-forwarding through the rest because it's such a flawed piece of work that I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing.I'm giving this an extremely generous 2 out of 10, mainly for Ricci' adorable-ness and a few funny side-characters. But seriously, take it from me- I tried to give it a chance, and I'm kicking myself for watching it. Avoid this mess.",

This movie is amazingly awful even by the standard of Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production company. That's how you know ahead of time if a movie is crap: if Adam Sandler's name is in the credits as a co-writer or an executive producer, but Sandler himself doesn't star in it. The plot: Sandler prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nick Swardson (clearly the Rob Scheider of our time) plays Bucky Larson, a thirty-something, mentally retarded man-child living in Iowa with his conservative parents. He talks funny, has buck teeth, and has an awful haircut, and much of the movie's \"humor\" derives from that. One day after being fired from work, his friends try to cheer him up by watching \"nude movies\" only to find that Bucky's parents were once successful porn stars in the 70s. Bucky, who for some reason is not disturbed by seeing his parents in a porno, decides it is his destiny to become a porn star and heads for the San Frenando Valley.Unfortunately his genitalia is so small, he can use a straw as a condom. At the sight of a naked woman, he screeches like a hyena and ejaculates all over the place. Lucky for him a porn director Miles Deep (whose character reminds me I could be watching \"Boogie Nights\" instead of this abortion of a movie) decides that he could star in a new type of porn, where men don't feel threatened by him and women could feel that they have a prize compared to him.The movie has us root for the most unlikeable schmuck in recent memory. Consider a scene where Bucky auditions for a Mac and Cheese commercial and to the horror of the judges (and the people watching this movie) takes off his pants and starts jerking off and even sticks him thumb up his but. There are many gags like these and they all have no set up. What led Bucky to think that it was a porn audition? Does he think porn movies are the only movies out there? Take the dick drawings montage from \"Superbad\". That was funny precisely because it had a build up to it. This movie was directed by Tom Brady, not the football quarterback although he probably could have made a better movie. He has previously directed the masterpiece \"The Hot Chick\" with Rob Schneider, also a horribly unfunny movie that relied only on it's one joke premise. People when you pay to see a movie, please do some research beforehand. Know who stars in it, know who wrote it, who directed it. Read some reviews If you do so, you may always avoid seeing garbage like is. As for Nick Swardson, in the words of Roger Ebert: Your movie sucks.",

It made me think of a rerun of Zach and Miri Make A Porno on Cinemax After Dark or Hugh Hefner's runaway bride disaster. For those of you Adam Sandler fans, make sure you don't buy any movie with the words \"Happy Madison\" on it. The script, cast, even a Pauly Shore comeback can't save him from being a failure of box office bombs and the list goes on and on. Try looking at a list of great pornstars like Sasha Grey and Jenna Jamison. That'll get your head pumping. \"Bucky Larson\" is so bad, even \"Grandma's Boy\" made Grandma a nice big piece of sugar cookies.Bottom Line: This is one of the worst obese films of 2011 and as I could recall to Bucky Larson, I should re-name my title \"Bucky Larson: Born to Suck Every Adam Sandler movie and let my critics throw Subway sandwiches at me.\" Nick Swordswan, you deserved a Razzie for that and Worst Picture.",

There is no way to explain the outright awfulness of it, but I will try.It's hard to believe that such an amazing cast would even SHOW UP for this movie. Bottom line. And yeah, Nick Swardson is usually hilarious.. but come on. The character Bucky Larson is the most unlikeable character I've ever seen in a movie, and I've seen thousands by now. And that alone makes the plot unbelievable.I suppose there is a whole, \"even guys with small dick's deserve love and can get a hot girl\" message there somewhere, but its clouded by stupidity, and its never very moving, because there is just NO CHANCE Christina Ricci would ever touch \"Bucky Larson\" - Stephen Dorf has a line in the movie \"Am I in the Twilight Zone?\" That is the only place where the story of this movie would ever be even remotely believable.And to make matters worse, there is ONE conflict and it happens in the last 10 minutes of the movie. The rest is literally climbing action. There's no climax. It is seriously the worst movie I have seen in years.Don't bother. The Hangover 2 (so horrible as well) was better than this movie, and I think I laughed more here... That's saying something about the script/plot of this movie. It's just a disaster.1/10.",

She is great, but other cast members don't seem to be taking the movie as seriously as she, but that's probably because they are all mates of Sandler.Its highly predictable, things are going rest for Bucky, something knocks him back, but all comes good at the end.So its not very good, there are a few funny moments, but the film is saved by Ricci and Johnson, playing way above everyone else.",

There are cheesy moments, but they are done in a manner that barely trips you up or takes you out of the moment.

I actually thought Swardson did OK in this movie for the role he was given but the premise of the movie was not well thought out, a dumb idiot in porn business and the idea that somehow him coming early before sex even starts would set some kind of trend in the industry and make him a star of porn. There were some very funny moments with Bucky's landlord (Kevin Nealon) and it was sort of romantic in the end how this idiot from Iowa hooks up with a babe waiter in Hollywood but the ultimate result for this movie is a failure because its just time consuming blather if you don't find Swardson's thick midwest accent amusing. Personally, this movie reminds me of Dumb and Dumberer, the wretched prequel to Dumb and Dumber, in that there were some rather funny scenes and i was able to watch the entire film but my intelligence took a hit and it was really, really dumb. 5/10 There are some occasional laughs throughout, if you make it to the end.",

Imagine waking up late for work, running out of gas on the side of the highway on your way to work, getting hit by a car on the highway as you wait for a tow, and then getting fired for not showing up to work because you were in the hospital. That would still be a better day than the day you watched this movie. If I could give this a \"0\" instead of a \"1\", I would.

Sandler probably has not produced a moment of tolerable on-camera presence since EIGHT CRAZY NIGHTS in 2002 (oh, wait, I think that was a pre-motion capture cartoon!). All jokes aside, Sandler's LITTLE NICKY (2000) makes BUCKY LARSON look like a Best Picture Oscar contender. Further, Bucky's prosthetic beaverish front teeth are slightly less irritating than Martin Lawrence's fat suit in BIG MOMMA 1-7. When you come right down to it, BUCKY LARSON comes off sort of like a sanitized version of Voltaire's CANDIDE.

            "content": "Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star (2011): Dir: Tom Brady / Cast: Nick Swardson, Christina Ricci, Don Johnson, Stephen Dorff, Kevin Nealon: Aimed at the lowest common denominator yet it references the fact that everyone has a purpose in life. Bucky Larson is met with the reality that his parents were porn stars decades ago, and he is so excited that he sets out to Hollywood to seek stardom as well. Tom Brady whose The Comebacks is a misfire does so again with pathetic semen jokes. Nick Swardson plays the buck-toothed Bucky whose unappealing physical appearance and small manhood render him a star in the adult film industry but what is interesting here is what Larson will find truly important and how he renders stardom upon how others see you. Christina Ricci is way too talented for her cardboard role of waitress whom Bucky befriends. Her dish tray trauma is stupid, and her liking of Bucky is not convincing. Don Johnson steals scenes as a porn director who seems tailored after Burt Reynolds in the superior Boogie Nights. He was eliminated from a party but discovers Larson and renders him a star through his shortcomings. Eventually Johnson owns up to his own mistakes and misjudgements. Stephen Dorff as porn star Dick Shadow is the predictable rival whose award record will be challenged. Bucky's teeth are an obvious bad prop, and the whole ejaculation joke is pathetic especially with its poor comic aims. Vulgar yet observant take on the porn industry and our trust in physicality, results in a comedy devoid of humour and leaves more shame on anyone involved in the industry. Score: 4 / 10",

            "content": "An unattractive not well endowed Iowa guy travels to LA to become a porn star in the steps of his parents. One of the writers is Adam Sandler so that should let you know what to expect. It is way below the Farelly Brothers in terms of humor and slightly worse than a Rob Schneider movie in terms of crudeness. Quite a lot of it is painful to watch but it's not a total write off. There is something uplifting in the story.Nick Swarsdon I thought was kind of annoying in 'Just Go With It' and in this movie he is annoying too but that is part of the character. He isn't a terrific comedian but he tries hard. The supporting cast is actually better than expected - quite good for what they are cast as. Christina Ricci is prettier than before and is quite sweet and touching as the girlfriend. Don Johnson is quite good as a slightly sleazy but kind porn director. Stephen Dorff is an arrogant porn star.Overall if you are in the mood for a crude comedy then it's quite cute in parts.",

My inner pre-adolescent teenager enjoyed the film for what it was.It falls into the genres of \"lowbrow\", \"dumb\", \"crude\", \"toilet humour\" and maybe \"slapstick\". You can't say it was an \"awful\" movie in the sense that it was poorly acted, written and directed. It wasn't. I think \"stupid\" is actually what Swardson, Brady, Sandler, etc. were going for. It's on the same level as making fun of handicapped kids or laughing at farts.There is an audience for movies like this, and who are we to judge this audience and the people willing to make movies to cater to them? According to IMDb, \"males under 18\" rate it just as low as everyone else. I suspect that the 11-14 year old boys who would find this movie the most amusing are not the sort to visit IMDb.",

            "content": "I don't really have anything more to say about \"Bucky Lawson: Born to Be a Star,\" but in all fairness, I should mention two stuff that made me slightly amused, although they have nothing to do with the movie itself. The first is Don Johnson's concept of playing Miles Deep as a porn industry vet.This is not particularly funny, but I kept thinking it might have been more funny if his character had also been named Don Johnson, as well as a completely acceptable porn name de plume.(Look, I didn't say it was that funny, just funnier than anything in the movie.) The other thing is that Edward Herrmann, in the same week this movie is published, will also see the launch of a project more adapted to his talents, the voice of Roger Ebert's autobiography's audio version, \"Life Itself.\"In other words, Roger Ebert is only one degree of separation from the people responsible for \"Bucky Larson.\" As he is currently at the Toronto International Film Festival, I couldn't ask what he thought about this connection, but I think that if I had, his response would have been a mildly abashed nod and a request for a Purell bottle of \"Contagion\" size.Believe me, the feeling I understand.",

The shattering of stereotypes and the inclusive nature of the storyline was refreshing. The fact that men masturbate was not dodged or hinted it was an obvious fact and even in a group scene was not reflected as homo-erotic just as being a natural. I particularly liked the way the parent/son relationship was portrayed. Mom and Pop, even though they had starred in porno back in the day, came across as loving proud parents and Bucky had obviously embraced good social values.The normalization of the porn industry was well handled and yet the essential goodness of faithfulness was also brought to the fore.All in all an amusing evening and the enjoyment of seeing some sensitive issues handled with a deft touch. Hats off to everybody involved.",

            "content": "I voted 10 to bring the average up. It's current rating is way too low. If you are a fan of immature goofy movies, (Corky Romano, Dodgeball, Freddy Got Fingered, The Rocker etc.) or the Jerky Boys tapes, you will get a lot of laughs. Let's talk about some of the actors. Nick Swardson's character, Bucky Larson, really relies on others for laughs and it's a unique character so it is hard to critique. The supporting cast does well to compliment him. He puts on a great Minnesotan accent a la 'Fargo' only exaggerated to the 10th power. Christina Ricci as always puts on a great performance as the romantic lead - very sincere and believable. Stephen Dorff, who I actually can't stand, was absolutely perfect for the villain role. He did a fantastic job and came off almost likable as a complete douche. There were some good characters who did well and added a lot to the movie, but it was Don Johnson who stole the show. I cracked up at nearly every line he had. His delivery was flawless. I am really surprised at how funny he was. You can compare his role to that of the legendary Rip Torn in Dodgeball and Freddy Got Fingered. I really can't stress how great Don Johnson was. The movie is light, there is no real drama in it that you have to deal with, it's just about getting some good laughs and forgetting about everything else for an hour and a half. Don't go in expecting Meet the Parents or some cerebral comedy. It's a goof flick, I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is immature like me. The movie bombed in theaters and I am not surprised. It should do well on PPV and DVD with people like me who don't go to theaters anymore. Just rented it from Redbox and it was a dollar well spent.",

Easily a 7.0I would say that I got a lot of fun from watching this impressive work of art that defies convention and goes where no other movie has gone before. It was a \"bad movie\" done entirely on purpose by the director and writers. Just like the porn movies Bucky made in the movie, this is innovation and film critics, people who were brainwashed in film school to like 1940's stuff, cannot simply understand the genius of this film, as did the people on the porn business which were shown Bucky film's.",

Somehow, appearing in this hot pile of garbage, she manages to deliver an actual decent performance and come off as likeable and adorable, despite the horrible materials he has to work with.The first 30 seconds of this movie give you a real feel for what you are in for. Pain. However I'll give it an extra star because there are a few gags that actually land and you'll probably have one or two hearty chuckles. And Christina Ricci delivers a solid performance. Actually the supporting cast in general is pretty solid. It just makes it all the more confusing, like how are these people supporting Nick Swardson. In what universe does that even make sense?Is this movie worth a watch? Not really. But it's kind of amazing to watch just for the sheer fact that it exists...",

This movie has impacted society so much following the come of the infamous young notorious 'Bucky Larson'!. Bucky appears to be your every day sweet heart but deep down he's a chigga chigga bad boy, unlike P'diddy Bucky Larson is not gang related, he is affiliated with the top people in the industry of L.A and uses his ol' folks skills to succeed in life. This movie will inspire young people all around the world to follow their dreams and not give up when the chicks are down. This movie smashed in records at the box office snatching a whooping '$2.5 million' the budget happened to be '$10 million' but its times like this when the chicks are down that like 'Bucky Larson' that you buckle up and follow your dreams. Watch other movies like 'Shawshank Redemption' 'Batman: Darknight' or the basic and generic 'Babby Driver' none of these movies compare to the sophisticated 'Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star'. The amount of diversity and satisfaction you obtain is quite unique and fresh to the audience. In conclusion this film is far better and timid compared to the 'Doogie Howser TV SHOW'. The kids will love it as well whats better then that? That's a rhetorical question by the way of course there going to love it. Bucky Larson the character is the definition of raw perfection and 'Nick Swardson' the actor is very talented.

If you pirated this movie don't feel ashamed because nobody should buy the DVD or even rent it which I did regrettably, so if you want a movie that's more entertaining than this get Boogie Nights or A Star Is Born instead.

The main character, Bucky, essentially is the quintessential portrait of every human being, young or old, rich or poor, intelligent or not. He tries desperately to be who he isn't, which is an idea that rings true for every single person with a soul. We all have. As I watched this movie, and honestly I did cry towards the heartbreaking and poignant ending (no spoilers here).

The romantic comedy elements in it were pretty lame. It's your standard Happy Gilmore comedy, not too good but not the worst movie ever made. The comedy in it isn't that bad if you really think about. The issue is, it's almost too raunchy even for today's time. The raunch in it made it almost unwatchable at certain parts.

In one scene soon after Bucky arrives in Hollywood, he goes to a casting call for a peanut butter commercial, but he thinks it's for a porno.
