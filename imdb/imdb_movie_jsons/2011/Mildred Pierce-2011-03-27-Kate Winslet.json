            "review_title": "Faithful to the novel",
            "content": "If you're one of the many people who read James M. Cain's novel Mildred Pierce and were utterly baffled by the changed made to the 1945 film adaptation, have no fear: the 2011 remake is so faithful to the book, it's as if someone's reading it aloud. Spread out in a 5-part miniseries, every detail of the long-suffering mother's journey is shown, from the dissolution of her marriage to her baby steps of adapting to the business world, to the sadness each of her daughters bring, and to her second chance at love with a young playboy. Kate Winslet takes the helm, and after her predecessor won a long-awaited Oscar for the original, Kate took quite a risk.Since the two versions are so different, because of the story changes, Kate Winslet and Joan Crawford play two different women. Even if you love Joan Crawford, I think you'll still be able to appreciate Kate's interpretation and admit that she gives a heartfelt, exhausting performance. Kate modernizes the role, bringing her own brand of acting to Mildred's struggles, rather than trying to imitate Joan's stoic performance from the silver screen. She was rewarded, too, earning a Golden Globe for her work.While in the original, the characters of Mildred's husband, friend, and suitor are stereotypes and rather boring, in the remake, Brian O'Byrne, Melissa Leo, and James Le Gros each bring realism into their respective roles. Mare Winningham joins the cast as a fellow waitress, and she's so realistic it's as if she's been slinging hash her entire life. Evan Rachel Wood takes on the villainous role of Mildred's oldest daughter, and while I am partial to Ann Blyth's original breakthrough performance, there are no flaws in Evan's. She does everything she's supposed to do and makes the audience hate her just as much as they're supposed to. Guy Pearce plays the handsome, spoiled playboy, and while he's always excellent in every role he takes on, if you watch this miniseries you might be too distracted to focus on his acting talents.Since I've read the book, I thoroughly appreciated Todd Haynes' adaptation. This version is faithful from start to finish, and with several seasoned actors bringing the characters to life, it's very enjoyable to watch.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to sex scenes and nudity, as well as upsetting scenes involving children, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",

            "review_title": "elephantine adaptation",
            "content": "Although \"Mildred Pierce\" was originally a novel, the story is familiar to most people as a glossy 1945 film noir in which Joan Crawford suffers in furs as her ungrateful daughter (Ann Blyth) steals her boyfriend (Zachary Scott). Strangely enough, the most engaging and gripping sections of this nearly 6-hour extravaganza of middle-class yearnings are not just the more heated of the mother-daughter battles but the painful struggle of the title character to find a job in a Depression-ravaged economy and a micro-examination of the frantic and messy business of running a restaurant, including the heartening camaraderie of the kitchen and wait staff. There is much attention to the details of craftsmanship \u2013 pianistic, vocal, culinary, architectural, managerial and sartorial. When the movie concentrates on these matters it zips by, so sure is the treatment. The musical underscoring, always a key element in the evocation of the antique past, is too shrill at first but improves as the episodes unfold. For some reason Todd Haynes and his composer Carter Burwell have chosen to hammer us over the head at the start with a very loud jazzy piece, which is a bad idea because it obstructs the establishment of our acquaintance with the Pierce family. As the series progresses the musical elements are toned down. Mildred's theme song throughout is, appropriately enough, \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows.\"The accomplished Kate Winslet flattens out her melodious native Britspeak yet again to impersonate a drab American housewife. How many such roles has she played by now? I've lost count. It's a consciously colorless rendering of an intelligent, strong and very feminine woman, but not the type of woman who would stop traffic or even try to. The supporting actors are the ones with personality texture: Melissa Leo as a good-natured neighbor and business partner, Mare Winningham as a tough but sweet co-worker (speaking with a \"New Yawk\"-style twang like one of those sassy blondes from 30's movies), Guy Pearce as the corrupt hedonistic boyfriend, Morgan Turner and Evan Rachel Wood as child and adult versions of Mildred's warped and snobby daughter Veda. Brian F. O'Byrne as Mildred's estranged husband is just warm and tender enough to evoke some sympathy.The production is so meticulously produced and masterfully photographed that you can get lost in the visual details but the scale is too large for the smallness of the story.",

            "review_title": "A Television Masterpiece",
            "content": "To really appreciate this masterpiece of television cinema, the first step is to outgrow the original starring Ms. Crawford.Initially as I started watching the HBO version I tried to compare the scenes with the original, as I have seen it several times over the years.It's easy to compare the HBO's Wally to the truly wonderful Jack Carson, and just for comparison sake, Carson takes the cake. No challenge.How about Ms. Crawford's Pierce vs Winslet's? Crawford of course would win for her screen presence, and the magnitude of her personality. She would also grab the public's vote because she plays a heroine. Ms. Winslet's Mildred has a persona of a victim and comes across as too ordinary, compare with the superhuman presence of Crawford. So, I understand why a lot of us would automatically defer to the original and try to ignore the new.And what about Veda, how would I compare Evan Rachael's to Ann Blyth's wonderful 1940's performance. In many ways I'd nod the hat to Ms. Blyth, because the movie itself is so immersing.Judging solely based on the performances of the original characters of the 1940's version, the luscious black and white cinematography, and Ms. Crawford, it would be easy to dismiss the 2011 version.However if you look at the 2011 version as a standalone piece of grownup film making and the viewer is indeed a grownup who appreciates subtleties, this is one of the best modern movies ever made for television.Many complain about its pace, they whine that this new version doesn't have a bang of an ending, they complain that Winslet is not a heroine, and how is it possible for Veda to become so great as a singer in such a short time. However, the core reason for people's dissatisfaction with the HBO version is because the original was so good, and to be honest so manipulative. The original twisted the novel to maintain and in many ways revive Crawford's superstar status.The HBO version is an ode to masterful, grownup film making. I am simply blown away that we can still make such amazingly powerful cinema in the US.A huge thanks for those involved in this truly inspiring movie. Thanks for not cheapening it with juvenile gun fires and cheap dialog. Thanks for not catering to the lowest common denominator.This is a heck of a grown up movie, if you can just see it for what it is and not as a remake.",

            "content": "I was already a Kate Winslet fan, but this performance has put her on a very short list of those who I have ever been so moved, so filled with respect and admiration.From the moment we first meet her skillfully making pies (old school like grandma) we see a woman who inspires respect. Her troubled marriage becomes apparent right off, but it's not the unreasonable, irrational type of modern day failed marriage relationship. They come to a mutual understanding that they are not happy married to each other, recognizing their own faults and personality differences that are not making for a happy marriage. He leaves her for another woman and while shocking to her, Mildred's inner strength gives you the feeling she'll find a way to manage, although at the most challenging time imaginable - depression era California! We watch as Mildred works hard to keep her 2 daughters cared for while trying to keep herself from falling into understandable depression.I'll leave the rest for when the series finishes, but I have never seen better acting than in this series, and a large part of that is KW. I believe her performance brings this series to a level it would not have achieved without her. Of course I must credit the directing, writing, and the story itself, for all are wonderful. I could not imagine any fan of dramatic film not liking this series.",

            "review_title": "A slow yet captivating mini-series, but...",
            "content": "-> continuing from the title <- But it is not for everyone. Mildred pierce is not like other movies/series \"based\" on novels. This one is more like it \"picturization \" of the novel. If you have read the James Cain novel by the same name, you will be stunned how this movie 'sticks' to the source faithfully. So this should be great right? Ironically we learn from this that sometimes being too faithful to the novel has its drawbacks.Read on:This is a film about a middle class divorced , single mom raising her kids , trying to be successful and riding the waves of success but making the mistake of trying to woo her 'rotten' daughter that leads to her downfall.Here is Kate winslet as the heroine, Mildred Pierce. She is in every frame of the film and this must have been an extremely tiring performance for her. But Ms.Winslet is nothing short of spectacular. She gets every emotion right and delivers every dialogue flawlessly. Morgan Turner as the young Veda Pierce is rightly cast and builds up a neat foundation for Evan Rachel Wood to play her adult counterpart. Wood plays the role just right. Mellisa Leo and MAre Winningham as Pierce's friends Lucy and Ida, are perfectly cast. Br\u00edan F. O'Byrne as Bert is surprising good and in the final scene, he truly shines. Now we have a good story and perfect cast so what could go wrong? Its the faithfulness! The novel is a good read, but picturizing it frame by frame into a movie would not attract many audiences. Its a film noire and is very realistic. The scenes unravel slowly and in detail. for some this may seem like a 'drag'. So if you find yourself yawing at movies like 'Revolutionary Road' or 'The English Patient' then stay away. Also the devotion Mildred shows to her, clearly sick and evil daughter is something I found hard to understand. In today's sensibility a mother wouldn't go this far I assume but this is debatable.Other than that the film is a joyful companion to the novel. It would actual be difficult to imagine Mildred Pierce as anyone other than Kate Winslet, if you both, read and watch the movie over the same course of time. In conclusion, If you like good acting, good music, Pre-World war II era-films with a touch of realism then do not miss this.",

            "content": "I thought this was a decent miniseries. I thought Kate Winslet was great in her role, and most likely would have taken home the Emmy if this had been better written. My biggest complaint about the story - and perhaps this is true in the original novel, I don't know - is that it's never explained as to what happened in Veda's upbringing to make her such a manipulative spoiled bitch. She grows up in the 30s, when most people were lucky if they had regular meals let alone a place to live, yet she's vicious and hateful because her mother works in a restaurant. It's not because of her sister's death because she was like that before her sister's death. Also, I don't understand why everyone falls all over Evan Rachel Wood's performance in this. Really? I thought she was mediocre at best. She chews up the scenery in this miniseries - sooooooooo overacted. The scene where Kate Winslet's character finds her daughter with her husband naked? Evan Rachel Wood's movement and performance reminded me of a soap opera. Truthfully, my opinion is that this miniseries would have been much better with a different - and better - actress playing Veda.",

            "content": "First off, I give this a 5 because of the great depiction of the era, the costuming, sets, etc. And because it wasn't awful for all five hours...However, I'm sorry, but this mini-series was BAD. Kate Winslet is a wonderful actress, and so is Evan Rachel Wood and Melissa Leo and Mare Winningham, but this series just fails to really capture the spark that it needed. Leo and Winningham, in supporting roles, fared better than Winslet, primarily because their characters were portrayed as likable. I don't know what series some of these reviewers were watching, but I found Winslet's Mildred Pierce irrational and irritating, lacking that redeeming quality where you root for her as the heroine/protagonist. I know the story is supposed to be about the relationship with Veda, but it just plays out like a soap opera, rather than something that should be coming from HBO.I also felt the direction was sub-par. The actors were there, and I believe could have excelled in their parts, but the awful and unbearably slow pace of the film simply overshadowed any possibility of success.And I'm sorry, but Veda could have attempted to murder her mother, and in this version, Mildred would have ended up apologizing. In one of the final scenes, where Mildred finds Veda and Monty, I thought, this is the reaction? Chasing her through the house, and even that felt contrived and half-hearted. And then constantly seeking her approval, by inviting her to the wedding to Bert (or whatever that was?) only to sort of stick up for herself as Veda's cab pulls away, so she can jet to NYC and meet Monty? Mildred doesn't feel empowered or heroic - she feels pathetic and sad, and not in a moving or good way.All in all, not really worth the investment of time, and certainly not up to the standards I expect from HBO.",

            "content": "Although the performances of Kate Winslet, Guy Pearce and Evan Racel Wood were all top notch in this 2011 remake, I preferred the original 1945 film. I just found the updated version to be too long. And it really didn't explain things as well as the 1945 version, such as the real reason why Mr. Pierce left his family. I know they make it seem like it was because he had another woman. But in the 1945 movie, it explained why he sought companionship with another woman. He was getting into a lot of arguments with Mrs. Pierce spoiling their daughters--especially Veda. And that's another thing too. In the 2011 version, it really didn't explain why Veda was a spoiled brat. But in the 1945 version, Mrs. Pierce said that she wanted to give the best things for her daughters. Anyway, another reason I liked the 1945 version more was because it had more style. I liked the film-noirness of it. I found the 2011 version to be all so typical and common. Nothing special. I don't know why they even bothered remaking this movie since the original was so much better. 5/10",

            "content": "It's 1930's L.A. Mildred Pierce (Kate Winslet) has been abandoned by her unemployed husband Bert leaving her with their young daughters Veda and Ray. She has been trying to make ends meet by selling her home-made pies. She is forced to take a lowly waitress job in Hollywood. Veda finds out and berates her for embarrassing the family. Mildred tells her that she's preparing to open her own restaurant. Mildred is sleeping with Bert's former real-estate partner Wally Burgan who comes up with a place to start the restaurant. Due to tax reasons, the scheme requires Mildred to divorce Bert. She begins dating polo-playing playboy Monty Beragon (Guy Pearce). He does no work but he gets an income from a fading fruit import business. While secretly away with him, Ray gets sick and later dies. With her waitress friend Ida Corwin's help, her chicken-and-waffles restaurants become highly successful. Mildred doles on Veda but she turns more and more rotten.This is a five parts HBO mini-series based on the 1941 novel and most well-known for the 1945 film adaptation. For me, this is a tragic mother and daughter story. The drama only gets great when Evan Rachel Wood arrives in part four. The younger actresses who play Veda in the first three parts do their very best. It's not their fault but the drama is limited to a few interesting scenes. This is a failure of adaptation. The first three parts are too plodding and fails to grab the drama by its throat. The saving grace is Kate Winslet and her never-ending humanity. Despite the slow start, she keeps the story going and there is value to a more expansive exposition than the 1945 film. It would have helped to concentrate this five parter into a two or three parter.",

Kate Winslet is a great actress, assuredly a more accomplished thespian than Crawford but the part fit Joan like a glove but by hewing so close to the novel this refocuses the drama in too many directions and loses the impact of any of them. Another problem is the part of Veda. The casting of two actresses minimizes the impact of the role for a start and the portrayals of both actresses while not bad can not possibly compete with the cancerous, psychopathic venality of Ann Blyth's pit viper in the original. It's bandbox pretty in the attention to detail of the sets but overall lacking a certain something...glamour? a proper consistent mood? to make it compelling that the Crawford film pulled off effortlessly.",

            "content": "And the mystery is, of course, why they bothered to make this. I have not read the book but it is easy to imagine author James Cain laughing in his grave at the thought of his potboiler being given the high art treatment. Of course potboilers have their place, as do movies of potboilers as per the 1945 Joan Crawford movie. We know they are not art, we turn a blind eye to the melodrama and implausibilities and treat them as the entertainment they were intended to be. It's all a lot of fun. But when someone tries to pretend works like this are great classics, sorry, it's just not going to fly. This adaption seem to be based on the bizarre idea that if you take an hours worth of material and stretch it out to 5 hours the result must be 5 times better.The story itself is simple enough. A tiresome mother agonizes over a tiresome daughter. The result is...well, tiresome. It doesn't help that the mother is not very bright, she continuously wears an expression like a stunned mullet and for the first 4 episodes she has the figure of a small whale - it looks like the costume designer has stuffed a mattress up her dress. Inexplicably men find her very attractive (maybe the whale look was in fashion back then). Her main claim to fame is that apparently she is the only person in America who can make a pie, which is nice for those who like pie-themed movies but quite boring for the rest of us. She has a brief fling with a rake (not the garden sort) who has a lovely car which surprisingly he doesn't crash despite his hair constantly falling over both eyes. Tragically the younger daughter dies and we are treated to a bravura piece of acting in which the mother changes her expression from that of a stunned mullet to a slightly more stunned mullet. But any grieve is short lived because soon our heroine is opening a restaurant and is up to her armpits in chickens. For the restaurateurs in the audience this is riveting stuff \u2013 we are on edge of our seats wringing our hands hoping beyond hope she has enough chickens. But hurrah, it is a huge success and the rake arrives with a very long package that may or not be a long handled chicken cleaver or a short jousting stick. Meanwhile the elder daughter is proving to be a stroppy little object, although obviously supremely talented because she learns how to be an opera singer in a week, whereas normally it takes, oh, I don't know, at least 2 weeks. While it is tempting at this stage to give a spoiler this is not possible for there is nothing to spoil.So what is it all about? What have we learned? About the unconditional love aka stupidity of a mother for her daughter? The ability of the little man (or woman) to triumph over adversity and achieve greatness? No, apparently, as the closing scene tells us, the answer is if all else fails \"get stinko\". And so the curtain falls.I give it a score of 1, simply for the director's ability to convince someone to give him enough money to make this turkey.",

While the story may well have been close to the original source material (I have never read it) the whole thing was far too slow to be really enjoyable. Kate Winslett is not one of my favourite actresses, I find her adequate but never riveting or charismatic as a performer. It may have been the decision of Todd Haynes but she plays Mildred as a passive victim rather than the dynamic entrepreneur that Joan Crawford played in the original movie. How she became a successful restaurant owner is puzzling (it all seems to have been some sort of accident). Too many long and lingering shots of people \"thinking\", maybe Haynes just wanted to show the money had been spent on the sets. Veda ( as a child) was not portrayed as the bitch she obviously was (something that Ann Blyth made so wonderfully clear in the Crawford film). The older Veda was better but still did not come close. There are obviously incidents (like Mildred's relationship with Wally) portrayed in the new version that could never have been tackled way back when Crawford was a star but that does not make the new version any better, just different. Overall it is a disappointing production and, in my opinion, was rather a waste of time.",

I haven't read the book yet but I think it wasn't structured to be adapted into a miniseries. Maybe a movie (I mean the one with Joan Crawford) but not a 5-hour series. Some dialogues are full of wit and deepness but, some feel very dull. Todd Haynes directed flawlessly but the scripts he co-wrote needed to be fixed or shortened.Kate Winslet just nails every scene she's in and gives a powerful performance mostly in the scenes with young and adult Veda. The relationship between these feels so real even if it's a toxic one, a VERY toxic one. Kate gives us a character that has been beaten by life but, tries to go on and give her daughters a better life even if the world is falling down.The sets and costumes are just brilliant. Anything you would expect coming from a period production.It is a beautiful story and production, feminism at its best, but the writing needs some fixing.",

            "content": "Todd Haynes's uber-Mommie Dearest drama, starring Kate Winslet, reminds one of a faded postcard, found in an old box of precious keepsakes \u2013 wistfully pretty to look at \u2013 for a moment anyway. The 5+ hour remake of the 1945 Warner Bros film classic, drags in all the wrong places, partly due to the cable giant's \"bigger is better\" miniseries mania and the miscasting of the central characters of Mildred Pierce, Veda (the elder), and Monty Beragon. In their determination to render up a carbon copy of the book, written by James M. Cain in 1941, Mildred Pierce 2011 is transformed into a tired and over-wrought tale that signifies a lot of ho-hum. Directed and co-adapted for the mini-screen by Todd Haynes, his Mildred Pierce adds all the modern clich\u00e9s of incestual longings and guy-on-girl action, which does little to save this remake from tanking. If anything, suggesting that Mildred has sexual longings for Veda undercuts the tension and appears like a cheap anchovy thrown into an already over-rich stew.Ms. Winslet struggles to deliver her usual tour-de-force performance in this psychological doppelganger study of Mildred, the mother who obsessively clings to her bitch of a daughter, Veda, while climbing her ladder of success as a restaurateur. Kate Winslet's Mildred is too polite and refined to hold our interest in this tepid soap opera. The five-part series spends the first three on Mildred and Veda's complex relationship, which is three times too long in OHLand's opinion. Morgan Turner - spellbinding as the young Veda \u2013 is a tough act to follow. It's too bad that Evan Rachel Wood had to be the one to step into the adult Veda's shoes, because she often looks silly, like a little girl caught wearing mommy's makeup. A wiser choice for this pivotal role would have been the smooth, kitty-cat Daveigh Chase, from HBO's \"Big Love\" mini-series. Guy Pearce, as Monty, the faded Pasadena playboy, comes off as a smarmy schoolboy with a bad haircut. Mark Strong, of \"Robin Hood\" fame, seems the most logical choice to bite into this juicy character. In using \"name\" stars like Wood and Pearce, HBO settled for the bottom-line instead of making bolder casting choices to strengthened their lengthy treatment and Ms. Winslet's dramatic efforts. Brian F. O'Byrne does what he can with the lackluster character of Bert, Mildred's tiresome husband. Melissa Leo as the straight-talking Lucy, Mildred's friend and confidant and James LeGros, as Wally, the Pierce's friendly neighborhood conman, deftly bring new life to these memorable supporting characters.Kudos goes to award-winning costume designer Ann Roth and the entire Mildred Pierce 2011 wardrobe department, who succeeds in recreating the faded classic feel of the period with timeless colors, simple cuts, and rich pattern work.Perhaps we're just too used to the tough-as-nails Crawford version, with its dramatic music, noir-ish moodiness, and sensational murder \u2013 all in 111 minutes! Naw\u0085what captivates us is the snarling dialogue between Crawford as Mildred and Ann Blyth's Veda and that ferocious slap-out on the staircase. Trying to remake something that's already a great masterpiece is really a waste of time, because as we all know, a masterpiece is a timeless creation.Duh, HBO!",

Excruciatingly slow and agonizingly detailed.The original movie had so much more going for it - Joan Crawford in the opening sequence wearing a mink coat with padded shoulders. It doesn't get any better than that. It moved along briskly to tell a story that spans years while this version feels like it's taking years to tell it.Why do directors go to such excessive lengths to create a particular period? Reminded me of Eastwood's 'Changeling' where the focus was so much on the look of the era that it was a distraction. Directors need to learn how to suggest a period without filling in every single detail. I've seen it done in 'Chinatown'. Less is more. It's an art.The characters in this one almost fade into the background. I guess I'm being really harsh but the original was so vividly done that it's hard not to compare.",

But Todd Haynes' miniseries IS the whole story as James M Cain described it, so those who felt the TV production is too long probably didn't like the book either. I was glad to see everything included----it made for a long watch, but an immensely satisfying one. Haynes has a real gift for recreating period feel; for realistic tones and colors, costumes, cars and sets, music, everything down to the dust on the furniture of the decaying Beragon mansion. You feel that you're actually watching people in the 1930's and '40's. The performances of the entire cast are wonderful---but, a caveat: a couple of scenes employ some brief and unnecessary nudity, so it's not for family hour. Other than that, this is one of the best book-to-film adaptations I've ever seen.",

            "content": "Not a patch on the original 1945 film starring Joan Crawford.James M. Cain's story about an ambitious housewife is still a good one, but there is perhaps too much detail in this version. The original film condensed the novel so well that one became caught up in what was happening to Mildred. In this version, you don't care as much.Kate Winslet is quite okay as Mildred, but she doesn't dominate the way Joan Crawford did in the role. And Kate should dominate, because Mildred is a person who stands out from the crowd. She's a go-getter. She's ambitious. She wants the best possible life for herself and her two children. She opens her own restaurant during the Great Depression and becomes wealthy! A shy and retiring wallflower she isn't! But the way Kate has portrayed her, Mildred now seems too much of a victim, and somebody that would be easily defeated by life's hard knocks rather than attacking first and winning against the odds! My biggest gripe about this show however is regarding the look of the film: the camera work is really sub-standard. No matter how many lights are on in any scene, you cannot see anyone's face clearly. It's too dark and gloomy all the time.The beauty of the film-noir techniques of the 1940's was that, even if a scene was supposed to be in the dark, and all in shadows and mysterious, you could always see the actor's face clear as anything! Of course it was artificial, but audiences loved it because it was these glorious scenes that people remembered most from films of that era.And even today, I'm sure that most audiences still want to see the faces of the people on the screen. You don't have to copy the 1945 film but you can still photograph actors adequately.Sadly, over the years, I've seen production values and film techniques diminish dreadfully in movies from every place, not just from Hollywood, but there was a time (back in the mid-1970's) when the made for television movies were sometimes better than what was showing on the big screen at the time.For example, remember such powerful and epic mini-series such as: RICH MAN, POOR MAN; ROOTS; and THE THORN BIRDS ? All of these captured on the small screen the magic that movies once used to be on the big screen.But, back to reality: MILDRED PIERCE disappoints because the original still burns just as brightly even after 60 years.",

And Monty has a good butt. It's nice to see equal time given to the men who've got something to show.I do miss the film noir aspect. Isn't someone supposed to die?

The father was a complete milquetoast who supposedly ran off to be with some other woman (and who could blame him)but can't seem to make up his mind if he'd rather be at home with Mildred or not. Mildred, for all her pride, still sleeps with every man she meets on the first date and seems to fall into the whole restaurateur business way too easily. And the opera singing. Really?

            "content": "The 2011 version of \"Mildred Pierce\" by HBO Pictures is very different from the Oscar-winning 1945 film with Joan Crawford....so different that I recommend you see them both. And, if you can, see it on HBO Max soon, as it's ALSO posted along with the original movie version. Seeing both would be well worth your time.So why are there two very different versions? Well, parts of James M. Cain's novel simply were not acceptable for the Production Code that Hollywood was forced to adhere to in 1945. So, Mildred's various sexual affairs were completely omitted from the first movie and the ending was changed to punish evil, as the Code would not allow wrongdoers to get away scot-free! But the Cain novel did allow for this darker, less 'nice' ending...and making the film over five and a half hours long worked for me very well. Some might find it a bit slow but I certainly didn't.As for the plot, I'll only briefly describe it. Mildred's husband was been cheating on her and she's had enough...telling him to leave. But it's during the Depression and she has two daughters to care for an no income. So, without any other options, she looks for work and finds it in a greasy spoon. This is nothing to be ashamed of...work is work. But her eldest daughter, Veda, is a snobby little jerk and so Mildred tries to hide this job from her kids...as working as a waitress was somehow a bad thing! This is foreboding, for as the story progresses, although Mildred eventually is able to create a fantastic living by opening up her own restaurants, Veda demands money and support from her mother...while also having contempt for her as well. In short, Veda is a complete narcissist and Mildred is an enabling piece of soggy toast. How all this works out in this sweeping drama is for you to find out for yourself.The acting, direction and script were all first rate and I might have even scored this one a 10 save for one glaring plot problem late in the film. The contemptable Veda, now about age 18-20, storms out of her mother's home and after only 2-3 months, is a singing sensation as an opera star. Now, considering Veda NEVER sang before this and never trained her voice, such a rages to riches success story simply defies common sense. I know Mr. Cain was a trained opera singer, so I can see why he included this plot, but you can't go from being a non-singer to an opera star in 2-3 months....it's just not logical. Still, you can look past this and see how exquisite the film is otherwise. Well made and well worth your time.By the way, as a trained psychotherapist, I did find the very Freudian imagery and themes in this mini-series VERY interesting...and it's something lacking in the 1945 film.",

Winslet, an Oscar winner, manages to perform like a stage school brat, all gaspy mouthed at every turn, Pearce's cad a dull pastiche.I had such high hopes for this miniseries. Kate Winslet. Guy Pearce. Evan Rachel Wood. HBO. What could go wrong? Well, it would turn out, everything. Its hard to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with this, as there is so much. I've mentioned the performances. Perhaps such a talented cast were trying to get something out of a dull script? What I can't understand is why Kate Winslet has to take her clothes off at least once an episode - perhaps a selling point a few years ago, its now a turn as frequent and as appealing as a doorstep energy salesman, an occurrence so frequent its become bland. Wood and Pearce join in the skin show too. One can only conclude it was the only way to detract from the pure hideousness of the production.The production values are very high - this clearly cost a few quid to put together, but there really is nothing to redeem this. The characters, all of them, are too one dimensional to relate to, the storyline is tepid and of its time, and the ultimate moral is botched by both of these traits. If I cared about the characters, I might care about the outcome - couple split up, go there own ways, make regrettable life choices, daughter turns against them, into something they rue creating, and then show no insight into the situation what_so_ever. You're left feeling as if the last five hours of you life would have been better spent on a Greg Evigan vehicle over on True Movies - in fact, the only thing separating this from the hallowed halls of the True Movies channel and its ilk is the lack of an Amish half sister appearing in the midst of the dilemma to show us a moral side of the story.This drama, with its big name cast somehow manages to prove that sometimes a sum can not be even as great as its parts let alone greater.",

            "content": "Classic film fans know well the 1945 \"Mildred Pierce\" that won an Oscar for its star, Joan Crawford, providing her the comeback vehicle after being fired by MGM.Due to censorship restrictions, the film's story deviated somewhat from the book and, because Crawford was the star, the focus was kept on her, rather than enlarging the story to include Veda's career. Also, several of the characters were combined or omitted.This version, starring Kate Winslet, Guy Pearce, Melissa Leo, Mare Winningham, Brian O'Byrne, and Evan Rachel Ward sticks to the James Cain novel, with dialogue actually lifted from it.The five-part drama still tells the story of Mildred and her obsession with her class-conscious, cold, spoiled, brat daughter Veda and the destruction this obsession costs the hard-working Mildred.As is usual with HBO, the production values are fantastic, perfect in setting the atmosphere of the '40s and the mood of the story. The top-notch acting adds to it, and while there may not have been enough story for the time allotted, it's still excellent, particularly if you have read the novel and/or seen the film.I can't imagine two actresses more different from one another than Kate Winslet and Joan Crawford, and the differences are highlighted here to interesting effect. Crawford played Mildred as strong yet vulnerable; it's an overt performance, as were all of her performances. Her Mildred lets Veda and Monty get away with taking advantage of her. Winslet's Mildred is more insecure, and her strength is inner in that she's a survivor. Her Mildred doesn't seem to realize that Veda and Monty are taking her for a ride, and she comes off like a sap. A sympathetic sap, but a sap nonetheless. In a way, it makes her reaction (taken from the book) when she does realize it all the more powerful.Guy Pearce sounds like Zachary Scott in the film, and he's marvelous with just the right touch of sleaze. As Bert, Mildred's ex-husband, Brian O'Byrne, who was the star of Doubt on Broadway, is excellent. Both Evan Rachel Wood and Morgan Turner (Veda as a child) were wonderful showing Veda's detached, frosty personality. It was episode 3 before I realized that Ida was played the remarkable Mare Winningham, who brightens every film she does. Melissa Leo was wasted as Lucy, but good nonetheless. And a special nod to Leslie Lyles, who played the woman in the employment office - she was a perfect '40s character.The rest of this review is for people interested in the singing in the film.Since James Cain was an aspiring opera singer at one time and the son of an opera singer, opera sometimes enters into his stories, as it does here. Some of the operatic selections for Veda here fit the story, particularly Der Holle Rache (mother-daughter), the Bell Song (luring men with one's voice), and the Casta Diva from Norma. As in the book, she's a coloratura soprano, which her teacher tells Mildred is rare. Not really. The rarest voices in opera are the bass, the heldentenor, and true dramatic sopranos and true dramatic mezzos. I say \"true\" because often their roles are sung by spintos or even big lyrics.In the HBO film, Veda has an odd repertoire which includes La Mamma Morta, a lyric spinto or dramatic soprano aria -- chosen because it fits Veda's feelings and personality. For instance, the aria contains the line \"Porto sventura a chi bene mi vuole! (Evil to those who love me well!) Truer words were never sung. In her concert at the Hollywood Bowl, she sings from Barber of Seville, today sung by a mezzo, but probably back then, a coloratura, and her radio aria is Je Suis Titania, also a coloratura aria.The vocal experts for the 2011 version did not want Veda singing Casta Diva since it is an incorrect choice for a) a young singer and b) her voice, but due to the fact that it's about a love triangle, it was chosen. Sumi Jo, whose recordings dubbed Turner, obviously had never sung Casta Diva, so a recording by Edita Guberova was used instead.Evan Rachel Wood was criticized for lacking correct expression and being too concerned with the lip-synching. I'd like to see the person who made that comment lip synch in Italian and German.",

It covers all the themes of pain, family struggle, and love, passion, heartbreak, success and most of all it's a classic mommy dearest struggle of power.Done over five parts the great Kate Winslet stars as Mildred a woman who's married living with two daughters in sunny California in the depression era, and from the start it gets more complex for Mildred when she leaves her husband over his affair, and she's forced to wait tables for a living. Then the big blow is felt her youngest one tragically dies. Only left is the oldest the snappy and high strong Veda(played well by Evan Rachel Wood)who's so ungrateful of her mother's hard work. Still Mildred doesn't let that stop her from using her skills as a cook and baker as her talents help her open several diners and places to eat wonderful chicken and tasty pies! Along the way Mildred meets and has a passionate romance with a California playboy(Guy Pearce) only later this hot tidal wave of steamy passion crashes. And a treat was watching the supporting work from Mildred's best friends played to a tea from veterans Melissa Leo and Mare Winningham. Also along the way of Mildred's food success Veda transforms into a hellcat but her talent for singing Opera can't go unnoticed. Thru it all the ups and downs and the pain and success the mommy daughter struggle takes it's toll. As in the end it proves with Mildred one can start over and go back to their roots.Overall well done in depth mini-series that's emotional, uplifting and a good drama of struggle and determination. The classic mommy dearest drama is one to look at, it proves family life is complex and one goes thru a lot and in the end one can return and start over even after success as one can go back. And the performance from Winslet was top notch.",

            "content": "Mildred Pierce HBO 2011: This does have some spoilers. Kate Winslet delivers an honest performance full of anxiety, passion, heartbreak and guts. She plays a woman ahead of her time and without apology - a character full of contradictions who gets what she wants. While the miniseries is long, it shows the delicate ups and downs of a single mother effected by the Great Depression. She is forced to get a job as a waitress, fearing her daughter's disapproval. Her younger daughter dies early in the film. I cannot say that Mildred was as heartbroken by that as she is endlessly throughout the film for being a constant disappointment to her daughter Veda. Veda, played like a perfect tennis opponent by Evan Rachel Wood is a performance not to be missed. Mildred ends up owning a corporation, making the dough, thriving after a divorce and losing it all quickly just to please an ungrateful and blatantly spiteful daughter. Guy Pierce spices things up as Mildred's lover and plays his famous coward role (Count of Monte Cristo, the Kings Speech) like a charm. This one is a surprise though and you have to watch to get to that gaping reaction towards the end of the film. (like you had all throughout Memento) Like all HBO movies and shows, your cable bill every month is worth the superb casting. Also true to HBO, this miniseries is a great snap shot of how it was for how it is now and something we can learn from as we get through the last four years of tough economic times. Though Mildred is considered to be a heroine, what I praise most is the fact that I did not agree with her most of the time, rather I was curious to ride the stock market rises and slumps of her journey.",

It's a bit too sluggish at times, and the first three episodes suffer from one too many pacing issues, but overall it's well worth it. I want to give note to the relationship between Mildred and her elder daughter. Truly, by the end, one wonders what it's like to have to lose your daughter. Veda is one of the most unlikable characters I have ever encountered on TV, and surely she's just so damn unbearable. You simply want Mildred to literally strangle her (oh the satisfaction!). It's satisfying when things don't go Veda's way, but this is all TV. In real life, as much as one can say that Mildred should just stop trying to be patient and understanding with her, how much would it affect a person? How much would you be willing to endure for your own daughter or son? That is what makes the ending so powerful, and although it must hurt deeply it's also necessary given everything that she has put the mother though.The performances are brilliant. Kate Winslet seems to always do these type of roles, but damn, she's just incredible at them. Her final scenes in the last episode are heartbreaking. Guy Pearce is also incredibly good, charming even at times where you want to dislike him. I have always had a problem with Evan Rachel Wood, as she is always very stale and obvious in her characterizations, but here she nails the part. Overall, well worth it, but perhaps not entirely memorable and maybe could have been better as a whole.",

She struggles to make a living and bringing up the two girls. She succeeds but she has this inexplicable love for Veda that eventually leads to tragedy.This was praised to the high heavens when it premiered on HBO. It was nominated for multiple Emmy awards and won one for Winslet. She is incredible, the rest of the cast is OK, it looks great and is well-directed but it's way too long. This did not need to run over five hours! This easily could have been done in two or three hours. As a result this is slow-moving and quite frankly boring. My finger was on the fast forward more than once. Everything is so drawn out it gets annoying. Worst of all Mildreds obsession with Veda is never clearly explained. WHY does she go to such ridiculous lengths to make sure Veda is happy and satisfied? It never makes any sense. It's suggested that she has lesbian tendencies for her but that comes out of nowhere and is never explored. Basically this is an over long, drawn out and boring mini-series. Winslet is great but not good enough to make up for this length.",

Kate Winslet's an Oscar winner too but these are still large shoes to fill and I wasn't completely convinced she did so after 5 hour-long episodes of Hollywood Golden Age recreation-specialist Todd Haynes recent production. She does her American accent well and certainly enters whole-heartedly into the part as the constantly striving Mildred, abandoned by her husband with two young children to bring up who'll stop and stoop at nothing to do the best for her kids, even if one of those kids turns out be the devil's daughter in terms of selfishness, disrespect and outright cruelty and vindictiveness. Somehow though, Winslet just fails to really trawl the depths of despair and desperation her character warrants plus is it just me or does she appear a bit too young for the part, indeed she seems to age very little as the drama proceeds.One also suspects the action unfolds a bit slower on the screen than it did in the original pulp-fiction novel. This production is over three times the length of the original movie and it does feel like it sometimes. I did appreciate that director Haynes stayed true to the book's original ending although it made me look a little foolish to my wife, to whom I'd confidently promised a big dramatic finish like I'd seen in the old movie.As you'd expect with this director, the period of 30's LA is reproduced beautifully both inside and outside and he gets good quality acting from the actors supporting Winslet. I would say though that the replacement of young Veda by older Veda is a bit sudden with little resemblance between the two actors. Of the two of them, I was more impressed by the younger version, the actress in question may not thank me for saying this but to my way of thinking, she has a naturally sardonic, even cruel visage. I also liked the actor playing husband number one and three while Guy Pierce revels in the flashy role of Monty Berragan, the penniless dandy living on old glories and a fading charm.In conclusion then, despite the question mark in my mind over Winslet's casting, this was still a compulsive soap-opera come thriller helped by stylish direction, impressive production values and good ensemble acting.",

Boy was I surprised to learn it was over 5 hours.But the whole story is so interesting and so well made that not only was the long running time not an issue, I almost found myself wanting it not to end.Kate Winslet is the star here, the success or failure rests squarely on her broad acting shoulders. I didn't pay close enough attention to whether she was in fact in EVERY scene, but if not then pretty close to it. And, coincidentally just a few days ago won the Golden Globe award for best actress in the role.Mildred Pierce is your prototypical 1930s woman in Southern California (all actually filmed in New York), married with two children, her husband the breadwinner. Mildred by what we can see is an excellent wife and mother, and a superb cook. In fact she makes extra money by selling her pies or making fancy decorated cakes for special occasions. She is smart and determined.But her husband has been stepping out on her, not very discreetly. When confronted, and given the ultimatum to choose between Mildred and the other woman, he moves out. Suddenly Mildred gets the moniker \"grass widow\" and certain men seek to take advantage of that situation.When people complain that \"the book was better than the movie\" some of that is because you just can't make a two-hour movie and do justice to all that is in a novel. With a mini-series you get a much better movie. The whole story covers 1931 to 1940, and we see the daughter Veda grow from a 13-year-old brat to a 22-year-old operatic diva. But still a brat.For me a totally engrossing mini-series and it helps that I am a big fan of Winslet.SPOILERS: Forced to take any job to keep her family afloat Mildred becomes a waitress in a hash house. She observes that most customers order chicken, and she knows her chicken is better than what the restaurant serves, so she observes, takes notes, and finally strikes out on her own, opening a \"Mildred's Chicken and Waffle\" restaurant. A big success, she opens other locations. But she is unwise in love and squanders too much money on her polo star lover and her brat of a daughter who wants to be a concert pianist. She eventually has deep financial problems, becomes estranged from her daughter, but marries the polo bum. Her daughter falls into a fortunate situation and become a big operatic star. But Mildred soon finds her daughter and her husband are having an affair, she kicks both of them out of her life, presumably for good, and re-marries her first husband who finally comes to grips with how loving Mildred is, but also after his mistress went away to Texas with her husband.",

They must have been aware that it was a essentially just a domestic drama set in California during the depression of early 1930s and yet people draw attention to the lack of action. Yes it is slow paced but its also wonderfully atmospheric At no time during the six hours or so was I restless or feel the need to check my watch. Everything about this production was class. The acting,directing,and photography were flawless.Great attention was paid to Winslet wardrobe to ensure an authentic look even to the extent of dressing her in late-20s outfits because few people could afford to buy the new styles of 1931. I have not seen the Joan Crawford neither have I read the book but I cannot believe the author intended to convey the impression that Mildred's daughter Veda was transformed almost overnight from a failed concert pianist into an accomplished soprano.This apparent absurdity must have bemused any aspiring classical singer looking in who knows only too well that there is no substitute for the long years of voice training. This is a minor criticism however and does not detract from the general pleasure.",

The story is relevant for today - how many people do you know today spoiling children? They hardly make movies of ungrateful kids these days. Superb acting all round. Evan Rachel Wood is beautiful and totally gets into the part. When she looked evil she really looked like evil. Her lip synching is very good. She is one of the few young actresses today who can really act and get into different roles effortlessly. The operatic music is lovely and watching her sing is really thrilling. Totally believable.

The novel had previously gotten a big-screen adaptation in 1945, winning Joan Crawford a Best Actress Oscar.Although I've never read the novel, I can say that this miniseries has strengths and weaknesses. The weaknesses are that they changed some things (rewriting entire scenes). The strengths are the performances (namely Kate Winslet in an Emmy-winning role), but also that the five-hour length gives the characters more time to develop.It's not a masterpiece, but it's worth seeing.

I do like her in The Reader but of course it was sex between a woman a boy. Mildred Pierce 2011 is not a match for her works. Young Veda was very much off target too, as her acting was very close to high school play-ish.Guy Pearce was very good and very close to the original actor's part. The older Veda was realistic and close to the original's portrayal. Wally was close to character and Mare Willingham and Melissa Leo were also good in their parts.

It was fun to see the story retold and this is first class film-making for TV that easily outclasses a great deal of what gets pumped out for contemporary cinema. It's hard to say anything bad about the great cast and a beautifully photographed and realized recreation of 1930's Los Angeles.Many reviewers seem to be posing the question Why? to a remake of this particular story. On one level there are obvious similarities to the Great Depression and the present times we live in coloured by an ongoing financial crisis. So is this a parable for our times ? Is there some deeper symbolic meaning to this storytelling that illuminates aspects of society ?From what I've read of the novel, it seems this may have been James Cain's intention. Although Mildred Pierce is credited as his most ambitious work no one has ever mentioned it in the same breath as \"great American novel\". Is Mildred's vain pursuit of Veda's love and approval an allegory for ordinary folks pursuit of a chimerical and ultimately false credit card maxed \"good life\", that is ultimately a betrayal of who they really are and their true values Maybe?, maybe not.It seems clear we are to think of Mildred as an tragic heroine on an operatic scale. Someone who's one blindness and weakness, her love for an ungrateful daughter, is her kismet and will be her ultimate downfall. But the story never really succeeds on this level and it's telling that it seems so well suited to it's styling as a Joan Crawford melodrama.What's stopping it ? I think the problem is for this story to touch the greatness it's striving for this that its two central characters are never quite believable. Veda comes off as an almost cartoon or pantomime baddie. On the one hand we can understand (if not sympathize) with her disgust of lower middle class Glendale and aspirations for the finer things in life. But this never explains the level of hatred and sadism she displays towards her mother. Perhaps there is no explanation for this, the Italian teacher who so aptly sums her up is right, perhaps she's just an exceptional one off, a beautiful poisonous snake to be admired from afar, but never touched.Even if we except this and take Veda's exceptional malevolence as believable the problem is that Mildred's character doesn't quite gel either. In almost every other area of her life we see Mildred as not only being clever, resourceful and capable but exceptionally so. The story of her entrepreneurial rise to success shows her dealing with people and situations with insight and astuteness. Yet this so completely deserts her when dealing with her daughter ? Of course that's supposed to be the whole point of the story and in the tradition of capable heros with ruinous great flaws, something she can do nothing about. It's just that somehow here it never seems to quite work on the subconscious level these stories need to succeed at if they are to satisfyingly tap into the great archetypal themes they are aiming to communicate with.So maybe Joan Crawford's version wins in the end, never the less HBO's mini-series is well worth a spin as a very superior soap opera told with cinematic flair.",

            "content": "Todd Haynes has established himself as a truly iconic director. From his works like Poison and Far from Heaven, Haynes is establishing a track record of remarkable period pieces, rivaling that of Kubric. His attention to detail, use of colors, and selection of music helps create the framework. Add to this exceptional performances by Kate Winslet, Guy Pierce, Mellisa Leo and Evan Rachel Wood, and you end up with a truly amazing work. Staying true to the original source material, Haynes has crafted a film that makes even the hardest soul enjoy the pain and wonderful cruelty of life. I am not sure how this story, in all its rich detail, fabric and nuance could have been compressed into a feature length film. As wonderful as Joan Crawford's performance in the original version was, this new adaptation takes James Cain's amazingly dark and deep story of depression era life to a new level that I think he would be proud to be part of.Hayne's sense of detail, imagery, and mood reflect a deep and powerful understanding of period film making that most directors could only hope to accomplish. I hope that he continues down this path of making wonderful period pieces that touch their audience in a most profound and powerful way.Watch this film, and then watch the Crawford original, if you haven't already seen it. You will see that each has it unique qualities, but I think you will see that Hayne's has crafted a more subtle while at the same time intense recreation.",

It made you wish you could go back in time, before technology, when things were so much simpler! The main theme of the story is universal to this day.

Things that every woman wants. The story was written in 1941 and is as relevant and modern today as it was then. Mildred is just a woman, trying to provide a superior standard of living for her family; her circumstances as a single mother leave her utterly vulnerable to the sharks circling her. These people have their own ideas about how to get their needs met, manipulation and taking advantage of another person's weakness, blackmail vs Mildred's straightforward no-nonsense approach leave her wide open. That and her heart. A real morality tale for the ages, but especially mothers; single or not.",

            "content": "Todd Haynes' MILDRED PIERCE is like someone showing you their beloved antique porcelain collection: they trot out one piece after another, you can't help but admire the work's delicacy, craftsmanship, and attention to detail, but you soon start making excuses to go and do something else.\nThis would be the case even if there wasn't already the 1945 MILDRED PIERCE, one of the great movie melodramas of all time, directed by Michael Curtiz with its score by Max Steiner, Ernest Haller cinematography, a virtuoso cast headed by Joan Crawford, and its Ranald MacDougall screenplay including the great line \"one man's poison is another man's meat\" (how did they get THAT past the censors in 1945?).\nIt's great to have a digital copy of the Curtiz version on hand whenever your everyday struggles and strife get too much for you and you want to see a tightly-resolved dramatic package about someone else's struggles and strife. It's 111 minutes long; the 2011 Todd Haynes version, in five episodes totalling 344 minutes, is three times as long; in fact it takes longer to watch the Haynes MILDRED PIERCE than it does to read the novel. Haynes' attention to detail includes a loving reconstruction of the book's penultimate plot device, the ascension of Mildred's monstrous daughter Veda to radio stardom as a classical soprano. Unfortunately, this is one of the novel's clumsier aspects; in 1945 they wisely condensed it into Veda's downmarket career singing in waterfront bars, and used a few gunshots to summarize Mildred's struggles, triumphs, and frustrated love within a compact murder mystery. The 2011 MILDRED PIERCE however, doesn't condense anything; it has great performances, exquisite costume and set design, superb cinematography and reconstructs every scene of the book, but like a tour of someone else's porcelain collection, it just seems to go on and on and on.",

For me it started out fine, and it was okay throughout the first three parts, I just thought they were just a bit too long though. However, like others stated for the last 2 parts everything unraveled. Everything started happening too fast, and it was a little too rushed. I think this series could have been done at the most with just three parts. Five parts is just too long for this series. Some parts were just too slow for me. I also kept finding myself getting upset at \"Veda\" for being such a witch of a daughter. I almost threw my remote at the TV because her character was making me mad. This is a very depressing and upsetting version of the story. Especially the part where Mildred finds out about Monty and Veda, I can't believe a child could be so cruel.

Having not read the book I am unsure as to which story line is more accurate but I found the nudity and sex scenes un-necessary and actually vulgar.

I'd say that this is a flawless period drama and not an ordinary TV movie.The direction is superb in every sense and I expect an Emmy for the outstanding job of the director and the cast.My vote is 10/10.",

            "review_title": "Updated version of the James M. Cain novel.",
            "content": "This series bears only a superficial resemblance to the 1945 movie and even less of a resemblance to the novel, not so much in terms of deviation from the actual storyline but in terms of character development. Here the principal character, Mildred Pierce, is transformed from a frumpy, conventional, clueless, hapless, lower middle class woman into a sultry, vivacious, sexually provocative vixen who pursues her goals through sex. Her daughter observes all this and tries to emulate her mother, which produces conflict because there is only room for one vixen in the Pierce home. Mildred goes through men like a knife through butter (to use a well traveled simile). First she drives away her first husband, then shacks up with her lawyer, then hooks up with a member of the \"gentry\" (he plays polo) who becomes her second husband and boy toy, and then when things don't work out for her, winds up back with her first husband who apparently is a gluten for punishment. Mildred's manipulativeness is matched only by her emotional insensitivity which at times is so transparent that it is a wonder that anyone can be found anywhere hear her. Amazingly, Mildred cannot understand why her daughter, Veda, hates her, revealing a denseness of thought which underscores Mildred's shallowness and limited intellect. If any character in this story has a legitimate gripe, it is Veda. Growing up in an intellectually and spiritually stale environment, and surrounded by people whose sense of social consciousness stops at the dinner table, the bar room or the bedroom, it is not surprising that Veda cannot wait to flee from everything that reminds her of her mother. Her mother's universe is like a gaping black hole (another simile)- it is empty. In fairness to Mildred, she is a product of a culture that values superficiality, so maybe she can't help being what she is - a superficial and pretentious person. As for the series itself, it is high-quality production that captures the smallness and drabness of Mildred's humdrum world. Ironically, set in \"sunny\" Southern California, almost down the road from Hollywood, in the 1930s, this story is anything but sunny. Most of the scenes are dark, drab and full of shadows, like Mildred's personality. Mildred rarely laughs, her usual countenance is a scowl. She's also cheap and a penny pincher. There is nothing heroic about her. She is distant from her employees. She has one friend - her business partner, and even that friendship is tenuous. When in need of advice or support, she turns to men, but only when it suits her needs. She is selfish, self-centered, judgmental and prissy. Although the men in her life care for her, she treats them like dirt. There is nothing about her that is dignified. But she excels in two areas: sex and cooking, using both to her advantage to survive in a culture where men predominate and people like eating good food. As a parent, she is emotionally and physically abusive. She is not a above physically smacking her daughter. At times the story becomes almost morbid as the dysfunctional nature of the mother-daughter relationship becomes more apparent and extreme. Probably the most appealing character in the story is Monty Beragon who sees through Mildred's pretentious and manipulative ways, for which he pays the price by becoming a convenient target for Mildred's wrath. Kate Winslett's performance as Mildred Pierce is outstanding. In this series she \"is\" Mildred Pierce. She captures the essence of the character to the letter. Her performance is a tour de force. She deserves any and all accolades she may have earned for her performance. To compare Winslett's performance with Joan Crawford's would be unfair. Both play different characters in different renditions of the story. Guy Pearce's performance is also excellent as the cynical yet honest Monty Beragon, Mildred's lover/second-husband. Beragon is the only one who has the courage to confront Mildred. Far from being a heal, Monty Beragon is symbol of the beaten-down Depression-era man who has lost everything except his name and is trying to salvage what remains of his self-esteem. He is struggling to maintain his dignity while his world is falling apart. He cares for Mildred, and for a while Mildred reciprocates as long as she can use him to satisfy her own physical needs and wish to improve her social status. The series contains explicit sex scenes which further reveal Mildred's sultry and lascivious nature and magnify the lie that she is living. She uses the facade of a rational businesswoman to hide her own social and intellectual inferiority. The only thing she has going for her is sex. She needs men to help prop up her fragile ego. Veda knows this and detests her mother's phoniness which Veda loathes. Mildred believes that everyone wants to use her when in fact it's the other way around - she's using them, shamelessly. If anyone has any doubts as to Kate Winslett's abilities as an actress, one need only to watch this series and those doubts will be dispelled.",

It really took you into the era it was portraying. Completely phenomenal.However, my gripe is with the story itself. Do not watch this movie if the darker side of humanity gets you down. This movie was not uplifting and only in an indirect way taught moral values: By witnessing how wretched selfishness and snootiness is from the outside. I finished this movie feeling pretty crummy about people in general. It could definitely make one want to never have children or get married, seeing the monster that this decent lady created, and seeing how married people cheat on one another like it's nothing.I was hoping throughout that there would be some turn-around. That the mother and the daughter would somehow reconcile. That the daughter would somehow find some wisdom from her experiences and become less of a demon. The scene where Mildred attacked her daughter after witnessing her with her husband is when I finally knew there would be no recovery from this horrible situation. It really made me sick to my stomach. And in the end, when it ended with Mildred telling her daughter she never wanted to see her again, I felt just depressed.This movie did provide me with a few good things. For example, witnessing Mildred's strength in being able to overcome all of her tragedies was inspiring. However, it also taught you that once a snake, always a snake. I didn't like this lesson, but it is undoubtedly true in this case. The only feel-good part of the story was when Mildred finally said \"to hell with her\" and came to terms with the fact that her daughter was the snake she was previously described as by that musician.I wished that someone had taught this child at a younger age to not find self-value in what you do, or what you have, but in being a decent person. And I wished she had been taught that all people are of equal worth. I felt that somehow Mildred could have turned her around and corrected her in her younger years. Letting her hang with her lover was about the worst adult influence she could have.Anyway, I'm going to try to go now and feel better about life, and hope that most people are not as horrible as some of the ones in this movie.",

The re-writers, if in fact this was actually written, as opposed to computer-generated, should be ashamed of this, and an apology to the memory of James M Cain would be appropriate.Having been lulled by an engaging beginning,suspension of disbelief is strained beyond breaking point. Two examples: having had no previous voice-training, Veda is, over the space of a couple of months, transformed into a world-class coloratura soprano; Monty, whose defining characteristic as an inveterate snob is that he despises what Glendale represents, chooses to fill the drawing-room with memorabilia of Mildred's restaurants.

Cain's Mildred Pierce is a sexy blonde who picks herself up at the end of her marriage and experiences tragedy after meeting a handsome playboy. The initial meeting between Monte Beragon (beautifully acted by Guy Pearce)and Mildred Pierce has all the sizzle of a burnt pancake. Their subsequent affair seems rather pedestrian and one itches for the fast forward during some of their scenes.The script is quite good and the supporting performances are also excellent. The director could learn pace as the series does drag along at times.The only thing that can be said for this series is that it has the length and breadth to fully explore Cain's novel and present its richness and complexity while 40s Hollywoood had to make its much shorter movie conform to the tenor of its time.",

But I really enjoyed it, and the extra length of presentation, I thought, really allowed for more in-depth character development and details of the story. I knocked off two stars from my review for two reasons. First reason, the actors.I thought Kate Winslet was every bit as good as Joan Crawford in the 1945 movie. Guy Pearce was far better than Zachary Scott in the 1945 movie. But actors who were far superior in the 1945 version were Ann Blyth as Veda, Jack Carson as Wally, and Eve Arden as Ida. Far, far better. Evan Rachel Wood came nowhere close to Ann Blyth's great performance. The second reason I took off a star was the ending. The 1945 movie was far better. It was just wonderful to see Veda not getting what she wanted and with no one able to come to her rescue. I have the novel, but have not read it yet, so I will have to see how it really ends. One more comment is about the sex scenes and nudity. I thought the ones involving Mildred were very tastefully done, and frankly quite hot at times. It was refreshing not to see her in the sexiest underwear and perfect skinny figure. Just blah white bras and slips, far more realistic. The one nudity scene which I could have done without was that of Veda parading around after she bed Monty. I felt it totally unnecessary, pointless, and even embarrassing - and I'm no prude. I felt all the episodes worth watching and I would watch again.",

I saw a commercial on HBO for this just this August and decided to watch it on Demand. I was blown away. Initially, I had no idea what the show was about but I kept watching and finished the series in two days. It's absolutely marvelous. Great film making, great acting. Kate Winslet was simply breath taking. I just absolutely fell for Winslet all over again. I am a big fan of Evan Rachael Wood, but I hated her guts in this. Nonetheless she was fantastic! I'm just stuck for words. I don't see why people say this is slow? Maybe I'm a sucker for period pieces. Anyway, I had to write a review, because I had to give this ten stars.",

            "content": "The 1931 setting was beautifully done. The actors did a good job. The storyline is a soap opera and like most soap operas, it is addictive. One definitely gets hooked into watching the whole series from the very beginning.There were some things however, that were so unrealistic, they were irksome. Illicit sex is a recurring theme in this mini series, however, not once do they ever discuss, show, or allude to any form of contraception being used. I would expect better of HBO and of a period piece. Much effort is taken to depict the 1930's, even the details of medical procedures during the hospital scene. Yet they just happened to leave out the important question of how so much sex is happening without anyone becoming pregnant, over and over again. Typical American hypocrisy.Another completely unrealistic plot twist was when Veda becomes a Prima Donna coloratura opera singer after only a couple of months of training. No previous voice training or experience. She explains that \"after a whole week of training, she 'finally' found her coloratura voice\". Wow, I didn't realize one could become a prodigy soloist after only one week to two months of training. That was so dumb, it almost made me stop watching. And it is an important part of the plot during the last two episodes.Lastly, I never could wrap my mind around how Mildred could allow her daughter to behave like such an incredible snob with no moral conscience, repeatedly. She turned into a monster really. Yet Mildred and Bert never seemed to take any responsibility for helping to make her that way.Unrealistic. Too much of this.",
