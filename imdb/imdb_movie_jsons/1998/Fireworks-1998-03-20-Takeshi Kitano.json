            "review_title": "More extraordinarily stunning cinema by Takeshi Kitano",
            "content": "Hana-bi (1997) is Japanese film maker Takeshi Kitano's masterpiece along his Sonatine (1993). Hana-bi reminds me pretty much of his more recent film, Brother (2000), which still has much more humor and positivism in it. Those who have experienced Sonatine may ask can a film be even more beautiful and brilliant, but Hana-bi is at least as masterful, if also different. The film stars again the director himself as Nishi, a police man who learns his wife suffers from some extremely lethal disease which has taken her speech, too. She is going to die soon, and all Nishi has in his mind is to make his wife's last weeks as enjoyable and nice as possible. He is forced to deal with Yakuza in order to get some money for her medical care and other plans he has for her last days, and that leads of course to troubles with the gangsters as Nishi isn't able to pay back his loans. Nishi's partner is another tragic character, who is shot and paralyzed for the rest of his life during one shoot out. Also one of Nishi's partners is shot dead in a scene, which belongs to the film's most powerful scenes and it is shown as a flashback, in the usual silent and symbolic style of the director. What follows is all the great elements we've learned to wait from this artist from one of the greatest cinema lands in the world, Japan.Hana-bi is almost unbearably sad and emotional, and its most tragic character is Horibe, the partner who is paralyzed and totally abandoned by his wife and children after he loses his ability to move and be like his used to. The scenes in which Horibe tells to Nishi about his loneliness and that everyone has left him are extremely powerful and really make think about the values of one's own life for the second time. Horibe finds some kind of way to express his sadness through art and painting, and he gets a great gift from Nishi, one of his last friends who understands him and would never leave him like the others did.The shoot out flashback is also one memorable segment in this film, and it is in its slow motion one of the most beautiful, yet shocking depictions of violence ever possible. Hana-bi has some very strong scenes of violence, and it all erupts again as rapidly as always in Takeshi's films. Weak souls resort to violence very often, and the result is always just more violence, death, depravity and pain, both physical and emotional. I will stress again that those who think Takeshi's cinema is gratuitously violent (or Japanese cinema in general, i.e. the work of Takashi Miike and Ishii) miss the whole point as his films absolutely never glorify violence or present it as a noteworthy tool; his films analyze violence and show many aspects of it, without hiding or embellishing anything. His films are as important in this level as they are in cinematic element level as some of his usual trademarks are absolutely unique and stunning, and Hana-bi is definitely not an exception.The music is again by Joe Hisaishi, who composed Takeshi's films Sonatine and Brother plus some others. The soundtrack in Hana-bi is again one key element of the film, and it is perhaps closer to Brother's than Sonatine's, but still all these three films have unique and masterful soundtrack which is full of emotions. The greatest element of all, however, in Hana-bi are the paintings by the director himself, who painted them after his nearly fatal motorcycle accident in 1994. They are stunningly beautiful and staggering as they combine different types of nature's beauty in very unique way. The animals combined with flowers are so wonderfully effective and their power is taken even further by the music. This symbolism creates so powerful experience that it almost requires the viewer to cry for the characters, but also for the cinematic magic this director has created.\nThe usual wry humor of Takeshi is almost completely missing in Hana-bi, but there are some little bits, which are still in right places and work as fine as they always do. Still, this is the most inconsolable film of Takeshi, and be sure to watch the whole film the end credits included, since there's one extremely purifying image coming, in the tradition of the finale in Brother. Despite Hana-bi being so sad and harrowing, the very end is again very relieving and belongs among the greatest endings of all time. Another film with similar ultra-powerful image at the end is Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves, another masterpiece from the 90's.I just cannot imagine loving some other film maker's work more than Takeshi's, and he is among the greatest cinematic artist I know, and it is not a surprise he's from Japan, since Asian film makers are usually the most personal and stunning and don't have any restrictions for their work like in Hollywood film makers usually have as they have to keep the ratings and commercial things in mind. Fortunately Takeshi has been able to do his films completely free, and I really hope he can continue it for many years to come. Hana-bi is his brightest masterpiece. 10/10 immortal cinema.",

            "review_title": "Great Kitano!",
            "content": "Takeshi Kitano's \"Hana-bi\" aka. \"Fireworks\" of 1997 is sad, funny, violent and melancholic and, alongside his 1989 debut \"Violent Cop\", my personal choice for his best work. Hardly ever have I seen a movie which is this memorable and unique in both its tragic and its funny moments, as it is the case with this great film.I am a big fan of director Takeshi Kitano, who also stars in the leading part (as 'Beat' Takeshi) in this, and \"Hana-bi\" is my personal favorite of his movies.Yoshitaka Nishi (Kitano) is a mostly calm, but occasionally irascible and ultra-violent cop, whose wife Miyuki (Kayoko Kishimoto) is terminally ill of leukemia. After his partner Horibe (Ren Osugi) is wounded, and another police officer is killed, Nishi decides to quit his job at the police and spend more time with his dying wife. In order to help Horibe, who is now in a wheelchair, and the dead police officer's widow, and in order to make the remaining time as comfortable as possible for his wife, Nishi, who also owes money to the Yakuza, needs money and he is determined to acquire it.Not only is Kitano a gantastic a writer and director, his acting performance in \"Hana-Bi\" is also superb. Nobody else could have played the role of Nishi with such brilliance as 'Bito' Takeshi Kitano, who rarely says a word in the first half of the film and is (nevertheless or therefore) absolutely impressive in his role of the cop with the constant poker face, which typical for Kitano. By the way, the impressionist and very original pictures which are shown occasionally throughout the movie were also painted by Kitano himself. The rest of the performances are also very good, Ren Osugi delivers a particularly memorable performance as Horibe, Nishi's partner who is struck by fate and has to live in a wheel chair, and Kayoko Kishimoto is great in the lovable role of Nishi's dying wife.Fantastic cneimatography and Kitano's typical way of patiently drawing out some scenes while showing abrupt outbursts of violence with stamina that makes them hurt as well as his unique talent for the combination of tragic and comical elements make this one of his greatest achievements. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "'Hana-bi' is one of the most impressive movies I've seen in the last ten years. Writer/director/star Beat Takeshi (Takeshi Kitano) is best known in Japan as a comedian and TV personality, so this movie is even more astonishing to outsiders like myself. Takeshi has a very laconic and charismatic screen presence, and is no slouch as a director either. It's difficult to describe the feel of this movie, and its poetic use of violence. Peckinpah's brilliant and misunderstood 'Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia' comes to mind, as does Cassavetes' 'The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie', Ferrara's 'King Of New York' and 'Bad Lieutenant'. 'Hana-bi' reminds me of those movies but Takeshi adds his own unique voice to the material. I was knocked out by it, and I cannot recommend it highly enough to movie fans who are fascinated by the relationship between art and violence. I don't think calling this movie a masterpiece is an exaggeration. Absolutely essential viewing!",

            "review_title": "A breath of fresh air. It's rare poetry -- a sentient piece with unflinching strength. MUST SEE for film appreciation buff.",
            "content": "It's lyrical poetry: sensitive, eloquent, visual, hard and soft edges simultaneously, and sparing dialog. There's no need to tell all -- all is conveyed in the paintings presented, in the words spoken by supporting characters, in facial expressions and gestures. It's minimal -- nothing's gratuitous. The story is told mostly visually, unhurried, not even a hold-up scene -- that feels leisurely, too.It's a story about a cop, miles apart from Hollywood commercial productions. The treatment writer-director Kitano delivered is unlike any seen before. The central character, Nishi, he has guts to live or to die. \"He's a darn good cop,\" Horibe his partner confirmed. (Horibe, whose poignantly restrained performance by Ren Osugi, is more than just a supporting role in the film). Nishi has two close partners: one (Tanaka) died in action and left a widow, the other crippled in action and confined to a wheelchair. His wife Miyuki (a wonderfully quiet performance from Kayoko Kishimoto) is in the hospital; she's been ill for two years; their daughter died earlier. These details are given to us through casual conversations from supporting characters and flashback memories reflecting Nishi's constantly attentive mind in spite of his mostly blank face.He's a caring man. But when he is ignited, incensed by injustice or anyone's action or words that get in his way, his reaction is the other extreme of his subdued gentleness inside: an unhesitating steady strike or continuous multiple blows, or \"emptying his bullets into a corpse.\" He has a lot of pent-up emotions ready to explode. Nishi is an honorable man; he felt responsible for the misfortunes that occurred to his two partners. Perhaps it's guilt; he has to do something to amend the situation. There are crime depictions, including Yakuza related segments. His physical reactions to thugs are unflinching to the point of brutal yet they are essentially graphic -- at times in powerful silence.He's a pensive man -- we can tell he's constantly thinking. There are occasional comic relieving pauses: we see him taking a moment and even breaking into a smile, e.g., when he beckons to play ball with the two workers on the street while at a stake out; his brief exchange with the junkyard owner was revealing. It's all paced in good measure.It's a quiet film yet strong and deep, filled with human frailties and vulnerable situations. The relationship between he and his wife is beyond words. There are little mutual gestures between the two of them -- so much is expressed silently. Sometimes it's straight to the point short questions from Nishi to his wife -- and this could be delivered to us in voice-overs. The camera gives us serene scenic landscapes: seaside view with a horizon -- waves rolling in being a repeated theme; snow scenes; a temple with a big bell and a few wandering cats. It also embraces the paintings and still lifes (e.g., a wooden puzzle game and two dessert plates on a table), giving us deliberate meaningful close-ups. In HANA-BI, silence speaks louder than effects of any kind.The film touches on aspects of life and living -- relationships of working partners, husband and wife, and being human. It's a canvas Kitano thoughtfully creatively painted on film -- broad strokes, little poignant details here and there, vibrant solid colors and imageries. Words are sparse. Simple and yet not at all simple. It could be evident that perhaps he did it all for love? His love for his wife certainly shows. Throughout the film, his face seemed void of emotions -- hardly flinches -- and in the end, possibly a flinch or two did cross his face. Perhaps he's resigned to fate?The music by Jo Hisaishi at times is reminiscent of European film scores, e.g., flowing tune following a car leisurely cruising along the seaside road at some Riviera of Italy or Southern France. It complements the story in soothing tempo from beginning to end. Kitano's \"FIREWORKS\" is in perfect cadence -- an excellent piece of film expression. A rare gem.",

            "content": "It took at least three repeat viewings of this film before I felt I was ready to review it here on IMDB. The first time I played the DVD I felt a strange sense of detachment as I tried to absorb what had been played out before me.Kitano plays a detective with huge burdens on his shoulders. His wife, Miyuki) is dying from cancer, a trusted partner & friend (Horibe) is in a wheelchair with nothing to occupy his mind other than to paint landscapes & think about suicide now that his wife & family have deserted him. And to cap it all during an undercover operation headed by Kitano a young detective (Tanaka) is mortally shot & killed because of a blunder on Kitano's part.Having been subsequently kicked out of the policeforce, Kitano has to cope not only with the loss his job (and income) but to come to terms with his guilt regarding the dead detective, Tanaka, his emotional feelings & absent love for Miyuki as she sees out her last few weeks. And finally, Kitano has a great deal of sympathy & loyalty to his former partner & friend crippled in a wheelchair.In typical Kitano fashion he decides to rob a bank, pay off his debts to the local Yakuza warlords and spend the rest of the money on his crippled friend, Horibe; Tanaka's young widow and Kitano's dying wife.Being a big fan of Kitano I wasn't disappointed by the style of the movie. His directional trademarks are visible through most of his films: flowers, beach scenes, picturesque landscapes, beautiful & haunting music (by the ever dependable Jo Hisaishi); face-to-camera shots and of course a sense of helplessness & defeatism within the lead actors themselves.But what I wasn't quite prepared for was the melodrama & pathos the film revealed to me. Unlike most of his other \"gangster/police\" movies such as Brother, Sonatine & Violent Cop, the violence seems secondary to the moving, sometimes harrowing scenes of Kitano & Miyuki holidaying together, trying to relive some of their past love & passion for each but only to find there is nothing but loss & grief.Kitano shows a great range of emotions in this film: from being a tough & very unforgiving man with his dealings with the Yakuza (the violence is sharp, sudden & very graphic). While at other times he is a man totally lost in a world of sorrow & pity, a man who finds it hard to grieve, to own up to his mistakes & guilt, a man who only now realises how much he will miss his wife after spending so many years staying away & not appreciating her needs whilst doing his job in the police.The ending is absolutely gut-wrenching, but to be honest it was of no real surprise since there are similar outcomes in most of Kitano's films, especially Violent Cop & Sonatine.The cinematography is absolutely outstanding, coupled with the haunting score of Jo Hisaishi (who also did the score for my favourite Kitano film, Sonatine). Kitano's direction is also beautifully paced with very tight editing & not a single shot is wasted.The acting as well, is top drawer. Nothing needs to be said about Kitano's performance because it is that good. But the support from Kayoko Kishimoto (Miyuki), Ren Osugi (Horibe) & Y\u00fbko Daike (Tanaka's widow) is truly excellent and never weighs the movie down with too much manufactured & false melodrama so typical of Hollywood (especially movies starring Robin Williams).As I said at the beginning of this review I had to see this film at least three times before I felt compelled to write about it, such is the power & strength within this film. Kitano's humanity is very redeeming  & reveals to our Western eyes the true values of Japanese tradition & family relationships, especially with regards loyalty, friendship, love & coming to terms with one's guilt.I recommend this film to anyone who takes an interest in movies of this kind. It may appear to drag at times, and some of the shots seems uneven & redundant on first viewing. But give it a chance because after about the second or third view more & more of the film's inner strengths will brim to the surface leaving you aghast & begging for more.*****/*****",

At a point, I unconsciously stopped worrying about those things, and started to enjoy it more. It felt less about having a conventional narrative and more about simply evoking some powerful- yet sorta hard to describe- emotions.

            "content": "Takeshi Kitano, the actor and director of Hana-bi certainly has left an imprint on Asian cinema. Managing to differ between playing brutal, yet sensitive characters to directing films centred on hard-boiled, \"cops vs. criminals\" plots. Takeshi Kitano remains one of the finest actors in cinema, most film viewers were introduced to his acting after watching Battle Royale, which has had a huge effect of his recognition. He is an actor who can bury himself deep inside a role, becoming a dark, disillusioned character and being cast as characters who are usually coming to terms with the guilt of their past. Well known for his deadpan style he has developed into an icon of modern Asian cinema.Hana-bi is the haunting, powerful, thoughtful tale of a severe police officer who retires from the force after his wife gets leukaemia and a fellow officer gets paralysed from an accident that he blames himself for. The film follows the tragedy and self-destruction in the man's life who wants to help the people he loves before it is too late. The narrative of Hana-bi is one that moves with a fairly slow grace, perfectly suiting the film's mood and structuring a detailed and enigmatically twisted plot.Hana-bi is a prime example of minimalist film-making, providing a poetic journey of self-discovery and accepting the effects of anger. Hana-bi is far from an aggressive film, even though the violence is stark, abrupt, restrained, brutal, unflinching and at times strangely beautiful in its film techniques. The literal translation of the title \"Hana-bi\" translates to fireworks, which is a metaphor for the brief explosion of life we live. The pensive feel is relaxing rather than brooding, flooded by sudden flashbacks of violence, which wonderfully grab the viewer's attention. There is also an element of dark humour paced throughout the film, which makes you laugh, but also makes you ponder the film's deep philosophical, moralistic and nihilistic imagery.The acting from the entire cast is stunningly provocative and moving, edged with the factor of such a brilliant script, yet it is a film that does not rely on language as a key factor. Few performances have moved me with such provoking and eventually challenging studies of human characteristics, emotion and psychology. The metaphorical, subliminal and emblematic cinematography is marvellous at carefully capturing some of the most unforgettable imagery in cinema. The haunting score is truly remarkable n its aching sophistication and elegance, ultimately helping define a clear atmosphere. It is undoubtedly a pessimistic film on the surface, although still being a film that holds hope under the fa\u00e7ade.Hana-bi is perfect cinema. Few films come quite as close to its breathtaking brilliance and overwhelming nature. Sublime, in every sense of the word, its beauty will knock you right out.",

            "content": "Nishi is a cop who is very good at his job but whose personal life is impacted with loss \u0096 a dead child and now a dying wife. When his partner is put in a wheelchair by a criminal and another officer is shot dead, Nishi finds himself plagued by guilt over his part in it all. Blaming himself Nishi tries to do the right thing by his partner Horibe and the widow of cop, while also trying to salvage some happiness in what remains of his time with his wife.I came back to Takeshi Kitano about the same time as I left the Movies You Should See podcast. I left it because I don't think it is as good as it could be and at times offers no real insight into a film other than describing \"bits\" however I give them a mention because they reminded me that I had only ever seen one or two of Kitano's films and that it had been some time since I had even seen those. So it was that after watching Brother, my rental site threw me Hana-Bi and I was looking forward to it due to the praise on this site and indeed the podcast itself. The expectation was not unjustified as Hana-Bi is a film of pain and beauty that is well worth seeing even if it is not the image of perfection that some would have you believe.That statement is bound to attract a low vote on IMDb but what can I tell you? That it was slow and quiet is not a problem for me but it is a feeling you get watching the film and it is not helped by some scenes feeling irrelevant within the context of the story. This is not a real killer but I felt that the slow pace needed support and seeing two minor characters argue about a fender bender (for example) saw my interest dip and the slow pace start to be felt. Otherwise though, the silence and pace suits the material and the style of the film. The violence is quite subdued (in regards what you actually see) because it occurs in the edit of the action \u0096 so the actual impact is mostly unseen. It doesn't matter though because the main thrust of the film is less the outward violence but the internal suffering of all the characters. The film does wear this aspect a little heavily at times and some will feel that some sequences are right on the edge of being pretentious and there is no point in denying that it does walk this line here and there.However for the majority it is a really well observed and emotionally engaging story built on the silent but emotive presence of Kitano as writer, director and star. As writer he has, it could be argued, left a lot to the actual making process itself since the script must have been a few pages. As director he sets the pace and I like the way his static style works within this story but it is his work as actor that always mystifies and impresses me. How he can convey so much while also appearing to be doing nothing at all I'm not sure but it somehow works and fits his style in other disciplines. He is well supported by Kishimoto, with whom he has genuine chemistry without betraying his character's nature. Osugi is not that great and it is with his character that I found the film close to being pretentious, not the actor's fault of course but I never felt for him as I did for Nishi.Hana-Bi is very slow and quiet and I can totally understand why some viewers will throw it in very early on. However sticking with it reveals a film that manages to be violent, introspective and emotionally engaging at the same time, all wrapped in the style of Kitano, who is creative across the board.",

            "content": "Takeshi Kitano's 'Hana-Bi' is something of an oddity. True to his previous efforts as director, the film contains its fair share of shockingly-graphic violence, and yet at its heart lies a touching tale of love, loyalty and devotion. For the entire running time, Kitano (who, aside from directing, also wrote and starred in the film) treads a perilously fine line between the two thematic extremes; it is an intricate balancing act that, if attempted by a less-talented filmmaker, might very possibly have turned into a complete cinematic disaster. Nevertheless, the director manages to pinpoint this perfect centre of balance, and the clash of beauty and violence combines to create a jarring amalgamation of conflicting emotional responses. We, as the audience, as simultaneously repulsed and entranced; as a whole, 'Hana-bi' is one of the most beautiful film experiences of the last decade or so.The title of the film itself acknowledges these opposing visual styles. Whilst the Japanese word 'Hanabi' translates to 'Fireworks' (the title under which it was released in the United States), the addition of the hyphen to the title ('Hana-bi') emphasises two individual components of the word, which translate respectively into \"Fire\" and \"Flower,\" the collision of destruction and beauty/renewal. Much of the film concerns a cop named Yoshitaka Nishi (Kitano), who is forced to retire after a shooting on the job leaves his partner, Horibe (Ren Osugi), paralysed, alone and confined to a wheelchair. All the while, Nishi is still coming to terms with the impending loss of his wife, Miyuki (Kayoko Kishimoto), who is slowly dying from leukemia. As any grieving husband might do in such a situation, Nishi decides to quietly rob a bank, and he then uses most of the proceeds to fund a final loving family holiday for his ailing partner.The scenes between Nishi and his wife are among the most touching I've ever witnessed. Miyuki has only two lines in the entire film, and so the couple spend most of their time in complete silence and quiet reflection, and yet you can truly sense the affection that they both have for each other. Their love is completely unspoken, and this makes it all the more touching when Miyuki does finally speak. Another touching character is Horibe, the loyal police force partner whose crippling injury leaves him alone and depressed. After attempting suicide, Horibe receives painting materials in the mail, and he commits his emotions to canvas, finally uncovering a reason for his continued existence (importantly, the artwork we see in the film was actually created by Kitano in 1994, after a near-fatal motorcycle accident). The film's phenomenally moving soundtrack was composed by renowned Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi, in his fourth collaboration with the director.There are very few negative criticisms that can be said of 'Hana-bi.' One possible item is that the film's unusual flashback structure made some plot-points difficult to follow, and I'm still unsure of which cop's lonesome widow Nishi was in the habit of visiting. However, that's the only critique that springs straight to mind. All in all, 'Hana-bi' is a gloriously assorted blend of violence, love and gentle humour, and a first viewing is not likely to be forgotten in a hurry.",

Music is by Joe Hisaishi and cinematography by Hideo Yamamoto.Yoshikata Nishi (Kitano) is a loose cannon police detective who quits the force after a tragic incident results in his partner, Horibe (Osugi), being confined to a wheelchair. His retirement brings him the time to care more for his seriously ill wife Miyuki (Kishimoto). Nishi can find no peace, though, more so as he has borrowed money from the Yakuza to pay for his wife's needs, and they are growing impatient for the repayment...Very early in Kitano's superb slice of Japanese neo-noir there is a piece of graffiti on the wall, it says \"Drop Dead\", while Hisaishi's music is a devilish accompaniment to the scene. It's ominous and foreboding, setting the tone for what is to follow. Pic is deliberately paced, beautifully so, with the opening nonlinear approach and scattergun shifts in time adding a sort of psychological maelstrom to the impending narrative darkness.Yet to suggest it as a perpetually bleak picture is doing it a small disservice, for Kitano (himself working from a damaged psyche that occurred in real life) has this adroit eye for poetic beauty and human tenderness that marries up with bursts of violence and emotionally shattering passages of play. And it works brilliantly, with stabs of humour also filtering in via the outer frames. Nishi the character is a force of nature and a walking - brooding - contradiction, a man pained behind his sunglasses, his expressionless visage amazingly still saying so much. When he explodes the impact is doubly strong, mainly because dialogue is so sparse, but the interwoven visuals - very much a Kitano speciality - strike an almighty chord for the story. To which we edge towards the finale, which unsurprisingly brings beauty and infinite sadness.Unfussy camera work, sabre sharp editing (Kitano & Yoshinori Oota), elegiacal musical arrangements, art, kites and Kitano's intense performance, this rounds out as film making greatness.

Good art is a communication from a transcendent place through a person or group with the skills to deliver it coherently. This is rare enough. All good craftsmen think they are artists and sell themselves that way.This film is a work of art. Yes, quirky. Yes, some elements are clumsy. He has some paintings he wants us to see, so he shoehorns in a suicidal painter. He needs a suicidal painter, so he...But we tolerate these misfits because the nature of the story follows the Japanese gangster movie convention of being a bunch of borrowed quotes from elsewhere. Borrowing these from Takeshi's artistic world is as fair as from the pop vocabulary. All these projects reference the outside.So this is good art. It resonates. I recommend you look at it.But the second challenge with art is deciding how to relate to it, to use it to build your mind, to work and extend your imagination. You are what you eat artistically. I cannot eat this. No, it is not the violence. Violence in film is merely cinematic tension, to be used like smoke. It is the world that matters. Art is a gateway to a world and you have to be disposed to the target: can you use it? Will it help?What's wrong here is that this the flip side of noir. Noir defines a world of random pain, animated by some conspiracy between the viewer and a disembodied fate. But it comes from an intent of humorous exploration, capricious hazard but hazard for mischief, not deliberate pain. Its the deliberate pain we get here, the incessant grinding of the human spirit, and incidentally some valiant tolerance, but only incidentally.If I clove this into my mind, I would be another half step closer to suicide myself. So watch it... from a distance.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

            "content": "\"Hana-Bi\" is well-known as being Kitano's most critically acclaimed and iconic film to date, and with good reason. Despite a backlog of excellent films (\"Violent Cop\", \"Sonatine\", \"A Scene By The Sea\", etc), the reason \"Hana-Bi\" stands out as arguably the finest is that it so beautifully captures a personal time in Kitano's life and blends some of the more eloquent features of his persona not heavily represented in his other works. That title alone; \"Hana-Bi\" (In Japanese, combining 'fireworks' with 'sunflower') represents an almost poetic change in Kitano cinema, conveying a combination of sub-meanings and representations making the film strongly multi-layered with many possibilities for interpretation.Kitano gives one of the best performances in his career as Nishi, the hardened cop looking after his dieing wife. Despite his stone-cold exterior and tendencies to explode in a violent rage, he is nonetheless a weak, broken, and tired man, haunted by some colleague's recent deaths and injuries and daunted by his wife's nearing death. Kitano is able to convey such an emotional stretch with sincerity, making this 'man of few words' one who the audience nevertheless bonds with throughout the film.The supporting players are excellent. Kitano regulars; Susumu Terajima and Ren Osugi give exceptional performances as troubled men in an emotionally crumbling world. Osugi, in particular, plays the disabled Detective Horibe with such intensity and unfathomable depth. The numerous scenes of Horibe seated infront of Kitano's token sea-view, staring silently with Joe Hisaishi's fantastic score soaring over the top conveys more emotion and moves the audience to tears in a way words never could. It is this which makes Kitano such an incredible director, of not just Japan, but contemporary cinema as well. His dialogue is irregular, yet powerful, and his distinctive taste of visual style combined with beautiful music and emotionally rich characters creates further emotional intensity within film, powerful cinema which is undoubtedly absent in recent Hollywood works.I have read that Kitano films are an acquired audience taste, and not suited to everyone. That maybe true with more shocking films such as \"Violent Cop\", but if you've not yet experienced the undeniable magic of a Kitano film, where better to start than the very best? It is certainly a film which needs to be viewed many times, as although the first time will leave you stunned, watching the film further allows you to notice more subtle qualities, as well as experience the film again.In closing, I hope that wider audiences will experience the power of Kitano's work, and in particular, \"Hana-Bi\" It is a film unlike any other you will see, and no review can do it justice. You must see it for yourselves.",

            "review_title": "Great concept, but lacking authenticity",
            "content": "I liked the concept of this film, which turns the yakuza genre sideways by focusing on emotional trauma and grief instead of action. When the violence comes it's in brief bursts followed by long intervals, which allows the impact to seep into us. The film oozes melancholy and brooding, but somehow I never felt the emotional devastation that I knew I supposed to be feeling. The cop who has lost a child, has a terminally ill wife, and then watches his partners die or be crippled is at the end of his rope, but because he has nothing left to lose, he's stronger as a result. He impassively stares down the yakuza and if any get out of line with him, he does things like put a chopstick through their eye at lightning speed. We see that his priorities are his wife and his friend, and that he'll invert morality to support them, which is all pretty interesting stuff.It was hard to connect emotionally to this film, probably because his relationship with his wife is shown with moments that have all the authenticity and appeal of a television commercial. The soundtrack is similarly shallow, and pace is a problem too, with the emphasis shifting so heavily to moments of inaction. His partner dabbles in art to pass the time after being forced to retire, producing mostly mediocre surreal and pointillist paintings which are oddly given quite a bit of screen time, which seemed a self-indulgence of director/writer/star/artist Takeshi Kitano. The ending itself was strong, but mostly I was disappointed by this one.",

He is a cop, he fights crime, he lives among criminals, he reacts violently because of his profession, and because of the people he needs to deal with, but all this tough behavior hides immense suffering and infinite love. It's not an easy film to watch, and effort is required from the viewer to understand the story. Not only are not narrative rules respected, but the logic of the film lies more in the emotions of the main character, with the temporal plan interleaved with flashbacks that eventually put everything in place, and with elements of plastic art, in a very Japanese way.Director and lead actor Takeshi Kitano have already made us face some of the other tough cops or stone faced samurais. What is different in this 1997 film, maybe his best, is that behind the mask of toughness and violence we discover the human tragedy of a father having lost his only child, and a husband close to losing his wife to a non-curable illness. He will do everything to protect her, to create a wall of protecting love away from the cold winds of the furious world around, and this is the beautiful meaning of this astonishing film, which is after all also, beautifully and incredibly, a love story.",

Takeshi's acting is wooden, lifeless, emotionless, and the same can be said of his relationship with his wife that he's supposed to love and really (no seriously) care about!. The plot is non-existent, the movie is bizarrely edited so that you can't tell what's happening now and what is a flashback. The main character's occupation is uncertain throughout and he's always followed by some secondary characters everywhere he goes for unexplained reasons.\nMy biggest gripe is that this movie suffers horribly from \"tell don't show\"! Characters blatantly spout exposition at each other and it seems very amateurish! We find out that yakuza toughs are part of yakuza because they say \"You know how we yakuza are\", we find out that a guy's wife and daughter have left him because he says that to a different character with a blank, talent-less face when that character presumably ALREADY KNEW that and he's only talking for the benefit of the audience!\nThere are numerous scenes where nothing happens for a long time, for no reason. To give 2 examples, we stare for 20% of the movie at Takeshi's blank, un-moving face and at the end we're treated to a 5 minutes scene where a girl is trying to fly a kite. Just her, running back and forth with some very exciting music in the background!\nIn conclusion, I have NEVER seen such levels of not understanding basic film making techniques and amateurism.

Unfortunately, during the many thoughtful interludes the viewer is left to ponder about the recent scenes just watched and many questions surface and annoy.For example, why didn't the wheelchair guy drown in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and the tide came up around him?  There was no rescue seen or hinted at.Can it be true that Japanese police are so inept and unskilled at arrest procedures as to not first remove the suspect's ability to reach for a weapon?  These detective-level Japanese police seemed to have no experience dealing with a suspect.Why doesn't the right eye of the lead character blink?  Having one eye blinking was distracting and it went unexplained.What exactly was the lead character spending all his money on to have to borrow so much from loan sharks?  He was not seen gambling.  Being a non entry-level government employee his wife must have had full health insurance.What was the single man doing all by himself in the middle of nowhere in the nature park?  What was his reason for being there?How in the world could the gangsters find the lead character and his wife up in the far off nature reserve?  It made no sense.And again, how could the gangsters later find the lead character and his wife up in the remote Mt. Fuji resort?  There were absolutely no clues available for these gangsters to even know which country the lead character and his wife were in, let alone the correct specific location at the correct specific time!And a third same question, how could the junior detectives know which few feet of the Japanese coast line to find the lead character and his wife? The Japanese coast line must be vast.  Were all of these characters supposed to have psychic powers?Two final questions: The cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach -- WHERE did she come from?  She seemed to have no transportation or companions with her.  And why in the world did she still keep attempting to fly what was left of her kite after it was ripped in pieces?!  This was weird. Unintentionally Python-esque.On the positive side, I loved the background music.  It was dramatic and flowing and added much to this movie.  The photography, imagery and art were pleasing to the eye.One final point, the wife was overly pleasing to the eye.  Not once did she ever come close to looking like a dying sick person.  She looked very healthy.  If anything, these people seemed depressed and mentally ill and not physically sick.  The husband treated his wife as perhaps a newly outed gay man would treat a respected wife... a love of friendship, but not close tenderness.A mixed movie for sure.",

I suppose there are some very deep subtextual interpretations to this work, but to me it's about a man who is very violent in his work, but very tender towards his wife.

It's just right.I'll give you one example. In one scene, we see a violent shootout in a crowded mall. Aside from the gunshots, the scene is completely silent. There are no stupid, hysterical people waving their arms and running about. And while there is a lot of blood, it's not shoved in our faces--a lot of it is handled off-camera. To me, this lets the scene speak for itself with no distractions. It's one of my favourite \"shootout\" scenes of all time.Takeshi Kitano is an amazing, visionary director. After seeing this movie, I went on to see all of his other work. It's surprising how he can switch from violence to comedy to art to \"chick flick\" on a dime. I believe HANA-BI is a great blend of all his talents.By the way, I should mention that he is a painter, and he painted all the images used in this film. So, around midway, when you see several minutes of paintings, you must realize that it's not random. It all fits in to the director's vision. And (here's a secret... don't tell too many people) stick around after the credits. There are more paintings. Perhaps even a hidden message? I dunno.I rate this movie an 8/10. It lost points only because in comparison I liked his other films DOLLS and KIKUJIRO slightly more. But definitely I think Takeshi Kitano is da bomb. Enjoy.",

Instead of the loquacious, witty character he played in the former film, the audience is instead presented with the stony, taciturn Nishi who could give a blank piece of slate a run for its money for a deadpan expression. Not knowing quite what to expect and having the whimsical images of Kikujiro still in my head, I was a bit disappointed with the film when I watched it the first time, but after repeated viewings and having viewed most films in which he has directed and/or acted has given me a greater appreciation of the film which many still consider Kitano's masterpiece.A very quiet and sometimes brutal man, Nishi works alongside his partner Horibe to keep crime, yakuza, down in the streets of Tokyo. If this job was not stressful enough, Nishi has also recently suffered the loss of his daughter and his wife has been diagnosed with leukemia. In order to make ends meet and to pay his wife's increasing hospital bills Nishi is forced to borrow money from the yakuza who he is supposed to be keeping off the street. However, unlike most who are in dept to the yakuza, Nishi is unafraid of those who he is in debt to and even goes as far as to pierce the eye of one yakuza with a pair of chopsticks. With his stoic nature it seems that Nishi is willing to endure his life's situation for as long as it takes. However, one-day Nishi's world is turned upside down.While on a stakeout with Horibe and two other policemen named Tanaka and Nakamura Horibe suggests that Nishi go to the hospital to check on his wife. Refusing to do so at first, Nishi eventually goes after Horibe has egged him on enough. However, while at the hospital Nishi learns that Horibe has been gunned down by a yakuza. Later, while stalking the yakuza gunman, Tanaka gets killed and Nakamura is injured. With his rage beyond boiling point, Nishi empties his gun into the body of the gunman. Losing his career as a cop, Nishi decides to make amends with his former coworkers and their families, but his methods are far from normal.Beautifully scored by Hisaishi Joe, Hana-bi is a bifurcated film depicting the life of Nishi, and his wife, and that of Horibe. While healthy in body, Nishi seeks the solace of death because all has either already taken away from him or is soon to be taken away from him. Horibe, on the other hand, while having been abandoned by his wife and child because of his injury that made him into a paraplegic, seeks life through other things such as art and the beauty of nature. Also, some of the most beautiful moments of this film occur between Nishi and his wife Miyuki. While nearly completely silent, the two characters are able to share and experience their feelings for each other just by being in close proximity. Such scenes make the hard as steel Nishi look a bit softer, just don't say anything about his wife's flowers",

The protagonist violently avenges his colleagues' fates and is then forced to retire from police work. Coping with remorse, he robs a bank to offer money to the widow of his deceased colleague and expensive materials for his suicidal crippled colleague who manages to find a new purpose in life in painting surrealistic works of art. The protagonist uses the rest of the money to pay off some yakuza loan sharks and pay for his wife's medical fees who suffers physically from leukemia and mentally from the death of their child in the past. The protagonist undertakes a trip with his wife visiting numerous monuments in Japan but he is bothered by greedy yakuza who want to steal what's left of his booty and police officers including the surviving former colleague who has figured out that it was the protagonist who robbed the bank.The thing I admire about this film is the beauty that can be found in darkness. The crippled police officer is abandoned by his wife and child but manages to find beauty in nature and crafts wonderful surrealistic works of art that were actually created by actor, director and writer Kitano Takeshi himself. The protagonist's wife is quiet and sad throughout most parts of the movie due to her terrible disease and the loss of her child but on their trip through Japan, she opens up, manages to smile again and shows genuine affection for her husband. The protagonist who was about to give everything up after the routine mission gone wrong finds the purpose to make people around him happier which rekindles his own will to live.Hana-bi beautifully mixes thoughtful dialogues, surreal imagery and appeasing landscapes on one side with gloomy flashbacks, intense action scenes and brooding tension on the other side. This combination is perfectly balanced which keeps the movie equally entertaining and profound. The closing scene must be pointed out as being quite revolting while still being slightly ambiguous. It certainly offers some food for thought and will be remembered for a very long time once you have watched it.Kitano Takeshi's Hana-bi is a film that will equally appeal to more sophisticated audiences who are looking for a profound drama that offers some food for thought and to fans of intense yakuza flicks that the director shot in the early stages of his directing career. FRom this point of view, Hana-bi might be the film that summarizes Kitano Takeshi's long career best. The film deserves its international acclaim as it showcases Kitano Takeshi's numerous talents without getting pretentious. The facts that the actor's own painting were used in the film and that he had been through a life-threatening experience himself just a few years before this movie was released make Hana-bi his most personal movie as well.",

Kitano is supposedly known for his violence, but this movie has more to do about the repercussion of violence--and about life and death in general--than showing actual violent scenes. The violence is there, bursts of explosive violence, but it is short and strategically edited.Nishi, the protagonist, sees his partners die or get injured in the line of duty. One of them, Horibe, becomes wheel-chair-bound. His wife leaves him and he contemplates life and death staring at the horizon beyond the sea. He starts to paint to express himself and save himself from boredom and sorrow. Nishi, sick of his work leaves the police force to spend some time with his dying wife. The doctor just released her from the hospital and she does not have much time left...Kitano chooses to focus on the underlying emotions rather than dialogue as most of the scenes with his wife are silent. At first, this is unnerving, but slowly, as the movie progress, we understand that there is nothing left to stay.The score of the movie is its strongest point. Accomplished composer, Joe Hisaishi (who worked with Kitano on other projects as well as with Miyazaki's animated films) outdoes himself with poignant classical music that, unlike Nishi, speaks volume. He would win the Award of the Japanese Academy for this.Some good cinematography can also be observed at times. Kitano's paintings are interesting and vibrant. They add yet another level of complexity to this intriguing piece of film. All in all, a very well made film.",

His narrow-angled attitude towards the substance of the film makes Fireworks a truly sombre and depressing little Japanese gem. Kitano highlights his insanely mad attention to details through blending the unusual crime thriller with melodramatical conversation-filled unformulaic romance. Fireworks isn't only an angry film, it's also a deeply passionate one. In all the blood and brutality that unnerves sometimes, the film presents a love story where a good-gone-bad cop tries to care for his wife and, simultaneously, begins to plunge deeper and deeper into madness, which might ultimately lead to horrible results.",

The narrative is non-linear and the story's structure is constantly prey to the emotions of the cop.'Beat' Takeshi is both the star as well as the director of this acclaimed Japanese film. He is a very gentle and emotionally repressed man who doesn't talk much. However, he is capable of great bursts of violence and rage which make him a force to reckon with. He has a sick wife who is dying. During a routine raid, his best friend and partner asks him to go check on his wife. In the interim, one of the cops was killed and his partner crippled for life. The guilt that this unleashes only increases his sense of responsibility. He plans a single-handed bank robbery to take care of his friend and show his wife some happy memories. He also mixes with the yakuza and borrows money from them.So you see, a lot is going on in his life. Yet what sticks in the mind are the quiet moments - the sea lapping up to the shore, the snow on the trip with his wife, the junkyard where he buys his getaway car. The violence of the cop Nishi's life is not as central to his life as his real problems, responsibilities and the emotions surrounding them. Those looking for a Heat or The Departed will be disappointed by this unique and refreshing look at the life of a cop, a life where extraneous responsibilities and emotions carry greater significance.",

What haunted me then and still do is the the still breeze that you encounter at a sunset sitting on some cliffs, close by the sea. That feeling of a greater perception, or strengthened senses that you sometimes get in those moments. When you somehow are almost able to touch the essence of life. Odd facts about the movie first; all the paintings in the movie were made by Kitano himself. If You feel that Kitano look somewhat odd in his right half of his face you're right. According to an interview with him, he had just crashed with a motorcycle, and been treated for it on a hospital. The result is that his nerves in the face were somehow damaged so that he for instance had to wipe his right eye again again since it continued to fill up with tears fluid. I know that the above is a weird intro to a movie with the following resume, but have a look at it;Nishi is an old tough fox of a detective in metropolitan Tokyo. His personal life is in a turmoil though, since he has recently lost a child and his beloved wife has been diagnosed with fatal leukemia. This has already driven him into the hands of Yakuza, from which he has taken a loan to pay the hospital . To make things worse his long time partner gets shot and thereby handicapped, while fulfilling a surveillance job on Nishis behalf, in order to make it possible for Nishi to visit his wife. Another policeman gets shot while he and Nishi is trying to catch the killer. For all this Nishi feels deeply responsible and set him on the track to figure out some way to solve it all. The imagery is deliberately composed to be permeated with stillness, often presented with the characters shot a frontal shot, doing nothing. Then suddenly there is a burst of action followed by other still imagery. Its as if we travel through a gallery of pictures.The editing itself puts no point to being continuous but rather present each individual image as a whole (Deleuze) which in turn make the plot not very linear. The distinctive cutting however never leaves the audience with a feeling of discontent, even though it sometimes takes some figuring when what is happening. The stillness however permits this reflexion and more of it. Dialogue is very sparse and is almost always performed by others than Nishi. Sound itself is treated to heighten the reality in some places. Finally an oddball; the music renders the movie a feeling of some American 70 police movie which is odd if u consider the above.Finally a comment; I doubt you ever regret having seen this movie.",

            "content": "'Fireworks (1997)' is an odd beast. It's a purposeful mix between the cripplingly mundane and the explosively violent. Its brutality almost literally interrupts its narrative at times; even when you expect it, it still manages to startle (much like the firework that the protagonist lights around midway through the movie). It's sometimes effectively affecting, its quietly contemplative tone providing a handful of truly touching moments, but it's equally as often bafflingly slow. By presenting things slightly out of order and continuously cutting to a character who ultimately isn't all that relevant to the main plot (though the plot is arguably secondary to the film's deliberately two-handed effect), the piece keeps you at an arms length from its narrative. At the same time, though, it almost plays out like a sort of poem. Its effect is palpable and distinct, even if it does mean that quite a lot of the picture is a bit, dare I say, dull. Well, 'dull' is the wrong word, really; I just mean that it isn't as straightforwardly entertaining as you may expect given that it concerns cops and criminals. The more important part of the piece is certainly its methodical deliberation on illness and grief. The relationship between its protagonist and his wife is simple but sweet, which is perhaps surprising considering that neither of them say all that much. It's also rather tragic overall. The poignancy of the piece is certainly one of its strongest aspects. In the end, the film is difficult to rate. It isn't the most enjoyable in-the-moment experience, even though some of its sequences are genuinely compelling, but it certainly has an impact. It's growing on me, that's for sure. In fact, the further away I get from it, the more I like it. It's an odd but palpable effect that I'm having a little trouble accurately conveying. 6/10.",

I suppose it's usual for police films to show some of the officers' home lives, bringing out the tension between their domestic and working worlds. Unusually, Hana-Bi foregrounds the domestic life of its main protagonist, a retired cop with some unfinished business, which involves the terminal illness of his wife. The tone of the film is thus more melancholic than tense. Kayoko Kishimoto, as the sick woman, gives a nicely understated performance. Beat Takeshi underplays his lead role to a greater extent, which may be the main strength of the film. Their life is contrasted with that of Takeshi's colleague, also facing private grief, though this contrast doesn't add enough. More importantly, the shifts between the violent world of loan-sharking and the sad, loyal marriage are hard to swallow. It seems implied as the film ends that Takeshi's character has values looking back to the Samurai. I'm no expert on these values, but was only partly convinced.",

Takes is a multi faceted artist and has created some of the truly great films of the last twenty years and certainly some of the finest recent Japanese of which this is a marvellous example.

Very somber, very melodramatic, very slow and silent (especially one \"robbery\" scene) ... just to go completely nuts in a split second. Sometimes with sound, sometimes without.

We also feel it in the comradeship that unites the policemen to one another.

It was upon a recommendation of a friend that I went to watch it (and guess what, my friend didn't have the opportunity to do so!), and since then I was curious about his movies, albeit the more violent ones.Hana-Bi is in this tradition of Kitano movies, either him playing a cop, or swinging on the side of the gangsters. Here, he stars as detective Nishi, a tough-as-nails no nonsense cop who lets his fists do the talking right from the start of the movie. However, his tough exterior is but a shell covering his soft hearted interior, and this is portrayed so well throughout his non-verbal interactions with his lovely wife.And that, in fact, is the crux of the movie, violence notwithstanding. Between his cop buddy and his wife, it is obvious where should one's priority lie. But being the cop devoted to duty as well, Nishi has to be persuaded by his cop buddy to look after his ailing wife instead. Needless to say, things go wrong during the stakeout, and Nishi inevitably feels responsible.Winner of multiple film festival awards including the Golden Lion at the 1997 Venice Film Festival, we follow Nishi in his one man crusade, and the narrative style is distinctively Takeshi. With flashbacks and the non linear narrative presented as a matter of fact, these are but some of the numerous classic moments in the movie, along with his editing style and facial closeups which shows his slight twitches now and then.Nishi is a cop whose bite is very much worse than his bark, given that he doesn't speak much to begin with. And the violence being so in-your-face, it's a wonder how Takeshi could balance stoic silent moments, with noisy action, all in one movie. As the story progresses, we see how his single-minded devotion to his wife made him go against all odds just to spend some quality time with her, though somehow, in a weird sense, those scenes didn't manage to do much for me. Instead I was reminded of the beach scene in his latest movie Takeshis, because of the lust to see blood on screen, and I think that particular scene is a knock on the head for people like me, who always yearn for more blood.This movie also allowed Takeshi to showcase his paintings, and they are beautiful to look at. It's very humbling to think that Takeshi is one heck of a talented person, being able to act, direct, produce, write, paint, edit, is versed in drama, action, comedy, the list goes on. And it's no wonder that for this screening, and the one after, there is a long queue snaking just to get (free) tickets, and those patient enough to be on the waiting list, mulling along the museum hallway just crossing their fingers to gain entry.",

Introducing the film as \"Vol. 7\" gives the impression of an important seventh chapter in a body of work, and so it would prove to be - winning his most prestigious award - and a sparse opening credits that give a significant reference to Hisaishi's soundtrack.Yes, there's something very meta about the opening shots of \"Hana-bi\"; shots that would be a key feature throughout the film. So, having set it up to be his masterpiece, did he deliver? Well, yes. This is the culmination of many of the elements that Kitano had been developing in his films, finally mastered and perfected. But, much like the film's holiday destination, \"Hana-bi\" is the peak his directorial career was rising to, never to be reached again.Nishi (Kitano) and Horibe (Ren Osugi) are battle-weary detectives that have been through it all together. They are called to a stakeout of a murder suspect, however, being that it is near the hospital where Nishi's sick wife (Kayoko Kishimoto) is staying, Horibe suggests his partner pay her a visit. Younger detectives Nakamura (Susumu Terajima) and Tanaka (Makoto Ashikawa) are unwilling or unable to stay with Horibe for the job, leaving him alone. And so, while visiting his wife, Nishi is delivered the news that Horibe has been shot - and eventually paralysed - by the suspect. We later learn that, overeager to make up for leaving his partner alone, Nishi retaliates resulting in Nakamura injured and Tanaka and the suspect dead.What is left is Horibe in a wheelchair, his wife and daughter having left him; Nakamura in recovery, needing a new partner; Tanaka's widow (Yuko Daike) struggling to support her young son; Nishi's wife terminally ill with little hope for her health; and Nishi himself without a job or purpose due to his actions. Responsible for the situation all those around him have been left in, Nishi's new purpose is payback for the suffering he has caused at the ultimate price.\"Hana-bi\", therefore, is a film about atonement and wanting to tie-up all loose ends before passing on. While many of the themes of his career are featured here, there is much more purpose to them. \"Violent Cop\" and \"Boiling Point\" were largely violence for violence's sake; while \"Sonatine\" tried to make it art. Though, following on from \"Kids Return\", there is more of a personal approach on show here and more emotion.Indeed, his previous film and the next, \"Kikujiro\", would form something of an \"Angel\" trilogy, with the imagery of angels placed throughout three of his most personal films. The other two would prove semi-autobiographical and a somewhat-tribute to his father, but \"Hana-bi\" introduces another element which would start to pop-up in Kitano's cinema: his own art. Featuring countless paintings he did while in recovery from his motorbike accident, the abstract pieces - supposedly done by Horibe as he recovers himself - pose more questions than they give answers, but are certainly thought-provoking and give a real depth to the work, particularly in combination with the soundtrack.These shots take up a significant portion of the film, and so introducing his art in this way was a risk in how the film would be taken. But indeed, the paintings and Hisaishi's soundtrack become arguably the best of the many partnerships featured. They are as important as any character and the lasting memories of the film, showing how Hisaishi's compositions are the perfect accompaniment to any non-live action cinema; bettering his efforts for Hayao Miyazaki.Previously Kitano had tried to make art of violence, but here he puts the two side-by-side, with the film's specifically-written title showing the duality Kitano has worked into his films. While \"hanabi\" translates as fireworks, a motif of the film, the purposeful Roman alphabet with hyphen separates the two halves of the composite word to \"flower\" (\"hana\") and \"fire\" (\"bi\" or \"hi\"). Kitano wants the two opposing ideas to have equal merit in his work as the art of the flower and the violence of the fire merge.The artwork features many images of animals with parts of their bodies replaced by flowers. Horibe, having violently lost the use of his legs, now needs something to replace his ability to walk and work. The blooming flowers are that new part of him. Nishi too needs to replace that which has been lost violently, seeking to give Horibe the gift of art, Tanaka's widow financial support and his wife one last memory. Out of the explosion of violence, flowers will bloom.This adds new depth to many of the Kitano staples. The hierarchical structure that features shows how Nishi feels the need to take personal responsibility for the lives of his younger subordinates in ensuring they are repaid for their losses. And the standard suicidal ending is less out of madness, but more out of taking the situation into your own hands to allow yourself to rest peacefully.Despite the heightened emotion, this also has some of Kitano's funniest moments, with his last trip with his wife full of gentle humour, both effective and affective. Various visual gags as they try to take photos and play games leave you unable to help but fall for their charms, as well as many bursts of Tetsu Watanabe's junkyard owner keep a good balance between the serious and the light-hearted.Self-edited again, the editing is also a masterwork from Kitano, not only for his standard use of cut-aways for visual gags and the result of violence. As the camera focuses on Nishi's face as he talks to the victims of his actions, the key scene plays back in his mind, until finally, while staring after a blaring police car at the junkyard, the full nature of his crimes is revealed. Nishi cannot escape what he has done and continually relives it, and Kitano portrays this brilliantly. There is also the use of some Ozu-esque \"pillow shots\", with particular focus on a puzzle Nishi and his wife work on throughout their journey, ending once complete.Criticisms are that female characters are again given short shrift, largely nameless with little in the way of a voice. Nishi's wife is referred to only in those terms and she only really speaks in giving the film its final line, though a key one, but serves simply for her to assuage his guilt so he can die in peace. A life of servitude awaits any Kitano female character. Nishi himself is also a typical Kitano role he gives himself: a man of few words or expressions who knows how to erupt into violence when he needs to. But these criticisms are minor, and perhaps more necessary than lazy in the context of the film.\"Hana-bi\" is a film that made me consider cinema differently and turned me fully on to Japanese cinema. And, while many won't regard this as one of the greatest, it scooped a big award and represents some masterful filmmaking and a key film of the Japanese new wave of the Nineties. It certainly is something to attract a younger generation to Japanese cinema who missed out on the era of the Japanese masters of the Forties-Sixties and a film that helped regain its place globally.I bought this on VHS for myself on my eighteenth birthday, and so its timing is perhaps important in my fondness for this film. And, much like Nishi, these are images that will stay with me.Politic1983.home.blog.",

            "content": "Sonatine and Hana-bi were the second and third Kitano movies I had the pleasure to see (the first one was Brother), in a small movie theater. In my opinion, Brother is fine. Sonatine, a masterwork. And Hana-bi, a cornerstone of the seventh art. With Hana-bi, Kitano pushes the envelope of his art and refines his famous trademarks we know mostly from Sonatine. The mime acting of Kitano himself and of Kayoko Kishimoto are accurate. The photography is gorgeous, with many shots looking like powerful portraits, sometimes reinforced by well-selected camera movements. The way the past and the thoughts of the characters are revealed feel sometimes so natural, it is just like if the spectator were on the terrain, not in front of a screen; quite often, the order of the scenes is structured as Nishi's thought, involving even more the spectator in the movie. Hisaishi's music is glamorous and only appears when setting music makes sense (unlike too many films). And obviously, as always in Kitano movies but especially here in Hana-bi, the violence bursts are perfectly inserted, realistic (there's no plot twist to \"save the hero\") and consistent with the plot. Overall, Hana-bi is a fine melt of cinema and poetry: it is minimalistic, personal, direct and amazingly beautiful.",

This movie is different from all other movies I have seen, and it is really really good. There is hardly any dialogue in the movie. All is being explained through facial expression and visual pictures and once you see that, you understand how great this movie is. The main character may seem like a violent person, but when you see him with his wife he is probably the most sensitive guy out there.

Kitano's films like Violent Cop, and Sonatine, have never been released here theatrically, though Kids Return was screened on SBS - Australia's only multicultural channel. Violent Cop, while good, in no way prepares one for the power of Hana-bi. It is one of the most magnificent studies in loneliness, and alienation I've ever seen. There's hardly any dialogue - it's not needed, as everything that needs to be said, is communicated through looks and body language. More than that, the visual imagery is breathtaking.

Riddled with the melodrama that inhibits his films I could see how many people (especially those with no appreciation for art, pacing and Human element) may very well be turned off, but to me this film was one of the single most beautiful things I have ever had the privilege to view. The simple underlying message here is humanity, and just how fragile life really is... and just how love is a many splendored thing. What Kitano does all for the love of his dying wife, while being haunted by the guilt of his partners becoming an invalid is to me what true love is all about. Sure, it may be hard at times and even when your back is up against the wall and it seems there is no way out, so you may feel the need to throw in the towel... but perhaps there is always a better way, right or wrong. That's what this film is all about. Aside from that the cast is comprised of the usual suspects from Office Kitano so you can be sure that they click on screen. The film showcases much of Beats own simplistic and childlike artwork as well, and while he may never be heralded and taught in a art college he sure as hell has more soul in his pastel heavy mangaesque artwork than most of the artists they teach in school systems. Overall I give it a definite 10, the ending alone was worth that... painful as it was, it was love, and as many of us know love can really hurt sometimes. Highly recommended.",

But it's not because he kills them, it's because life is crappy and his friends and family either die stupidly and unexpectedly or get terminally sick. In the end, he will do whatever he can to make the last moments of his wife as happy as possible and make right by the people he loves, while the yakuza and his old police colleagues are trying to stop him. Of course, this movie is a depressing one, but it is also about putting aside the inhibitions of society and doing what you think it's right. In a calm and real way, he is just as much a hero as Neo, maybe more, since he does this in the world we live in, where there is no escape from reality. The beat of the movie (little pun, I couldn't help it) is slow and the average user could get a little bored with the 100 minutes of the movie, but this is good for the viewer that wants to think a little about what he is seeing or notice the details. For example the wounded partner of Takeshi Kitano's character, paralyzed from the waist down, starts painting and the results are not only nice, but also deep in meaning.

            "content": "FIREWORKS / HANA-BI (HANABI). Viewed on Streaming. Director Takeshi Kitano's mash up of flowers (hana)--literally and figuratively--and fires (bi)--violence--is sparse on dialog (especially the character-developing kind), but rich on images as a police vs. yakuza melodrama with bits of comedy, a rekindled romance, and terminal sadness. Kitano is also the writer, picture painter, co-editor, and lead actor). The Director plays a character with a bipolar disorder that alternates (usually abruptly) between serenity (almost sweetness) and brutality (which yakuza fear). Recently separated from the police force after a yakuza shoot-up that left several detectives dead or seriously injured (for which he is blamed), Kitano borrows money from yakuza to pay his dying wife's medical bills, single handedly carries off a daring bank heist, pays off his loan, and flees with his wife on a one-way, memory-lane trip to scenic sites with yakuza (trying to get the bank loot) and former police colleagues (trying to get Kitano and the money) in pursuit. The Director compares actions of the police with those of yakuza, making the point that the behavior of both groups is pretty similar when it comes to acts of violence. Kitano over doses on the therapeutic impact of painting, but the many surrealistic transformation of flowers into animal forms on canvas are fascinating (and really play a co-staring role!). The Director's style takes some getting used to, and early on is often just too languid (the camera also lingers on after the actors have left the frame) between spikes of violence. But persistent and patience will payoff. Overall, actors deliver fine performances, and characters played by Kitano (with and without sunglasses), Kayoko Kishimoto, and Tetsu Watanabe are especially enjoyable. Cinematography (semi-widescreen, color) is stunning and artifact free (but a bit on the static side). Editing is crisp, although flashbacks could benefit from adding more clues when transitions from present to past occur. Music and subtitles are good. Recommended. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

While he did that in Brother (2000), his early films tend to structure things differently. They don't focus on why the violence occurs nor its build up, but choose to follow its aftermath and the how the repercussions effect its victims and those connected to the victims.For those interested in his work, I suggest starting with either Brother, Violent Cop or Boiling Point to ease you into the unique plotting and pace of Takeshi's crime films.",

I have seen many say that Hana-bi is Kitanos best film, but I would probably disagree and say Sonatine is. I feel that the films are quite similar, but Sonatine just does it better. That's not to say that Hana-bi isn't a great movie. Kitano plays a very similar character to his other films. A silent and violent cop who retires from the force due to a certain incident and the fact that his wife is sick. He plays the character well and you certainly feel the pain he is experiencing. What I found slightly strange about the film was the side plot of the partner who was injured and starts to paint to keep himself busy. We keep cutting back to this story, and I couldn't quite place the significance. Looking at it from a very basic point of view, it does nothing to help the plot. Obviously it has a deeper meaning to it, but I can't quite understand it myself. I think I would need to analyse the film more. I almost feel like it may be some kind of personal statement by Kitano. He was involved in a car crash in real life and began to paint after it. Perhaps parts of this film, if not all, is about Kitanos accident and the feelings he had after having a near death experience. That would explain a lot. I feel overall, Sonatine does a better job of doing what Hana-bi tries to do. Sonatine has similar themes, but displays those theme more clearly and concisely, while Hana-bi is much more up to your own interpretation at times. Also, the humour in Sonatine works perfectly, while it feels out of place many times in Hana-bi. That's not to say the humour isn't funny. I actually found it extremely funny (especially a scene involving a camera on a timer), but it just felt quite out of place at times. In the end, Hana-bi feels like a lesser version of Sonatine. Even though Hana-bi came after, I just found myself thinking \"Sonatine did it better\". I got goosebumps from Sonatine, but not Hana-bi.

I didn't read any reviews beore seeing it, just a short summary. I did this on purpose because I knew I won't be disappointed and I wasn't, I expected a lot from this movie and I got what I expected. Just as most (at least from which I've already seen) Kitano's films it's a violent, sad and touching story with very sad ending and a pinch of black humour (or at least it looked like that), and that's what I love in his films. Nobody can beat Kitano. I'm on my way to see rest of his films which, I'm sure, will be brilliant just as those which I've already seen. Thanks Japan for this wonderful director!",

I can actually understand people, that mostly watch action flicks, getting bored by this film, but for those more into poetic films, this is just the thing for you. While short on dialog, the movie is stronger on the body language of all the characters... sometimes there isn't any dialog for more than 6 minutes or so, where you just have to watch in order to understand what he is trying to tell us... For me it the movie was a bit depressing and sometimes hard to follow, but i still enjoyed it a lot. But as i said, this movie is not for everyone.... The movie is about a cop in Japan who leaves the police to spend more time with his wife who is dying of cancer, and if that was not enough to bare with, he also lost a kid and his partner gets shot and paralyzed on the job. Now he has to deal with all these tragedies at the same time... So if you want a comparison, if you liked movies like \"21 grams\" for example, you will love this movie!",

Kitano also displays another aspect that is stunning: his artwork.

Hana-Bi is a film that in one moment it can be beautiful and tranquil, and then the next, shockingly violent. If it is machine guns and explosions you want, look elsewhere. This film is engaging study of real emotion and violence and will for two hours make you look at life from a unique perspective. Takeshi Kitano also proves he is nothing short of a brilliant actor as well - and I think he plays one of the best \"tough guys with a heart\" character anywhere.",

In these countries, the culture dictates that it is better to die than to live as a disabled person. I agree with the director that this treatment of disabled people is totally unfair and inhumane. Overall, the film is slow and occasionally interrupted by sudden violence. The director is known for his style of injecting sudden violence into otherwise slow films. Said to be influenced by the Vietnam War and a photo of a South Vietnamese intelligence officer randomly shooting a Viet Cong prisoner in the head.

It's all pulled off in Kitano's usual minimalist style, alternating shocking violence with moments of quiet subtlety and humor.

Even if I am not watching the film, I have always been rehearsing the sequences in my brain on Joe Hisaishi's wonderful score.Although his film has risen to such height, which means, expressing one's personal world perfectly using artistic media, Kitano is not much talked about outside Japan or Asia, compared to Woody Allen, also once a stand-up comedian and had been enthusiastically hailed by European audience especially French since 90s.Is it probably because a lot people dislike violence and prefer New York elites talking from beginning to the end? Hardly so and most likely just the opposite. Then it must be that people are uneasy to face or comprehend those acts of violence permeated by Oriental Silence (see my comment on Brother for further discussion on this point).It is easy to understand that Akira Kurosawa is a great director, just like Steven Spielberg in USA and ZhangYiMou in China, both happen to be big admirers of the former. But talking about auteur film, theirs are far from it. It is easier to understand their works since they are open to the extent of almost flat. On the contrary, an auteur film is not so inviting and stands in front of us like a giant monster before we have any clue where they came from.It is like Nietzsche with all his originality and self-assurance but hard to be placed right amid European philosophy history, whose existence could only be imagined outside an institutional hierarchy.",

            "content": "This is my favourite of Kitano's work as a director. It has all the traits you expect if you have seen his earlier films but this feels like a pinnacle to me.\nIt is a hard film to describe without feeling you are being critical. Much of its charm and power is achieved with little dialogue and long scenes of subtlety and inaction. And yet it is very engaging, balances darkness and humour, violence and serenity and portrays a lot by apparently doing so little. It has a contemplative, poetic feel but never feels slow or dull. There is the typical stone-faced Kitano acting but he cracks a smile now and then. (This is part of his charm - not a criticism). Many of the long scenes show an odd warmth and have an underlying tension and inevitability.\n***Spoilers from here***\nThe basic plot is that Kitano is an ex-cop. Initially he seems cold and unlikeable but his actions tell us otherwise. He is a strange combination of quiet, almost wordless love/loyalty for a select few along with unflinching, unemotional, sudden violence for others. He feels responsible for a colleague getting killed and another getting paralysed. In the background he has a terminally ill wife (I assume - it is not made explicit what is wrong) and they have lost their only child who died aged 4 or 5. He remains loyal to the injured man and the widow of the dead man but gives up being a cop. There are the usual Yakuza characters but the film is not really centred around them like some of his other films are. Don't expect a Japanese Yakuza thriller/action film. Kitano performs the quietest and calmest face-to-face bank robbery you'll ever see on film and gives money to the paralysed colleague and the young widow. He then takes his wife on a kind of road trip which can only really have one ending.\nIt is hard to do this justice - the plot is almost irrelevant, there is little dialogue but it carries you along, makes you feel much more emotion than is ever displayed on screen and is very cinematic. It feels almost perfectly balanced. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "When I first saw this movie about 15 years ago, I was ecstatic. Little has changed since then.The story is about the downfall of one cop and the transcendence of another. It is also a deeper look into a mind that exists in extremes.First, the few things that I didn't like as much as the rest. The score seems very western-oriented and sentimental, and I cannot help but thinking that it was done that way to make the movie more appealing to western audiences. Just as in any Asian restaurant in the West, where they add flavors to adapt the dishes to a western taste. In one instance, the violence seems to be a bit self-serving: when his wife is bullied while watering the flowers, it doesn't really have anything to do with the story, nor does it add anything. And finally, there are some logical issues (why would the Yakuza boss drive out to the spa personally?).That said, the film is so strong that these issues are more like fly spots on the windshield of a sports car.At it's core, the film is violent in an almost pathological way and at the same time beautiful in a grand way. My sister, who saw the film and found it \"somewhat poetic\", was ultimately turned off by the blood and slaughter. You therefore cannot fully appreciate it without accepting or even admiring it's violent aggression, for instance when Nishi is poking the eye of the Yakuza mobster with his chopsticks. At other moments, Nishi becomes iconic. When the mob killer is pointing the gun at him in front of the elevator, his calm fatalism makes Tarantinos films look like comic strips.When Horibe, the wounded cop, is looking at the bouquets that are displayed in front of the flower shop, the film show us the moment of his inspiration. It is expressed in a way that makes the viewer realize the exalted state and intimacy of the moment. Takeshi knows what he is talking about, since he is the artist who did all the paintings, and they are scattered throughout the movie. Sometimes, they contradict the mood of a scene and give it a slightly ironic feeling. But they always add color to the mostly monotone backdrops (hospital interiors, dimly lit bars).His very unique humour is also everywhere in the film, in little self-enclosed sketches that I personally find quite funny, they also serve to add some lightness to an otherwise very severe theme.The camera is mostly still and the frames are composed in a very focused, reduced and determined style, which is probably not unusual for Japanese cinema.This is more of an experience than a movie.",

Most movie fights are like boxing matches, with jabs and counterpunches and snappy dialogue between rounds.  Do not look for extended martial arts set pieces here.  `Fireworks' has bursts of action, but Kitano is more concerned with taking his time to show the different responses to adversity by the two main characters.Like Mike Hodges's Get Carter (not, for heaven's sake, the Stallone remake) the beginning of the movie purposefully is hard to follow.  The viewer is thrown into the plot without standard exposition or background.  Add in some unadvertised-as-such flashbacks and it took a while for this viewer to get `orient-ed.'   But once I did, I was given time to appreciate the comfortable silences between Nishi and his wife, Horibe's paintings of flower-animals, and Jo Hisaishi's sensitive score.  When Miyuki's wood block puzzle pieces are properly assembled, we know Kitano is giving us the clue that the end of the line is near.  Nishi's final moments have the wistful fatalism common in Japanese culture and cinema, so I rightly was punished for predicting a different ending.  Serves me right.",

            "content": "Simply one of the greatest films of the last ten years, and possibly beyond.POSSIBLE SPOILERSAlthough this film is likened to Violent Cop, in the way Sonatine is to Boiling Point, this film shows more than just a technical improvement in Takeshi's work.  it is no secret that this film was directly influenced by Takeshi's brush with death and that horrible experience shines through this work with a stillness and beauty that makes one weep.  The graceful settings of Japan, from the beach to Mt Fuji, and the sad, lonely paintings (painted by Takeshi himself in the wake of his own brush with death) provide a colourful array of images that provide the film's visual beauty.  This is complemented by the relationship of Nishi and his wife - also quite still and sad - as they endeavour to make their last few moments together the best moments of their lives but always tainted with the knowledge that it will all come to an end, and very soon.In typical Takeshi style this grace and beauty is contrasted by scenes of brutal violence.  Many praise this contrast for achieving a balance in the film.  Although generally true I find that it is actually more beneficial in some cases to view the contrast and clash as exactly that.  Nishi lives a troubled and violent life, one that he is stuck in and this makes it impossible for him to have a happy ending.  He relies on this life and indeed uses it in order to find a quick fix to his problems, which naturally does not make them go away.  He starts the film as the cop character we always expect from Takeshi and immediately becomes the classic tragic figure and he knows he has been punished.  All he can do is try and make it as bearable for the person he loves before she dies.  The true sadness lies in the fact that she seems to be paying for his sins.END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis is Takeshi's masterpiece.  A serene, violent, minimalist and incredibly sad movie that does more with nothing that many directors could ever do with everything.",

Takeshi Kitano deserves recognition for every role that he has on this movie: he directed, produced, edited and stars as Yashitaka Nishi a cop who does things his way, the hard way.Kitano combines on this movie the rawest and most brutal of the violence with the most delicate and tender human feelings. He mixes them separately on the movie but together in Nishi, a guy who does quite severe when the tough gets going and toughly tender when the tough is gone.Visually the movie is simply a masterpiece: every single frame is a splendid image by itself, each detail is there because it belongs there; Kitano and cinematographer Hideo Yamamoto did a superb job letting the images do the job, words supposed to do.Hana-bi is not a thrilling movie even it's about cops and mobsters, Hana-bi is an atmospheric and moody movie were you'll simply witness a tough story about a tough man who has as much from tough as from man.",

            "content": "Takeshi Kitano dives once more into the yakuza underworld and emerges with a fierce performance, as he leads one of the decade's best hidden gems.Kitano plays Nishi, a cop whose life has been slowly crumbling apart and is about to take an even darker turn. He's lost his daughter and his wife is fighting an uphill battle with leukemia. She spends her days at the hospital and, to pay for her treatment, Nishi now finds himself in debt with the yakuza. To add insult to injury, he's also feeling guilty, as his partner, Horibe, has been confined to a wheelchair after being injured while Nishi was visiting his wife. It's here that the film parts into two narratives: that of Horibe, who must grapple with his new condition, and of Nishi, who has to repay the yakuza and deal with his wife's inevitable demise.Make no mistake, this isn't an Asian action movie. The film has a very deliberate pace. Kitano often shoots long and almost silent takes, showing us a cold and deadpan Nishi, always hidden behind his shades, even when he's with his wife. In fact, the two barely talk throughout the film, but they're truthful, as if they've been together long enough to tell each other all they had to tell. Sometimes they giggle, or share a more heartwarming moment, but these moments are fleeting. It's in between these long takes that we get another look at Nishi. With flawless editing, Kitano makes violence spark in \"Fireworks\", but that's all it does. Rarely does he linger in the violence or the gore, the act itself is nothing more than that, an action.Both Horibe and Nishi are men to whom life has been treacherous, and yet it's curious to note the distinct way in which these two men react. Horibe is the more vocal of the two, but still seems better at handling his misfortune than the explosive and criminal Nishi. Truth be told, the only pleasant moments in Nishi's life seem to be the ones he spends with his wife, walking by the shore or sitting by the beach, he's calm. However, if he's confronted by his own immoral actions, mayhem ensues. This is mostly how \"Fireworks\" plays, like a ticking time-bomb, serene but with the threat of violence always at the surface.\"The flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long\" - we know that eventually Nishi will get his comeuppance, but whether he truly deserves it is what's most unsettling about \"Fireworks\".",

            "content": "I first viewed this film in England and I was blown away by its awesome use of slow motion shooting scenes and violent imagery.  Admittedly, I and a lot others who have seen this picture are not experts on Yakuza violence. Being ordinary law abiding citizens, we wouldn't really know what exactly represents true scenes of mob violence, would we? However, we may be able to visualize how such images might be like given the literature and news which we are frequently exposed to.  The action in the movie and its consequences are very believable given the true life accounts we have read about, seen or even heard.  The character Beat portrays is after all a quiet yet serious individual whose loyalties are unwavering and who would do anything to perpetuate survival.  Those who have watched the film will however, discover the great irony of this need to perpetuate survival, at the film's tragic yet liberating ending.There is also a very touching love story between the unfortunate cop and his ailing wife.  As a sub-plot, this love story is engaging as Beat hardly utters a word to his obviously devoted wife and then suddenly takes her on a vacation at a very quiet and scenic Japanese destination.  The cinematography and colours during this part of the film are magnificent. While the couple are finally living their lives, Beat receives an unexpected visit from his Yakuza creditors who are all efficiently disposed of in Beat's usual merciless style.  Those with some sense of humour would no doubt appreciate the manner in which Beat transforms a car into a police vehicle which he subsequently uses to perform a bank robbery.  The robbery scene is itself a farce of what is normally portrayed by mainstream film makers.  The movie would preferably have to be watched more than once in order for its understatedness to be fully understood.Yet another feature of the film that had me gobsmacked was its soundtrack. The music is unnervingly sad and stirring with brief infusions of excitement depicting the more passionate moments shared between \"Beat\" the husband, and his wife.  These passionate moments are then quickly superseded by the despair which dominates the rest of the film's already surreal ambience. This has undoubtedly got to be  Beat's finest moment to date and must be watched by all those who pride themselves as being true afficionados of cinema.Truly a landmark in film making and a fine reason not to spend good hard-earned money on Hollywood (and especially Bollywood)insults.",

I went so far as to say i had no intention of doing so, or rather that i was just not interested in seeing it (ive never really bought into the whole thing, altho i have seen the previous three). From there we got off on this big debate about film, film snobs (i guess i was being lumped into this category), hollywood vs art films...that sorta thing. of course, as these playful arguments tend to go, we agreed to disagree, and no feelings ewere hurt or anything like that. but during our heated little discussion, we began discussing just WHY we/people watch films in the first place. \"to be entertained\", was the other's reply. this person then went on to say that if out of all the movies they saw in a year, let's say, if 10% were pretty darn good, and 1% of that 10% were exceptional, than they were happy. well, this made me think....\"no way, man!\" -  i want to see 99% great exceptional movies. i want to feel that amazing charge/rush/call it what you will all the time! instead of wasting my time with mindless dreck like 'batman forever', i want to be moved by movies like \"last night', 'breaking the waves', or 'hana-bi\". sometimes it's hard to find joy, why look for it in places you know you wont find it?thank (insert deity of choice here) for movies like HANA-BI.",

Hana-bi is one of his more praised pieces of work. \"Detective Nishi (Kitano) is bitter when he learns that his wife Miyuki is terminally ill and his partner Horibe was shot and now tied to a wheelchair. Horibe wants to become a painter, but doesn't have money for that. To help him and a young police widow whose husband was shot dead during an arrest, he borrows money from yakuza. After that he buys an old car, paints it as a police car, and, dressed in uniform, singlehandedly robs a bank. With the money he goes on a final farewell journey together with his wife\". I had one big problem with this movie. The concept was built around Kitano's relationships with his wife and best friend, yet they were hardly played up. His wife spoke about five words in the movie, and there was very little interaction between Kitano and his friend. I think this may be a movie that requires repeated viewing to really understand though. Kitano's acting is great as always, with his facial expressions saying so much to the viewer. The movie also features some of Kitano's famous bursts of violences, which are always a sight to behold. The flashback one that we saw several times throughout the movie was amazing. Unless I'm missing something that I'll pick up next time I watch the movie, this wasn't Kitano's best, but was certainly very good.",

Of course, reservations are to be made for acting prowess, but we live in an era where we are surrounded by capable actors and actresses, so more often than not, I simply overlook this factor and focus more on the 3 I listed above.Suffice it to say that Joe Htisaishi's music in this movie is wonderful. It fit perfectly into the sad tale of Nishi and this was coupled with the beautiful scenery of Japan towards the end of the movie. TLDR; Watch this movie if you want an Asian version of a film noir.

You'd think this would stretch him a little thin but the film looks and feel very accomplished.Hana Bi was my first encounter with Takeshi and I found it quite breathtaking. It's the story of Mr Nishi (Takeshi), an ex-police officer at odds with an amoral universe. He's a man with nothing to live for, exuding laconic melancholy and existential resignation as life disintegrates around him.Indirectly responsible for the death of one colleague and the paralysis of another, haunted by reminders of his lost daughter, he contemplates the imminent death of his wife from terminal illness.As the local Yakuza pressure him to settle his debts he decides to take his wife on one final trip.There's a strong sense of `mono-no-aware' throughout, the idea that beauty comes not from the appearance of things but the knowledge that they are fleeting and will soon be gone.

Definitely among the bleakest films you'll find out there, yet it embraces immense subtlety; The main character (played by its director and writer) rarely talks to anyone, out of overwhelming grief for his fellow teammates, and it makes for scenes of him with his friends' dialogues truly emotional and immersive. Legendary composer Joe Hisaishi also enhances its tone beautifully with what might be his best score (take note ghibli fans).Kitano really does make use of oceans and blue skies throughout the runtime, and it's brilliantly executed enough to make me focus on the characters that matter in each frames it's present. Being released around the same year as Titanic, it should be a shame that mainstream audiences at that time were impressionable enough to fall for such pretentious aristocratic propaganda, for the love between Nishi and his wife is way more sweet and genuine.Unlike most movies involving gangsters, its dependence on intimate solace is refreshing and its poetic ambience retains creativity. With its action scenes of such sparse and abrupt presence enacts the most intimidating violence, all coming from Nishi, which only happens whenever a yakuza member annoys him by bragging about their greed.Even from the golden age of jidaigeki, it's rare to find Japanese movies that strike this level of depressive silence and neorealism before. Usually there's always some crutch of absurdity or goofball humor that allow mainstream audiences to find excitement and/or immediate reactions, particularly in the films of Takashi Miike (his newer filmography) and Sion Sono. It is only matched by the Taiwanese New Wave, and it kind of has the same aesthetic particularly of an Edward Yang film except that it's contained with high levels of isolation.",

Kitano shows a warmth and humanity not displayed in his previous films,the scenes between Nishi and his wife being particularly moving. All of Kitano's films have a tableux quality with their long static shots and here he takes this to the logical extreme by using paintings (his own) to display the emotions of a crippled cop considering suicide. Kitano employs his usual deadpan humour carefully at key moments throughout the film, often in the most violent scenes.And nobody else can film a scene set on a beach like \"Beat\" Takeshi. Special mention should also be made of Joe Hisaishi's beautiful jazz influenced score.

Nishi is a middle aged cop in Japan. He has a wife who is dying from terminal illness.  They also had their daughter's death before and now they have to prepare for another.  Nishi's partner, Horibe, gets shot during the duty and his family leaves.  At first, he commits suicide but after surviving, he wants to paint but doesn't have money to buy the equipment. Nishi robs a bank and buys Horibe the painting equipment.  Afterwards, he goes on the farewell trip with his wife.   Nishi's character is very unique: he nearly has any dialogues and is always expressionless even he faces the danger of death. He usually seems a nice guy but when he gets upset, he commits brutal violence without warning. When Nishi stabbed an eyeball of a yakuza who was insulting him, it made me jump out of the seat. Action is not important in this film.  The camera is looking at somewhere else when the characters beat up or shoot each other and only shows the injured or dead people. Nishi and his wife do not seem to be afraid of the death.  During the journey, they concentrate on childish activities.  There is not a scene they hug each other and cry.  Kitano asserts that even death comes, people always can relax. The camera does not move much and the music is also calm.  But they are beautiful and go along with the film very well.",

The strength of the charachter was brought to the fore by action and deed, the epitome of the notion that one's strength comes not from words but action. On the emotional side of the film, I can only say that when my wife and I sat down to watch this together, not knowing what to expect, at the end we were holding each other tightly and she had tears coursing down her cheeks.

Why try to live by the rules, as there will always be those who make their own regulations?   Being a cop in a big city must be frustrating and scary.  Maybe the only way to cope with that kind of work is to get numb of all that terror.The most impressive parts in this picture were the violent scenes, especially the unusual way of using sound was quite effective:  The silence \"underlined\" the violence.  I think this movie showed violence in a way it should be shown:  As brutal and terrible as it is, how it hurts and how people really suffer from it, this is not the picture you get from Hollywood films.What leaves me with mixed feelings is that in this movie,  suicide was not shown as violent, desperate or insane but as something graceful, peaceful and inviting (snow, light, sea).I did a lot of thinking after seeing this movie and that is rare:  I recommend the movie to everyone who wants to see something totally different from the mainstream movies!",

            "content": "\"Hana Bi\", the Japanese word for fireworks, literally translates its two Kanji characters as \"Flowers (of) Fire\", the contraposed coupling of evanescent life with violent death. At the core of the movie is its disagreeable moral. Detective Nishi is responsible for the crippling of his partner Horibe, shot on a stakeout while he absents himself to visit his terminally ill wife Miyuki at the hospital. Nishi constantly relives the death of another cop at the hands of an armed robber he was unable to control. In thrall to failure and remorse, Nishi quits the force and borrows money from the yakuza to enable Horibe to become a painter and support the young police widow reduced to working at a fast food stand. In order to repay the yakuza he buys a stolen taxicab from a junkyard, paints it as a police car, dons a patrol uniform, and singlehandedly robs a bank with a toy revolver. While Nishi returns the principal to his creditors, he neglects to pay the interest, knowing full well that this oversight will oblige them to pursue him. The profit from his heist underwrites Nishi's final farewell to Miyuki on a sentimental pilgrimage to Mt. Fuji, as he wipes out his pursuers and flabbergasts salarymen with his retaliatory justice disregaring all native decorum.Kitano's oblique depiction of ultraviolence is both very Japanese and very revisionist in style.  A sixty-second scene in Kurosawa's Red Beard shows Toshiro Mifune, who plays a provincial doctor in Tokugawa Japan, confronted by a dozen yakuza in a whorehouse yard over a sick little girl he intends to rescue therefrom. Encircled by arrogant louts, Mifune somberly dispatches them in a smoothly flowing sequence, visiting just deserts upon each adversary with his bare hands, only to survey the carnage and express his regret of having transgressed the Hippocratic principle to his ambitious young samurai understudy. So Beat Takeshi, boxed in and surrounded by sneering goons in the yakuza Benz, swiftly addresses each of them with a revolver abruptly confiscated from their hapless colleague, then proffers a posthumous admonition to the inert body of a pompadour punk, thrice-thrashed, yet thitherto twice spared. The action is distilled and compressed; the therapeutic protagonist's conscientious alter ego is inverted and mooted.On a break in their journey, as Miyuki squats at a lake shore to water a bouquet of dead flowers, a boorish interloper upbraids her about the futility of her melancholy gesture. Nishi abruptly shoves him underwater and colors the lake with blooming petals of his blood, in a warm-up for dealing with the next batch of yakuza pursuers due to catch up with them shortly. This juxtaposition of sentimentality and ultraviolence retreats from the more tough-minded narratives of Akira Kurosawa and Hideo Gosha, whose stoic brooding heroes Takeshi Kitano obviously seeks to emulate.  But the staccato beat of action punctuating the contemplative portrayal of the hero's love for his dying wife, equally well rooted in the chambara tradition It is evocative of Tatsuya Nakadai soulful oyabun, deferring to the prior claim on his wife left loyally unarticulated by his recovering amnesiac retainer in Gosha's Hunter in the Dark, both in munificence of spirit and operatic surfeit of suppressed emotion. These devices epitomize the Liebestod suggested by the title, a plot device destined to be imitated but unattained by lesser filmmakers.",

            "content": "Before watching the movie, I had heard nothing of it except for the fact that it was a Takeshi-film. When it got started, I couldn't help trying to connect \"Hana-Bi\" and Takeshi's other film, \"Brother\". A story of a man who is involved with the Yakuza, one way or the other by either helping or killing them. A man, who in my opinion, is full of pride and love for his wife though he has a hard time showing her. There's no denying the fact, that Takeshi knows what he is doing, when directing a movie. I couldn't help feeling sorry for him, in this film, even though his actions always left a smile on my face when he took care of \"things\". The sadness of this film, combined with the occasional use of brute force and bullets makes it a movie to remember. I would rate this a nice 9/10.",
