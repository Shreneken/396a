            "review_title": "An unassuming film that is thought provoking on so many levels, well acted and thoroughly enjoyable however you come to it",
            "content": "Truman Burbank is an ordinary guy in an ordinary little seaside town of Seahaven Island where nothing really happens. Everything is clean, everything is perfect, he knows people but never really connects to anyone. The one woman he ever really loved is not his wife and has long since left for the other side of the world where he longs to visit but feels he can never go. Paralysed by his fear of water since seeing his father die on a boating accident, Truman still feels he is missing something. A strange light falling from the sky, a man who reminds him of his dead father, a strange radio broadcast and the feeling that the world really stops when he shuts his eyes all combine to make him feel something is wrong \u0096 but what is it that he seeks but feels he cannot find?When I first saw this film it was with my girlfriend (who would then become my wife, then ex-wife!) and I remember how she and our friends felt a little bit cheated by the film that they had expected to be yet another wacky Jim Carrey comedy. In fairness to her and the others, it was easy to do this at the time \u0096 who would have thought that Jim Carrey would be able to act \u0096 certainly not the marketing department that sold this film on the basis of it being a hilarious film as opposed to the thoughtful and rewarding film it turned out to be. The plot can be viewed on so many levels that it is honestly easier to leave it to each viewer to take what they will from it. On the most obvious level it satirises the media, the emotional fa\u00e7ade of television and (the increasingly relevant) look at reality shows. To others it will say as much about God, the empty drone of life and the things that we all desire. Of course to others it will just be a comedy with general comments to make \u0096 and there is nothing wrong with that whatsoever; in fact the multi-level approach works to make it appeal to many audiences.Starting as a comedy, I am always taken by how well the film moves to become more and more interesting but yet never loses sight of those audience members who have come for the basic story. Hence it delivers an enjoyable and engaging central narrative that, plainly put, makes for a comic and involving yarn \u0096 we grow to care for Truman and this makes the ending an emotional and satisfying one even if some viewers will bemoan the fact that (to them) it appears 'open ended'. That it is also a very thought-provoking affair is only a bonus, with the satire working on many levels. Of course by seeming to tackle so many subjects and issues in such a short running time, the film never really gets its teeth deep into any one of them but this is not a major problem because it leaves us to do that in our heads after the film finishes.The cast is roundly superb even if the majority of them are in minor roles. Of course it is easy now to look back at Carrey and accept that he can act straight but at the time it seemed so unlikely and few felt it was a good casting choice. Of course, seeing the end result it is clear that he can and he delivers such a great performance that he really makes the film work.He is comic but yet serious, sympathetic but not worthy of pity \u0096 it is a great delivery and one that basically meant that I now look at his Ace Ventura stuff as the 'other' category and see his acting as his real work (6 years ago that was vice versa). Carrey carries the film, being on screen for almost the entire film but he has good support from Linney, Emmerich, Krause and others who play it well despite being stuck in the necessary stiff and unreal roles. The controller etc roles are all well played and feature a collection of well known faces including a great support role from Harris through to roles for Giamatti, Shearer, Baker Hall and a few others. It may be Carrey's show but the support certainly helps.Overall this is a great film that can be appreciated as much for what it is on the surface (a great little comic story) as it can for the issues that it hints at all the time. There was a time when some viewers may have looked to a Carrey film to be a load of mugging an crude, basic laughs but this was the film that saw that change. Thought provoking, funny, entertaining, short, enjoyable and well acted throughout \u0096 well worth seeing and well worth coming back to several times.",

            "review_title": "Life is Starting to Imitate Satire",
            "content": "Life is starting to imitate satire. \"The Truman Show\" was only made seven years ago, but it predates the current mania for so-called \"reality\" television shows such as \"Big Brother\". The idea behind such shows is that they present the viewer with a slice of actual reality- real people in real situations with real emotions- rather than the simulated reality of drama or the edited reality of documentaries. The flaw in this idea is that nothing is more unreal than a reality show. The presence of the cameras has a distorting effect, inducing artificial behaviour patterns in those who appear in front of it, and the sort of people who star in such programmes are almost invariably eccentric exhibitionists. \"The Truman Show\" takes the central concept of reality TV shows one stage further in order to overcome this flaw: what would happen if we made a reality programme about a person who has absolutely no idea that he is appearing on television? Truman Burbank is an insurance executive, living in a small American seaside town called Seahaven, and happily married to a nurse named Meryl. Or at least he thinks he is. What Truman doesn't know is that he is the central character in a soap opera and that his whole life is a fiction. The company he works for does not exist. Seahaven, the island it stands on and the surrounding ocean are all part of a gigantic set, specially created for the programme and sealed off from the outside world in a gigantic geodesic dome. Everyone in Truman's life- Meryl, his mother, his colleagues at work, his best friend Marlon- are actors playing out their roles in his drama.For thirty years Truman has accepted his world unquestioningly, but at the beginning of the film a series of incidents- a light falling from the sky, the reappearance of his father, who was supposed to have drowned in a boating accident when Truman was a boy, strange messages picked up on his car radio- awaken his doubts. Although members of the cast make strenuous attempts to dissuade him, he decides to try and explore the world outside Seahaven; in particular he wants to travel to Fiji where he has been told that his former girlfriend Sylvia now lives. (Sylvia was written out of the show when the scriptwriters decided that he should marry Meryl instead).The film has certain similarities with another film from the late nineties, \"Pleasantville\", which dealt with an inverted version of the same idea; two teenagers from the real world are magically transported into the world of a fifties television show. In my view, however, \"The Truman Show\" is the better of the two. \"Pleasantville\" deals with its political themes in a heavy-handed way with some very obvious symbolism. \"The Truman Show\", although it deals with some weighty issues, is never ponderous or excessively serious; indeed, it is often very humorous. The main source of humour is the contrast between the na\u00efve, trusting Truman and the behaviour of those around him, all living a lie and desperately trying to prevent Truman from finding out that it is a lie. I had previously thought of Jim Carrey as a rather annoying actor whose appeal was based upon the idea that manic overacting is in itself funny, but here as Truman he is very good indeed, both amusing and touching. I was also impressed by Ed Harris as Christof, the show's enigmatic producer.Another factor in the success of the film is its visual look. Seahaven (like the town in \"Pleasantville\") appears as an eerily perfect, not-quite-real version of the typical American small town, but was actually filmed in a real place, the purpose-built village of Seaside, Florida. There are similarities with the cult British sixties television series \"The Prisoner\", which was also filmed in an eerily perfect seaside village, Portmeirion in North Wales.The film is obviously a satire on the intrusiveness and obsession with celebrity of the modern media; added relevance was given by the fact that it came out shortly after the death of Princess Diana. There is, however, more to it than that. Much has been made of the film as religious allegory; it has been pointed out that Christof whose name is clearly, and quite deliberately, similar to \"Christ\", is a God-figure, whereas Truman (the \"True Man\") is a symbolic Everyman. It has even been claimed that the film is an anti-religious allegory, with Truman's final escape from Seahaven symbolic of man's need to break away from outdated religious dogmas. This is not an interpretation with which I would agree- if one is trying to put across a \"God is dead\" message, it seems odd to provide a God-figure who is very much real, not mythical or illusory. The imagery of the final scenes \u0096 the calm after the storm, the ascent up a flight of stairs into the sky and clouds- also struck me as religious rather than secular. Moreover, the film seems too complex to be reduced to any single allegorical meaning, although it certainly deals with the relationship between man and God. It also touches on man's need to explore- both to explore new places and also to explore new ideas and to break away from established ways of life and ways of thought- and on the nature of reality. Truman's world may seem unreal to us, but as Christof says, \"we accept the reality we are presented with\".This is a brilliant, multi-layered film, part comedy, part satire, part philosophical speculation, and in my view one of the two best movies of the late nineties. (The other was \"American Beauty\"). I felt it should have taken the \"Best Picture\" Oscar for 1999- \"Shakespeare in Love\" is a good film, but \"The Truman Show\" is a great one. It confirms my view that Peter Weir is one of the best directors currently working. 10//10",

Now that I have seen it, I am somewhat glad that I waited, because from this vista, twenty years later, it really seems prophetic. Think about all of the children who were born after the ascendance of the internet. Many of their lives are not unlike Truman\u00b4s life: every moment captured for all the world for all of time.What is even more disconcerting is that many people willingly choose to focus on and cultivate their internet presence at the expense of everything else. We have become a selfie culture, and reality t.v. thrives because people not only like to watch other people but also to put themselves and their lives on display. Modern people have become narcissistic exhibitionists--and are proud of it!",

            "content": "I have never liked Jim Carey's humor. I have found it to very broad and boorish. However, I was very happy that I saw \"The Truman Show\" and am surprised I did considering my feelings about his earlier 'comedies'. Thankfully, Carey showed he could act and NOT ham it up--a tribute to his native talents as well as the director and writer. With a weak director, Carey might have begun to seek laughs in 1001 crazy ways. Here, however, it's straight and quite endearing. I could talk about the plot, but there are already a bazillion reviews for this one. The bottom line is that don't assume because you don't like \"Dumb and Dumber\" or \"Ace Ventura\" you won't love this film. And, I really loved \"The Truman Show\" and think it's a lovely film with a lot of heart and an awful lot of imagination.By the way, I would say the same things about Will Farrell and Adam Sandler. Despite disliking some of there very broad films, there serious films (such as \"Reign Over Me\" or \"Stranger Than Fiction\") are exceptional. Additionally, I gotta admit that I did enjoy a few of their 'stupid' films such as \"Water Boy\" and \"Talladega Nights\". So don't assume that just because you may not like a few of their films means they all are not your cup of tea.",

Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comedies I've seen lately.  The point (the media and its destructive powers)  is subtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don't feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals.  Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING at the Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn't ribald for once. The final scene--I will not reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless.  Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here.  This is a thinking person's movie.

            "content": "'The Truman Show' epitomizes strong and original storytelling on screen. This film is emotionally engaging, didactic, witty, dramatic and very unique. For those unfamiliar with the concept, Truman Burbank has never left his ideal home town of Sea Haven. What he doesn't know is that his entire environment is a materialized set and he is the ignorant star of a reality TV show of epic proportions.Taking this entirely original concept, writer Andrew Niccol and director Peter Wier take the viewer into territory uncharted by anything in film history. Thus, the plot is entirely unpredictable but still flows along expertly. The tightness of the screenplay and the immaculate pacing of Peter Wier contribute largely to this film's brilliance.The acting performances are amongst the best I've ever seen. Jim Carey is superb as Truman, effortlessly conveying his fears, desires and personality. Ed Harris is excellent as the reclusive creator of the production. In addition, the entire support cast appears synthetic enough to let the audience know they are \"acting\" for Truman but in some scenes let their \"genuine\" feelings shine through. The ensemble simply cannot be faulted. Carey was hardly done by not to get an Oscar nomination for his performance.The music and visuals are top notch. The cinematography has a reality TV feel that is clever but never intrusive. The shot selection is of the highest quality, particularly in the movie's final sequence. Muscially, this film is incredible. Phillip Glass is a dream on the piano, perfectly evoking the mood for each section of the narrative. The two combine excellently during the scene in which Truman breaks his routine for the first time. During the sequence, Truman makes subtle changes to the bland routine he follows compliantly every day. The emotion of the music when combined with the apparent simplicity of Truman's actions makes this scene one the most powerful I'v ever experienced.This film is an absolute gem. It effortlessly combines everything a classic film should have. It has comedy, drama, strong character development, atmosphere, originality, superb visuals, a superb score, tight writing, raises interesting moral questions as well as providing insight into the human condition. One cannot watch this spectacular film without wondering how a human would react when put in that kind of situation. It touches on our sense of adventure, desire for conformity and the courage we require to question the life we are presented with. 'The Truman Show' does all this in the most accessible and compelling fashion. One of the greatest films of our time.",

            "content": "When \"The Truman Show\" hit theaters in the summer of 1998, there was no such thing as reality TV. \"Survivor\", \"Big Brother\", \"Amazing Race\", or \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\"? All in the future. The fact that this film beat America to the reality-TV punch shows how much of a landmark production it truly was--ahead of its time, to be sure.For a basic plot summary, \"The Truman Show\" tells the story of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), a seemingly regular guy who begins to suspect that his life is being controlled by forces outside of his own. As it turns out, his life (from birth) has been viewed by the TV-watching public since birth, with everyone in on the idea except him. That includes his wife (Laura Linney), best friend (Noah Emmerich), and even an old flame (Natascha McElhone) intent on revealing the mystery once Truman starts putting the pieces together and ultimately discovers how manipulated his life truly is. But not if enigmatic director Christof (Ed Harris) has anything to say about it.\"Truman Show\" is a concept movie through-and-through. It really nails the concept of \"reality TV\" & just how pervasive commercialism can become in our society. As previously mentioned, this film was years ahead of its time in portraying such issues. As such, in way the experience actually resonates more today than it ever could have in '98.The acting helps the production rise above just the concept as well. Carrey completely and utterly sheds his more farcical comedic roles and turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as the befuddled Truman, while the auxiliary roles are finely-tuned as well. Director Peter Weir will have you truly caring about the little town of Seahaven Island and its inhabitants by the film's conclusion.I consider \"The Truman Show\" to be one of the finest films of all-time. It has everything a great movie needs...intriguing plot, good pacing, solid acting, investing characters, and even a little humor thrown in here and there. Not only does it work on its surface level, but it also expertly presages a digital, commercialist, voyeuristic culture--all avenues that seemed to be moving closer to a societal reality.",

So as you would imagine \"The Truman Show\" is another success.Truman Burbank has the perfect life, or so he thought until finally his life long suspicions about his world begin to unravel. Even though the idea for Truman is not totally original, it is thought provoking enough and allows the audience to wonder, what if? If you think this couldn't happen, just look back over the years at the stupidity of the human race and think again.Jim Carrey once again nails his role, as do the entire cast. It is rare he fails to perform at a level that perfectly complements the movie and its genre. This is something he does not receive enough credit for.

On one hand this is a high concept comedy in the vein of \"Groundhog Day\" about an unwitting man whose entire life has been a TV show.  This is also a Jim Carrey vehicle designed to display his charms.  On the other hand this a very satirical look at the way the media manipulates our reality.  The film also wants to take a philosophical look at free will vs. a higher power and reality vs. fantasy.  It doesn't always work as the satire often keeps you from thinking too deeply about the underlying themes and the philosophical stuff keeps the satire from biting as well as it could.  Credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from Weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining.  There are some great cinematic moments here.  I loved the \"stolen kiss on the beach at night\" and \"Cue the sun!\"In the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current \"reality TV\" obsessed culture.  Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face (most people do so in childhood, some I fear never do).  The universe does not revolve around us.  In the closing moments we are excited for Truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore, but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic \"childhood\" existence.  How's it going to end?  Who knows...but things will never be the same.",

The world of Truman Burbank certainly took me back to those days. I used to look at myself in the mirror and say out loud: \"I wonder if I am me? I wonder if everybody thinks the same shade of red when I say red? Why was I born? Why are my parents my parents? Why did God create the world? Will I get punished by God for thinking all these things?\" This is a deep movie, bound to become an art film.  Jim Carey did such a superb job that it earned him a Golden Globe Award. This is definitely an Oscar contender. It made me think! What a suprise! Movies do not make me think very often. They are predictable to me now. Could it be age?When the lady comes on the bike with the basket, then the dog and then the yellow Volkswagen it reminded me of how repetitive life seems at times, when we think that nothing is going to change and we want changes. The Director was like God,  the creator,  although at times he was a mean guy, I think that all of us have questioned God and have been angry at him. Truman's world seemed so \"perfect\", no messy hair, no trash. Just phony! Our world seems much like that, everything is a matter of perception.The audience that watched the Truman Show in the movie was a hedonistic audience of consumers who wanted to be entertained no matter what the cost to Truman, reminded me of the soaps, of the Paparazzi, of how we like to know about the celebrities, and ultimatly of how the product could be the death of someone such as Princess Diana, or Truman Burbank.Purchase the video and watch it many times and many other symbols will come to mind.

Well, Truman Burbank never did and this movie tells of how he found out his life was a TV show.Quite possibly one of the most imaginative plots ever, Peter Weir's The Truman Show shows how one man's vision (Ed Harris) of having someone's life be on TV (that being Truman played by Jim Carey)...without him knowing it. A totally real show that has no boundaries except the walls of the enormous set. With actors playing the roles of the townspeople in this perfect community, as it seems.Jim Carey is brilliant as the confused insurance salesman who just wants the truth about his life. The death of his \"father\" drowning at sea has given Truman a reason to stay in his town and not venture off. But the urge to see the woman of his dreams is all to much. She was moved to \"Fiji\" because of some problems. Laura Linney plays Truman's wife. She isn't only his wife but is a walking commercial. Whenever there is a product she brings home, it seems like she is telling the world how great it is. Noah Emmerich plays Truman's best friend Marlon. This always uplifting character brings comic relief for Truman when he needs it most. When Truman's world seems to be falling apart, he's there. When Truman just needs a friend, he's there. Marlon is the one part of his life that makes it seem so real when everything else seems so fake.What makes this movie so enjoyable other than the story is how the people act in this \"town\". The way they make sure Truman stays there and doesn't leave. How everybody has a routine and even the weather is controlled. In the opening scene Truman wakes up and heads off to work to have a stage light fall right in the street. Where it came from?...he doesn't know. But doesn't worry about it because life is going great...for now. Ed Harris's character Cristof a.k.a. the Creator is genius and maniacal. With his people working around the clock to make sure all is well, this world he has created is now a world wide phenomenon. He is on top of the world with millions of people watching his creation unfold.This sensational film about a man trying to find his way in the world is incredible.

In appearance only \u0085 What Truman doesn't know, and here's the visionary originality on which relies his life, is that Seahaven, is in fact a huge studio with 5,000 cameras always keeping an eye on him and that everyone's an actor, including his wife, his mother, his best friend etc. and last but not least, all his life, was filmed since his birth to become the greatest and longest-running reality show in television history: 'The Truman Show'. Truman believed in a reality which is in fact, completely fictional, and all the protagonists of this pseudo reality, are puppets hanging on the string of the show's Creator who designs the perfect screenplay creating emotional cliffhangers for future episodes. The Creator is Kristoff, brilliantly portrayed by Ed Harris like a kind of almighty God, and the human incarnation of media's omnipotence. And Truman eventually realizes that his life is a huge hoax, and decides to leave the perfect utopia of Seahaven, and go discover the \"real\" world. Because that's the point: reality shows don't depict reality, but paint it with fiction, it's real fiction, but fiction nonetheless. The ambivalence is obvious in \"The Truman Show\". Truman's life is fictional, because all the protagonists play a role in order to create a story for the viewers. Viewers who follow the show like a soap opera with a 'realistic' dimension. Indeed, Truman's character is real, as stated by the creator of the show, he is the only \"real\" protagonist of this world, his reactions are spontaneous and sincere. The reality is pushed to (unscrupulous) limits, because unlike other shows, Truman doesn't know he's filmed, he's natural. His life is a fiction, but paradoxically a 'real' one. This is the semantic loophole, unscrupulous TV program managers use to justify the unrealistic aspect of their shows. The script's fascinating brilliance reminds of \"Network\" in the 70's, highlighting many unpleasant aspects of TV Reality, including the viewer's tacit complicity. Indeed, the viewer never minds the scripted aspect of reality as presented in TV programs as long as it improves his personal enjoyment, like for all these people who were assiduously following 'The Truman Show' in all over the world. The second aspect is the subjectivity of reality. Truman, for all his spontaneity and sincerity, was unknowingly following the storyline that producers traced. And all the situations were constructed to make him react according to a script. The process of mediation doesn't prevent from spontaneity, but it undermines its credibility by creating specific situations for premeditated reactions. Like in some programs where two people who don't appreciate each other or whose views totally differ, are both invited just to create a violent verbal confrontation -supposedly unexpected- to please the audience.Finally, the main lesson of the film lies on the climax where Truman, tries to leave the fictional world of Seahaven, materialized by the powerful symbol of a dome painted like a sky. Truman struggles to get outside before he faces the producer of the show. The latter warns him against the dangers of a hostile real world where truth is no worthier than elsewhere, and invites him to join the perfect utopia of Seahaven, where he's a hero. Truman's reaction is very symbolic. He left the cameras' world, like an artist who addresses his fans for the last time, with his famous catchphrase as a farewell, and finally gets out. This last pirouette, sublimated by the thrilling score of the film, earned him the applause of the audience, as if the excitement made them forget that the show was ending. Indeed, when the show was finally interrupted, two viewers quickly recovered from their emotions, and zapped to another program. The end. Truman is a genuine character, who understood the completely artificial status of his stardom. He therefore preferred to leave a charming utopia and face the real world. Television today launches ordinary people at the rank of stars for the simple reason that we, viewers, observed their everyday's moves, the details of their life's banality during weeks or months. But that kind of artificial popularity is inevitably ephemeral: it sinks into oblivion as soon as a new reality show emerges. And that's because camera's point view as depicted in the film, presents the reality in a dangerously subjective way. The 'staging', admitted by the public as it highlights positive values like friendship, fame, success, and empathy is a dangerous emotional depiction of reality. The risk is less for the viewer, who accepts the process, than for the protagonists of these emissions, whose purely artificial and prefabricated fame can lead to deep feelings of frustration later. The emotional excitement is binary, and plays on both positive and negative poles, it may present for the sake of transparency, real people who suffer and live under difficult conditions, whether in the context of stories, talk or reality shows. The danger here is moral, because with this constant clash between reality and fiction, how can we be sure that the depiction of suffering and frustration will inspire the audience positive psychological reactions like compassion and solidarity rather than a voyeuristic sadism mixed with a circumstantial empathy?\"The Truman Show\", denounces the fictionalization of reality, through a remarkable fiction, that makes today's reality look like a less believable fiction",

            "content": "With its (all intentional of course) cheerfully colorful cinematography, cheesy music and one-dimensional supporting characters, it's easy to miss just how brilliant The Truman Show is; it's in fact one of the most important cinematic creations of the 1990's, at least as important as darker films like American History X and Fight Club, and one that works on several different levels. Because while it works quite clearly as a sarcastic satire and a commentary on the destructive and intrusive nature of the media in the post-modern age, in the light of the reality TV syndrome which was at the time just starting to grow, it's also a philosophical metaphor about the state of mankind.For Truman's story is man's story; and it's difficult not to see the importance in the names given to the lead characters. True Man's life, the film says, is an illusion, a lie. Or perhaps \u0096 all our lives are illusions, but the True Man is the one who figures it out and seeks a deeper truth. In its essence the point is very similar to the one The Matrix made; The Truman Show is a fascinating trip through Plato's Cave, and while it takes a rather simplistic look at Plato's philosophy \u0096 because any other way would be impossible in a film of less than two hours \u0096 it doesn't dumb it down. The Truman Show is a deep and intricate film that deserves repeated viewing and gets better with time, and can be discussed for hours.Writer Andrew Niccol \u0096 who made his breakthrough debut one year before with the critically acclaimed cult favorite Gattaca \u0096 lost the Oscar that year to the Academy's favorite Shakespeare In Love, and director Peter Weir got most of the credit for the film; but while it's certainly an important achievement for Weir and the best film of his long career, it's Niccol's sarcastic, intelligent, innovative script that made The Truman Show great; that, and the amazing performance by Jim Carrey, who showed his fantastic dramatic skills here for the first time. Carrey is enchanting in the lead role as the ultimate everyman Truman, and we're as fascinated with him as the show's fans in the film. Praise should also go to Ed Harris, who plays Christof, creator and director of The Truman Show (and again, special attention should be given to the character's name) \u0096 and also to Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natasha McElhone, Harry Shearer, Peter Krause, Paul Giamatti and the rest of the wonderful supporting cast, both in Truman's world of Seahavan and in Christof's 'real' world. Finally, a word of praise for the excellent musical score, composed by Burkhard von Dallwitz and the great Philip Glass, which compliments the film's atmosphere to perfection.The Truman Show is not an easy movie to absorb; it's a disturbing tale and a disturbing message, which takes some time to seep in, and while it's entirely unconvincing as a reality and even as sci-fi, and feels more like a metaphor than a story of a specific man, it's also entirely involving and demands to be taken at face value. Truman's character is irresistibly charming, and just like the people watching The Truman Show, we believe in him and identify with him completely. The beauty of The Truman Show is that it's lots of fun; it proves that entertainment and art are not necessarily opposing ideals. By being entirely entertaining and gripping, it gets its messages across a whole lot better.The Truman Show is now eight years old: the way I see it, once a decade has passed, a film can begins to be considered a classic. The Truman Show will pass that test. In any possible aspect, The Truman Show is one of the absolute best films of the 90's, and one that will remain relevant long after reality TV has bitten the dust.",

            "content": "As many fans know, Jim Carrey is the man when it comes to slapstick comedy. His comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch. But anytime before 1998 I think I can safely say that not many people saw Carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasn't truly in the comedy genre. I definitely didn't see it coming. And to be honest, I wasn't sure if I would really enjoy it. But in the end, I did, not only because of how well Carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if up.The plot is about Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) who is viewed live 24 hours a day, uncensored, as a soap opera to the real world through public broadcasting. The thing is, Truman Burbank is the only one who doesn't know this. Everything else around is all a set-up. And when I mean everything,...everything...is a set-up. Even the sun is fake! Nothing is real. All the people Burbank knows are all actors. People who go through the same routine every day.And that's partially what makes this film so great. Every piece of the \"set\" that Truman Burbank lives in is so believable. Along with this is Christof, acted by Ed Harris. Christof is the creator of Truman's world and he essentially plays God. Everything that Truman Burbank is as a person, was created under the supervision of Christof. The whole story itself, written by Andrew Niccol, brings up the controversial issue of nature vs nurture. Who should have control over whose life. Well I think that answer is obvious.Jim Carrey himself actually does have some comedic moments but it's not because he wants the movie to be a comedy. Carrey does what he does because it is the connection to how a human would react to such a situation that makes it funny. And along with those funny moments comes a real emotional performance. Sure Carrey can deliver laughs but also proves that he can portray human drama. That's a question a lot of people wanted to see if Carrey could pull off and he did it well.Adding to the emotion is composer Philip Glass' score. Yes, it did evoke the right emotions and I don't think it needed a theme either for this particular story. Usually I do, but it didn't seem necessary here. Unfortunately for me, I prefer to see Jim Carrey in his comedic skin. I didn't mind the different role that he took on here but it didn't feel like I was watching the movie I wanted to see. And I'll admit, I put too much thought into believing Jim Carrey would've made the film more comedy than drama, so basically I disappointed myself. So on that note, it could be disappointing to fans of Carrey for his comedic films as well.As the first drama film that comic gut buster Jim Carrey stars in, it is not that bad as some would expect it to be. Carrey can deliver a performance like real human but for the hardcore fans, it may upset.",

He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.Weir, who directed the great 'Witness', uses different camera angles to make you feel like you're actually watching 'The Truman Show' and not a movie. He ends it before you get tired of the concept and helped Carrey and Harris give immaculate performances.

            "content": "I've seen The Truman Show a multitude of times, and each time it gets better. First watching it at a young age (Roughly 10 years old), I never picked up on much of the deeper meaning behind the film. The idea of someone's whole life being a television program was simply entertaining. Now, as an older viewer and with more experience in analyzing books and movies, I can really pick up on the satirical meaning behind the plot. Truman plays the star of a 24/7 television program. His entire life is broadcasted for all the world to see. He is raised to believe that there is no real reason to try and leave his perfect \"island\". Throughout the film, we watch as Truman tries time and time again to discover the truth behind his life, and as he attempts to escape. The struggle he experiences while trying to break free from the artificial world can be seen as a satirical message. The world is trying to oppress you, and although difficult, you can escape. This is supported by a statement made by the creator of the Truman show. He said, \"We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented. It's as simple as that\". Several other hidden messages (Ideas) appear throughout the film. All the actors who play roles in Truman's life, are indeed fake. Despite directly lying to a person whose life is immediately affected by that lie, the actors/actresses show no emotion for Truman. This is comparable to the lack of care society has for the majority of its citizens. Overall, The Truman Show is filled with subliminal messages and hidden meanings, all of which can be directly tied back to daily life.",

            "content": "Having been bandied about the release schedules for the best part of a year, Carrey's first semi-dramatic film finally got a UK release last October. He plays Truman Burbank, a vaguely unhappy insurance salesman in the perfect little seaside town of Seahaven. Following some strange occurrences, Truman starts to think that he is being watched. Little does he know that his entire life is secretly filmed, his town is a gigantic sound-stage, everyone he has ever known was an actor and that his every waking and sleeping second is broadcast around the world as a top-rated docu-soap.Critics have been lavishing enormous praise on this movie since it opened in America last June, and probably rightly so because it is a superbly crafted piece of work. Weir's direction is outstanding, frequently viewing events from the point of view of hidden spy cameras, such as the one in Truman's car radio. One stunning shot has the town's main street full of motionless extras, waiting for Truman to turn the corner. Jim Carrey's performance has been singled out for particular praise, and though his acting is of a much higher standard that his usual comedy antics, it is not exactly Laurence Olivier. This said, an Oscar nomination would have been well deserved.\nThe setting of a chirpy small town from which escape is impossible echoes cult 60's series The Prisoner, but the balance of reality and poetry is much more restrained here than it was then. The opening credits are especially clever, using those of the actual `show' (e.g. Truman Burbank as Himself). There are, however, a few problems. The film is simply too short to adequately explore Truman's situation, and the character of Meryl, his `wife', disappears about half-an-hour from the end. This kind of slightly sloppy scripting was not something I expected from writer Andrew Niccol, whose previous film Gattaca, which he also directed, was such an immediate classic. Gripes aside, this is an extraordinary and highly original film that really is worth seeing several times to fully understand the director's message. It doesn't even matter if you never liked Jim Carrey before. You will now.",

I did not have the pleasure of seeing this until this year, where after seeing Bruce Almighty and becoming somewhat of a Jim Carey fan, I made an effort to watch more of his movies. Truman Show is an instant classic in all the right ways, it's a smart, well acted, somewhat eerie, and utterly unique masterpiece. It also gets better the more you watch it.I don't happen to like the genre of science fiction and nobody could deny Truman Show's got a bit of sci fi but I don't think it really falls under any one genre. What's really scary is the idea-this concept-is not so out there anymore, in today's times, that one could completely rule out that this could ever happen. It's creepy, very much so, in the way that The Original Stepford Wives is but more so in a way, and I wonder about what would be said about the movie had it been released currently, instead of the late 90's when reality TV was just starting to cause a ripple.I first started changing my thoughts on Carey after Bruce Almighty, a great movie (and one that is a lot more thought provoking then many give it credit for.) But as good as he was in that, he simply shines in Truman, everyone does, I loved Laura Linney as Truman's annoying, cold on screen wife Meryl. I've seen many of Linney's movies, this is one of her best.I'd advise people who haven't seen Truman Show to see it more then once-the first time I saw it, I thought it was about an 8 or 9, it grows on you and it's the kind of movie you want to see again as soon as it ends. There are a few frustrating things to be sure, I wish it had not ended so ambiguously, I'd have liked to see more of Truman's life after leaving the set, his relationship with Sylvia and what the other characters were feeling gone into a bit more. Also the audience. Was Truman an instant celebrity when he left or was he quickly forgotten in favor of the next flavor of the month by his devoted audience as is a bit inferred? Truman Show, unlike about 95 percent of movies made, does seem like a sequel could be made, although with how bad most sequels are I'd be a bit wary. Still, any flaws are not enough to prevent a 10 of 10 rating from me, you could be watching this movie for the 50th time and it still seems like it would inspire the same reaction.",

            "content": "The Truman Show may be approached on one level as social satire exposing the emptiness of an American Dream defined by consumerism and purveyed by the electronic media over the last half century. Life in \"Seahaven,\" the vast dome-enclosed set/community in which Truman (Jim Carrey) has been raised under the watchful eyes of a worldwide TV audience of millions, is a sharp and elaborate parody of the corporate sponsored images of middle-class American material bliss and innocence first introduced to mass television audiences through such '50s sitcoms as Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best, and The Donna Reed Show. A closely related target of The Truman Show's satire is the pervasive voyeurism and passivity that has increasingly characterized American social behavior as witnessed in film (ED TV), entertainment television (tell-all talk shows, Reality TV, the talent search genre), and even broadcast news (disaster/victim footage).Yet, on another level, The Truman Show, like Gattaca, The Matrix, Dark City and other more obvious examples of science fiction, deals with broad philosophical themes such as free will versus determinism in human action, subjective versus objective perceptions of reality, the assertion of humanness through existential rebellion, and the quest for an authentic self/ identity. Most immediately, the names and plot functions of the film's two principal characters - \"Christof,\" the megalomaniacal producer/director of a 24/7 reality TV show, and \"Truman,\" the show's eponymous everyman figure - invite the viewer to approach the work allegorically.Legally adopted by a corporation (in a clever parallel to virgin birth), manipulated by the all-seeing all-powerful Christof (Ed Harris) into phony friendship and empty marriage with actor-minions, and psychologically conditioned (i.e. terrorized) into fearing adventure and change, Truman gradually begins to suspect that Seahaven is not the paradise it purports to be. To assert his humanity and escape his artificially prolonged state of childlike ignorance, Truman must ultimately undertake that most mythic of journeys, a Sea Voyage. At its end, he must turn his back on the secure, controlled environment of his \"heavenly\" father's house and step through a forbidding black passageway that leads to the true human condition: emotional and physical risk, scary freedom, and - perhaps - real love. In so doing, Truman ironically brings to his TV audience (whether they are still capable of appreciating it or not) the very affirmation that the false god of television claims they receive from the contrived \"hope and uplift\" pabulum the show has been ladling out for 30 years along with its subliminal primary diet of product placement advertisement. In its climactic scenes, The Truman Show reveals Christof to be neither a social visionary nor a benevolent deity. Rather, we learn he has much in common with Orwell's Big Brother and - allegorically - with the implacable, sadistic god that Melville's Ahab imagines is running things behind the sky's impenetrable veil. By literally rending the heaven of his imprisoning universe, Truman navigates his storm-tossed sailing ship toward a completion of the heroic quest that Ahab's mad distraction (and Melville's theological uncertainty) forestalls: he momentarily frees himself and us from the diabolical/divine puller of the chains of human fate. In its final act, The Truman Show recasts the tragic despair of Moby Dick as comic triumph.",

The could be a conversation going on then one of the actors will just drift to talk about an object in such a manner you wonder if they have lost it, only for you to figure out seconds later that it was an advert in the show, that was very creative.Before making this masterpiece, Jim Carrey had just finish Cable Guy (1996) and Liar Liar (1997).The movie is directed by Peter Weir (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)), who did a great job pulling the viewers along as they watch a movie of a show. Andrew Niccol went ahead to do more great movies from S1m0ne with Al pacino in 2002 to The Terminal with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks in 2004.",

What was so amazing was the fact that they let you in on the secret pretty early instead of leaving it as a twist. So instead of finding out at the end of the movie that it was all staged we find out relatively early which leaves us something else to look forward to: will he ever find out? And if he does, what will he do? Carrey was great as the simple small town happy character. He brought the character to life which made it all work. Truman couldn't be a skeptic, he couldn't be a big dreamer, he couldn't even be a roamer; he had to be the exact type of character he was for it all to work.

            "content": "I remember hearing the briefest of synopsis of 'The Truman Show' in a film magazine that was promoting the next year's upcoming movies. It just read, 'Jim Carrey discovers he's a character in a TV show.' I have to say that that description hardly blew me away as I didn't know what to make of it. Saying it like that makes it sound much more simple and goofy than it really is. I didn't go and see it when it was theatrically released, but after the positive word of mouth it generated, I felt I had to see it for myself.I can't really sum it up any better. Jim Carrey slowly discovers that the world around him is one giant TV set and he's the (unwitting) star, as cameras have been following his life ever since his birth. It was actually a pretty novel concept back in 1998. 'Big Brother' and various other reality TV shows had not yet taken over our airwaves, making this film quite ahead of its time.Carrey plays, 'Truman Burbank,' a happy-go-lucky fella who slowly starts to realise that there's something very wrong with the world and its inhabitants who exist all around him. From there, he slowly begins to unravel the plot for himself. It's all great fun and you really want to root for Truman to succeed in escaping this 'prison/goldfish bowl' he exists in. Jim Carrey is known for his 'larger than life' characters, but I'm pleased to say that he's dialed it down here and is much less manic than his other outings such as 'The Mask' or 'Ace Ventura.'Not just is it a quirky little drama, but it throws in many a dose of healthy social commentary of society and their obsession with television and the characters they spend their lives watching. However, I doubt that the film-makers ever realised how true to life this would all be with the amount of reality TV shows which were to follow it.Personally, I loved it and - despite it being a bit out of date now - I think it holds up perfectly as a warning of our obsession with TV. For what it's worth, I'll mention my friend's thoughts on it. He didn't like it because he thought it was all too far fetched. He felt that if the cameras had been following Truman since birth (approximately thirty years by the time we join him), that would mean the TV show started around 1968 and, back then, studios didn't have the technology to pull this off. I simply disregarded that as a nit-pick. This film is too good to look that deeply into and risk putting yourself off enjoying the ride.I guess I'll leave it up to its 'tagline' to say it best. 'On Air. Unaware.' Well done to the Marketing man who came up with that one!",

            "content": "After being blown away by Fearless, I set out to see more of Peter Weir's work. Along the way I came across The Truman Show. After watching the film, I have nothing but praise for this film. The Truman Show is a truly dazzling and sophisticated satirical comedy drama on media omnipotence that benefits from fine direction and performances. Beautifully scripted by Andrew Niccol and flawlessly directed by Weir, the film is utterly captivating from the start right through to the truly poignant finale. Here Carrey plays Truman Burbank, the star of the world's most popular reality show. The catch is he doesn't know that. Truman believes he lives in Seahaven an island community that is somewhat idyllic, but in reality it is just a set housed in a studio with his friends and family as actors. This realisation and how it comes across is ambitious admittedly, then again I find Weir a fairly ambitious director, but it comes across as brilliant. Aside from the directing, concept and script, the acting really does soar here. Having loved his performances in Liar Liar and The Mask, I was looking forward to seeing Jim Carrey in a more dramatic role, and his restrained performance while funny in parts(in a subtle way in alternative to hysterical) is very sympathetic and moving. Ed Harris is great as Christoff and Laura Linney is outstanding as Meryl. Overall, brilliant film, it is funny but poignant too. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

This film is genius on so many levels.The film follows Truman Burbank, a man living in the perfect world of Seahaven, who is unaware of the fact that his entire world is a large set and he is the star of a grand TV show, known as The Truman Show, created by Christof.If you've only heard the synopsis now and never watched the movie then you must be wondering \"How will this movie work?\". I had the same thought before watching it. After viewing it I can say that The Truman Show is exceptionally made and one of the greatest films ever to come out.What makes this movie undeniably amazing is the direction, screenplay and acting. Peter Weir's direction is simply outstanding. There isn't any moment where you feel bored since the film paces extremely well. The cinematography and shot selection is perfect. Both add to the realism and make the idea of this world being a TV show very believable.The acting all around is fantastic. Jim Carrey plays Truman effortlessly. Aside from the script, Carrey makes the character of Truman believable and lovable with great emotion and personality. Ed Harris was also brillant as the manipulative creator of the show. Everyone else's performances felt real as they pretend to be in the same fictional world as Truman.The most praise I have to give this movie to is Andrew Niccol for giving us this unique and thought provoking script. He has wrote a script that will get people to think because The Truman Show is much more than what it looks like on a surface level. As you dig deeper into the many underlying themes of the movie, that's when you realise how profound it really is. The film's plot is very interpretive. Many viewers will come up with different theories trying to piece together the actual meaning of the movie. There are ideas relating to the way media manipulate people, God, reality shows, desires and much more.The Truman Show is an example of how great cinema can become. Weir and Niccol have done an exceptional job and I applaud their efforts. This is a movie that gets people thinking and highlights many relevant ideas in an entertaining and accessible way for everyone to enjoy.",

Truman Burbank is adopted by a network and his life is on full display 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all without his knowledge. He lives in a giant dome that recreates an island town. To prevent him wanting to leave, as a small child they instill a deep, fierce fear of the water. Every resident of the town is an actor, some of them having been there for the majority of their lives. Every interaction of his life is scripted as best they can, until one day Truman gets an inclination that not is all as it seems. While Truman struggles to find the truth, the world watches on.\nWhile I have enjoyed watching this movie many a time, it does have one flaw, to me.Laura Linney, an actor that I have in all her other roles, seems miscast to me in the part of Truman's forced happy wife. Laura typically plays such a strong female lead that perhaps it was just her having to play an actress cowed into catering to Truman, a person she clearly dislikes, was what I did not like about her here. Were it not for this small flaw I would have given this 10 stars. This is a great look at mass consumption of media and the ultimate greed that is at the core of the human species.",

            "content": "Inspired by 'The Twilight Zone' 1989 episode titled \"Special Service\". This 1998 comedy drama film directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol tells the story of a well-liked small-town insurance salesman, Thurman Burbank (Jim Carrey) slowly finding out that his whole seemingly idyllic life has been a television sitcom that been airing globally around the clock. Without spoiling the movie too much, the influenced of classic 1950s good wholesome American values tv shows are very noticeable on the film's choose of locations, sets and costume design; along with the highly comedic satire style of camera work materialistic commercialism, included with the Cold War fear of visual eavesdropping. The motion picture truly does look like we're viewing our eyes through a colorful Norman Rockwell socially conservative painting at times under its many different surveillance like techniques. Even when the film is looked upon with modern day foresight. Seeing the film through pov cameras in buttons, car radios and mirrors was a very unique watch even if it's a bit over gimmicky and wonky at times. It really does mirror the rise of mass domestic surveillance within America during the late 20th century; as well as the public interest in straightforward voyeurism reality-based television like 'Big Brother'. Both eerily haunting and comedic satire foreshadowing. Well done shooting. Then there are religious analogies. While Truman is viewed from some audiences as Christ like. Even the scene where Truman walks along 'the sky' in the end makes it look like he's walking on water. I think he's more like Adam before the great awakening. The town of Seahaven can be viewed as the modern day Eden with the show creator Christof (Ed Harris) as the patriarchal overlord version of god from the old testament; trying to prevent the 'true man' from having too much free will and being enlighten from the dangerous temptations of the outside world by the woman in red Sylvia (Natascha McElhone), the Eve of the story. Much like Yahweh and the stories of the Great Flood, Christof kept Truman in check by instilling Aquaphobia fears. Other people viewed this act more as a false god or antichrist like the antagonist name suggest, because the deceitful ways he operates. Regardless I'm not really please with those audience members who has taken this movie's interpretations to the extreme often with antisemitism or racist results. I doubt that hatred for a certain people or religion is what the film was going for. Despite that horrible thinking from some, the visuals of Christof's backstage control room are just as rich as the Seahaven set. After all, it has a cameo of composer Philip Glass playing the piano. His score for the film was beautiful. Anyways, you also start to notice a lot more subtle hints that something is not quite right with the studio production in the moon. Foremost, the idea that Christof's value his privacy so much over others to the point, that he crafty hangs up calls from the Hague in order to avoid facing different international judicial bodies for the human rights violations shows how self-sighted he is. The legal problems must be so vast that employees of his are viewing the classifies for other means of work. To add onto that, the majority of the mishaps that happen in the film can be explained by the creator's lazy short sights such as the lack of updating the dome like unfinished bridges to mean Truman's modern standards and allowing camera crew to fool around with basketball hoops and treadmill while working. Along with that, the whole Tru Talk sequence with Christof really does explained a lot without going overboard into lecture dump territory. It gave enough information to suspend our disbelief even if producing a show like this is nearly impossible. It was so well done that the filmmakers use part of the interview for the opening, along with other footage of the inworld cast talking about their roles in a once separate marketing behind the screen mockumentary. While this decision kinda does hurt the suspense as the audience is waiting a while for Burbank to catch up. Revealing Truman's world as a show in the beginning was indeed the right choice. In truth, the filmmakers made a lot of good decisions in the editing like cutting away jarring moments like Truman confronting another homeless person. Honestly if they kept that scene, it would be super weird to think that the creator would allow performers to portray homeless people; seeing that Christof wanted Seahaven to seem like the ideal utopia. Wouldn't many of the show commerical sponsors be against that idea? Anyways, they made the right decision to have the real homeless guy Kirk (Brian Delate) just break into on set, instead of portraying one. Other story changes that work well was getting rid of the teenaged angst version of Thurman in a metropolis like urban settling with the staged rape scene and a boy dying from a car wreck. That's pretty dark. It's disturbing enough to see Thurman overly obsessed and desire a woman he only met one day. Seeing him stalk and make a photo of worship of her was a bit too much. Nevertheless, another great choice the filmmaker did was getting rid of actor Dennis Hooper in the antagonist and replacing him with Harris even if Ed wanted Christof to be a hunchback. Regardless the acting from all the cast was great. Another great decision was inserting moments of outside dome fans watching the show. While the structure can be seemed somewhat fragmented because of that. Nevertheless, it does enhance the film experience; especially in the Plato's \"The Allegory of the cave\" type ending. You'll find yourself rooting for Truman due to herd mentality by the end. The flick was so popular that even a syndrome was named after this movie. Overall: be adventurous, spontaneous & check this film out. It will certainly be worth your time.",

In addition to the really disturbing questions the film raises about the nature of reality, metaphysics, religion, entertainment, human cruelty, voyeurism, and the concept of freedom, the film also offers a glimpse of humanity simultaneously occupying its worst and best aspects.The cast is phenomenally good. Carrey gives Truman the life his rich and sympathetic character he deserves - providing some of the most disturbing comedy I have ever witnessed. Tasha McElhone, Ed Harris, Peter Krause and Laura Linney are all excellent - though you may end up hating most of them for various reasons as the film progresses.Truman's entire life, from his birth onward has been one long TV show. He is literally being broadcast 24/7/365 and he knows nothing of it. His mom, wife, best friend, and everybody around him are all cast members. And the show is shot in a giant set which simulates an island. Because of a traumatic experience with the sea during his childhood, Truman does not feel free to travel away from his island home.Yet Truman is oddly compelled to explore the world and has begun to suspect that something is very wrong. Meanwhile, in what we like to think of as the REAL WORLD, everybody is watching him. People stay home from work to participate vicariously in his life in hopes that they will somehow catch a clue to \"how it will end.\" This film is pretty heavy. You might find it amusing the first time you watch it, but once you've allowed it to exhaust you a few times, all that is left is the superb craft and the intense and disturbing ideas it constantly bombards you with. The film has a dark side and a hopeful, light (but never airy) side which - amazingly - is exposed concurrently with the heavy stuff.The cinematography is as picture-perfect as most of the work Weir is associated with. The acting is remarkably good all around, with those mentioned above in the outstanding roles. Sound is usually a very important component of Weir's films, but it's a little underexploited in the Truman Show - perhaps to (sometimes with painful force) draw the audience's attention to the profoundly insane dialog.The Truman Show is plot heavy, heavy, a little funny, and profoundly smart.

He essentially realizes he's living in a fantasy world and goes on a quest to free himself from this invisibleThis movie plays on not just waking up and challenging everything around us, it shows Dystopian levels that our world is getting much closer and closer too - mass surveillance in the form of facial recognition technology that's trying to be implemented in all retail stores as a way to buy goods instead with our credit cards. It's a form of tracking and monitoring. If you do and say the wrong thing as people in Truman's life that actually were reaching out to tell him he's living a lie are quickly taken off and put back into the real world and the overbearing of an authoritarian Governments looking to control and watch every aspect of our livesIn the movie's case the studio lead by ' The Truman Show's' director - Christof, who controls every aspect of the show, the people around Truman who follow Christof's rules and not actually helping Truman and the show itself. Notice his name - Christof = CHRISTof. They used Jesus's name for this character to appear as omnipotent or thinking he's Jesus himselfSeriously! A kid like Truman who from even before he was born was given to a production company to have his entire life filmed on camera for the world to enjoy 24 hours a day within a studio is just disturbing and a reality show on a whole different levelThe ending to this film is just perfect, it really is.

We as the viewers wanted to see what would happen next but when you think about it. We are as much to blame as the audiences shown in this movie watching Truman still wanting his life to be exposed.An absolute masterpiece with so much hidden meanings and depth, You could even consider this to be a horror movie because this is literally life imitating art.",

            "content": "An engaging, one of a kind fantasy yarn which propels you into a journey into an impossible world, and is one of those \"concept\" movies that stays in the mind (the only other comparable work I can think of at the moment would be GROUNDHOG DAY). In the light of reality shows like BIG BROTHER, THE TRUMAN SHOW is effective in its depiction of an entire world obsessed with one specific television program, which is in itself the ultimate \"reality\" show as it shows the 24-hour day, 7-day a week life of the one guy who's not acting in a sea of fake appearances and pretend people. Blessed with excellent music and a fine, distinctly un-Hollywood director in Peter Weir, this is a film in which the concept can't fail. The script is witty and highly amusing at times, especially when real-life invades the fantasy world and has to be desperately explained away by the producers.Jim Carrey - to be frank, an actor I can't stand - puts in a restrained and adequate performance as Truman, probably the most accessible role for his non-fans. Ed Harris steals his scenes as the frightening, bullish Christof, and the rest of the cast enjoy playing their over-the-top polite and friendly characters for all their worth. With a knowing wink at consumerism and without too much sentimentalising, this is perfect family fare and a must-see little film with a warm heart and the feel-good factor; in all probability it really did deserve the Oscar nominations it received.",

Knowing the premise, I was interested to see how they were going to justify the story.The film is actually incredibly well set-up, explaining in detail how it was possible for Truman to never explore the world. Jim Carrey is also perfectly cast as Truman, and he completely sold his character to me in a not-so-over-the-top comedic and also somewhat dramatic performance. The more I watched, the more addicted I became - like a soapie. This was the whole idea of the movie and it effectively came across as such.Ed Harris is also great in his role as the film's antagonist. 'The Truman Show' is an interesting concept, and they manage to pull it off perfectly. The film also has a beautiful score. Good ending.",

            "content": "Truman Burbank thinks he is an ordinary person doing an ordinary job in a fairly ordinary town... he does not realise that he is the star of a reality show. He has lived in the town of Seahaven all of his life; never suspecting that cameras are watching his every move and that everybody else, including his wife, mother and his friends are merely cast members and that the town itself is under a giant dome. Strange things occasionally happen but excuses are quickly made; for example a falling spotlight is explained away as something that fell from a plane. From an early age Truman has been conditioned so that he won't try to leave the town; the drowning of his father gave him a terror of the sea and any time he thinks about leaving an obstacle appears. Eventually he starts to realise that something is wrong and decides that he must leave to prove that he isn't paranoid.'The Truman Show' is a fine satire of reality television made when the genre was just starting. The idea that Truman might live for thirty years before he realises something isn't right with his world might seem unlikely at first but one has to remember that this reality is all that he has ever known. Jim Carrey can be a bit annoying at times but here he is on top form and gives one of his best performances as the eponymous Truman; he manages to be funny without being silly and makes the viewer sympathise with Truman. Ed Harris is also impressive as Christof, the creator of the show who has directed Truman's entire life and is determined that the show must go on. The reality of Truman's world is fun with lots of digs at modern media; characters talk as though they are in commercial\u0085 which of course they are and a travel agent's shop is decorated with posters guaranteed to put you off flying! There are also touching moments such as Truman falling for an extra who is quickly taken 'off to Fiji' by her 'father'. Not only do we see what is happening to Truman; we are shown the fans of the show who are obsessed with his life which emphasises just how public Truman's life is. Overall I strongly recommend this; the concepts may be quite dark but it is presented in such a way that it can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",

He has been filmed since his days in the womb in the style of 'Big Brother' and he's only just started to suspect that life's not what he thinks it is.The film is very cleverly made, with great use of angles and filters to give the impression of various cameras and the use of Truman's audience to give balance with the real world helps to bring the show to life too. The product placement advertising also makes me laugh.It's probably my favourite Carrey film, as I'm not usually a fan of his and although he only has a relatively small part, Ed Harris gives a great performance too.Can you imagine if they tried to do this today for real?

            "content": "The Truman Show is original and provocative movie that has a place in all our hearts. Jim Carrey breaks his typecast funny man role and becomes a more serious character. Of course there are cute and funny moments, but it is just his kindness and casualness that gets the audience cracking up. It is not meant to be funny, just nice to see. So nice, the audience can't help but smile. The storyline itself is original and suspenseful. It is not meant to be a thriller, it just happens to be exciting.This was before the days of reality TV. Nowadays, almost everything is reality TV. Everybody in reality shows know they're being filmed, but what if they did not? What if literally everything somebody did was being broadcasted to the world 24/7? That is just what The Truman Show is about. Jim Carrey plays Truman who has had a camera on him since birth. He lives on the island he grew upon which is completely fake. Ever since he was a kid, they have tried everything they can to keep him on that island, even going so far as having his father drown to discourage him from ever sailing off. Actors play his friends, sand is fake and everything on the island is controlled. It is amazing to see all of this, and freaky how possible it all is too. The filming of Truman's every move may seem boring, but the world loves it all, as the title character is oblivious and goes about his life as an average joe. After all, Truman just works at a bank like thousands of others. Sympathy grows towards Truman, but his life is so full of joy.Truman is in his thirties and has had a camera on him in his fake world all his life. After a while, would there not be malfunctions or mistakes? It all starts when he sees his father being taken away on a bus. There have been subtle clues his whole life, but nothing he really gave a second look at. As Truman really starts checking out anything unusual, excitement grows as we have no idea what will happen to Truman. Will he escape? Will he stay? The ending is something that may be small, but really has an impact.No matter how you classify The Truman Show, it was always be near the top.4/4",

Despite the fact that most of the film is served as a comedy drama, the film is revealed only when Trueman begins to behave aggressively and the entire staged world falls apart. The script of the film ignores many details that even the most unbiased viewer pays attention to. But this is not done, the message of The Truman Show in another. There is a vivid reflection of modern society in this hypertrophied toy world. The work of Christophe's team reflects the state. The ending of the film leads to the expected climax of Trueman's growing up and sobering up. The Truman Show is a film that deceives the viewer. It can be watched by both a child and an adult viewer and everyone will find something of their own in it. Great movie.",

He doesn't portray the usual goofy comic guy, but this time a simple man who is in the media crossfire, and he doesn't even know it.

Raised entirely 'within' a television show which comprises his entire world, Truman is an Everyman for the post-television age. Truman's world, \"Seahaven\", is an Eisenhower-era model of American bliss, recalling the prison-like Port Meirion and the moral certainty of Bedford Falls (Its a Wonderful Life). Surreptitiously filmed around the clock by 5000 hidden cameras, the show exists inside an enormous geodesic dome with simulated weather and even its own ocean. Through a series of production blunders Truman slowly realises that he is being controlled and that perhaps all in his world is not as it seems. His surrogate father by proxy, 'Christof' the producer/director, goes from being benevolent social scientist to evil genius as his attempts to frustrate Truman's wanderlust become more and more deadly. Will he escape?The film raises some interesting points about our fascination with life as seen through the magnifying lens of tv, and the morality of real lives viewed as so much entertainment. But like most soaps the scenes from \"The Truman Show\" that appear within the movie are variously dull, mawkish and sentimental. At points the film has a problem deciding on whether it is going to be a straight escape-chase movie or a philosophical piece about morality and technology. The t.v. show's inherent blandess also lends little to the pace or our sense that there are characters worth caring about.Carrey is good. This in itself is gratifying, and a tribute to a script that walks the tightrope of imitating bad t.v. in tandem with the metaphysical angst of Truman's unique situation. If it isn't quite the film it could have been, The Truman Show is still pretty much unique in the recent crop from our cultural overlords in Hollywood. No arthouse here, this is a watchable, big-budget think piece, with well-executed and stylish direction. Its too early to say but this film may have given some execs at NBC, ABC et al. one very bad idea...",

This was a good development of his determined, and very go getter type of personality. At the end, before he escapes the studio, he stands there for a while, then he even says his lovely catchphrase \"and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight.\" ending his 30 year show with a bang. 10/10 Absolutely love!",

Really nailed the role he was playing and never really forced out any humour. The character Truman was really likeable and relatable also! Whilst quickly on that topic, the film isn't a comedy really (not a negative at all), but I noticed that Netflix etc list this as a comedy so don't go into this film expecting a typical Carrey comedy.This film is so ahead of it's time its unbelievable. To horde in on the current zeitgeists of todays world (CCTV everywhere, life is a simulation and the TV media and the power they have) and direct a film that's entertaining at the same time is really rare. You often find with these type of social issue films that they focus too much on the messages they are trying to portray and not the plot, this nails both really well. Again, the fact this was made in the 90s is just honestly baffling and if that exact film was made right now it would not only do well, but the messages shown would be hard hitting.Yeah, please watch this film if you haven't already it's great.

And there's all the crew shaping the people in the background, the music, the cinematography as a result of the camerawork and the unforgettable 1 hour and 43 minutes who deserve big points.The Truman Show, the title of the movie and the title of the movie's TV concept, is an excellently written and executed film about an amiable and utterly simple individual who begins to discover his whole life is being staged and recorded for a television program. Already respectable, the entire film and each of its witty ideas is completely original. None of it duplicates the tiniest schemes of previous feature films and no copycat will be understood.What makes it such a surprising film other than how brilliant the story is, how likeable the characters are and how humorous or dramatic it is, it's thought-provoking and does have an unanticipated psychological aspect to it.

So it's no wonder that some people are still thinking about watching the movie and reading reviews, and one of those people used to be me once, and I'm surprised you're reading my reviews out of all the ones. I'm glad you're reading this, and I'll try to give you the best effort for a review possible so you can see whether you'd like this movie or not.The Truman Show can be interpreted as a basic comedy movie to pass time by some but it can also be interpreted as a misunderstood masterpiece because of the specializing in cinematography, subtlety and wittiness in the subject of TV shows. In reality TV shows, people like Truman live in them for basically the entirety of their lives and the only difference is that they are fully aware that they have been living in one while Truman is completely unaware. However, Truman begins to gain suspicion after strange events happen and he begins to suspect things while we, as the viewer, are completely aware that the strange events are because of the fact that he is in a TV show. As usual, Jim Carrey brings his humorous characteristics as he reacts to these strange situations such as product placement, coincidental happenings and bad luck and we, as the viewer, are amused when we watch him in these situations because we know he is in a TV show. While these situations are funny they are actually very thought-provoking and they may question your life itself and how the process of Reality TV Shows work and whether or not the actors in Coronation Street are like Truman - except that they are self-aware of it being a TV Show. We then watch these TV Shows with heaps of effort and we enjoy them, however are we really to care of the impact of TV Shows? After an episode we just flick it onto another channel until dinner is ready.Still not sure whether you will like this or not? Well, if you are a big fan of Jim Carrey's outrageous but intelligent humour then I think you will enjoy this movie. While this is a lot more subtle and thought-provoking in terms of humour than Jim Carrey's previous comedies, it still sticks to the humour we know and love from Jim Carrey however on a lower volume than it is usually played. If you are a fan of thought-provoking, cynical satires then I think you will enjoy this film as well. If you are a fan of good cinematography techniques then I think you'll enjoy analyzing this film. If you simply want to watch a good film then watch this. If you are not a fan of Jim Carrey, satire, cinematography or good films then this film is not for you. Simply put, this film is a comedic masterpiece that may be to some tastes and below others depending on the type of films you usually take interest in, but for me it was a delightful treat that just whizzed past my expectations.",

Its a ending that leaves you wanting more\nTo see where truman goes from is escape. The film leaves you with so many questions.

Next the cinematography was amazing though some critics called it \"awkward\" upon further re watch's I realized that the scenes with \"awkward\" cinematography was actually the hidden camera angles. Next the writing and plot the writing in the beginning feels like a cheesy sitcom yet later it really feels like the actors are freaking out when Truman is starting to realize that he is in a TV show and nothing is real. And the plot is one of last original plots ever created. And the scenes of the \"Director\" in the studio directing the music is a very good scene. And then there is the small details like how close the moon is to Earth and the hidden camera in Truman's ring. And then my favorite part of the movie other than the car scene is a quote that I use everyday \"Oh and incase I don't see you good afternoon good evening and good night\".",

The Truman Show is a film about a man called Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). Who lives a normal life; with his normal job. But he is living in an abnormal world. Because Truman is living in his own world called sea heaven; sea heaven is actually a set and his home and job is all a lie. Truman has a world based around him and what ever he does the citizens of sea heaven have to go along with it. His Mum, Dad, Wife and even his best friend are all actors. The Truman show is filmed with the highest technology in cameras around. Small clip on cameras that can clip on to a jacket and not be seen. But when Truman sees that elevators have 4 men drinking tea in the back of them and that the radio has co-ordinates of his position on it he starts to get suspicious. The Truman Show has been nominated for three Oscars and has won three Baftas. Award winning director peter weir worked with paramount pictures to make this film a masterpiece. The Truman Show is a film that just about makes up for the horrible disasters of Godzilla and Armageddon, this film might be the film of the 90's.The Truman Show had a strict budget of $60 million and earned $125 million in film screenings alone. The Truman Show hasn't got any fancy graphics or any expensive cars or props its just pure film making and passion.Overall the Truman Show is a very good film, but my only criticism is that some of the background actors didn't look like they knew what they were doing. But overall there was no big mistakes in the plot. I would give this a five star rating.",

            "content": "\"The Truman Show\" is an absolutely amazing film that transcends beyond the boundaries of conventional moviemaking and storytelling.  I remember coming out of the theater the night I saw it not knowing how to feel.  Should I laugh?  Should I cry?  Be happy or sad?  It was unbelievable!  The idea of a man's whole life being televised and scripted is certainly an original and creative one, and on the whole, an upsetting one.  It's hard for me to watch Truman Burbank, brilliantly played by Jim Carrey, suffer and be so blatantly deceived and lied to by those he crosses and even lives with.  He doesn't know that his whole life wasn't under his control, until things in the show don't quite go as planned.  A piece of equipment from the set falls from the sky, Truman bumps into his dead father who wandered into the set, and he learns his wife actually hates him.  What really upset me about the film was having to watch all those actors and actresses lie, betray, and deceive Truman.  Worse yet, the fans of the show are cold hearted and cruel enough to keep watching, even at the peak of Truman's suffering.  Of course, that's what people do with movies and TV, watch people go through their trials and tribulations, pains and sufferings.  The only difference here is that the star of the show isn't pretending.  Luckily, he takes action and initiates an escape, while the shows creator battles to keep him on the set.  Finally, in a devastating scene, Truman comes to terms with reality, that he never had a life.  Thankfully, it was redeemed when he proudly walked out of the set and ventured out into the world.  What you may not know is that \"The Truman Show\" is actually a film about God.  The creator's name is Christof, related to Christ, and he orchestrates every day of Truman's life.  \"Don't worry about tomorrow, because God has already taken care of it for you.\" Also, I didn't think Christof was playing God.  I thought it a satirical way, he really was God.  He was the creator of a show that \"gave hope, joy, and inspiration to millions\", as did God with the world and his son Jesus. His wrath and anger was inflicted upon Truman when he tried to leave the set, or the Garden of Eden, and learn the truth about his life, thus receiving the fruit of knowledge.  Christof throws a violent, Biblical storm at Truman, and after Truman survives the storm, he screams out \"Is that the best you can do?\", on his sailboat the Santa Maria, or the Holy Mary.  The ultimate is the ending, where Truman appears to be walking on water towards the stairway to Heaven, not knowing if he is dead or alive or if it's reality or nightmare.  Christof speaks to Truman through the clouds in a deep, God-like voice, telling him that he has been watching him his whole life.  Another aspect of Christof's God-like qualities is that he isn't actually evil, and all he wants is to do what he thinks is best for Truman. \"In my world, you have nothing to fear.\"  A couple of times in the film, Christof pets Truman on the TV screen, a sign of gentleness and love. Finally, Truman gracefully bows before God and walks out of the set, and into the unknown world, thus Adam and Eve leaving the Garden of Eden and venturing out into the real world.  The whole awesome power of the climax brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion.  It's the first time in my life that a film could have such a strong, inspirational impact on me. It really shook me up!  I was deeply upset that this film got a disappointing 2 Academy Award nomination, neither of which won.  Jim Carrey wasn't nominated, although looking back on his career as the rubberfaced maniac who talked out of his ass in Ace Ventura, it's amazing that he was even involved in such an earth shattering film, let alone play the main character.  But he did it.  He gave Truman a likeable, intelligent, curious, and sad quality.  I remember seeing the trailer for the first time in theaters and thinking, \"Oh boy.  Another Jim Carrey comedy.\"  How wrong I was!  This film was a serious, provocative, and inspirational one that put away all the laughter with the exception of the man in the bath tub.  I remember desperately trying not to cry at the climax, watching Truman bang on the wall of the set, learning in a painful instant, the reality of his life.  What would have been really sad is if he never escaped, although an ending like that would be pointless, because the message and the meaning would be lost.  Hopefully, the AFI(American Film Institute) will put this on their list as one of the best films ever made, which I strongly would stand up for and believe it to be true in every sense of the word!",

            "content": "It's been about a decade since this film came out, and the sad truth is, the majority of people haven't learned. Reality TV is not dead, but has rather flourished, and is gradually becoming more and more perverse(indeed making the idea presented here seem almost tame by comparison, which is a very unpleasant notion to consider), digging deeper into the lowest common denominator to grab attention(worse still, it's working), and they are at least as shallow as they've always been, quite possibly worse(I won't claim that I watch them), and costing depth in real people, by abandoning it in favor of more ratings-grabbing \"entertainment\". Niccol is not a man who favors superficiality, or that which seems, at first glance, to be perfect, beautiful, or even right... nor is he one who keeps quiet about his view on said subject. One needs to look no further than two other movies he wrote, Gattaca and S1m0ne, both of which he also directed(he is perhaps less shrill in his protesting in the former and this, compared to S1m0ne). I've not watched much of Weir's work... to this day, only this and Dead Poets Society, which my review will immediately reveal, I did not find to be anything special. Therefore, I don't know whose idea it actually was to let the imaginary hidden cameras be our eye into the world of Truman... whether Niccol had it in the script, or Weir thought it fitting... but I commend and respect whomever thought of it. The score and music are fitting. The acting is good, all-round... Carrey surprises. Harris is marvelous. Carrey may have some sillier moments in this, but it is a film separate from his comedy work. Those seeking his typical brand of humor(which it should be noted, I am somewhat fond of) won't find that satisfied herein. Exposition is delivered with fairly good subtlety. The writing in general is excellent... Niccol hits the mark entirely, and maintains a realistic tone, steering carefully clear of the pitfall of mockery to the point of the ludicrous, which he would later fall into with S1m0ne, and his continued exploration of reality is interesting. I personally make it a point to keep up with what the man is working on. The satire and cleverness found in his work deserves recognition. This, as The Cable Guy, has some social commentary on the viewers, but on the whole, this is by far the superior film(sorry, Ben). It is but saddening that it would seem that the film caused exactly what it may have been trying to prevent. I recommend this to fans of science fiction, Andrew Niccol and Jim Carrey as a dramatic actor. 8/10",

This film was packed full of opportunities to explore the human and emotional issues behind these questions in a powerful and thought-provoking way, but aside from a couple of scenes, failed to do so.Jim Carrey stars as Truman Burbank, whose entire life (since before he was born) has been the subject of a television show. His world (unknown to him) is a huge studio, replete with oceans, artificial weather, etc. Everyone with whom he interacts is an actor hired to play a part. Carrey shows the ability to transcend the usual comedic roles he plays and displays dramatic talent, but either he or the writers (producers, etc.) seem to feel the need to keep falling back on his comedic talent (facial expressions, etc.) rather than allowing the drama of his journey of self-discovery to build. A glimpse of what might have been possible with this movie occurred in the scene where one almost thought he was about to kill the actress playing his wife as he crumbles psychologically with what he recognizes to be the inconsistencies of his life, but there are too few of these powerful moments.This was a good movie, but could have been so much better.",

            "content": "From BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated directed Peter Weir (Witness, Dead Poets Society) this is a fantastic satirical drama comedy film, with a great comedy star taking on a more dramatic turn. The film begins with an interview with Christof (Golden Globe and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Ed Harris) winning, creator of the highly popular reality show called The Truman Show, along with cast members Hannah Gill playing Truman's \"wife\" Meryl (Laura Linney) and his best friend Noah (Noah Emmerich). Then we get to the main story, where since birth, Truman Burbank (Golden Globe winning Jim Carrey) has been the star of the show, only he doesn't know it, and he has lived in his fictional town filled with an all actors cast. On Day 10,909, a TV camera suddenly falls from the sky, and later on character Lauren, played by Sylvia (Natascha McElhone) tries to tell him that everything is fake and everyone is pretending. Very slowly more peculiar things happen to make him believe he is \"part of something\" (e.g. his wife promoting products, he sees his Dad who he saw die, the radio broadcasts his movement, he sees a film crew where the elevator is meant to be, characters circling the block, and when he tries to get away everything the makers can think of are stopping him). The network is the first to legally adopt a child, they have 5000 cameras watching Truman's every moment from the mundane to the monumental, they gave Truman a fear of water when his Dad \"drowned\", and they have no intention on ending. But when they think they have sorted everything bringing back Truman's \"father\" (Brian Delate), Truman tricks the camera and escapes, but not before they find him sailing away from the town. They attempt to scare and stop him with a storm, but he continues till eventually he reaches the studio edge (i.e. the sky). Christof talks to him for the first time when he sees the staircase and exit, and has a little heart to heart to try and make him stay, and when he asks him to say something because he's live to the whole world, Truman says his catchphrase \"In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\" and finally leaves. Also starring Holland Taylor as Truman's mother, Paul Giamatti as Control room director, Spinal Tap's Harry Shearer as Mike Michaelson and Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as Network executive. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Cinematography and Best Special Effects, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Burkhard Von Dallwitz and Philip Glass, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture.

There are many that say that the end of the movie was a cop-out, that he should have gotten revenge. I say it is completely perfect the way it is. It proves that the most basic human instinct is to know, to learn, and to be independent. So many movies try to be revolutionary, to be a metaphor for life and fall woefully short. Sometimes it's because the metaphor doesn't speak the way it should, sometimes it's simply because the quest for profoundness has stripped the movie of its entertainment value. This movie does neither. It speaks volumes, but it's still entertaining. And I don't think there is a movie ending that moves me to tears quite as frequently. I don't think there ever will be.",

They believe that they alone are the center of the universe and everyone and everything that comes in contact with them exist for their own personal benefit and enjoyment. This isn't exactly the idea behind \"The Truman Show\", but it was close, as Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) was born and raised as a corporate entity and marketed to the world as the central character of a thirty year old, twenty four hour a day living soap opera. I guess the picture did the best job it could of providing the viewer with the rationale needed to make this concept work, like throwing up roadblocks in Truman's youth to steer him to certain conclusions about life and it's limitations. On closer examination however, some of those foundations begin to crumble. One of the biggest plot holes for me involved Truman's marriage to Meryl (Laura Linney). Even though presented with a simulated wedding photo showing Meryl's fingers crossed, my thoughts proceeded to the honeymoon and the consummation of their marriage. How did Truman rationalize beyond that point to where the story picks up for us? Still, in an age of realty TV and celebrity 'This and That With the Stars', it was probably only a matter of time before a subject like this was tackled for a provocative film treatment. I wouldn't put it past any large corporation on the scale, say of Exxon Mobil or General Electric, to jump the shark and participate in something as totally over the top as The Truman Show. And sadly, I see no small amount of willing participants eager to sell their souls for a brief moment of fame, glory and wealth. Why I'll bet there's someone out there who would be willing to stage an elaborate high profile courtship, plan a big expensive wedding, and then get divorced after only seventy two days.

No show lasts that long and this show would be rather dull one to watch. This one is at its best when it is more comedy oriented. Unfortunately, it is more of a drama and takes itself to seriously when it should be more fun to watch. Carrey does do a good job in the main role, but Ed Harris is just too bland for me.

Weir's direction is EPIC! Andrew Niccol's screenplay is beautiful. In the acting department, the film belongs to Ed Harris. The Veteran Actor is simply fantastic in a supporting role. Jim Carrey brings Truman alive. The actor, as always, is flawless. Laura Linney is superb in a extended appearance. Noah Emmerich is excellent. Natascha McElhone is effective. Paul Giamatti does a fine job.'The Truman Show' is a must watch. His life is off-air now, re-visit the popular reality show once again, and know his legend. Two Enthusiastic Thumbs Up!",

            "content": "Let's not delude ourselves that THE TRUMAN SHOW is all that iconoclastic , prophetic or mind blowing original . In the late 1960s Nigel Kneale wrote a BBC teleplay called THE YEAR OF THE SEX OLYMPICS where very similar ideas are explored so the central plot of a man having his whole life manipulated and broadcast to billions of watching people isn't all that clever if you're familiar with the works of Nigel Kneale I have to confess that while this movie was released in 1998 a couple of years before reality TV saturated the airwaves of western television i had never seen it until a couple of days ago which means my view of this movie especially its plot is prejudiced by a force fed television diet of ordinary people going about their lives so the idea that billions of people watching a man selling insurance comes across as totally ridiculous to me . We've seen BIG BROTHER become a parody of itself ( And has been parodied in the recent series of DOCTOR WHO ) while other similar shows have suffered from slipping ratings and critical backlash . So it seems ridiculous that billions of people across the globe are compelled to watch a mundane real life show for thirty years Not to be totally negative what the producers have done with THE TRUMAN SHOW is structure it correctly where it's revealed from the outset that Truman Burbank is unwittingly living inside a massive TV studio . If the story had been constructed as a M Night Shymalan type mystery where it's revealed to the audience at the end that it's all a television show this would have been a disaster , can you imagine the word of mouth giving away the ending ? Without hammering it home there is a logic to the motives of producing a show like this - Product placement , and Jim Carrey gives a restrained performance and makes Truman a sympathetic character . But if it's mind blowing prophesy and social commentary you desire then I'm afraid THE TRUMAN SHOW is inferior to THE YEAR OF THE SEX OPLYMPICS",

            "content": "Have you ever stopped and actually looked at your everyday life? Where it's going? Where it's coming from? The people you share it with? The events that have shaped your life right up until this point in time? That's the dilemma Truman Burbank is facing.Truman (Jim Carrey) lives in the idyllic town of Seahaven. The sky is always blue. The people are always friendly. He has a loving wife and mother. It's as if everybody knows everybody. Life couldn't be better. But something is missing from Truman's life in a way he can't explain.Although Truman's life is seemingly perfect, he doesn't get much fulfilment out of it. There's a desire burning in Truman to explore. To see the world. To get out of Seahaven. But most importantly, to find a woman called Sylvia. A woman he grew to love. A woman who filled the void in his life. A woman he has never forgotten.If Truman's life sounds perfect to you, that's because it's been engineered that way. Unknown to him, his entire life is a TV series. A series called The Truman Show.Truman is the star of his own personal reality show. Cameras follow his every move. The town of Seahaven is an elaborate set, and the townspeople are actors. Including Truman's wife and mother! The events of his life are all under the watchful gaze of Christof (Ed Harris), the show's creator and overall overseer. He decides Truman's destiny, his every decision, possibility and train of thought. He controls Truman's dreams and ambitions, broadcasting his life to an audience of millions.The Truman Show is a truly extraordinary film. One of the most daring, thought-provoking and intriguing films to come out of Hollywood in God knows how long. The attention to detail in this film is just amazing, but it's the little things that keep bringing me back, such as the ominous advertising posters dotted around designed to put Truman off travelling.The film has been created in such an intricate way it constantly improves with repeated viewing. The way we follow Truman's exploits are incredible, how the influence of the creators are always around, like the way Truman has been deliberately traumatised to keep him away from the ocean, and thereby discovering the truth.Jim Carrey is the emotional core of the film, and he rises to the challenge admirably. For the most part, he reins himself in, becoming increasingly disturbed as he slowly senses the truth. Little errors and discrepancies such as a stage light seemingly falling out of the sky, stage hands caught putting together sound stages and the conversations of the creators filtering through his car radio start to alert Truman to the truth.The small details of Truman's artificial world really enhance the viewing experience. I like the adverts on TV subliminally suggesting he should stay home instead of thinking of travelling, as well as the creators trying to make good when they've slipped up in their routine. The subtle attempts at brainwashing are everywhere, and send the chilling message of how much power the media has over our lives.Ed Harris also puts in an excellent performance as the megalomaniacal Christof, a man with a Messiah complex. He's been watching every aspect of Truman's life, from the day he was born, and will continue to script his existence till the day he dies. Which may be a day of Christof's own choosing. Another chilling possibility. The possible what if's and maybe's are intriguing, because there is so much potential to this type of situation.One of the most touching aspects to Truman's life is the connection he formed with Sylvia. She was a sympathetic co-star, and tried to reveal the truth to him. But a relationship with her went against Christof's master plan, and you can see the way he's scripted encounters that would lead Truman to marrying another woman, Meryl.So Christof had Sylvia kicked off the show, but she touched Truman's heart, and he spent so many years searching for her. Unsuccessfully, of course. One of the best scenes is during a talk show with Christof about the making of the show. We learn so much about Truman's artificial world, and how much power Christof has over his life. The idea of a corporation buying a child from birth is not only sickening, but also a chilling foreshadowing of what the media will do for ratings. Sylvia has every right to be appalled by this, and the arguments between her and Christof are both compelling and intriguing.As things come to a head, and Truman begins to rebel against his existence in Seahaven, I found myself rooted to the spot. There are seldom films these days that can have that effect on me. Truman on the sea trying to escape, Christof using every means at his disposal to stop him, the people glued to their TV screens. I was practically cheering Truman on.I'll never forget that part at the end, when Truman finally gets out. The look on Christof's face is priceless. He looks a broken man. For the first time in his life, he's lost his power over Truman.But the ending is truly exhilarating, and is the emotional icing on the cake. The only complaint I have with Peter Weir's film is I wish it were a little longer. I would have liked to have seen more of the relationship between Truman and his on-screen wife, and how they cope with their sexual relationship and their jobs.But The Truman Show is still a magnificent film. A wonderful, insightful journey of one man's dreams being observed by the everyday world. As Christof puts it:\"We accept the reality of the world we're presented\".Next time you look in a mirror, make sure you really look. You may not be the only one staring back.",

It's interesting to see him act this way, but frankly it comes off a little on the boring side.The overall concept of the movie is interesting, because its far outside of the box of a normal movie. A man being watched 24/7 on tv, while he lives in a fake world unknowingly. The movie could have taken that plot and made it darker or a lot more funny, instead it was given an even balance which came off slightly boring. I think the real question would be, why would anyone want to sit down and watch this guys life on television. He has such a \"normal\" boring life. Every day he does the same thing, he never fights with the wife, he's always happy, and he sells insurance at a desk. If you were going to make a tv show, you'd think you'd want to spice up the issues to make it interesting. Or perhaps in today's society, 2022, we have become so used to tv shows that have extreme drama, that it's hard to watch the normal.Not a bad show, good acting, some funny stuff, but could have been more extreme.",

No other film (that I know of) compares to it.The film touches me on several levels:Once on the level of fear that something like this could become reality. Not to have a private sphere anymore, because you are always being watched. The thought of such a thing is somehow really scary and sick at the same time and makes me angry. This also brings us to the next level:The anger at what is being done to Truman in the reality show. Christof (Ed Harris), the creator of the show, claims in front of all the viewers that Truman is \"real,\" but how can his life be \"real\" if he is given the path, if he is even given the wife? This is a lie to the audience, to Truman and to himself all at the same time. Then Christoph also claims that Truman could leave at any time if he wanted to. This is also an absolute lie, and every viewer has seen this live. Truman is prevented from leaving by all means, even if Truman could die in the process. By doing so, Christoph would even accept Truman's murder. Fortunately, at the last moment, he had a change of heart, otherwise he would probably have been charged with murder. This brings us to the next level:The level of satisfaction. It is a nice feeling to know that Christoph will get a fat lawsuit on his neck for what he did: Filming someone 24/7 without being asked and even influencing and determining and putting their life in danger and lying to them. Hopefully that will cost the media company billions in fines. Too bad there was never a second part about this.In addition, the movie also makes me sad, because it is sad to see that Truman's \"parents\" who raised him, Truman's \"wife\" who married him and lived with him and had sex with him, Truman's \"best friend\" who grew up with him, all developed no real feelings for Truman at all. None, really none of them feel bad about this \"lie\" of life. That's really sad. Also, it's sad that the authorities in the world just haven't done anything about something like this all these years. It seems like Lauren is the only person on earth who thinks this is unfair, who developed real feelings for Truman, and who warned Truman and told the truth. This brings us to the last feeling the movie creates for me:Joy that Truman manages to break out of this \"mouse cage\" (alive). And it's gratifying that he and Lauren finally get together.Yes, \"The Truman Show\" is a real movie of emotions, and that's what really makes it so great. At the same time, the film is a memorial and finger pointing to the evolution of reality TV shows and the viewers who, like stupid sheep, watch all this crap as if there is nothing more important than watching the \"posed lives\" of others (see Big Brother, Dschungelcamp and other trash).9/10 points - Medium rewatch value.",

The love story is between Truman Burbank and his true self. In his trueness to himself, he cannot accept this reality as presented by Christof. When he starts trying to escape it, things and people start to look more transparent, and he begins to see illusions everywhere.It all starts with a stage light dropping out of the sky onto the street. Whoops! As he is given more and more clues, he starts trying new unpredictable things and observing the towns response. This escalates and it becomes truly fascinating.His obsession with Lauren, or Sylvia as it were, -is- just a little creepy, yes, but just how anyone would respond to being put in this situation is completely up for debate. Just what is the \"correct\" way to respond to this situation anyway? Remember he was born into it. This is his whole life.Christof's response to his escape attempt is indicative of his mindset: Truman is a Christof production--that is, Christof owns him. There was never any doubt that Truman's spirit would overcome everything that'd been programmed into him, because this is the story of a man who refuses to be a product. To be owned. To be a slave. \"You don't have cameras in my mind!\"I saw this for the first time when it came out, and it has remained one of my favorite movies of all time. I found the ending to be stunning, watching this illusion fall like a house of cards is almost spiritual. There are no fancy special effects (other than the aerial view of the Truman's set; any other effects are quite transparent,) no out of control self-indulgent fanciness, no blockbusterism present at all.

            "content": "The Truman Show is a television show about the real life of Truman Burbank, who has lived his entire life in a giant soundstage and who has no idea that his life has been broadcast to the world since his birth. Clearly, this is not a realist film, but if the production of something like The Truman Show were possible, literally and legally, this is probably about what it would look like. However, given the relatively exciting reality of everyday life (exactly what the movies are there to help us escape from),  I doubt that the show would be quite so widely followed, or that it would have such an obsessive fan base. This is a very challenging type of movie to make, and the effectiveness of it reflects the skill of the films creators. As was the case with the Back To The Future series, all of the obvious problems with such a concept are dealt with and the ways that they are solved are explained in the film. You have people trying to let Truman know that his whole life is televised, you have his deathly fear of water (stemming from his father's `drowning' and explaining his failure to leave his happy home even once during his entire life),  and you have things like Truman hearing people on his car radio as they follow his every move, lights falling from the ceiling of the soundstage, etc. All of the \u0091close calls' that you would expect to happen when keeping someone unknowingly trapped in a confined space are presented, and when Truman starts to catch on to the whole thing, the movie really takes off and starts getting really exciting. The Truman Show allows Jim Carrey to engage in several different kinds of acting, even, although briefly, the goofy comedy that he is best known for. But here, he introduces a new kind of comedic acting (at least new for himself), in which he goes along with strange things and pretends not to be weirded out, such as when his wife shows him what she bought at the supermarket, explaining all of its qualities exactly like a TV commercial (`Wow. That's amazing!'), which is intentional because the product placement is the only way to have any kind of commercial in The Truman Show, which runs 24 hours a day. This is tied in with his suspicions about what is really going on when it happens one time in the kitchen of his home, and his wife is talking like a commercial again. This time, Truman comes out and finally speaks what has been on his mind for so long, in a bit of hilarious dialogue that is very effective in the near-thriller story that follows (`What the hell are you talking about? Who are you talking to?!').\nWhen Truman seems to lose it and attack his wife, she screams `Do something!!' and Truman's suspicion's are confirmed. This is a significant scene because not only is Jim Carrey not giving us goofball comedy, but he actually appears menacing, which is totally unexpected given his iconography. Laura Linney plays the role of his intolerably tolerable wife with the incessant smile, and Ed Harris fills in the role of the producer of The Truman Show, in an uncharacteristic but very effective performance. This film is a great example of how an impossible story can be made to work and be fun. Peter Weir lends his direction skills to this unique story, and with great success.",

The predicting power in this respect is the most amazing aspect of this film and tends to squeeze other things to the background.This is a pitty because there is much to marvel at in this film.Think of the right balance between science fiction and comedy.

What if my life isn't real? What if all my friends and family members aren't who they say they are, and I'm just part of some ungodly social experiment? What if my life as I've known it just isn't.. real? For Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) these concerns are very pressing, as he discovers throughout one of the most thoughtful, touching, creative and insightful films ever made. Director Peter Weir works with a script by Andrew Niccol to bring us this now timeless tale of a man existing in a patented pastel world that was never his own and always destined for him. Truman is the unwitting star of his own television show, inducted into its gargantuan studio set since the day of his birth, and conditioned to believe all his life that the people, places and events around him are in fact his real life. Cruel? Perhaps, but the film never takes sides, instead favoring wonder over analytical dissection, a wise move. Even the conductor of this whole absurd symphony, a prolific filmmaker played by Ed Harris, gets his moment of sympathy which can be read as preening ego or the desire to connect with his leading actor beyond the pixelated jumbo- tron he sits behind, depending on how you view the situation. Truman has a lovely wife (Laura Linney), a salt of the earth best friend (Noah Emmerich) and the perfect little white picket fence life. But none of it is real, or at least organic in the sense that every person deserves out of the womb. Truman is a rat in a very elaborate maze, but like anyone who's had the wool pulled over their eyes, eventually he begins to see lights of authenticity piercing the seams. Gradually he begins to sniff out the ruse, like a child losing their innocence, and questions the eerily idyllic life he has been given. The people, or rather, actors in his life react in different ways. Some panic, others stick to the script, and Harris sorrowfully watches his controversial creation awaken beyond his control. Carrey is a starry eyed revelation as Truman, in one of the most overlooked performances of the century. His arc is the stuff of dreams, spanning the lengths of naivete trapped in a bubble that bursts into affecting, starry eyed realization and wonder. Every moment is owned by him, every beat is resoundingly hit in flawless fashion. When a mysterious and beautiful defector (the luminous Natasha Mcelhone) enters his life to play the part of whistle-blower, it's the first genuine and non-puppeteered interaction he's had with a human being. Sparks fly high enough to reach the heavens, and it's the catalyst for a journey to find the self, the reason for his predicament, a world beyond the Lego brick suburbia he has known and the next step in his impossibly unique life. There's a piece of Truman embedded in every viewer beholding, and I believe that's why the film has held up for so long, and been beloved by so many. Every human being has insecurities as large as the fake sound stage that raised him from a pup. Every one of us has at one point felt the alienation he must have gone through upon realizing the truth. In a story so larger than life, we find the answers, or at least a modicum of such, to what it means being a person in this world. Carrey's Truman is an achingly relatable avatar of this and a direct conduit into the essential. Couldn't have picked a better actor to bring all of this to life. Couldn't have made a better film about it. A classic. Good morning, and in case I don't see you: good afternoon, good evening and goodnight.",

In his second work for the cinema, Niccol elevates the cinematographic narrative in elaborating a metalanguage of the main sense that involves cinema: vision. In this story, we look at the life of Truman (Jim Carrey), a friendly insurance salesman who lives on the quiet island of Seahaven. So far, nothing more. However, the truth is that Truman has no idea that his entire life is the subject of the most popular reality show in the entire world: The Truman Show. However, some strange knowledge takes the normality out of the protagonist's routine, raising several doubts about the reality he lives.The objectivity with which Niccol works his story is one of the greatest strengths and also a major flaw of The Truman Show. Mechanically, the screenwriter presents Truman's normal routine, presenting his work, key characters of the meticulously constructed narrative for everyday life and, above all, his enormous fear of water - a fact satisfactorily explained by the use of flashback. Very quickly, the screenwriter already presents the various flaws in the production of the program, making that reality made up more and more superficial. The feeling of paranoia grows, fueling the protagonist's dream of traveling to Fiji, a place that an old flame would have traveled to after being disconnected from the show, after all it was not the romantic interest planned by the megalomaniac director of the show, Christof (Ed Harris dominating the role).It's quite convenient that all of Truman's relationships with others are fake, after all, everyone who lives in Seahaven is just a contract actor. Niccol doesn't mince words to completely transform Truman from a happy citizen to a complete paranoid. The concept is very interesting, bringing to light the truth that despite being the star of the show, Truman has absolutely no control over his destiny. All narratives are created and manipulated with psychological games so that Truman is a slave to the show and, therefore, when he finally decides to travel to see the world, the fabricated reality of the show begins to fragment. Despite its immense size, the world of The Truman Show cannot accommodate other destinations besides the fictional city.It is precisely in the second act that Niccol starts to fail, appealing too much to narrative conveniences, coming close to breaking the suspension of disbelief. Despite rendering comical excerpts and other powerful ones such as Truman's nervous breakdown, Niccol shows the show's production as perfect incompetents showing incomplete sets, official radio broadcasts to direct the actors, in addition to not-so-subtle attitudes to display a complete farce in the functioning of the show. City itself, as if the reality of the show was constructed as Truman passes through the venues - something that yes, makes Christof more complex, but also reveals a general incompetence for the director of the most watched show in the world.The film's messages range from the simplest to the most possibly hidden: from the criticism of an unbridled capitalism that deals with a single life and puts itself above it - see the marks that some characters make a point of highlighting - to the fact that it is common to accept all around without even checking. Is it part of the routine? So it's normal and right. This mistake, which anyone can make daily, has another face: freedom from habits. Thus, Truman's day-to-day life is naturally shown, with his greetings to his neighbors in the morning, his daily trip to the newsagent, his meeting with a couple who, making small talk, only places him in front of a large advertisement pasted on the wall and his work. In fact, in the midst of all this, there are the viewers of that reality show, who have followed the young man for more than 30 years and, for a long time, have only observed his routine. The repetition of Truman's life only reflects the repetition to which those who watch him submit. And it's this power to hypnotize and stick the viewer in front of the TV, which many real reality shows would come to have.As much as the script has a predictable progression - it's obvious from the beginning that Truman will discover that his world is a great farce - the path taken by Niccol's text and the way in which Weir unleashes the discoveries is very intelligent. Added to this is the air of human villainy that Ed Harris bestows on his Christof - full of a paternal affection that, until a few minutes from the end, it is not known whether it is for Truman (who he saw grow up) or for the show itself -, and the cruelty of the construction of a psychological affected by trauma - especially the one that implants the father's death by drowning and makes him terrified of water.What is interesting is that there is indeed a self-consciousness on the part of Niccol regarding the exaggeratedly rapid advance of the narrative. Knowing that he will soon sell out Truman, he presents a new point of view to show the core of the show's backstage, in the room where Christof and much of the broadcast crew reside. Based on this, the screenwriter begins to present the show's ethical problems, other audience reactions that condemn Truman's imprisonment, in addition to showing more incompetence of the production. The core only gains strength when Christof finally reveals the truth to Truman, in the most beautiful scene in the film. Ed Harris and Jim Carrey reach the pinnacle of their performances to show a revolted relationship between creator and creature, but an emotional and very tender speech in which Niccol tests the limits of the spectator's moral judgment, after all what is better? Living in a prison where you will always have everything, free from the ills of the world, but without any privacy or being free and knowing the worst that humanity has to offer? In this philosophical tenor that takes a long time to arrive, Niccol manages to end The Truman Show with a very powerful message.The story does not lose its voyeur taste and obviously plays in this field to attract the public. The expectation common in reality shows is extended to the film, where questions about Truman's future or how the show would end end up being the curiosity that keeps us attentive and this demonstrates Andrew Niccol's great creativity in making use of external experiences. (C. S. Lewis; The Twilight Zone) to flesh out the story and Peter Weir's competence in honestly using the script's acid criticism disguised as carefree entertainment, which, ironically - realize the abyss within the abyss - ends up being the proposal of the movie we see and of his own world, since the criticism of the \"Truman Show\" also exists in the \"world outside the program\", inside the film.Director of photography Peter Biziou knew how to work very well with different types of lens and image projectors, following the general proposal of the production that the dynamics of TV should not depart from the work. Techniques more present in First Cinema such as fisheye or iris imagery (angling or adding dark fades to the edges of the frame to highlight the center) were used to the right extent, as were accurate color corrections for Truman's fictional city and the world. Exterior to it, which we seldom see except through the eyes of the spectators.When we see The Truman Show, we realize that everyone is connected to the character and the show in some way. Whether they agree with Christof's methods or not, everyone watches the program, cheers for the character (each with a personal interest in him, who is nonetheless a semiotic object of desire), expects something from him. Realize that the spectator's relationship with the various media is just one aspect of the work, since the same attitude can be observed in everyday life, of people who \"watch\" others, demand certain postures from it, expect them to win tests, to be something previously organized, written, agreed upon. It's as if Niccol and Weir transferred the show to a scenario where people follow a life they believe to be normal, obeying rules they were not invited to make and allowing the increase of extras and agents who will give continuity and legitimacy to these pre-existing rules and postures. -established. The Truman Show turns out to be our own lives, \"watched\" a little less evidently (or not?) by our institutions.Even so, the tale brought by Weir and Niccol is a cultural phenomenon, with the right to studies from different academic areas, heated discussions about the limits of freedom and privacy. A show airing a show and criticizing the show people paid to see, as well as met aphorizing those people's lives as part of a show as well. Truman, in this whole story, is as real and as fictional as any of us. Our downside is that there's rarely an emotional soundtrack and Philip Glass cameo playing one of our big dates.",

Surely the evil genius behind The Truman Show would have come up with a more creative source of funding...?But we're talking about, what, thirty seconds of footage?  Apart from this `The Truman Show' is a film so finely crafted it sings.  Lovely to look at and intelligent as well.  One of the two peaks of science fiction cinema of the 1990s (the other was `Twelve Monkeys'), but this rather understates the case.  Jim Carrey was inspired casting.  I don't care whether he's technically speaking a good actor or not - he might as well be, since he's perfect as the hothouse-produced Truman Burbank, who doesn't know he's performing in front of a huge audience but who's unconsciously adopted one or two mannerisms of someone who does.Amazingly, some critics have complained about the end, motivated, perhaps, by the vague feeling that no symphony should ever end on a sweet major chord.  Honestly!  Some people wouldn't know a good story if it fell out of the sky and hit them.  The entire film was concerned with the inside of Truman's dome.  We were told, of course, that there was an outside world, as there must be, and we even saw bits of it - but only those bits that were directly connected to the inside of the dome.  When Truman finally, after a GOOD story, dammit, emerges from his egg, the story simply must end: there's no other way to end it.  I hope all those people who wanted to know how Truman will cope with the outside world get their wish.  I hope there's a twee, tiresome, mind-numbingly tedious sequel which tells you everything you want to know.  Serve you right.  You can watch that; I'll watch the breathtaking original again.",

Beyond the creepy, suburbanesque world that Christof created for him is the real world where billions of people watch him day in and day out. One thing that movie does extremely well (although I don't think it was the first) is how eerily prescient it is in predicting the nature of reality TV and its effect on our culture.

            "review_title": "Disturbing, compelling, relevant",
            "content": "I happened along the Truman show when it played on television. Thinking it would simply be another Jim Carrey vehicle (I'm not much of a fan of his outrageously over-the-top style of comedy) I passed it by. When I came across it again, flipping channels, I stopped to watch for a bit. Needless to say, it only took a few minutes until I was completely engrossed in the story, and angry that I had missed the first half of it. Surprisingly enough, while channel surfing later that same night, the same movie was playing yet a second time on the same channel, right after it had finished the first time. What struck me as extraordinary about this chain of events was that it was disturbingly similar to the strange coincidences experienced by the title character of the film. Truman Burbank has lived his life believing himself to be no different than everyone else around him. But after a few strange events happen, and an ever strengthening feeling that the world seems to stop when he isn't around, Truman begins to notice signs that all is not right around him. Unbeknownst to him, Truman Burbank is the most famous man in the world. But sadly enough, it isn't the world he lives in. All his life, Truman has grown up in a completely simulated environment, a gigantic set. Truman has lived for 30 years on television, 24 hours a day. I have to admit - the concept was unique. And the execution was excellent - as we slowly discover Truman's situation, we develop a bad taste in our mouths at the sheer lack of humility it would take for a human being raised for the sole purpose of providing fodder for a television show. We sympathize and pity the innocent Truman, as he makes up feverish solutions for his feeling of being followed, including that his 'dead' father is actually alive, and looking for him. This goes far beyond any cloning moral dilemmas - this is a truly sick concept. Director Peter Weir, who is emerging as one of Hollywood's most talented directors, plays the disgust element regarding Truman's situation strongly. He also provides an interesting portrait of the media and television industries, part satire and part thoughtful reflection. Yet it's hard to believe the 'thoughtful reflection' side when all audiences watching Truman's show seem to be characters straight out of a satire - ditzy restaurant waitresses, a cackling man watching from his bathtub... we can't take these characters seriously enough to reflect on what they represent in our society. Nevertheless, Weir maintains a firm directorial hand throughout; his pacing is superb, and his choices of music are, as usual, unexpected, refreshingly different (droning didgeridoo in the background reminiscent of 'Dead Poet's Society'), and completely succeed in beautifully complementing the film. Weir is no stranger to casting comedic actors in dramatic films, he evoked a similar performance out of Robin Williams in 'Dead Poet's Society'. Here, he manages to morph Jim Carrey from playing the role of Truman as a straight out comedic role into playing a real person, who has the occasional comic moment. Besides being refreshingly subdued, Carrey also turns out a brilliant and consistently watchable performance, which is lucky, since his character in the film parallels his character's role on the TV show. The entire picture revolves around Truman, and Carrey carries (no pun intended) the film with ease. It comes as a let down then, when Carrey lets himself drift ever so slightly over the top at parts, when Truman starts to go hysterical, believing people are following him. In these parts, we start to see Jim Carrey, and not the masterful facade of Truman Burbank he has created.The supporting cast is less developed, also paralleling Truman's TV show, where characters seem to simply float in and out, never really connecting with the lead. The character of Truman's wife, played by Laura Linney, is hastily and sloppily written out of the story, leaving more room for a developing romantic subplot (which, mercifully, is only taken to a certain level) between Truman and a former 'cast member' (Natascha McElhone) whom Truman believes is the only woman he ever loved, and who, in turn, has developed feelings for Truman. But McElhone has one of the flimsiest characterizations in the film, despite how pivotal her character is, only really getting the chance to stare anxiously and complain about how this treatment of Truman is wrong. It's nice to see cameos from Harry Shearer as yet another news anchor, and Paul Giamatti as a show technician, but most of the acting support comes from Ed Harris' masterful performance as Christof, the man who orchestrated and directed virtually every aspect of Truman's artificial life. Harris is spellbinding, overshadowing every actor present except Carrey himself as the character stubbornly refuses to come to terms with the moral issues of his hit TV show.Don't be mistaken into thinking The Truman show is a typical mainstream Jim Carrey comedy vehicle. If you go in expecting this, you are likely to be disappointed. However, if you go in anticipating a thought-provoking masterfully executed film which raises significant moral questions and causes us to strongly re-examine our TV addicted society... you may find that The Truman Show is about as good as you could hope for. If it wasn't for the flimsiness of the supporting characters, the occasional plot hole and Carrey very occasionally drifting into his OTT comedy persona, The Truman Show could easily be the best film of the year. As it is... well, to say the least, it definitely deserves a viewing. And don't be put off by dislike of Jim Carrey - if you didn't like him before, you will now.-9/10",

Much to the dismay of the creator(Ed Harris).In a way, this film has some good commentary. Do we enjoy the shows we watch despite the misery the actors have to endure to entertain us and will we still like them even after the truth's revealed? Even after he leaves, where's he gonna go and what's his life gonna be from then on?While most viewers probably won't think about that, when you watch it a few times it does raise a few questions the more you think about it. It goes without saying but Jim Carey's the highlight of this movie. His acting's over the top but also dramatic when he needs to show confusion or wariness.The antagonist himself isn't really evil. Amoral yes but in a twisted way, he does want what's best for Truman despite making him a virtual prisoner. Some of the gags are hilarious like the hospital scene where he's trying to get through only for a nurse to stop him with some equipment. It would be funny if Carey took it and rolled it away.The ending's pretty thought provoking as well. After he leaves, the bar patrons celebrate while also wondering what they'll watch next. That's an interesting way to end it. This was a great movie to watch. It's funny, thought provoking and clever at times in how it gets its point across. With that being said, watch for yourself.",

Yes there's Carrey's silly side, but here it makes perfect sense in his fictional world with every detail dialled up to eleventy-stupid. It's the sinister underbelly that's that lights the touch-paper though, it's ridiculously troubling, taking a baby, putting him on camera, cutting him off from the real world and fabricating a picket fence utopia without his consent or knowledge. It's the knowledge factor that's key for Truman, not his lack of, but his thirst for. This is Ed Harris' world, his character Cristof's idea of utopia and as Truman grows up, he outgrows the godlike creators vision. Sure there's love too, a longing for someone, but Truman is an explorer, it's in his soul and can't be contained or controlled. It's a film full of spirit, as well as chuckles and twilight zone drama, but it's the rooting for the underdog urge that makes me love this so much. Maybe we see ourself here somehow, don't we all sometimes imagine ourselves as the star in our own show and what is real in our consumer world anyway. \"We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented\", but we all know what's real and what's fake... well just about. This is a fun film, a simple premise, yet feeling utterly original and as over the top and grand as the world it displays. It's cinematic to the core, even boasting a Philip Glass score and is probably my favourite Carrey film (although Eternal Sunshine is great). A joyous ride to the end, with genuine heart in mouth moments. \"Was nothing real?\"... well who knows!",

            "content": "First time I watched this movie was when I was 12. A the time I did not have the tools to completely understand the movie and the message behind it. My girlfriend never watch it, so I took advantage. Jim Carey is surprisingly good and so much different than any other movie: he is less comedic, he does not do his typical funny and strange faces like in \"Ace Ventura\" or \"The Mask\". He was always a very versatile actor. But I consider this one one of his best one, still today.\"The Truman Show\" was made in a period in which television was deeply changing, where reality shows were exploding as a genre. I have always considered this production as a critique of this kind of empty and useless form of entertainment, that unfortunately became so popular and still today is very important for so many networks, as a lot of people watch them. Truman is a prisoner of this kind of entertainment (as a lot of people are), the only difference is that he did not have any choice, while common people can always to turn off the TV. The concept is very original and in my opinion way ahead of many productions at the time.Actors are phenomenal and you can actually see how much fake characters around Truman are, while the main character seems to be the only genuine one, that wants to escape from that golden prison, just to explore the world and reuniting with the true love of his life. This difference is very well highlighted.\"The Truman Show\" is not a movie to underestimate: it may seem a light-hearted, but in reality is far away from that. Managing to treat an important topic like this one, without too much drama and with a brilliant storytelling like this, is not easy at all.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a beautiful film that I've seen countless times. It stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a man who has no idea that his life is being secretly filmed and broadcast to the entire world on TV (hence the title).\nPlot: Truman is an average insurance salesman, with a pretty wife whom he doesn't really love, a fairly large house, and a working class best friend. He's an average upper middle class American. Truman starts to catch on to the fact that something isn't right with his life, because everything's right with his life. It all starts when he sees what he believes to be his supposedly dead father, who was written off of the show when Truman was little. The creator wrote him off as a death at sea, which Truman witnessed as a child, so he's be scared enough to stay on the large island TV set. Truman's determination that he saw his father, alive and well leads him to discover how lots of little things are just slightly off about his life. This crisis leads him to a point near insanity.\nMy thoughts: I'll start with Jim Carrey. Carrey absolutely shines in this role, which was really his first role that wasn't in a wacky comedy. He is very average and relatable, which makes it all the more sad when things start to go wrong (or right, depending on your view) for him. He is fantastically heartbreaking in the final scene, where after riding a boat through the sea, reaches the wall and talks to the creator of the show, Christoph. Christoph is very much a god figure to Truman, since he has controlled every aspect of his life up until now. The movie is incredibly entertaining, and provides a wide range of emotions, from laughter, to nostalgia, to heartbreak. It has some great comedy lines, like \"What's it going to be Meryl, are you gunna slice me, dice me, or peel me?! There are so many choices, aren't there!\" but it also as some genuinely tragic moments, like when it's revealed that the woman Truman really loves was taken away, because she wasn't part of the script, and when Truman reaches the wall and is pounding on it, trying to find some way, any way, to escape. At one point while he's on the boat, Christoph contemplated killing Truman with a storm, and even attempts it, and Truman seems absolutely fine with this. He'd rather die than be confined. The movie also has a very nice message about doing what makes you happy, even when it doesn't conform with your supposed destiny. Overall a fantastic, touching film, and one of the films that got me into movies in the first place at that. I can't think of a single flaw. 10/10",

The idea of having a man grow up in a 50's sitcom-style universe without him knowing it and then show it as a TV-show 24 hours a day is a somewhat perverted idea but everybody in this movie seems to eat it up. It is not that I am against movies with questionable morals but it seems the situation the main character, Truman is in gives everybody some kind of unexplainable Ecstasy. They are almost slobbering at the screen and all they are really seeing is a person who does pretty much what we all do every day.It might seem like an odd way to start this commentary but I can't for the life of me think of a better way. This is no ordinary movie and the premise is somewhat unusual but still I don't know why it is supposed to be so brilliant. A man is followed around by cameras all day and night and doesn't know it. All well and good. But why does the he have to live in a totally artificial universe where everybody he knows is a fake? And why does Christof believe that he is God because he controls the destiny of one man? When Truman begins to suspect that something is wrong, Christof will destroy everything he has created to keep Truman in the universe which no longer exists because Truman has become aware of it.To say that this is a entertaining film would be stretching the truth. If it is an educational film it doesn't teach me anything. Am I supposed to think TV is bad? Please. Why use a movie then to teach the lesson. Am I supposed to think people are drones who follow every direction which is shoved down their throats? Then why sohw it in a movie which is supposed to sell tickets bought by the same people.

Whenever we label something as good or bad or create a preference in our mind, it is due to the coming into being of egoic structures or self-interests. The solution is not to fight for peace or conquer nature, but to simply recognise the truth; that the very existence of the ego structure creates duality, a split between self and other, mine and yours, man and nature, inner and outer. The ego is violence; it requires a barrier, a boundary from the other to be. Without the ego, there is no war against anything. There is no hubris, there is no overreaching nature to create profit. These external crises in our world reflect a severe inner crisis; we don't know who we are. We are wholly identified with our egoic identities, consumed by fears and are cut off from our true nature.

Jim Carrey offers an iconic performance as the naive salesmen, and while being one of his less over-the-top roles, he is able to put a bit of himself into Truman which really takes the character to the next level.\nThis film had an original, well developed concept that was able to convey strong messages and is still light-hearted and comedic. It maintains a good story and morals while also being technically excellent with magnificent cinematography. The shot of Truman walking up the stairs in the sky is one of the most beautiful shots I've ever seen. The story was able to portray many ideas throughout the film that questioned reality itself.\nCristof states \"We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.\", which is very accurate in my opinion. We are put on this earth with no true sense of reality until we are presented with it. Our beliefs manifest from what others tell us to believe. Truman represents society being forced to follow under the beliefs of high power without having any of their own. But upon realization, Truman can break free and move on to a better life.\nChristof is an excellent antagonist. He is said to represent God and how he has control of everyone and everything. I didn't see him as a villain until he overturned Truman's boat, unspokenly admitting that he'd rather have Burbank die than lose his star and TV show. He believed the whole film that he was in the right, never once doubting his ideas or thoughts. To him, his assistants and staff, he was not the villain but the hero; bringing a wonderful show to viewers around the world, to the detriment of Truman's life and freedom.\nWith our current crisis, the world seems to be silent. Our reality feels altered and shifted in a way that seems eternal, similar to Burbank's. But like Truman, we can rise above it all and come out the other side feeling more confident and stronger than ever. Eventually, this will be a blip in our lives and in history, becoming something we can laugh about as I imagine Truman would too.

            "content": "I had heard a little bit of The Truman Show, I was watching a program where they were discussing Jim Carrey's career and they mentioned how The Truman Show was like his first major drama and how well he had performed in it. I never realized that this film was so well liked, especially when I went onto IMDb and people seemed to love this film very much. So of course I rented it at Hollywood Video and watched it last night and I have to say that I have pretty much the same opinion as most of the users, it's a great film that had a great dramatic story with a little dark comedy.Truman Burbank seems to have the most perfect life, he has a beautiful wife, a close nit community, a desk job, and a loving mother. But is it a little too perfect? Especially since everyone always seems to know his name? He meets a girl, Lauren, and they hit it off, but she tells him that she cannot speak to him or \"they'll\" take her away from him, she tells him that his life is a TV show and that his whole life has been a set up. He slowly discovers what his life has been and how it's either too perfect or the dramatics come at the perfect time. But is the world ready to let go of The Truman Show? The Truman Show is a well acted film with an incredible story that I'm more than certain any one could enjoy, it was very charming and had the perfect elements to the plot. Jim Carrey did a terrific job and this movie proved how great he could be in a drama instead of all comedy. Laura Linney was just perfect, I loved her constant details of everything she bought and how she presented it like a commercial. I think you will enjoy this film, it's a good one to watch.8/10",

When I'll think back on the classics of this decade (the 90's) like The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Saving Private Ryan, The Green Mile I'll be adding this movie too.The premise was very simple and yet the way the movie develops itself is fantastic. You basically know from the get-go who Truman is and what's The Truman Show. The Show itself is what surprises you, moves you, inspires you on so many levels. I'll mention some of them: 1. First there's the manipulation theme which by the way mentioning it in my time (the year I write this review) is so relevant and is amazing how a movie 21 years old at this time was able to predict something so big that is sort of happening right now. 2. Then there's the freedom theme which in this instance basically says: don't be what others or what this world may want you to be. Be yourself, find your own unique path! 3. This one is one that basically tormented Hollywood for decades to come and is the Life is a lie thing or Life is irrelevant or Life is meaningless in the way that everything is just on a loop. Everything that happens is not real, that you are living only a scenario or a dream (see Inception).I could go on and on about the whole messages this movie transmits but you get the point. Aside from that the performances are all fantastic especially from Ed Harris and Jim Carrey who gives one of his best ever performances. The only thing distracting from that are his momentarily Ace Ventura- moments, but aside from that is maybe on par with his performance from Eternal Sunshine of the Spottless Mind. The score is fantastic and well suited for this type of movie. Everything else is just flawless and if I were to pick a thing that bothered me or a thing I didn't like I would have to really search and nit pick it.A masterpiece in every way possible that surprised me, inspired me, moved me and entertained me a lot. 10/10",

We would all love to have the world revolve around us, but this film depicts that it can be distressing, as it was for Truman.I thought the movie was one of the best films I have ever seen because of its great acting and unpredictability, but I was deeply upset that this movie was not nominated for Best Picture this year for the Oscars.  C'mon, look at \"The Full Monty\".  That was nominated for Best Picture last year???  I was glad, nonetheless, that it was nominated for Best Director, Supporting Actor (Ed Harris), and Screenplay.

When I revisited this film 5 or 6 years later, I was even more impressed. For one thing, this story has proved very prophetic. How many reality shows dominate the TV today? It also has many allegorical layers that I missed the first time. I think 5 years ago I had a sense of some attempt at symbolism in \"The Truman Show\"; the Ed Harris character is CHRISTos, he's the creator and he's up above over seeing everything. However, the more I watch it, I see Truman Burbank as a Christ figure also: a man singled out, sacrificing his life for the sake of others, a man who knows he does not belong in this world, a man who ascends to his true home at the end of the story in fine \"resurrection\" style. There's even a scene where he appears to be walking on water. Again, it's an entertaining story on the surface level but like Truman himself I hope the viewers can rise above the surface and see a new world.",

Already this week, the CBS network is building up anticipation for Survivor 3: Africa and Big Brother 2 while other broadcast and cable networks follow with much of the same (MTV's REAL WORLD of a few years ago).  In the world of Truman Burbank, the all-seeing, all-knowing (supposedly) Christof plays \"God\" with maniacal gusto.  He's like the Grand Inquisitor in THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV. Director Peter Weir and Original Screenplay author Andrew Niccol have shown convincingly their audience that today's Pop Culture in the light of day is pathologically or at least neurotically obsessed with \"on-camera\" peers who have been manipulated into \"maze-like\" situations and problems. Mainstream TV audiences (according to ratings surveys) want to watch religiously as people are \"voted off\" or \"lose a challenge\" for a weekly dosage of bread and circuses.  From scene to scene, Truman gets tormented, teased and finally caught up in a deadly hurricane as his TV audience sits back and breathes sighs of relief.  He does have one true friend inside his tormenting contrived \"universe\": a beautiful informer-traitor named Sylvia/Lauren who cheers his efforts to find a real world apart from the Land of the Smirks, Patronizing Product Placements, and Constant Surveillance. Will technology and oppressive social control win out over the freedom of the individual to choose to be with honest, enabling others?

Truman's life is a fake reality show, watched by millions of viewers, though he doesn't know that. He lives in the small seaside town of Seahaven, a peaceful place. Truman is married, has a best friend and works as an insurance agent. He has an unnatural fear of water after being in a boating accident in which his father died.One day he boards an elevator and it isn't an elevator; he sees his dead father in town; and a woman has a strange message for him that he doesn't understand. He tries to leave town with his wife, and it simply doesn't happen. The \"reality,\" if there is one, is that Truman doesn't really exist; the town is fake, filled with actors (one of whom, the man who played his father, comes back to make trouble). That person on the bicycle, the passing car, etc., that's on a repeating loop. He has a public he has never met who follow each phase of life with interest. His producer, the man who created Truman, is a man named Christof, who took an illegitimate child and turned him into a media star. When Truman tries to get out, he realizes just how trapped he is.With today's reality shows abounding, \"The Truman Show\" today is even more fascinating than it was in 1998. Here's a reality show that's not a reality - and it makes you wonder about what we're watching on reality shows today. It brings up all the metaphysical questions of who am I and who made me. The film also asks us to take a look at our attraction to the lives of celebrities, where people are merely an image, and where we separate the events of their lives from the actual human being for some good gossip; after all, we only know the persona, not the real person, and we only know what the media reports, not the whole story. In the end we have no idea of what Britney Spears or Madonna or Brangelina are like as people, what they think, what their day to day life is like. In the movie, we know Truman's - and his whole story is false.It's said that a great comedian can do drama, and Jim Carrey is proof of this, giving a brilliant, heartfelt performance as Truman. Ed Harris is fabulous as Christoff, the puppeteer who created Truman and needs him. Such a wonderful film, it demands a second viewing.",

It is a commentary of how engrossed we are in tv and other peoples life and i think it's a good lesson that you have to pursue your dreams to make them happen no matter any fear or obstacle.I have read reviews that talk about the characters being unrealistic and obvious for Truman but i think many if not most watchers agree that Truman is a character that hasn't known anything different and yes maybe the actors wouldn't give up their life for this show but its not the most far fetched idea.I think where the film left off is brilliant it leaves you with the sense of relief for Truman and the movie doesn't talk about his life after but when you sit down and think about it his life would be terrible with his whole life being \"perfect\" in the set up world and him being the most well known person in the world life would be near impossible. But the lack of that in the movie gives you the ability to think.Many call this movie overrated but i think it takes you by surprise how good the movie is the first watch and for me that feeling doesn't leave after multiple watches.",

He\u00b4s married, he\u00b4s got a good job, everything\u00b4s fine. Until the day some strange things happen. Sylvia (Natasha Mc Elhone) - a former actress of the show and Trumans secret love - tries to warn him. He wants to find out, what\u00b4s going on. \"The Truman show\" is the story of a man who tries to break out of his life. He\u00b4s been betrayed for a whole lifetime. Betrayed by actors, who pretended they were his friends. That was the point that moved me most. How far can TV go? It seems that there are almost no limits in these days. Truman had no private life, he was a public man until the day he found out the truth. Christof (Ed Harris), Trumans spiritual father and the creator of the show, said it\u00b4s not the show that is mad, it\u00b4s the real world outside that is mad - Truman lived in a save world where nothing could happen to him.  I could really feel Christof\u00b4s pain - when Truman leaves the show in the ending, it looked like a child that tries to grow up and wants to stand on his own feet, like a child that leaves his father.  Peter Weir, the director of \"Dead poets society\", amazes me ever and ever again. His movies are so uncommercial and \"un-american\" (he\u00b4s australian...), that it\u00b4s a miracle they\u00b4re mostly successful. But also Jim Carrey is a true gift. He shows that he can be a real character-actor. It\u00b4s a shame that this movie was ignored at the academy awards 1999. \"The Truman show\" is a true masterpiece. Poetic, funny and touching.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a remarkable movie. Truman (Jim Carrey) is a character on a TV show whose entire life has been watched by millions worldwide, from birth through adolescence up to the present. Truman is not aware that his world is an artificial one created specifically for the purposes of its director producer Christof (Ed Harris). It is a story of Truman's awakening. And a story about Life. The movie can be taken on several levels. As entertainment, it works as a story which itself has levels.Christof as creator of Truman's world ... is godlike, attempting to create a Paradise for his \"son\".Truman is a \"type\" of ourselves, the existential human condition. He is in a situation, inside the box, in his \"world\", unaware initially of the outside world, of anything beyond...Because Truman is a being with consciousness, he gets \"clues\" that things are not what they seem. Events occur that indicate the way he originally perceived his life is different from the way it really is. Examples include: \u00b7 The studio light falling from the sky \u00b7 The character he falls in love with \u00b7 The strange way his wife does \"commercials\" \u00b7 The re-appearance of his father \u00b7 The technical error when the car radio switches to set directions Truman at one point remarks, \"It feels like the whole world revolves around me somehow.\" The girl he meets (so briefly) and falls in love with... is a type of those who are enlightened, who know that life is more than what we see, think, understand. She seeks to reach him, but he does not understand her words because of his frame of mind. He is trapped inside his mindset.... Ultimately, we are each like Truman. We are unaware, and as a consequence passive about seeking freedom from our situation. Through chance events we become \"awakened\" and begin to notice the periodic clues that tell us that life is more than it appears to be.The result of this awakened consciousness is a decision to act.From my 1985 Journal notes: \"To understand the world we live in, we must first see it as it is, not as we are trained or manipulated to see it. Where do our ideas come from? Ideas about God, about right and wrong, about how we should live... Are they chosen? or...?\"It is interesting that while the world Truman inhabits is counterfeit, the emotions he feels are real. So with ourselves, we do not really perceive things as they really are, but the emotions we feel ~ our fears, hopes, anxieties ~ these are very real. In another sense we are also like the other players in Truman's world: Like the \"extras\" and bit part actors, we tend to get caught up in playing our roles, but not really concerned about the real situations of the persons around us. Our lives can become all script, all \"show\".... In real life, we can be so busy with our \"roles\" that we do not consider others' needs. Truman's \"awakening\" leads to a single overwhelming desire to obtain his freedom from this \"world\" that is his life. Perhaps on another level we are like Christof, manipulating all the sets, all the characters, for a \"higher purpose\".... personal glory. Christof sought ratings. He was a Mastermind.... But in achieving this end he degraded Truman's humanity. All people in the show were his to manipulate. It was his right, he believed, and he was possibly even sincere in his love for Truman, who was a \"son\" to him.At times we ourselves think we have a right to control everything. We each want to be Christof in our own sphere of influence. It is unsettling when one of the characters is unpredictable, doesn't follow the script, does not cooperate with the \"show\". Ultimately, this can lead to a crisis, and the relationships can change. Christof offered Truman a safe, crime-free world... but Truman wanted something more valuable: his freedom.When Truman began his quest he was not even aware of what it was he was escaping from, but he knew he must escape. Ultimately, he was seeking to escape from the Bubble, the Dome, his artificial world. Like Truman we, too, must strive to escape in order to find our true selves and to see what life is all about. Like Truman we have become immersed in a world of illusions. But the Quest cannot be successful without taking risks. Truman's quest became an obsession. In order to escape he had to face his greatest fears, real fears. And it nearly cost him his life. But he found the door, a door he didn't even know existed... and upon walking through to the other side he would find a new understanding as he left behind everything that was known and familiar to embrace the unknown. Little did he know that \"she\" was going to be there.... waiting for him. So, too, with us there are clues, if we would but observe them, that life is more than just the material, physical molecular world. The Scriptures are a book of clues. The \"Grand Design\" of nature presents us with manifold clues. Conscience is a clue. And deep within our hearts, the \"still, small voice.\" \"In case I don't see you.... Good afternoon, good evening, and good night.\"",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a perfect example of how much money a \"high concept\" movie can make. It's also a textbook case of how shallow a high concept movie can be if you don't find the right structure to express the inherent themes. That this movie is being heralded as the most original of summer '98 says more about the sad state of creativity in mainstream Hollywood and the need to sell magazines than it does about the quality of this film.Most screenwriters know that high concept is essential for a script to succeed in mainstream movies. What most don't know is that high concept only gives you two or three fun scenes. Then you have to know how to develop the high concept through opposition and theme to get two hours of great writing.The Truman Show is a story of a man who discovers that his entire life is a television show. This puts us in the realm of social fantasy, an advanced form of fiction that allows the writer to compare social worlds. Fantasy always involves two tracks, the fantasy world and the real world it is commenting upon. Without the real world reference, the fantasy story is clinically interesting, as an act of creativity, but never compelling.When you look at the structure the writer chose for The Truman Show, you see immediately why this movie was doomed to blow most of its immense potential. Instead of starting in the mundane world then going to the fantasy world - as most great fantasies do - the writer chose to have the hero - and the audience - slowly discover that he is living in a fantasy world. That makes the hero a kind of detective solving the mystery of his own life.This choice appears, at first glance, to be a good one. Audiences love a mystery because mysteries give us a clean desire line and a lot of reveals. And a detective story where a man solves the mystery of his own life is a brilliant premise.Problem/Need: But the reality here is much different. The so-called \"coming-to-awareness\" structure causes you to start your hero as a clean slate. He's quite happy with his life before things fall apart. But this means you cannot detail your hero's Need, whether psychological or moral, up front. Since need is the wellspring of any good story, and the source of the self-revelation, this is a serious loss. Truman is portrayed from the beginning as little more than an impossibly cheerful optimist.Desire: The detective structure, in this case, also gives the hero the lowest of all possible Desire lines: to escape. By ending the film with the moment he breaks out of his trap, the author guarantees that this low desire will structure the entire story. And that has a devastating effect on plot. Instead of giving us lots of great reveals, we have only one, repeated time and again: \"I am caught in a fictional world.\" Opponent: Using the detective structure also diminishes the Opponent. In the Detective Class I talk about the negative effects of hiding the opposition. The most serious drawback is that we have no opportunity to contrast the values of the hero and opponent until the end, when it is too late for detailing and texture. In The Truman Show, the director is nothing but an omniscient presence until the end of the film when he spouts a few platitudes about Truman being the star of his own world.Since the opponent in a social fantasy also stands for a larger alternative world, the detective structure makes it impossible to have a deeper comparison between this safe, fictional world and the freer, real world outside.A look at the premiere American social fantasy on film, It's A Wonderful Life, shows how important the right structure is to making the larger themes pay off. It's A Wonderful Life uses an elaborate storytelling structure in order to give us the centerpiece of the film, which is an immediate and highly detailed juxtaposition of the same town under two different sets of values. The Truman Show gives us only one version of the world for the full two hours.Battle, Self-Revelation: No wonder, then, that the Battle and Self-Revelation are anticlimactic and stale. Truman gets smashed in the boat by an all- powerful director and has a simple self-revelation - \"I'd rather be free\" - that was a foregone conclusion from the first reveal.Social fantasy is among the most challenging and satisfying of all story forms, especially in film. But it requires a mastery of craft and theme to fulfill its massive potential. Finding a great high concept premise is the single most important factor in successful Hollywood screen writing. And it certainly made everyone associated with this film a lot of money. But it is not enough for great writing.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com",

            "review_title": "A brilliant example of how subtlety works in film.",
            "content": "Peter Weir is a genius and this film is the best way to prove it.  \"Dead Poets Society\" was a better movie, but it had a better script to work with and better all around acting.  This film rests almost entirely on the shoulders of the more-than-capable Weir.Thinking about the positive points of this film, it looks like a can't miss: 1.  Andrew Niccol's mind providing an idea and a script, but his hands getting nowhere near the camera (he's just too heavy-handed as a director, see \"S1m0ne\" for proof), 2.  Jim Carrey in a dramatic role (the man can act, but he's not funny), and 3.  Peter Weir behind the camera but staying away from the script (\"Green Card\" was okay, but it was a pretty generic script). How could you miss with that?  About the only way to improve upon that would be to bring in Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams, and/or Kellie Martin.Perhaps the most easily overlooked aspect of this film is the brilliant performance of Laura Linney as Meryl.  Her performance is (purposely) more loaded with cheese than many pizzas that I have seen and in fact is the funniest part of the film (which, incidentally, is really a comedy more than a drama or a fantasy).  The cheese goes away only when she is truly disturbed by Truman's actions and asks, \"How can I be expected to carry on under these conditions?  It's just not professional!\"  How's that for a bit of a subtle nudge at actors?However, the film is loaded with good performances, especially including that of Jim \"I need to quit trying to be funny\" Carrey and that of Ed Harris.  [THE NEXT TWO SENTENCES CONTAIN A SPOILER] The look on Harris's face after Truman walks out the door is one of the greatest facial expressions I have ever seen:  One can see in his face that he has lost, essentially, his son and that his child essentially chose to live in another world without him.  The power of that scene cannot be questioned.    Meanwhile, Carrey manages to make his loveably quirky, somewhat dull-witted character very believable throughout the film (though he does not have a scene that gives him the ability to create a look with the power of the aforementioned one by Harris).Yet, the film's power comes mostly from its direction.  Weir knows exactly what he is doing with the camera placement.  In fact, it is almost as though he has been planning this show in reality.  There is never a shot in Seahaven that seems impossible for a camera being used inside the set to portray, and the idea of using the television screens for the cameras in the homes of the average people is amazing.  He even consistently manages to bring out Christof's fatherly relationship to Truman in the scenes in Christof's studio (is that what you'd call it?) with the way Christof is almost always looking down at Truman and other small details like that. While Niccol's screenplay is certainly not bad, even a director like Steven Spielburg probably would have ruined this film.  It had to be Peter Weir and since it was, the film turned out brilliantly.",

It is still beyond how he didn't even get nominated for an oscar when his performance was by far the best of that year. The other oscar worthy performance comes from the great Ed Harris(The Abyss, The Rock). Unlike Carrey, Harris did get nominated for an Academy Award\u00a9(He lost to James Coburn).

Almost everything about it is absorbing, multi-layered, and ultimately inspiring in a way that few movies are. Director Peter Weir uses powerful imagery and riveting performances to tell a timeless story about humankind's unending quest for freedom, with Truman (a \"true man\") at the center. I love the film's story, which uses its ingenious premise to critique a global culture increasingly dominated by celebrity obsession and \"reality\" TV. In a \"post-truth\" environment where the leader of the free world is a former reality TV star, \"The Truman Show\" couldn't be more relevant. The finale is easily one of the best ever in cinema history and Ed Harris' performance is perhaps the finest of his career - the fact that he didn't win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor astounds me.I want to give \"The Truman Show\" a perfect 10/10, but I can't due to the movie's narrative problems. The logic of the film's world (the explanation for how Truman was \"adopted\" by the studio or why Truman never discovered his whole life was a show until his 30s) isn't laid out until the movie's third act, making the central premise hard to believe for most of the film. A basic rule of screenwriting is you're supposed to establish the setting at the beginning, not the end. Of course the movie's premise is so good that I mostly ignore this problem while I watch it, but I'm still left wondering why the State of California allowed a corporation to adopt a child or hold a man against his will - questions the movie never answers. I'm usually willing to overlook plot holes if they don't hurt the overall viewing experience, but even after watching \"The Truman Show\" multiple times I have a hard time finding the central premise believable. I know it's fiction, but even \"Star Wars\" and \"Lord of the Rings\" operate within the suspension of disbelief.\"The Truman Show\" isn't flawless. But so what? Movies don't have to be. Like people we enjoy them despite not being 100% perfect because of the way they make us feel and better appreciate the experience of being human. \"The Truman Show\" inspires me every time I watch it and I can't wait to see it again. 9/10.",

And when he meets a girl in the library she lets the secret out. She takes him to the beach to let him know everything, but its not long before the actors are called in to save the show. This time a man playing a dad to the girl, who saves everything by saying she is mentally ill and drives her away. Truman is left with nothing but questions and an ambiguous mind. He's doubting everything, questioning everything, and starts to think he is going insane. The director of the show is well prepared and got everything figured out to keep Truman in the pretend world that The Truman Show is reliant on. The smartest move of them all, was probably making him and his dad go sailing, killing the dad by creating a storm, and drown the dad. And that would sooner lead to a phobia of water, very clever since the town is surrounded by water, which would make Truman stay there forever. The hidden subjects about, The higher power/god, ownership of our own life and Ethics was in the back of my mind throughout the whole film. It would be unethical to keep someone imprisoned like that, not only that but to share his life with the whole world, showing no respect or giving Truman privacy. The idea of the story that the film is built upon is truly phenomenal, so intriguing. I can't imagine what I would have done if I found out I was the star of a show like \"The Truman Show\".",

            "content": "This is a perfect film. Andrew Niccol, a genius of frightening allegories(Gattacca, S1mone) created a brilliant story of a reality TV show(before we HAD reality TV shows) created by a demented genius known only as Christof(Ed Harris) about the life of Truman Burbank(Jim Carrey, in what is his first and best dramatic role--I can't believe he wasn't nominated!) who lives the American Dream in a picture-perfect island town. From the start, as you see that everyone he meets(or is supposed to meet) is an actor, and people are glued to the TV 24-7 to watch his life unfold. The movie is a frightening tale of manipulation, reality, environment, and a number of other things that haven't come to mind yet. Laura Linney, as Truman's \"nurse\" wife Meryl is hilarious when she picks up an object and speaks to the camera, advertising the item to the audience while Truman just watches, a little bewildered by her enthusiasm. Noah Emerich as Truman's beer-guzzling best friend comes up with some subtle yet humorous lines: \"You've got a DESK job! I'd kill for a desk job.\" Natascha McElhone also shines as the girl who stole his heart, exposed him to the truth, and now is part of a minority of people protesting to free Truman. As Truman's suspicions arise about his life we feel with Truman, we become just as intrigued by his adventures as the people watching him on TV, and perhaps more compasionately. Ed Harris adds subtle charm to his character as a man who admires his art so much, and takes it so seriously, that he has come to forget that he's not God, and that Truman is a person just like everybody else. As long as he can keep him afraid of the water, Truman is a prisoner, never going to Fiji.",

            "content": "Back in 1998, the concept of Jim Carrey appearing in a more serious movie than his usual fare was unthinkable. Surely, the man who gurned his way through Ace Ventura couldn't handle a thoughtful, well-written drama without the shadow of those tropical shirts, ridiculous catchphrases and ludicrous facial expressions looming all over it? Well, while the studio may not have thought so either (consider the marketing campaign which focused mainly on the comedy), the results speak for themselves and established the man as more than just a one-dimensional funny man.Carrey is Truman Burbank, a man with a seemingly great life who just can't shake the feeling something is wrong. His world seems so neat and organised, too perfect to possibly be real and when a camera mysteriously falls from the sky for no immediate reason, it kicks off a chain of events that lead to him questioning the authenticity of his very existence. For unbeknown to him, he is the star attraction of The Truman Show, a program all about his life within a sealed idealistic, Eisenhower era world of apple pie and sunshine and everyone around him is an actor. Every second of his life has been watched by millions.With a concept such as this, it is no surprise that the movie raises a lot of troubling issues. The philosophical nature for instance is not unlike that of The Matrix, in that it is difficult to sit through it without wondering if there are limits to the very world around us. Furthermore, the moral issue of reality TV rears its ugly head, asking us what price we pay when we glamorise the ordinary and make everyday people our entertainment? Sure, Truman has had a good life and is totally safe from harm, but how much of that life did he choose for himself? Carrey of course is a magnetic focal point. He was clearly keen to stretch his very capable acting muscles by this stage in his career, but that isn't to say his comic side has been totally abandoned. Just watch his attempted road trip to New Orleans for example, the man barking and ranting maniacally as he careens almost out of control through town in his car with his hysterical wife on the passenger seat trying to reel him in. It is a very funny moment in the film, but his actions here are brought about not by the inherent zaniness in his personality, but more by the growing frustration at his inability to get out of the town.However, the scene where he really comes into his own comes in the moments following his encounter with his supposedly dead father. Driving to work one morning, his radio malfunctions and after beating the thing with his fists like we've all done at some point, he suddenly picks up radio transmissions detailing his every move. He parks his car and wanders the street, trying to draw attention to himself but failing, even stopping a bus in the middle of the road to no reaction, the occupants simply waiting for him to get out the way. What if he really were the exact centre of the universe and everything else just revolved around him? That isn't to say this is a one man show however. Laura Linney as his wife Meryl is also well cast, her wholesome nature at first being very sweet, then growing ever more troubling as Carrey's paranoia escalates. Then of course there's Ed Harris as the eye in the sky directing his every move. At first, he is a benign guiding influence crafting a Utopian vision for his progeny. But then the child begins to resist the father and events spiral out of control, soon Harris has become a fascist dictator denying Truman the choices he so desperately needs to make himself.As a whole then, The Truman Show is a rewarding experience. It contains one of Carrey's finest dramatic turns to date and while we can revel in the philosophical and moral issues at work here, it can also be enjoyed simply as a very charming and uplifting movie. Come the climax, I doubt there'll be a dry eye in the house.",

            "content": "Some general comments about the grave injustice of this film being robbed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would obviously be unnecessary due to the high amounts of people demanding an explanation for the inexplicable lack of a Best Picture Oscar nomination for this film. So let me just go about in praising this film: \"The Truman Show\" was definitely the best movie of 1998 and one of the five best of the decade, behind \"Pulp Fiction\", \"Goodfellas\", \"Schindler's List\" and \"Forrest Gump\".  What struck me about the film is just how meticulous everything was.  Andrew Niccol and Peter Weir really thought everything out to its fullest dimension!  It took me two viewings to appreciate this film's greatness, but the scene that will always strike me is just how carefully orchestrated Truman's moonlight stroll by the beach with Lauren/Sylvia is used to elicit an emotional reaction.  Chopin's \"Piano Concerto No. 1 in E Minor\" has never sounded so melancholy and beautiful as this wonderful scene, and the breathtaking imagery and careful build-up to Truman's makeshift assemblage of her face is one of the most impressive and subtle plot developments I have EVER seen. Weir does not bang us over the head with this film, unlike some films that were inexplicably crowned with the sheath of greatness (namely \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\" or \"Saving Private Ryan\"...a well-made film, no doubt, but not the greatest war film ever made).  Whoever claims that this film could have been more missed the point of subtlety that this film was trying to get across...what did you want, Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis suddenly appearing on the screen to deliver some Oliver Stone-style message on violence or the JFK conspiracy?  The film's climax is one of the most surreal and strangely moving pieces of cinema I have EVER seen, and just the way Carrey enunciates a pained \"Was nothing real?\" to Ed Harris was worth an Oscar nomination alone.  Give me Carrey's nuanced performance over the contortions and muggings of Benigni anyday, a trait he must have inherited from...Carrey himself!  Oh well, to give this film the recognition it deserves would be to misrepresent the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a sincere, incisive group of people instead of the smug and sanctimonious group of bootlickers they truly are.",

It really explores this interesting formula to a significant degree, unlike some movies that often fail to deliver their full potential, we see Truman disovering the truth about his world and struggling to uncover it, we also get to see the effect the Truman show has had on the world and, the most complex part of the film, how they have managed to make the show work for all the years of Truman's life, there was no aspect that felt unexplored. The cast is outstanding and were all very able to act with this unusual storyline, Jim Carrey delivers one of the finest roles of his career, being able to showcase his talent for both comedy and drama, he has some hilarious parts, but also plays a very complicated, complex character very effectively. Carrey is also joined by talents such as the great, underrated Ed Harris, playing a man obsesssd with the world he has created, Natascha McElhone shines as a woman who has fallen for a man she can never be with, while Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich play two actors struggling to hide the truth from Truman, stellar acting all around. Funny, dramatic, intense, whimsical and simply fun, I find it hard to understand what I have done to deserve a movie as beautiful as the Truman Show.

Truman Burbank is unknowingly in a hit reality show where his life and world is fabricated. He starts to find odd idiosyncrasies in his day to day routine that makes him question the legitimacy of his world. Straight up, this is Jim Carrey's best film and best performance. He controls his usual animated comedic mannerisms to create an understated and emotionally captivating performance. Peter Weir's direction is also compelling, utilising hidden cameras in this false reality to enhance the TV show-like qualities, making the experience feel real. But what really puts The Truman Show on the map is the concept. I've seen this a good few times, and every single viewing gives me a sense of euphoria. The ending might be slightly underwhelming but when we get to the final five minutes, it's like we've completed a quest! Me and Truman, together. The narrative evokes many themes. The idea of our lives being dictated by a higher power. The right to have the freedom of choice. Exploring the concept of fate and destiny. Is it subtle? No, but it doesn't need to be. That's the point of the plot. I adored the small details that reality shows include, like product placements. Laura Linney staring at the camera talking about cocoa...it's a thing of beauty and kinda makes me want to buy some. The natural progression of Truman discovering unusual happenings was well paced and all the loose ends were tied up nicely.

Today, economic interests drive everything, and the proliferation of business logic has forced us to play with ourselves. We have to entertain ourselves and sell our money, privacy, freedom and even life in the moment of revelry.",

            "content": "Haven't you ever wondered what it would be like to be the star of your very own \"Truman Show\"? Have you ever wondered if you in fact are?Imagine for a moment a documentary, featuring one Debbie Samuels who you remember as that girl you liked in the ninth grade and once thought she liked you. Only here she is a disgruntled ex-actress named Morgana Windemere, who complains about how the writers once told her to give you significant glances, then suddenly decided to \"go in a different direction.\"\"I thought I was going to be the co-star, you know, the girlfriend, but then they said I wasn't working. Even though HE liked me. They made me snub him in the cafeteria and then said my family moved to Canada. Not even a farewell episode.\" Elsewhere on the show, onetime childhood bullies complain about the unlovable characters they had to portray. \"All the writers ever did with that guy was have us beat him up,\" one complains. \"They said it was good for the ratings.\" The concept of \"The Truman Show\" is a lot of fun. Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, who gradually comes to realize he is in fact being watched by everyone in the sheltered community of Shorehaven where he has spent all his life. Indeed, there is a reason why Truman's wife approvingly holds up household products in the middle of dinner conversations, and why the travel agency features posters showing planes struck by lightning: He is the unknowing star of his own sitcom.I wish I enjoyed the movie as much. Though funny in parts, it is more of a wet-eyed spectacle featuring an often-serious Jim Carrey staring upward in one of those \"what-does-it-all-mean\" poses that has marked too much of director Peter Weir's work since \"Dead Poets' Society. Aiming for maximum uplift, the film sometimes forgets to keep its feet on the ground.The film is in many ways like \"Being There,\" the fragile but brilliant Peter Sellers comedy with a similarly minor key classical music score. But \"The Truman Show\" is less sure of what it wants to be. At times, it's a broad satire on modern life, like when Truman watches people walking by his house and figures out they are on a loop. At other times, it goes for a more realistic bent, with a group of people who advocate Truman's release (including Natascha McElhone as Lauren, Truman's version of my Debbie Samuels) and a headstrong director with a God complex, named Christof naturally enough and played by Ed Harris.\"We know how jealously you guard your privacy,\" a smug TV commentator (Harry Shearer) begins a rare interview with Christof, ironic of course given Christof's treatment of Truman.More comedy could have been mined from the concept of Truman, but comedy is not Weir's forte and except for that travel agency and a scene where Truman watches his wife in surgery, the film plays it straight.Still, Truman makes you think even if it doesn't make you laugh, and there's a satisfying conclusion that teases out the metaphysical concepts the movie has played with all along. It's manipulative, yes, but genuinely clever. If it doesn't make you look extra hard in your bathroom mirror the next morning, maybe you're just looking into the wrong camera.",

Jim Carrey turns in a great performance as Truman Burbank, who spends 30 years living his life in a TV show before realizing what's going on. It's not what you might expect from a Jim Carrey movie. There is no slapstick gross-out humor in the film. The movie is a drama that has some funny parts, but it is not intended to be a comedy. Not that that's a bad thing. In fact, it's a very good thing. There was nothing weak about Carrey's part in this movie. It proves that Jim Carrey is a truly gifted actor, unlike so many others who have made their name in slapstick comedy (Adam Sandler...). Carrey shows that he has a wide range of talents, and pulls of the dramatic acting without a hitch.Of course, there's more to the movie that just Jim Carrey. Peter Weir does a great directing job, giving us the views from the cameras that watch Truman's life. It works very well. And the supporting cast turn in great performances as well, especially Ed Harris as Christof, the director of the show. Of course, the other actors are overshadowed by Carrey's performance, but they still do a great job.\"Touching\" might not be a word commonly associated with Jim Carrey films, but this one is. It has sad parts, it has happy parts...it is just a great drama. The only thing it doesn't have is the slapstick humor that got Jim Carrey famous. And I for one don't miss it. See this movie, it is truly great. Everyone involved does a great job, and Jim Carrey establishes himself as one of the best actors of our time, maybe of any time.Rating: 10/10",

But when was the last time you saw the Star Ship Enterprise (or Voyager) flying over earth ? Its a great fantasy movie, thats all it is. The acting in this movie is superb, especially that of Jim Carry and Ed Harris. Ed Harris' character is so evil, the way he thinks he knows what's best for Truman.

            "content": "The Truman Show is a fantasy film that was released back in 1998. The first thing that caught my attention was the concept of this film. The concept of this film was related to the influence of media in everyday life. The Truman Show is about a person called Truman Burbank who lives in a small island called Seahaven near the coast of Florida where nothing really happens. Everything in life almost perfect, but certain events of the past often disturb his feelings towards the life he lives. The sudden turn of events and suspicious happenings around him makes him more curious to discover the world he lives in. Therefore, Truman sets out on his voyage to unlock the mysterious happenings and seeks for the answers to his questions. The first person to be credited is story writer Andrew Niccol who also co-produced this film. His writing showed futuristic thinking and thought provoking ideas that were quite absent at that time zone. Director Peter Weir should be given a huge congratulation for taking up this story and delivering it in great fashion which entertaining, engaging, thought provoking and heartwarming at the end. The film starts in a slow pace as editing were quite sloppy and elevation of scenes which potentially confuses its viewers. As time went on, the introductory of characters and comic timing of the dialogues really pulled me into whole scenario of weird behaviors of each and every character in the film. The curiosity to know the answers to Truman's questions slowly crept into me and the only reason could be the ever relate-able Truman's character to real life and again, full credits had to go to Peter Weir for creating a great character that could gain our sympathy.The next thing which I was really impressed with is the dialogues of this film which was co-jointly written by Andrew Niccol and Peter Weir. The dialogues in the film really worked well with every character in the film especially in the comedy department that gave good laughs throughout the film. Coming to the backbone of this film, Jim Carrey who absolutely carried this film as his child. Jim Carrey lived as Truman in this film. The smartness, stupidity and curiosity were shown in his ever expressive face and the ambiance of his expressions could be felt throughout the film which made it a more amazing experience. Jim Carrey was the only actor that could pull off this role with such perfection. Hats off.Supporting casts in the film like Noah Emmerich and Ed Harris had important roles in the film and played them really well. The more important among them was Ed Harris' character in the film. A sense of seriousness enters the screen every time he shows up just because of his menacing and hard look throughout the film. The cast is roundly superb even if the majority of them are in minor roles. The cinematography of Peter Biziou was great all along, my favorites were the scenes at the sea and aerial shots at night. The editing of this film was good overall despite feeling slightly off place and sloppy at times. The only reason is the inconsistent screenplay of this film especially in the first hour. Some scenes were elevated in a slow pace which made the film a bit lengthy. This is the only drawback in this filmOverall, The Truman Show is a mind boggling futuristic piece of film making that is thought provoking and entertaining at the same time. It might not have won anything at the Academy Awards, but it certainly won hearts of millions watching it. This is one of those movies which is a classified classic, certainly worth watching a few times, hats off to the makers.",

Truman's entire life, since the day of his birth, has been orchestrated on a giant television studio set, the only world Truman knows, and televised worldwide as \"The Truman Show.\"  Truman represents something impossibly difficult to find in our society today: an absolutely innocent person.  This goes a long way to explain his public's fascination with him.  Ed Harris brings a bizarre dignity and ethic to his portrayal of Christos, the god-like creator and director of \"The Truman Show.\"  This delicately beautiful film shows us the utter hypocrisy of our media and the herd-like docility with which we accept that very hypocrisy.

It's a perfect film.  The acting is great, the screenplay is phenomenal, and it is a very deep and symbolic movie.  I've seen it seven times and I pick up something new every time I watch it.  Even the title character's name, \"Truman Burbank,\" is oxymoronic and symbolic.  He is a \"true man\" who is the product of Hollywood.  You can even spot a few allusions to the crucifixion when Christof tries to stop Truman from escaping by flipping his boat.  The depiction of a Utopian society reminded me of Alduous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" a world were freedom did not truly exist even though the citizens thought it did.  Why did they not do anything?  It's just like Christof said in a memorable and disturbing quote: \"We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.\"  This cynicism is thrown at you one last time in the final scene of the movie.

Everything we watch on screen are virtually entertainment for us whether it is about two people yelling and fighting on the street or a reality show about god knows what. I love how the picture let us see that in the final scene where, after everyone had finished cheering for Truman's escape, they immediately just continued to deliberating which channels or shows to watch next. In other words, they never really cared about Truman's life and freedom or his desire to escape, they only see it as a part of their entertainment. Truman's happiness, sadness, struggles are nothing more than just entertainment and good TV for the audience. Additionally, if I may add, I love how Truman didn't care or inquire much about what is the real world like - for all he knows, the real world could be a dystopian wasteland and humans in chains, but regardless he just wanted to be anything by a spectacle, anything but living in a surreal and superficial world. Both the two points I observed above just shows this picture as having more aspects than just about \"living in a fake world\" and the filmmakers did a stupendous job at writing that out for us.",

I pray that a storyline like Truman's stays in the movies and isn't transfered to reality TV.  Anyway, bottom line, this is an exellent movie that really makes you think.  Jim Carrey proves his talent beyond comedy with this role.",

A \"world\" entirely encased in a very large dome, with a large lake and even sunrise, sunset, and weather!  So we must look for a deeper meaning to this film. To me, it is a re-statement of the old saw \"it is better to be free and risk the perils of life than to be confined and protected in an artificial world.\"  (Hmmm ... maybe that applies to wild animals too - maybe we should abolish zoos!?) Carrey's character, Truman, as a 30-yr-old adult whose life has been a live TV show, 24/7, for 30 years. It started with \"one\" camera, but now there are over 5,000 in Truman's world. He begins to suspect his world is not real, that all the friends and aquaintances are actors, that his whole life is \"just a TV show!\" This is revealed fairly early in the film, and the rest of the film we watch the development of his understanding of his situation, and eventually his plan to \"escape\", or die trying.  Just like the chickens in the more recent film, \"Chicken Run.\"A renegade actor tells him it is all a fake. He studies an old photo of his wedding and sees his wife's fingers are crossed.  He changes his daily routine and sees a fake elevator in one building. He begins to notice that the same people, cars, and bicycles simply go around the blocks and repeat. A funny scene, which you can only appreciate if you've been in a film as a cast member or extra, the \"directors\" tell all the people in the street, \"first positions, everyone\", and they all hold their positions, waiting for \"action.\"In an interview with the reclusive \"Christo\" (Ed Harris) he explains that Truman was one of 5 unwanted babies due to be born, and he was selected because his birth was at the right time, nothing else. He had a pretend dad who later pretended to drown, as a way to make Truman scared of water and hopefully prevent his exploring too widely.  Was it cruel for a corporation to adopt this baby, then use him for a show? Christo's p.o.v. was that Truman had a much better life this way. The film is very well done, and Carrey does some of his best work here in a \"serious\" role. The preise is fascinating, and the way it is depicted remains very interesting all the way to the end. I rate it a very strong \"8\" of 10.",

I really had high expectations for the film that was supposingly \"robbed\" of a Best Picture Nomination. I must say I felt let down.Anyone who thinks that Jim Carrey's performance is Oscar-worthy is insanely out of their mind. Saying that is similar to asking why Tom Hanks didn't get an Oscar nod for \"The 'burbs.\" Carrey gives a decent performance that to me differed in no way from any of the performances that he has done before. There are still elements of his comic side (scene in which he drives around in circles trying to foil the other cars) present here and he really never comes through with any element of real drama, it all seems fake. However, who knows? Hanks started his acting career by doing mainly comedies until Philadelphia and look what happened to him.The film itself is directed well by Peter Weir who I felt had so much potential to use other interesting facets of the life of Truman. It seems that we are given a quick intro into the life of Truman and are all too quickly rushed into his ploy to get out of the dome and fly to Fiji. If only the first half of the film was devoted to what life is like for Truman and some of the neat ways everything that he does ends up on camera, this film could have been much better. We are hardly introduced to his family, friend and co-workers before the film turns on itself and leaves a lot of interesting issues untouched.The Truman show is a good film overall, however, not even close to the near-greatness achieved in two of the Best Picture nominees that I have seen so far (Saving Private Ryan, Shakespeare In Love). I guess I'll have to look to EdTV for more of what I was looking for.7/10 stars.",

I had the honor of watching this great film several years ago in a college psychology class, and loved it. The basic idea of the film is that a man who believe what he is experiencing the real world, is in fact a staged TV show that has been going on for years and has no idea about it.The film itself is unique because to my knowledge nothing like this has been done before until EdTV, but that was different. The movie itself brings up an interesting point. Is everything that we do in life just part of some gran scheme and somebody is watching out lives. This film also has a quote that I would like to point out \"We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.\" This quote itself imo sums up the entire film. We don't question the reality that exists as we see it. We accept it, but how do we know it's real. How do we know it's not some person's dream and that once they wake up we die? We don't know that, nobody knows. We just accept it and deal with it. Truman doesn't question at first the world he is in. Little by little he questions the system and overall learns about his \"wolrd\" that he lives in.If you have not seen this film then I would strong suggest you watch it, especially those who have psychology background.",

For good and for bad, it is very different and a unique movie experience.In general, \"The Truman Show\" is okay but far from perfection. Some moments are a bit boring. It was directed by Peter Weir, the same guy who directed \"Dead Poets Society\".\"The Truman Show\" is a movie which makes us question this: \u00abWhat if my whole life was nothing more than just a reality-show? What if my whole life was just a television program? What if the whole world knew everything about me and my life?\u00bb.That's exactly what happens with the character Truman Burbank. He doesn't know about this, but as the movie runs he suspects that something's wrong and slowly he finds out the truth. He also finds out that even his wife, his best friend Marlon and most people he knows are actually hired actors. However, Sylvia (Truman's dream woman) is the only one who supports him and feels ashamed about what they are doing to Truman.Jim Carrey does a great job as Truman Burbank. However, Jim Carrey is hilarious as usual in this movie but at the same time he does a very good job as a dramatic actor. Yes, this was his first dramatic role ever, which was a challenge for Jim Carrey, but ended up as a victory.Ed Harris is great as well in the role of the arrogant program's creator Christof. But the other actors do a good job either.This movie is distinguish for being so different and fresh, but at the same time it has the power of letting me paranoid. It's notorious how after this movie came out lots of reality-shows were made (naturally inspired by this movie's idea).This movie looks simple in many ways, but it also has some amazing and original things: a perfect sunset, a nice and lovely town (Seahaven), beautiful sceneries, stunning views of Seahaven surrounded by the sea, the moon which is Christof's studio, different and good camera angles which give us the impression that Truman is being watched (including from the inside of the electronic climate controls of Truman's car - somebody explain me how did they do that?), the rain falling on Truman, the incredible storm caused by Christof's selfish orders and even that final part - when Truman walks through the sea and Christof talks to him from the sky. That final part is so well made that we can consider it magical.By the way, I can't finish my review without talking about the soundtrack. This movie has brilliant and very smooth classical music by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. It's so beautiful and wonderful!

Even fewer are ones that are memorable and push the limit in terms of inventive creativity and pure originality. \"The Truman Show\" is such a tour de force. It is a film that is hard to describe. It is not quite a comedy though it is funny. Neither is it a drama though there are dramatic elements to it. \"The Truman Show\" can be a genre of its own: fantasy, science-fiction, comedy, drama, adventure, thriller--all fit into this movie. It is that unique. As a feeble attempt to explain the plot, this movie is about a man who lives a seemingly ordinary, middle-class life in suburbia, who happens to be filmed from every angle imaginable. The catch, he does not know about it. As bizarre factors begin to take place, he starts to question his identity and life around him. Like the millions of viewers who turn in to see Mr. Truman, we too are fascinated as to what he does next and \"how it will end.\" Jim Carrey as Truman turns in perhaps his greatest performance (although Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was pretty good too). His trademark humor is left out and he becomes this individual trapped in a world that is beyond his control. The supporting cast is very solid, particularly Ed Harris as Christoph, the man behind the curtain so to speak. However, it is Carrey who steals the show, I mean, it is about him after all. Besides the acting, Peter Weir's direction is sublime, the visual effects are impressive, the editing is well-paced, and the score is simply astounding. If I had to make one criticism about the movie, that is its abrupt ending. That aside, I consider \"The Truman Show\" to be one of the most creative films ever made and one of my favorites. Way better than \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Shakespeare in Love.\"",

I haven't seen such a bizarre idea be the main story of a film since Transformers ( however that film wasn't good). In bizarre I don't mean dumb or stupid, but more like interesting, and boy is it interesting. This opening is different to most films I've seen, it shows the cast of the actors characters \"acting\" in an interview, which is good because it is already treating itself like a movie, and unlike Truman, they all know they're being watched. In the beginning of the film you get to see lots of product placement, when Truman is saying hello to his neighbors it shows the ideal neighbor, then when Truman meets the twins, one of them pushes him in front of a poster which shows some sort of chicken dinner, later in the day he is in the garden when his lover shows him a brand new kitchen knife and showing all the features like a commercial, and also when your introduced to his best friend who is drinking a beer and says \"now that's a beer\" or something like that. One thing I noticed about this film is that it is very smart, Like when a light falls from the sky they later say that it was a part of an airplane, well since he's always being watched the director can make sure Truman doesn't suspect anything, and I should be more specific in that this director is smart. I saw that this was listed under comedy, which I didn't get at first, but if the point was to be satirical, then it did a perfect job.

Back then, it was considered a vast departure for Jim Carrey, seeing as he's only been in comedies such as the Ace Ventura movies. In retrospect, \"The Truman Show\" was only a harbinger of the kind of acting he could do. But it wasn't his movie alone, Andrew Niccol's script and Peter Weir's direction and the rest of the cast that make this movie work on so many levels.One level in which \"The Truman Show,\" along with its counterpart, \"Ed TV\" works, is that both movies pre-date the whole \"reality TV\" craze by a good 2 or 3 years. Oh, we had \"The Real World\" but that was the extent of it...this was before MTV was milking its incarnations for all its worth, and definitely before \"Survivor,\" \"The Simple Life,\" and those \"Celebreality\" shows on VH1. The scenes in which people react to the things Truman does and hang on his every movement is no different than how people tune in for the next episode of \"Survivor\" waiting on who will be \"voted off the island.\" Another theme that is evident in the movie is the desire for absolute control as shown in the character of Christof. He has structured Truman's world as to who could or couldn't talk to him, using any means necessary to keep him on the island, and ultimately losing. While it seems that Christof has a connection to Truman, he is merely a means to an end, which is a televised life, from cradle to grave.One thing that I need to point out again is Jim Carrey's acting. \"The Truman Show\" is his first serious role, departing from the sight-gag movies of his earlier career. His acting is so reserved, and yet, there are funny moments of his, but it doesn't break from the tone of the movie or his overall character. Everyone was caught by surprise in this apparent 180, especially film critic duo Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. They were so impressed by Carrey that they publicly apologized to him for panning \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.\" Overall, this movie, I like to fall under the category one of the best films ever made. On my hierarchy of movies, I would put this under \"Worth full price/add this to your DVD collection.\" Grade: A+",

            "content": "This is an intriguing film. Truman is in his mid or late 20s when we get to him in the present. The idea is that he was one of several children born from mothers who gave away their children for adoption at birth. He was the first one to be born and as such became adopted by the corporation represented by Christof, the director or this show. Suspend your disbelief a lot because the fact that he lived in this artificial cinema setting all his life, which means went to school on a daily basis and to college to get his qualification for his job, is a pure illusionary impossibility. It is maybe easier to make a few hundred people live in this community with only one real inhabitant, Truman, and all the others actors who have to be unionized in a way or another and hence cannot work more than a certain certainly limited number of hours a day and a week and a month and a year. And what about the population of a school from grade 1 to grade 12, not to speak of the full population of a college. I will not consider the legal side of things. This abduction and total retention of a minor and then an adult in an artificial environment is pure imprisonment, which means totally illegal, and when Christof says Truman could leave anytime he wanted, it is an absolute lie since when Truman finally tries he is nearly killed by Christof's own decisions and acts. That amounts to the inhumane torturing of a grown up by another grownup with a whole bunch of accomplices pushing the buttons. This has to be said because everything in this show is REAL, really REAL. Not just Truman, but all the others. They are maybe a fake illusion for Truman but they are real actors and actresses, really acting on command, prompted by earplugs in constant relation with the studio. Instances of Christof's dictating to an actor what he had to say is even provided. It is all an illusion and a delusion for Truman, but it is all true. And I repeat totally impossible because beyond any material credibility and what's more beyond any human rights as for Truman, and in fact as for everyone in the film. Apart from Truman, they all behave either as criminals or accomplices of criminals.But we have to accept to enter the film to find a deeper meaning in the story.The first element is the delusional world in which Truman is forced to live. It has one motto written on a couple of arches: \"Unus pro Omnibus, Omnes pro Uno.\" This motto is old and was first used within some religious conflict in Bohemia in 1618. It is also a traditional motto in Switzerland, but not in Latin. In German \"Einer f\u00fcr alle, Alle f\u00fcr einen.\" In French \"Un pour tous, tous pour un.\" In Italian \"Uno per tutti, tutti per uno.\" And in Romansch \"In per tuts, tuts per in.\" The motto is generally translated into English as \"One for all, all for one.\" It is particularly famous because it is the motto of the famed and heroic though hilarious (three) Musketeers staged by Alexandre Dumas along with d'Artagnan. This motto is immediately visually amplified by the name of the store on the corner of the street in front of these arches, Omnicol, though I do not know what this store might be selling.This motto is very ethical and is obviously in full contradiction with real life where it is always everyone for oneself. This community, Seahaven, the very well named place because it is a haven and even a heavenly haven to its residents. Imagine keeping up with this illusion that this is a harbor (Le Havre in France) on a sea with no possible traffic, ships, and even the ferry is only a prop on the set. The only boat ever really shown is the boat in which Truman's father will die in a storm in front of Truman's eyes. And then at the end, the second boat will be Truman's escape boat in which he will nearly die by the decision of Christof himself who could not accept the escape with a cynical remark of his that sounds like a death sentence: Network Executive: For God's sake, Chris! The whole world is watching. We can't let him die in front of a live audience! Christof: He was born in front of a live audience.At this moment Christof himself is showing the reverse motto: everyone is supposed to do what he wants, even Truman who may die if necessary to satisfy the selfish ambition of the power freak and the control freak Christof is. His name is the very antagonistic reference to Christ \u2013 he is an Antichrist \u2013 who is supposed to die for everyone and not the reverse. In fact, he is more like Ponce Pilate, thus turning Truman into the Christ of the story to be sacrificed for the interest of the show that is supposed not to die, since the show must go on, as Shakespeare said a long time ago. But this is a film and that's what makes the show a pure fable. The director of the film systematically creates a distance between Truman's experience and ours, the audience's experience, of Truman's fate. The public is shown as having a tremendous level of empathy for that young man who is going to be sacrificed on the altar of a reality TV show. [. . . ]Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",

Though its pace is consistent, never reaching fever pitch, its concept is ground breaking and its storyline magnificent. Jim Carrey is Truman Burbank, an ordinary man, living in an ordinary world. At least that's how he defines his world, for unknown to him, he is the star of the world's most popular television show, 'The Truman Show', which has captured on film every second of his thirty year existence. Everyone he knows are actors, every situation that arises is perfectly choreographed. The idea behind The Truman Show is genius, as was the casting of Carrey in the title role. All too often criticised for his slapstick style in movies such as 'Ace Ventura' and 'Dumb and Dumber', Carrey puts on the performance of a lifetime as Burbank, whose life begins to collapse around him. Also of note are performances by Laura Linney as Truman's 'stage' wife who finds it increasingly difficult to cope with Truman's developing ambition to discover life beyond his manufactured world, and by Ed Harris as Christof, who has single-handedly created and moulded Truman's articifial world. The brilliance of The Truman Show is that it works on so many levels, and plays up to man's greatest fear: that his world is not so secure and perfect as it appears. The Truman Show is astounding cinema. See it. Be Thrilled. See it again.",

            "content": "In the Truman Show, we follow the life of Truman, someone who was adopted by a film corporation at birth and lives as the focus of the most famous reality TV show, without even knowing it. This show is on 24/7, following every little detail of Truman's life. His little town is all he knows, and for years, he is okay with it. Since he is the star of the show, he is the center of attention of the town. Eventually this fact sticks out to him; Truman starts to figure out that something isn't right and decides to do something about it. He tries to escape, but he encounters many obstacles keeping him on the TV show's island. This movie inflates the idea of how far we will go for our own pleasure. In the movie, the whole world knows about the TV show, that the main actor is being watched 24/7 without knowing it, and that his life is being controlled by the cast and directors, yet they do nothing about it. In fact, they don't want to do anything about it; they enjoy it. Truman has no privacy, but no one seems to care; it must be alright since they are getting entertainment out of it, right? The movie also uses irony to convince the audience of flaws in our society. When Truman is struggling in his life, he turns to his \"best friend\" who talks to him using the director's words spoken to him over his earpiece. One of the most ironic line in the movie, in my opinion, was when Truman's best friend turns to him during a serious conversation and says, \"The last thing I would ever do is lie to you,\". This is ironic, because of course as he says this, he is lying. He is trying to convince Truman that he is just thinking crazy thoughts and everything is normal, when he actually knows that the whole world is watching is life play out. The Truman Show really makes us reflect on our lives; how far do we go for our own pleasure? It uses many satirical elements to convince us of this flaw. At first, while watching the movie, we find it crazy and over-the-top at this world's crazy idea of reality TV. When we stop and think about it, it makes us wonder how far-fetched it really is.",

He plays Truman Burbank, a normal white collar suburbanite who works in real estate and leads a simple normal life. However, his life is anything but normal. From the moment of his birth, his entire life has been shown on television live and unedited to an audience around the world, the island he lives on is a gigantic sound stage, with close to 5000 cameras, and with the great wall of China is one of two man made structures still visible from space, his wife, best friend, the people he works with, and the people he sees everyday are all just actors. The most amazing thing about this innovative premise is the fact that Truman is completely unaware of all of this. The premise of this film is how he finds out about the reality of his life, and how to escape this prison.The Truman Show is Peter Weir's finest film ever, and the always excellent Ed Harris who plays The Truman Show director, Christof gives his best performance since Glengarry Glen Ross. Jim Carrey gave the best performance that I have seen in 1998, and Laura Linney  provided some comic relief as an over acting actress playing Truman's wife. As the #2 film of 1998 (next to Saving Private Ryan), and one of the 10 greatest films of the 1990's, The Truman Show ranks as one of my top 30 favorite films of all time. This is a film that truly deserves a 5 star rating. Comedy, drama, romance, and even suspense, this film as something for everyone, and is one of those rare films that has something for everyone, it even has an important moral message behind it. The fact that life is too sacred and precious to be entertainment for someone else.This is one of the most uniquely original motion pictures that I have seen in a long time.

A man discovers, at the age of 30, that his life has been entirely a manipulated television show, and the world around him a stage set and the people around him actors.

Director Christof does not merely want to keep his show alive; Truman was an unwanted baby, and Christof deliberately wants to keep Truman in his cocoon world to prevent him seeing the world outside and how bad it is, and does everything he could to discourage Truman from wanting to leave.Basically, the story is predictable. Once Truman knows the world around him is manipulated, why would he bother to stay? If he can leave the cocoon, why wouldn't he, if he is a normal, healthy man? Really, with everything spoiled, the whole point of the show is lost, and there is no way things could have ended otherwise, so the story's end is actually anticlimactic.",

Married to the beautiful Meryl (Laura Linney)he seems to be just fine.But as he leaves for work, a piece of lighting equipment falls from a clear blue sky. You soon realize that Truman's life is far from fine.And that is the premise of \"The Truman Show,\" directed by Peter Weir. Truman wants to leave his town of Seahaven and see the world, but he slowly realizes that the town doesn't want him to leave. And with good reason. He is the star of an incredibly popular worldwide show, only he doesn't know this.His whole life, from womb to man, has been televised. Created by Christof (Ed Harris), the town people (Including his wife and parents)are actors, each one of them manipulating Truman's emotions and responses. Christof even creates a way to keep Truman from leaving: His \"father\" died in a boating accident, causing young Truman to be afraid of water.But as much as Christof can try to control Truman, he fails. Truman becomes rebellious, trying desperately to escape his existence. More importantly, he is in love with a girl named Lauren(Natascha McElhone), who he met in school, but was taken away (She tried to tell Truman the truth).In one of the film's most dramatic scenes, Truman has escaped the town by sailboat, conquering his fear of the water. Christof, playing God to the end, calls upon the elements to stop him (sun, storms,lightning), trying to crush the very thing that he created. When Truman reaches the end of the line (In the form of a sky blue wall), Christof speaks to him from the sky as like the voice of God, trying to coax him to remain.In a world in which every network has at least 1 reality television show, \"The Truman Show\" is not as effective as when it was first released. However, you may say that the film may have brought home the point that we as viewers are fascinated with watching someone else's life unfold in front of our eyes.Carrey's performance is incredible, clearly showing he has dramatic range. It's too bad that he can't do this more often, but audiences prefer him to make them laugh instead.For the longest, I had a huge beef with the way it ended, in which Truman walks through the door and out of the show forever. I had wished they could have shown us what would happen after he left. However, I finally understood why they did not. Truman had been trapped by fear (the fear of water, for example). When Christof talks to Truman, trying to convince him to stay, he tells Truman that the world he is about to enter is different from the world he is leaving: the real world is full of lies, deceit and horrors. Truman's world is a place where none of those fears exist. When Truman steps through the door, going into the real world, you realize that Truman has truly conquered his fears after all. He steps into this brave new world, unafraid of what will happen to him. Still, it would have been nice for us to see him reunite with Lauren/Sylvia. But deep down, you know that they will.

However, he is unaware that his whole life has been turned into a TV show in which every move he makes and everything he says is being observed by millions of people around the world. Following a chance encounter, Truman begins to realise that everything isn't as it seems and that maybe his life isn't quite as ordinary as he first thought.I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey, but for some reason this is one film that I've overlooked since its release in 1998. The concept of the film is interesting and I have a feeling that this film will age rather well. At the moment we are in the grip of several reality shows and the Truman Show, in parts, clearly satirises the reality show genres. The camera cuts from time to time to show various groups of people utterly engrossed in what they are watching - this element is believable as I honestly do believe that there are people who can't do without their fix of Made In Chelsea or The Only Way is Essex (UK reality shows)or Keeping Up With the Kardashians as an American equivalent. The Truman Show demonstrates this in a humorous, but subtle manner.The Truman Show for me just seemed to get everything right; the script was intelligent, but it was also cohesive. The plot was straight forward, but it also managed to be touching and moving. Truman Burbank was such a likable person that it's impossible not to care for his character. About halfway through the film there is a 5 minute segment which explains how the Truman Show came about and once you know the 'truth' about Truman you'll care for both him and his cause all the more.Jim Carrey proves here that he is a much more talented actor than some give him credit for. His zany OTT comedic acting style that we've seen in films such as 'The Mask', 'Liar Liar' and the Ace Ventura films are certainly not to everyone's taste, but I happen to like this style of acting and think he's a very funny man. Carrey gives a much more restrained performance here and his performance perfectly suits the tone of this film. Carrey's strong performance and tight script combine together to make this a pretty much flawless film. The cinematography and directing were also top notch. Ed Harris was also superb as the Creator/Director, but he's only given limited screen time.The ending of the film was suitably uplifting and I can honestly say that this is one of the few films I've seen where I didn't want it to end. The Truman Show is a wonderful film which combines humour, satire, intelligence, a good script, and also manages to be touching and uplifting. It's a rare example of a film which not only felt too short, but also left me with a big smile on my face. The Truman Show is a film that simply has to be seen.",

Jim Carrey ultimately fails to deliver.

What could have been a very powerful movie dealing with the pressures of life and the changes of aging is ultimately reduced to a hollow, meaningless study of its star. Since the material does not allow Jim Carrey to do that at which he truly excels--outrageous physical comedy--he looks and feels very stiff and very miscast.

Have an open mind while watching this. While the film is easily a drama, it is actually quite funny. Watch it expecting a comedy, and you'll hate it. Watch it expecting a thought- provoking drama, and you'll find it to be just that, and you'll often laugh out loud.Everyone is familiar with the story somehow. Truman (Jim Carrey) is an ordinary man, living in a town, Seahaven Island, that defines the term \"too perfect to be true,\" and he has never left it. What he doesn't realize is that the town is actually built inside a giant TV studio, and over 5000 cameras are placed within the town, broadcasting Truman's entire life as an iconic, wildly popular TV show, that plays 24/7, and is controlled by a producer known as Christof (Ed Harris). Truman has never known that he is the most famous man alive, as every telltale sign that might reveal it is cleverly covered up by the controllers, and every one of Truman's friends and \"family\" are just actors who probably have no true compassion for Truman. The movie follows the show up until Truman's eventual discovery of his situation, and his attempts to escape.One fun thing to do after you watch this film is to watch Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. This is a great way to see just how talented Jim Carrey is. He was robbed at the Oscars this year, as his performance was dead on. While he plays it straight, there is the occasional glimpse of his style of comedy, especially in a rather intense scene where he gives his \"wife\" several hints that he knows about his fake world. His behavior in that scene will provide some relief for people who were expecting a Jim Carrey laugh-fest. One thing that makes his performance in the movie better than the rest is that Jim Carrey is the only one playing a real person. Every line said by anyone else around him (besides the controllers) is staged. Everyone besides Jim are playing actors. That isn't saying that everyone else is bad. Everyone else is terrific. Truman's wife (Laura Linney) is the second best performance. She is a brilliant actress playing a suspiciously bad actress. You have to see it to believe it.In spite of all the drama, the movie is actually (subtly) hilarious. Sight gags (all related to the plot) are frequently visible, as is the behavior of everyone around Truman when they get suspicious that he knows his world is fake. Truman's wife constantly describes household products to Truman as if she were a rejected audition for a badly written commercial. Truman doesn't seem to notice this (yet). Travel agencies are filled with posters warning people of the deadly hazards of flying on an airplane. The fact that these type of sight gags are rarely acknowledged is one source of humor. Also, the thought of what's going through the actor's heads as Truman approaches them with travel plans are rather funny. The best sequence of the movie is a talk show interview with Christof, which gives us a behind the scenes look at the show, and answers many of the biggest questions we may have about the technical details of Truman's life.The combination of humor with the drama of the amazing story ultimately leaves the viewer with a lifted spirit, and looking at the world a whole new way. I recommend this thought- provoking, moving, entertaining, and arguably hilarious film to everybody and give it a 10/10.It is rated PG for Thematic Elements and Mild Language.

If you haven't seen this film... do it now.  It is worth a lot more than the 103 minutes of your time it is asking... a whole lot more!",

The place he lives is in fact a big studio with hidden cameras everywhere, and all his friends and people around him, are actors who play their roles in the most popular TV-series in the world: The Truman Show. Truman thinks that he is an ordinary man with an ordinary life and has no idea about how he is exploited. Until one day... he finds out everything. Will he react?Hmmm\u0085let me see where to start with this movie. It was weird but wasn't that weird compared to other movies. And it was disappointing. I expected more from this kind of plot. The plot was excellent, but the execution wasn't all that great nor interesting to catch my attention.I was actually quite bored within the first twenty five minutes until the plot started moving. Yeah, it started getting interesting but still, wasn't interesting enough. It felt way too long, for some reason and slightly boring. I really tried to like this movie. I really wanted to but it didn't work for me.The performance by Jim Carrey was good and sometimes funny, giving us a comedic relief. Laura Linney's performance was weird and Noah Emmerich's decent. The cinematography was fresh and original, since it's like Big Brother all over again. There are some surprising plot elements which caught my attention.This was a good movie with a good score but, I expected a little more of an \"oomph\". Some people might not need it and some people might do but either way, it isn't bad. If you want to see Carrey in a serious role, here's the time.",

            "content": "I used the last days of December to watch some films, that had impressed me about a decade ago. The film The Truman Show was among them. Around 2000 I watched The Truman Show several times, and tried to analyze its contents. Like many modern movies, it contains an ambiguous message. Obviously the leading theme is the obtrusive invasion of our private life by the producers of television programs. The common life of individual people is transformed into entertainment, not just in the form of a single commentary, but by means of regular (weekly or even daily) broadcastings. At the time this type of entertainment was still a novelty. I even remember that shortly after The Truman Show a similar film about the topic was released, titled EdTV. Since 2000 the so-called reality TV has become a common vehicle of entertainment, probably because it is cheap and doesn't require any careful considerations. Nevertheless The Truman Show has withstood the ravages of time, and still succeeds in fascinating me. At the time, I interpreted the story as a critique on the unwanted invasion of your private living space by unknown outsiders. For passer-bys clearly and intentionally block Burbanks passage, when he is in a hurry, both in a hospital, on the sidewalk, or in the file on the highway. During a chance meeting a cop unexpectedly happens to know his name. When Burbank wishes to visit the Fijis, the posters in the local traveling agency try to instil a fear for flying, and the flights to the Fijis happen to be fully booked for at least a month. Burbank discovers that in an eternal procession the same group of strangers circulates around his house. As a whole the chance of an accidental conjunction of circumstances becomes negligible, and Burbank logically concludes that it is all premeditated. The only surprise is his slowness in the uptake, considering that he had already been encysted for thirty years, since his birth. In the end Burbank succeeds in escaping from his artificial, repressing and hostile world. But now, after another ten years, I doubt that this is really the leading theme. For we live in a world, where you can simply watch the home life of your neighbors by infiltrating their computer through the net and controlling their web-cam by means of spy-ware. And if you can not do this, your government or an ICT firm certainly can. Apparently The Truman Show is not so much a protest against a threatening future Big Brother society (after the narration of the totalitarian society by George Orwell), as a warning against the actual way of living, that develops around us. Thus the story becomes a hotchpotch of undesirable developments: for instance the intrusion of advertising in our lives. Or the social encysting and gossiping in the small community. Perhaps even the oppression by social conventions in general. Or the spying by the state and enterprises on their citizens and costumers, which in the professed age of terrorism has become unbounded. Apparently the narrative of The Truman Show is more a shower of grains of shot than a well-targeted critique. So although I still appreciate the film and its invitation to ponder, it is clearly not the monument of resistance that I presumed twelve years ago. A pity. Disappointing.",

Because of his childhood incident he is afraid of water and so he never left the island.The overall performance was good though majority of the time its Truman on the camera or shud i say cameras.

I personally believe that there are a lot of satirical messages in The Truman Show, but I think the most prominent is that the media is used to display people's lives in whatever way they please. The Truman Show targets the media, and displays the problem of media manipulation. This idea is exaggerated by Truman being the media's subject matter without consent for every moment of his life. We see this in real life with celebrities in paparazzi photos and reality TV shows, although, contrary to Truman, celebrities are aware that the world has their eyes on them. Throughout the movie, we see the producers of the show plant subject matter into Truman's life, such as his father coming back to life, or all the advertising for hot chocolate. This can show how the media manipulates people. In the movie, the inhumaneness of Truman's situation is deflated. The movie is ironic because Truman's audience knows that he's on television, but Truman does not. I really enjoyed this movie, especially after having realized the satirical messages hidden within it.",

            "content": "The \"Truman Show\" tells a thought provoking story with a main protagonist desperately trying to find answers. It isn't until halfway through the movie the answers are finally revealed and explained to you.This movie is heartbreakingly interesting from its concept to its presentation. A rewatchable masterpiece that portrays both the evil and good in humanity.A story like this may never be told again, and is the way films should be made compared to the drivel or nostalgic cash grabs that are made today.SPOILERS------------------\n---------------------\nWe watch the movie from the directors point of view, not from Truman's POV. We don't have meaningless explanations from the characters and how they know one another. We don't know Truman's own thoughts. It's shown to us through his actions. The other side characters like the people watching or his \"friends\" or \"family\" are the only ones who bring up his past and explain things about Truman.The show slows down when showing flashbacks that can be confusing and unnecessary tho. There didn't have to be a romance but I didn't mind it all that much since it was a minor detail that helped him figure out how his entire life is a sham.Truman is the only real character in the show and that's why the show is popular. An entire show directed in controlling another persons life with an entire staff team of writers and actors is incredibly interesting.How far will people go to experiment on people? Children? How far will people go to make a buck? There are many questions to ask from watching this show that is still relevant today.There was a study of triplets who were separated at birth that were studied to see how they'd grown up. Eventually in college they found each other but this movie questions this study. Is the ethically correct? What situation would make this okay? Would you have to have the families consent or would it have to be a completely lone orphan with no one to look out for him/her?The movie answers these questions with a flat no and shows you why.Truman performs the best act of his life and attempts to escape. He goes against the god/director of his life and faces his fears to obtain his destiny. It does not matter where you are born from, but the willingness to overcome your fears and chase after what's real and more importantly protect what's real to you.The only character you grow to care for is Truman, you feel what he feels and watch as the audience watches him triumph as he walks out the door and basically flipping off the director quoting his catchphrase. It's a heartbreaking but uplifting ending. Truman never finds out why he's held captive, but even so he finally gets out.",

The scene displaying Christof watching Truman sleep on camera, putting his hand on Truman's face as the emotional music swells does such a great job at showing this. On the outside, the Truman Show is a comedy about a man discovering his life is a lie, but at its center it's so much more than that. It's a story about deep realization and betrayal, growth and maturing. Deep down it's a sad, depressing look on modern reality tv. Throughout the movie, due to his positive outlook on life, Truman never takes time to mourn and contemplate his stolen life, and that shows how tough he really is at spirit. The way those who filmed the movie blackened the corners of the film on certain shots to show shots from cameras in the movie is artistic and different than anything else from television. The payoff at the end is absolutely wonderful. We're rooting for Truman the whole movie to learn the life changing secret and his incredible escape onto the ocean is just perfect. The score intensified when Truman is in danger by the weather, and calms down to a beautiful, melodic, orchestral theme illustrating victory. Jim Carrey gives an excellent performance in every scene he's in, whether comedic or emotional. He embodies this role in such a way that Tom Hanks embodied Forrest Gump. The good storytelling doesn't even end with just Truman's story though. The shots of the outside world show people dedicating their whole lives to watch this simple, normal man. The whole world fell in love with somebody just as insignificant and regular as them. The reason why this is so great is because in real life this is something that could very likely happen. Beyond the surface of this lighthearted, at times comedic movie is an extremely sad story that has brilliant acting, dialogue, and morals. The pacing is incredible, given that every scene keeps you wondering what will happen next. Just like the audience in the movie, you fall in love with Truman and cheer for him throughout the whole movie, and the ending is victorious for both the fans and Truman himself. Truman's final line, \"Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon good evening and goodnight,\" mimics his line repeated twice earlier in the film to his neighbors, but the first times it was an introductory statement but this time it felt more like a closing. A goodbye. Christof faking Truman's fathers return showed how deep and desperate to succeed he really was. To conclude, this film has been brutally unappreciated for what it is since it's release. This is art for those of all ages to appreciate and look at differently. Every human needs to witness this masterpiece at least one time, I personally have seen it thrice, and it only got better each time. I 100% recommend it. 9.7/10.Some other outstanding quotes from the movie:\"You can't get any further away, before you start coming back\"- Truman\"We've become bored with watching actors give us phony emotions. We are tired of pyrotechnics and special effects. While the world he inhabits is, in some respects, counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts, no cue cards. It isn't always Shakespeare, but it's genuine. It's a life\" - Christof explaining why people watch the show\"Sea haven is the way the world should be\"- ChristofNetwork executive: \"we can't let him die in front of a live audience\"\nChristof: \"He was born if front of a live audience\"You were real, that's what made you so good to watch\"- Christof\"The early bird gathers no moss! The rolling stone catches the worm!\"- Truman\"I know you better than you know yourself\"-Christof\"We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. It's as simple as that\"",

            "content": "When it came out, I remember thinking of \"The Truman Show\" as just a Jim Carrey vehicle - little more than an announcement than he had decided to be a dramatic actor now. Perhaps because of that conclusion I didn't watch it until recently. The movie is actually pretty good, and Carrey's casting is more than just a cold bid for box office dollars over picking the actor best suited for the role.The premise, which oddly is much more relevant in 2011 than when the movie was made in 1998 when reality TV was in its infancy, is that Carrey's character, Truman Burbank, has been raised inside a gigantic television set and every moment of his life has been broadcast on television to a mostly adoring public. He is a television sensation interacting with actors and extras in a carefully controlled world, and has a sort of goofy sitcom way of conducting himself, complete with catch phrases, that is perfect for the show he doesn't even know he's staring in. This sort of \"goofy everyman\" angle actually helps explain why such a show could become popular, and is perfect for an actor like Jim Carrey who might very well be described as a \"goofy everyman\".Of course, everything starts to unravel and the film becomes about if Truman will escape from his constructed world, or if he will even want to. We follow his travails along with Cristoff (Ed Harris), the diabolical creator of the world, but also through numerous fans of the show, a real cast of average Joes and Janes. We also learn about Lauren (Natasha McElhone), who infiltrated the world briefly and is Truman's true love interest, but was whisked away by the producers and is involved in a (apparently unpopular) movement to free Truman.Living in a media-centric world, it's hard to not find the premise and possibilities of the story intriguing, even fascinating. It makes for compelling drama, and the comedy is just fun enough to not be annoying, but the reason to see this is the story, not the jokes.The movie works. I found myself wishing they'd let him interact with his world more, instead of thrusting predetermined life events on him. Wouldn't it have been more interesting, and less likely to fail, if they'd given him some more freedom to live his own life? I also wish the movie had explained a bit better why the life of an insurance salesman could be so interesting - much of it would seemingly be pretty boring, daily routine. No doubt his otherwise monotonous days were scripted with plenty of amusing events, but we never actually saw any of these.The movie has obvious philosophical and even theological themes, but is not anything dramatically deep. I'll forgive it for that, especially as it manages to be meaningful without being pretentious.\"The Truman Show\" is just a good premise told in a competent enough manner. It's one of the more original big budget, big name films that Hollywood has cranked out, and it doesn't squander all of that potential. This movie seems to have somehow fallen by the wayside a bit, but now more than ever it should be quite enjoyable if you haven't seen it before.",

But few years ago, my crush in high school set the Truman show poster( the one with Truman's laughing face on it) as his line profile, and I immediately rewatched it that night in order to discuss with him on the other day(yeh such a indecisive valley) but wow it turned out to be resonated af. I supposed that people who are a bit cynical and negative or who sometimes figures that life is a bi*th would feel related to Truman.

People unfriendly eyes and attention disturb us to be ourselves. Their unintentional comments hit the softest part of our hearts.

            "review_title": "One of the films for which the Nineties will be remembered",
            "content": "I believe that, in the future, when the 90s are looked back upon, The Truman Show will be seen as one of its truly representative films, not only for its high quality but for its unerring evocation of one of the most prominent themes of our times: the out of control nature of the media, and its invasion of our personal lives. Think about how many movies over this past decade have used this theme as a jumping off point: Natural Born Killers, Mad City, Wag the Dog, To Die For, The Cable Guy, Quiz Show, EdTv, . . I could go on, but you get the idea. The Truman Show towers over all these films because instead of being a polemic, it casts its story in the form of a fable; you're free to buy what's happening as \"real\" or simply metaphorical, and the story works equally well either way. Because there's no direct reference to any current media images (no MTV or CNN or Jay Leno monologues about Truman and his life) the story exists outside of time - it could take place either in the future, a fictionalized present, or an imagined past: it's never made clear and it doesn't matter. By not trying to be up to the minute, The Truman Show succeeds in being timeless.However, that is only one of its many successes. The story manages to be involving on the levels of drama and comedy simultaneously. Truman's dilemma is always achingly real to him, and yet as spectators we can't help but see how funny are the preposterous ways in which the situation is kept going (the posters in the travel agency, for example, or the teacher telling Truman \"You're too late, everything's been discovered already.\"). To be sure, it's a sinister humor, one that chills at the same time it amuses. It reminded me at times of the coldness and bemused misanthropy pervading such Kubrick films as Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, and 2001. And yet, amazingly, at the same time it also had - through Truman - a hopefulness and a wonderment that was reminiscent of the very best of Spielberg. Now, I can't think of two directors who are more different from one another, and by evoking both, the film shows an almost unparalleled range and vision.I'd like to say Jim Carrey was a surprise here, but in fact he wasn't, not to me anyway; from the time I saw him in The Mask (in his Stanley Ipkiss scenes) I always suspected he had a role like this in him. He's effective and believable in a more toned-down part, although I believe that the role is such a gem - and so assured of audience sympathy - that nearly any actor could have played it and been equally effective. The true star here is the director, Peter Weir, who after this and Fearless must now be considered in the genius category. Not only does he create a compelling and totally believable world, but he uses camera angles in a sly and totally original way to subtly indicate to the audience the depth of surveillance involved in Truman's world. And he comes up with a cornucopia of unforgettable images, all slightly surreal and menacing, while at the same time containing a strange and gripping beauty: the \"sunset\" scene where the sun and moon hang next to each other in the sky; the nighttime image of all the actors on the set, arm in arm, searching for Truman with guard dogs and flashlights (definite shades of Invasion of the Body Snatchers); the final scene of Truman, at the \"ends of the earth\" seemingly \"walking on the water\" (an image Magritte or Dali would have been proud to have painted); and, perhaps most memorably, the supremely surprising yet totally brilliant moment when the moon metamorphisizes  into a giant searchlight. Even out of context, these scenes have a stunning visual power, and add immensely to the film's overall subject and theme.But even if you're not in the mood for a serious message, or a meditation upon the popular media and its role in our lives, it's possible to enjoy The Truman Show on just the most basic level of an interesting story, well told. It's a \"quest\" film, but because of the way it's set up and its sly humor, it can also be enjoyed as a *parody* of a quest film (after all, it's \"only\" a TV show). Its \"major themes\" can be taken as a parody of a movie that would like to have \"major themes.\" The film achieves this dual effect (significant and yet not significant) because of the way it refracts everything through the television lens - which, as we all know, trivializes every subject it encounters: yes, even a man's quest to discover the meaning of his life and start entirely anew. The very final shot of the movie, which some people complain is too glib and abrupt, is actually perfect because it emphasizes this point with such deadly satirical force.The Truman Show: entertaining, thought provoking, eerie, sad, triumphant - just about the most complete movie experience you could ever have. Definitely one of the classics, not only of our time, but of ALL time.",

From start to finish i sat on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens to the lovable main character Truman and what'll he do next! This movie could be considered emotional because of the astonishing journey Truman goes through, however it glides more into the drama or sci-fi movie category according to Google, this fantastic movie was nominated for 3 Oscars, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor. So just that should tell you how amazing this movie truly is.This movie is a classic in my opinion, and a must watch!",

Carrey's performance makes it worth the hype, but the story itself was a cold, calculating, cashing-in of the talent, and I can not find anything enjoyable about that.This work was clearly intended to make you think. It endears you to the main character (Carrey), introduces its premise (which was refreshingly new), and then lowers the boom. It was the boom I couldn't swallow. I found this work horribly disturbing, and just plain sad.Frankly, in spite of the glowing reviews and excellent numbers this work received, I believe this is the pinpoint of the decline of Carrey's career.

Now - 20 years on - with family documentaries such as Keeping Up With The Kardashians taking centre stage, I believe The Truman Show serves a new audience as a thought provoking masterpiece that brings an astute awareness to the viewers.

But to Truman and Sylvia, he was a great villain. Trapping Truman in this picture perfect, happy-go-lucky town gave Christof complete control of every piece of his life. For Truman, once he realized things weren't as they seemed, he started to see that nothing in life was his choice, nothing belonged just to him except Sylvia, and his escape at the end to find her and\nstart his own life is sort of like the risks we take in life, to pursuit something that feels far away or out of the question.\nI think that when Christof said, \"we accept the reality of the world with which we're presented,\" he was partly right.

            "content": "Kind of a complicated business, this film. Most of Peter Weir's movies are, but at least he lays open here the source of our discomfort. It's a palimpsest of basically three layers. (1) The visual story we see unfolding on the screen, the one that Peter Weir shows us. (2) The story as constructed by the world's greatest producer, The Man in the Moon named Cristof (Ed Harris), who manages the television show of which the thirtyish real-estate salesman, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), is the unknowing star. And (3) the presumed allegory that deals with such Big Issues as conformity, happiness, God, free will, artifice, and television.Carrey lives on glossy, carefully enameled Sea Haven Island, a paradisaical place of warm sunshine, neat middle-class housing, clipped and barbered lawns, cheery neighbors and co-workers, a beautiful and accommodating wife (Laura Linney), and a lifelong friend who bring him the occasional six pack of brewskies. Everything is peace and prosperity. Then things begin to seem a little odd to Carrey. When he breaks his routine, he stumbles into unsettling scenes. What should be the interior of an elevator turns out to be a craft service table with glazed donuts and a few strangers who gawk at him before running off.There isn't space to go on with this in any detail, but finally Carrey realizes that he can trust no one on the island and is literally a prisoner there. Every escape attempt is blocked by some incident -- traffic, an accident at a nuclear power plant -- something. He manages to sail away across the small sea and, pow, the bowsprit of his little boat punctures the wall of the largest television studio in the world. His life is a world-wide hit on TV, filmed on 5,000 hidden cameras. Given a choice between the scripted, almost perfect life he's been leading, and a new life full of challenges and entropy, he plumps for -- well, guess which one.As for level number two, the TV program built around the life of one Truman Burbank, who has been on the world's screens from the instant of birth until his final choice, Ed Harris is the man responsible and he and his crew live in the fake moon that hovers so picturesquely in Sea Haven's night time sky. Harris gives the best performance. His character brims with intricacies. His first thoughts are of the show, of the business part of it. It's sustained by product placement. Every artifact that Carrey touches or talks about brings in revenue. But Harris isn't at all a caricature. Of course he wants Carrey to stay put and the show to continue, but he's sentimental too. When he tells Carrey at the end, \"I was there when you took your first baby steps,\" he's soft and convincing. But as the director of the world's greatest show, Harris is pretty clumsy and it's a wonder that it took the hero some thirty years to tumble. Carrey tries to leave the island on a bus but the bus won't start. The driver, an actor, calls, \"Everybody off,\" and the other passengers who have been sitting like dummies all stand up at once and file out in order. That's not how it's done, not if it's to look like anything but acting. An experienced director would ask who was born in the first half of the year. They should stand up at random, some slow and others not, and crowd up at the door, followed by those who were born in the second half of the year. In fact, Harris is an extraordinarily inept director.That leads us to level three -- what's it all about? I'd be the first to admit I don't know. Peter Weir might even be the second. I doubt, though, that it's any accident that Ed Harris's director who lives in the fake sky goes by the name of Cristof. His mixed attitude towards Carrey is probably not accidental either. Harris has fits of pique when Carrey doesn't do as he's expected. (Cf., the Garden of Eden business in Genesis.) But he's merciful and spares the miscreant's life, edging into New Testament territory. If he's sometimes careless, maybe that's why we humans have this tendency to mutilate one another. Imagine a director who can stage an impromptu power plant accident off-island to stop Carrey but has extras check their watches before crossing the street. \"What, then, did the hand of the potter shake?\" The world applauds when Carrey achieves free will, although nobody is sure that's such a hot idea. Look what happened to Alex in \"A Clockwork Orange.\" No more space, I'm afraid. Good luck with the movie. It gets a lot of points for tripping up an audience expecting a dumb comedy or a dumb action movie. It's anything but that. Weir seems almost as ambitious as Cristof.One final question. Why in hell would an entire outside world be enthralled by a TV program about the life of a dull man? But maybe it's not worth asking in light of the popularity of reality TV shows like \"American Idol\" and \"Survivor.\"",

To put it in simplistic terms, this film is nigh-on perfect. There is no fault with this film, and if anyone finds a fault with it, I would love to be informed of said fault to see if it is really a fault. Jim Carrey gives the best performance of the year (with maybe the exception of Roberto Benigni in Life is Beautiful) as Truman Burbank, perfectly portraying the paranoia and strife a man in such dire circumstances must go through. Ed Harris is enigmatic and scene-stealing as Christof, and honestly I think it is one of the best-written parts in the last twenty years of cinema. The rest of the cast are excellent too, ranging from Laura Linney as an actress who knows that The Truman Show is her big break, to Paul Giamatti in a very small role in the \"real\" world. Andrew Niccol's script is one of the best ever in Hollywood, on par with Paddy Chayefsky's Network and Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Peter Weir's direction is brilliant, but I now find myself contradicting what I earlier said about there being no faults with this film. The only fault with this film is that they didn't go far enough. I read in the trivia section on IMDb that Peter Weir planned to have the film cut, the screen shows people watching the film in the theater through a security webcam, and then keep going on with the film. This would have been amazing, and we are left with only wishful thinking of what might've been. Several other deleted scenes, one being a jogger portrayed by an actor who two days previous had played a homeless man in a wheelchair, would have elevated this film from nigh-on perfect to as important as Network or dare I say Citizen Kane. In one of the strongest years in film, this film was almost thrown into the gutter and forgotten about at the Academy Awards. I need not tell you how much of a disgrace it is Carrey didn't win for Best Actor and Niccol win for Best Original Screenplay. Thank God everyone else on IMDb agrees with me that this film is outstanding, except with its current ranking of 207, I am also disappointed because really it should be top 25-30. This film contains many subtle messages, from schizophrenia to the power the media holds in our society, and it is very difficult to choose what moment is best, except I think I have it. At the very end, and in case anyone didn't see the banner at the top SPOILER ALERT, when Truman exits his alternate reality, and the show ends, we see two men discuss what to watch next, so seamlessly as if they have to watch something. This is the best moment of the film because it shows our complete lack of care for Truman, and that once something ends that we have devoted time to watching it, we must go and begin to watch something else. This film is difficult to comprehend with one viewing, but once you appreciate its power, its subtleties and its satirical messages, then you will relate to this review.",

He's been on the show for over 10,000 days if you can believe it. Right from his birth. Truman though starts to figure some things out when there are some malfunctions like lights falling to the ground or seeing his dead father just to mention a couple things. Nothing is allowed to happen naturally in his life in his life like falling in love without major input from the show's creator and director Christof (really well played by Ed Harris as usual).A smart script from Andrew Niccol that is able to ask some good hard questions about humanity while giving a cold look at reality. Wonderfully directed by Peter Weir as well. Harris, Niccol and Weir all received Oscar nominations for their work. Now, I hardly ever feel this, but this film may work just as well if not better on TV due to the subject matter and really making you feel like you are watching the very show Jim Carrey is on.To me though the number # 1 reason why this film so amazingly well is Jim Carrey. He does not play that way over-the-top character who looks like he has drank 100 coffees that day. He is more down-to-earth, more human. Also starring Laura Linney as his wife Meryl as well as Paul Giamatti and Harry Shearer. So give it a watch if you like to think with a laugh. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "The Truman Show has received quite a lot of praise since it's release in 1998, but it's never really managed to achieve the status that it rightly deserves. What we have here is a film that more than delivers on the entertainment front, while still finding time for a backbone of thought-provoking substance. More often than not with movies that work from a premise, rather than an actual plot, they miss the mark because of a lack of ideas to populate the premise with; but that certainly isn't the case here! The film follows the story of Truman Burbank. Truman is an insurance salesman, but unlike most insurance salesmen; he has his own show. And unlike most people with their own show...he doesn't know about it. Truman Burbank is the unwitting star of the massively successful TV show; The Truman Show. His whole life has been the subject of this show and everything that he believes to be real is actually the brainchild of the show's creator, the flamboyant Christof. We then follow Truman as he goes about finding out that the real world, and his world, are different places entirely.As you might expect, this plot gives the film great basis for thought-provoking ideas. The idea itself of having a TV show filmed around your life is intriguing to say the least, and is more than enough to inspire paranoia from more than a few audience members. The idea is fused with the drama surrounding Truman's life, and the two blend brilliantly. Adding to this is the way that the film gives a commentary on the waive of reality TV shows. The substance is more than evident, as we are shown that Truman is a prisoner within his own life and the TV crew are, in effect, 'God'. The Truman Show features what is probably Jim Carey's best performance. The way that he amiably portrays the character makes the film a delight to watch. Carey was, of course, more known for his over the top (and very good) comedy roles before this film, but here he really shows his worth as an actor. The rest of the cast is mainly made up of lesser-known stars, with Ed Harris standing out and the rest helping to build the film into a great ensemble drama. Before this film, Peter Weir was known for making OK-good films such as Dead Poet's Society and Witness; but this film is his masterpiece.",

But the script is adept at addressing such concerns, or at least sweeping them under the rug. You find yourself absorbed in Truman's inner struggle, and his blossoming sense of adventure. This is probably my favorite Jim Carrey performance; he's ideal. Ed Harris, too (geez, what can't that guy do?). The movie's premise of reality TV isn't new (and I'm not sure it was even back in '98), but it's honestly an imaginative take on the whole concept and maintains a surprising level of depth.The truth is, there aren't all that many '90s movies that hold up on rewatch, but this one absolutely does.9/10",

That is where things gain steam and become more exciting as the film progresses.Jim Carrey's acting was pretty good, as is Natascha McElhone, the actress who plays Carrey's love interest. Much of the other cast members acted too carefree and theatrical, which rendered them somewhat annoying. It was also distressing to see all of the characters in on this conspiracy of exploiting Truman's life in worldwide broad-casted T.V. show, making you root for Truman to outsmart the conspirators and escape the \"fake\" life they have envisioned for him.This movie sends a message that life is not simple and there is no such thing as a perfect world. Despite all the problems and turmoil in the world, there is nothing greater than your own freedom to live your life and make your own choices.Again, the movie takes quite a long while to gain any momentum, and Burkhard von Dallwitz's music score for the film seemed very out of place for the story.

While \"Pleasantville\" is about going into the fairy-tale land and making a difference, this one is about a man trying to leave the fairy-tale land. It isn't as magical as it was when I saw it as an adult but I now appreciate it more for what it is after having some life experiences of my own. It's about not conforming to the same routine, about taking risks, to sometimes be able to leave the comfort zone in order travel abroad and have experiences that are beyond where you are at. How some people can try to restrain you from exploring and and take away chances you dreamed of and how it's your choice when it comes to what you really want to do with your life. Despite the really far-fetched and a ridiculous concept this film has, it accomplished what it tried to do. Jim Carrey was at his peak when it came to stardom and was the topnotch actor at the time. And he was the perfect choice for this role at the time as well. Overall this the style of films I miss now a days, I highly recommend this one.8.1/10",

The city he lives in is a huge studio with hidden cameras everywhere & the people he interacts with on a daily basis are paid actors but when a series of events force him to question the world around him, Truman embarks on a quest to discover the truth.Written by Andrew Niccol & directed by Peter Weir, the best thing about The Truman Show is that unlike many high-concept films of its genre, it manages to keep itself grounded throughout its runtime and with its light-hearted narration, easily penetrates into the minds of even the most casual viewers without for once compromising with its entertainment factor.The production design is no short of amazing as the entire city resonates a sense of artificiality like a movie set yet has a certain realism to it, cinematography makes expert use of camera angles by capturing the events from different point of views thus adding more authenticity to the plot, editing keeps the drama flowing smoothly & music also manages to make its presence felt.Coming to the performances, the film features an interesting cast in Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Ed Harris & others and, stepping aside from his typecast roles, Carrey surprises everyone with a dense, dramatic & well-balanced performance that is truly heartwarming. Ed Harris plays the show's creator who really cares about Truman in his own way but loves his show too & Harris did a terrific job in capturing both sides of his character.On an overall scale, The Truman Show is a stellar work of quality whether you put it in the genre of comedy, science-fiction, drama or all at once & is equally effective as a meditation on the various themes it deals with, be it religion, philosophy, artificiality or existentialism. A heartfelt, hilarious & satirical take on the absurdity of reality television, The Truman Show is one of the finest examples of how to blend art with entertainment in order to make it work for the masses.

The themes of runaway celebrity culture and the fake nature of reality TV are subtly yet humorously traversed, particularly with the blatant product placement that is featured in the show. This is what makes this film so great, in how it integrates these thought-provoking ideas into the narrative.The artificial nature of Truman's life and how that is created is outstanding, such as how his eventual wife is chosen for him by the show's producers and how he is always subtly encouraged to never leave Seahaven so the show can continue to air. If certain cast members try to reveal to Truman what his life really is then they are swiftly whisked away, prompting the question of the morality of the decision to keep a man effectively in a prison away from the real world, with his entire life being a lie.The final scene in the film is a truly great piece of cinema with how the show's creator, Christof, tries to persuade Truman to not leave the set before Truman replies with his catchphrase \"If I don't see ya, Good afternoon, Good Evening and Goodnight\" before bowing and walking off. This is such a euphoric and emotionally-satisfying ending that is makes the film.In terms of performances I don't understand how Jim Carrey didn't get an Oscar nomination for his performance.

Weir very convincingly tells the story of Truman Burbank and his struggle for a new life. I like the way he sets the mise-en-scene. His story juxtaposes very well with the audience's (in the movie) reactions and the studio's operation. This is the first film through which Jim Carrey has gained credit for playing a non-comedic role. Carrey is fantastic in the title role and he is wonderfully supported by the manipulative Ed Harris and the phony Laura Linney.

I never thought Jim Carrey would put on a performance as he displayed here in the Truman Show.Unlike most Carrey movies, this movie has an actual plot and a really original one, at least it was back in 1998. This film is about a guy, Truman who is being filmed in part of a 24-hour reality TV show. But, he just believes he is an ordinary guy living a normal life. As time goes on, he believes to suspect that not all is ordinary.As I mentioned before, Jim Carrey is very, very good. But also deserving praise is Ed Harris as the show's creator. He played his role so well, I had to ask myself if he is the good guy or the bad guy and that usually never happens.Overall, this is a masterful film directed by Peter Weir. Both Weir and Harris are deserving of their Oscar nods. I truly wish that Carrey received one as well. The film holds up well as we move along in the 21st century. The visual effects and the way the movie was filmed regarding the Florida landscape was really done well.

It is an ideal city, perfect, calm, without trash, without crime, without poverty, where all are good friends but there is no relation of closeness or friendship, or anger or rancor... no trace of humanity, in the good or the Bad sense of the term. And Truman Burbank is the symbol of an artificial human being in an artificial world. It is this artificiality latent in everything that bothers, always bothered the character who, after all, is unaware of being part of a millionaire reality show, which transmitted to the world every moment of his life. And here lies another important provocation essential to understanding the film: a critique of the kind of TV shows we watch, programs that exploit and make millions at the expense of people's weaknesses and pains. The film also makes some surreptitious and highly philosophical considerations, equating the nature of God, the size of the Universe, the reason for Man's existence. The film develops well, around Truman's quest for truth behind the apparent lie where he lives.Jim Carrey is the big name of this movie. He does an excellent job and proves to us that he can also be serious and dramatic. However, he may have disappointed some audiences who went to see this movie expecting another comedy. He shone in this dramatic role, is almost always present and succeeds, even in the serious context of the film, to look nice and play without getting to the point of idiocy. Ed Harris also shone in the role of the director of the television program, always trying to keep his star. It's a side supporting role, but Harris knew how to ennoble your character with a job well done.This is a complex and provocative film, but it hides behind a relatively simple story and great humility. It is not an elaborate production, it does not seem to me to have been expensive nor does it have huge special or visual effects. Everything is done with discretion but efficiency. However, it is not a movie for anyone. It's funny without being funny because it's not the humor that makes the movie work. It leaves a lot open, leaves many questions and reflections in our head. For some, it will be a boring movie.",

The constant tension between the inquisitive Truman Burbank and the odd happenings in Sea Haven create an eerie mystery that unfolds over the course of the movie. Everything around him is totally documented and controlled, a prescient depiction of reality TV and internet culture (Chris-Chan comes to mind as the closest real equivalent). This theme of paranoia, illusion and exploitation drew natural comparisons to deeper themes of life alienation. All of this was only possible by the great performance of Jim Carrey who found the perfect balance of goofy comedy and relatable everyman. This film's triumph is in presenting such provoking ideas in an endearing and entertaining package.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a movie that is simply brilliant. The more I think about this movie the more I seem to see in it. Its ending left me totally stunned and the entire movie is pure originality and it is made in a way that you are not sure of how it is going to end.The Truman Show is a television program that is focused around one man, Truman Burbank (Jim Carey). He has no idea that he is the star of a television program and he simply goes about life as if it was his life. The show goes for twenty four hours a day, seven days a week with no breaks. Advertising is made a part of the show, and is blatant to the audience but Truman simply does not think there is that much strange about it. The show takes place inside a huge dome, called the Hollywood dome, that surrounds a beautiful beach town. At one time Truman has wanted to leave the town, but they have always found ways to keep him inside. They decided that the best way was to give him a phobia about water as the town has been built on an island. So they killed his father while on a boating trip.The movie is about control, they say so at the beginning. Though Truman is not supposed to know that he is living in a television show, they try to make sure that every aspect of his life is controlled. The first realization of this is when he catches the eye of one woman and he decides that he wants to get to know her better. But Christof (Ed Harris) the director prevents this by sending another woman to him that he is going to marry. Once that happens, his next goal is for Truman it impregnate his wife, but the problem is that he does not love her and because he does not love her he has no desire to have children with her. He is still very much in love with the woman who he glimpsed for a second.Another way they control Truman to keep him in the town is through subtle things like a job, friends, and a mortgage. He wants dearly to go to Fiji, because he believes the woman he loves is there, but he can't go. He has a mortgage on the house and the car making money tight. When he does try to go more problems begin, like the bus breaking down, a forest fire, and finally a nuclear meltdown. In this movie there is no coincidence, and you realize this when everything seems to happen to push Truman in a particular way. It seems that it is real life, but we see through the fa\u00e7ade when we know that everything in Truman's world is controlled.It is interesting though to consider whether this is reflected onto our world. The Truman Show seems to be a cry out for freedom and individuality. In one aspect it could be a movie of rebellion against God. Screaming that God has no right to control our lives and that we should be able to do what we want. Another aspect is that it is an attack against the government, which I think is more so. The government seeks to control people's lives but there is a cry that the government limit itself and give us our freedom to do what we want. In a way, the Truman show seems to be like 1984, where Big Brother knows everything about us.As for rebelling against God's control, we must remember that God has given us a free choice of turning away from him. Truman has no choice whether he wants to stay or go. No matter how hard Truman tries to leave, Christof refuses to let him go. God does control the universe, and he does everything for our own good. Christof claims the same for Truman, but Truman has no choice, we do. Truman does not know the truth, we do. Truman believes everything in the dome is real, where it is not. God has revealed himself and his plan to us in the bible and thus we are able to make a choice based on that.Another aspect is privacy. In the Truman show there is none. Truman does not have a private life, even though he thinks he does. Every action, everything that he does is watched by millions of people world wide. His funny things in the bathroom are a private matter to him, but people watch him and laugh at his antics.It is also interesting to note that Truman has no friends. Everybody around him is there because they are being paid to be there. His best friend never says anything from his heart but from the mouth of Christof. His wife does not love him, and does not even consider their marriage legitimate because she crossed her fingers when she made the vows. As such the life of Truman becomes a sad, lonely, and false life. Though he believes that he has friends, he does not and if all were to go away, he would in the end be left with nobody.The Truman Show is simply one awesome movie. It is one that I would put up in the region of the classics. It stands alone with its plot and its story, and it takes on board some very deep themes.",

The remaining 80 minutes are EPIC.Starting off like any other drama film, The Truman Show talks about the story of an ordinary man. But, as the plot advances and as the character grows up, psychologically, things seem to take a reality check. Throughout the realization & final mission, you stick to your seat, most of your senses concentrating on what might happen next. Twists & turns start to come up and you stay mesmerized.Jim Carrey has won the Oscar, at least for me. His slapstick is improbable but funny. His portrayal is full of originality. Supporting cast act very well. Music symphonies provide a strong score and the screenplay just completes the classic.I can watch this more and more and still stay baffled at the unwinding of plot.

            "content": "Peter Weir's earliest major films -The Last Wave, Picnic at Hanging Rock --are studies of people overwhelmed by circumstances they can't understand or control. But his later films offer hope of redemption and triumph. Like Dead Poets' Society, the Truman Show is the story of struggle for freedom from an oppressive system. While \"DPS\" was an interesting development of a standard situation (a liberal-minded teacher helps students free their minds from tradition through creative literature) the Truman Show is based on a very unique setup. The main character, Truman Burbank, is the only \"true man\" in a TV-show world of actors and commercial advertising. We, the viewers, discover this truth before he does because Weir introduces us to a selection of viewers who are hooked on the show. The film holds our interest by showing us, first, Truman's process of discovery, and then his attempts to escape his situation.A lot has been made out of the supposed religious elements of the Truman Show, presumably because of the \"Christof-Christ\" name parallel (a bit too cute, don't you think?). But to turn the film into a religious allegory misses the obvious: the film is about the line between fake and real, and how television destroys humanity by hooking us on images in order to sell products. The key line in the film is (Truman to Christof): \"You never had a camera in my head!\" You can't say that about God. Second, the real Christ was a rebel (as in the confrontation with the money-changers) who was killed by the system. If you want a Christ image in the Truman Show, it's Truman \"walking on water\" at the end of the film, not the lord of commercialism chillingly played by Ed Harris.If there's a deeper philosophical message in the film, it has to be the rejection of the postmodern idea of how we know what we know. Truman lives in a world that's been created for him. A postmodernist (i.e., pretty much anyone teaching in the literature or history department of my university) would say that we accept the world we're given. What we \"know to be true\" is what we are told is true. My \"truth\" depends entirely on the culture I live in and the categories of thought I'm provided with. On this basis, Truman should never escape Seahaven. But human intellect and curiosity exist precisely to question and change categories of thought. So, Truman's quest for the truth involves observing both anomalies (a falling stage light, odd patches of rain) where there should be consistency, and patterns (bicycle, flowers, Beetle!) where there should be randomness. He persists until he finds a way out of the world of image into the real world, out of the fake light, sky and clouds into the black door of whatever is out there. The tragedy is that the commercial world of television needs us not to find our way out. So the very last image of the Truman Show is not the hero escaping, but the viewers saying, \"So, what else is on?\"",

            "review_title": "Seeking the Freedom of Reality",
            "content": "This is one of my favorite films of all time as well as sci-fi films, suspense thrillers, and one in the Dystopia subgenre in sci-fi. I remember seeing this film when I was in my teens, I was in my sophomore year and of course it was the 90's when there was the Jim Carrey train. Jim Carrey is one of my favorite comedic actors and seeing him in something like this really took me by surprise, in fact the whole film took me by surprise and believe it or not it's my favorite film from him. It's always interesting seeing comedic actors getting out of their comfort zones really showing how much range and capability they have. This was a different kind of role for Carrey as hear it really felt like he was for once playing the regular man.This was also a different kind of film as it's one of those sci-fi films that causes you to think but in a good way, heck this is the kind of movie you can show in a philosophy, theology, and even psychology classes. Watching this film now is very interesting because of how slightly prolific it is on our media counter culturing today, which is really crazy and part of what makes this film a little scary because of how dangerously plausible the whole story really is. The film is a Philp K Dick tale which in some of his stories had a similar concept and dealt with some of the same issues as the perception of reality and human freedom.I really like how the whole thing starts out where it's all a big mystery at first. This is something different for the suspense thriller because usually it takes place in formats and settings that we are already accustomed to mainly the modern day, it's the protagonist that is just easily disoriented. But here we are completely unsure of where we are, this really helps enhance the feeling of disorientation and increases the reliability of the protagonist because we are also on the same boat as him.And like in some suspense thrillers were a step ahead of the protagonist, as were seeing Truman in the camera angles provided for us along with part of the beginning of the film. We already know that Truman is living in a counter fit existence that there is a show being made about him. However, we don't know the entire scope of the plan and were constantly hoping Truman will help us fill in those blanks and hopefully figure it all out on time so he get himself out. Were also hoping Truman can find some way to evade and outsmart the cameras despite the fact their providing us the visual, we also know we're not the only ones watching. As the people running the show and most of all the creator himself like the Thought Police in \"1984\" watches Truman 24.7; which is also disturbing and sad as it once again shows how little of a real life Truman has as he has no privacy or real solitude of his own. I'll admit seeing this made me grateful about having privacy and solitude because when you have them you have the freedom to do whatever you want.The production in the film is impressive, I really like how they make the fictionalized town Sea Haven, which seems to be this mix of 1950's America with a little of the modern age. As we see clothing and even houses that look like you might have seen from pictures on a history book or watched from an old film made during that time. But we also see a little of the modern conveniences like the cars driven and even tech. From all of this you immediately know it's a counterfeit existence because nothing is ever this nice; let alone boring it's no wonder Truman can't stand living there another minute even I wouldn't. Of course, like in David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet\" there are nasty insects living within this so call paradise, because the thing about the place is that there is no progress, no change, and worst of all no freedom or at least freedom of any real kind.Christof is a villain you just plain hate and what's scary about him is not just his scam, but due to how far our media and technological culture has come over the years, this guy could possibly exist. The man has sick delusions of grandeur, narcissistic, zero sense of the line between reality and fantasy, with a god complex to boot which all make a deadly combination, a psychopath in the guise of a stereotypical art director. In a way what he's doing is the sick ideal/dream come true of every narcissist and god complex psycho which is having total control of one's life and livelihood.One of the disturbing things about this film are how most to all the populous which consist of actors and actresses around Truman have all gone along with this sick delusion. We never really know any of them from Meryl to Truman's so called best friend and that's the point because none of them have any real life or lives for that manner, only the role and lifestyle they are all assigned. This sort of gets at the danger of making one's career their whole life without making a life of your own. But also as Philip K Dick warned about sacrificing one's ethics, freedom, and soul for fame, profit or to live out a certain lifestyle they desire despite it's counterfeit nature.This scam is gets much worse, with what he's done with Truman you just have this very icky bad feeling that this is just the beginning of a even eviler grand scam when there is that whole goal of Truman having a child with the fake wife, that kid will be subjected to the same lifestyle as Truman along with several others kids and kids after them, all to complete his counterfeit masterpiece of his sick definition of what life is and should be.As an old quotation from the Bible goes \"Beware of false prophets\" as well as a part of revelations that warn us to beware of a false messiah. Chistof is literally playing God to want to be a God, but he's not God, in fact he's a poor imitation and what he's created is a sick farce of a congregation and what life is supposed to be. But also what Chrisof has done is a crime against humanity as he's committed the heinous acts of dictating and controlling how one should live their lives and their basic human rights like the right to love whomever they choose.Truman is another of my favorite fictional heroes. He's a character you feel heavy pathos for because he represents us. And of course, his name is implicit irony as he's the only real person in the counterfeit existence but most importantly that he's true to himself as every thought and feeling he's had and expressed was and can never be scripted.He's the kind of guy that I personally find relatable because of the fact he's a naturally curious which I myself am too. Really like his mannerism where he's an easy going friendly guy that I can easily be friends with. He's also a bit of a silent rebel to as I am, from some of the flashbacks we see likes to go against the grain as we see in his university years he found a girl which is the character Silvia ( Natascha McElhone). Her character you could say is like the kind for the Noir/suspense thrillers that mysterious beauty that helps the protagonist in some way or another.I really like the chemistry between both despite brief and both at a distance, but it works because the feelings both have for each other are genuine and the one real thing Truman has; it shows how the essential part of human nature love is nothing you can ever script nor control, just like the seasons that change it happens there is no stopping it.Despite all the comforts Truman has, he is not whole in fact he's completely miserable, despite starting the day off with a routine smile and quote, it's really all a mask to hide this. There is one little scene that makes me sad when he looks at photo album and as he flips though the pages there is a look of genuine sadness because each of those photos have one thing in common Truman never left Seaport. As Ellas from \"Unbreakable\" said, \"You know that sad feeling, it's because your not where your supposed to be, your not doing what you're supposed to do.\"Things like this even more make you care for Truman because his human freedom and rights are clearly under attack which in turn is an attack on us, you want him to win he deserves to win, he has the right to choose who he wants to love and most importantly to be his own person and life.The film really has some good messages as to why we shouldn't give our complete trust to media, fame, charismatic powers that be for they are not always right, in fact can be dangerously misleading. To cherish and defend your human rights and freedoms and never sell them out or give in to forces and threats against them, for losing both is no real way to live. But most importantly to always strive, fight and go to make our dreams come true, for that is what makes the reality of life all the more beautiful and worth living.Rating: 4 stars.",

I feel like it's more relevant even now than it was then thanks to the advent of social media because I can only imagine how some people feel as though their whole life is being scripted and obsessed over by thousands of people. It's a kind of psychological stress that didn't exist 20 years ago and yet The Truman Show captures it perfectly somehow.Excellent performances all around, solid effects and set work. This is just a fantastic movie that everyone should see.",

            "content": "Peter Weir's film, \"The Truman Show\", definitely lacks no innovation, bringing us as it does the unique story of a man who is the central character in an amazingly long-running television show that is all about him. Only catch is, he doesn't know it.We have probably all felt that our lives were on show at one time or another, or even imagined that we were the centre of some great movie. I must admit to imagining myself in a situation just like Truman's. I never expected it to become the subject matter of a movie though. It is probably no wonder that Aussie director Weir jumped at it.Weir does a pretty good job creating the world in which Truman Burbank lives (maybe a reference to Burbank studios in that name), giving us a pseudo-reality of which we are completely aware, but of which Truman has no concept. Weir's problems start when he has to decide where to take this ground-breaking film. Like Peter Howitt's \"Sliding Doors\", it is very difficult to know how to close a movie whose very concept is capable of totally wowing its audience. Many may be disappointed with this film's finale, and some may even feel cheated out of a true ending. Others will cheer; it's all down to personal taste.Jim Carrey, upon whom the entire show rides, impresses often as the bright, cheery insurance salesman who starts to believe there may be something very wrong with his world. He certainly has the right amount of charisma, though whether his dramatic prowess was strong enough is debatable. Perhaps a classic actor would have done something completely different with this role. Support cast are merely incidental, but include Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Ed Harris, Hollard Taylor and Natascha McElhone.Highly effective music comes from original composer Burkhard Dallwitz with additional pieces from Philip Glass. The set, an entirely fabricated island village, is from production designer Dennis Gassner.Friday, October 23, 1998 - Greater Union Melbourne",

The movie immediately sets its conflicts and Truman's suspicions as soon as Truman's character is introduced. Nevertheless the movie can really hold on to its grip over the story and exploits all it can from the angles by using the lens filters and robotics-moved cameras to give the actual spy- cam feel. The acting overall feels also nice. Jim Carrey's acting feels suiting to Truman's character and the changes he goes through.Laura Linney did her part well enough, maintaining that smirk almost all over her screen time.

The story may not be entirely original but the film works because it took a different approach. The story incorporated good world building through unraveling the mystery behind how that particular world works. Everything seemed so normal yet something kept bugging Truman. The manner in which the tension of the plot maintained its engagement is good. There were nice plot twists and turns that added to the mystery. The story also had a balance of drama and comedy. The performances are all great, most especially of course by Jim Carrey. His signature comedic style is present. But more than his comedic portrayal, his dramatic parts also stood out very well. Ed Harris was also a great actor in the movie. His character may not necessarily be a bad guy. But he was able to portray a person who is controlling and somehow selfish yet convincing. The film was able to present an admirable production set. The film showed that in actuality the setting for the \"show\" was done in a studio. That is complemented with an actual behind the scenes studio that works through everything. This gave a feeling that the show within the film was large, very large. Aside from that, the film also included audiences in the real world watching Truman. The scenes that they were in emphasized how big was the fanbase watching the show.All In all, The Truman Show poses a valid question. But that being said as a film, it delivers good entertainment. Jim Carrey really brought the film with his performance. And the story is something that will let the audience feel the same feelings that the audiences within the film feel which was genius. It was a good time with a satisfying pay off.",

Something always stops him from leaving.Lately Truman has noticed some very odd things happening in his day to day life in Seahaven. It seems like everywhere he goes people are always in sync. Like they keep repeating lines of motion and never stop. Like they've been choreographed or something. He notices it always seems like Meryl is speaking to someone other than him.

The things happen too randomly and non-sense until around 70 minutes of running, which made me very bored and lost in the story. The soundtrack isn't touching neither deep, so the film isn't comedy, isn't drama, isn't anything! Also, this is a much improbable show, since no decent country would have laws to allow it. Also, tying yourself in the boat isn't very smart, since the boat could turn upside down and you'd drown to death.It is surely filled with philosophical thoughts and questions, but they do not seem to fit in the film.

This would certainly apply to Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), a man who doesn't know that every moment of his life has been manufactured and manipulated from birth to be a television series.Truman lives in the town of Seahaven, a plastic looking community (he doesn't see it that way because he doesn't know anything else) with white picket fences and friendly neighbors always ready with a friendly howdy. But one day he starts to get a little suspicious. Truman, though happily married still longs for a girl whom he had a crush on in college. She was the only person who had sympathy for him. So he hatches a plan to go to Fiji to find her. I loved the clever way that the television staff keeps coming up with ways to keep him in town using everything from delayed buses to his fear of the water to a nuclear reactor leak.Andrew Niccol's script reminds me of his previous work on 'Gattaca' another movie about a man whose life has been manufactured from birth. Watching the film I thought a lot of the life of Princess Diana from the day she started dating Charles. Our voyeurism and our love for peering into the lives of our neighbors are central in this story.We are made to feel bad for Truman but we are curious about how he is going to get away. We become as voyeuristic as the audience in the movie does. Therefore our voyeurism is called into question. Our curiosity is aimed at making celebrity of a man who has done basically nothing.",

The problem was that though it pretended it was treating the audience as an intelligent entity it took the typical Hollywood attitude of presuming that after all that we would not think about this film.The subject matter demands that as we leave the cinema we must think about the questions that have been asked of us.  To what extent is the media dominating or commanding our lives, do we live to see other's manipulated, is what around us real or a projection of our imaginations (however sick and warped that may be).  All very well, in fact excellent.  Too few films ask us to question the world around us.  But this is where we run into problems. You see, once you start thinking about the film you realise quite how many holes there are in the plot.Forgive me but I would presume that if a man is brought up in a fake world he would never know it was fake because it wasn't fake to him.  For Truman Burbank there can be no real world because in reality to him everything outside the TV studio which is his reality is fake.  Forgive me if I'm not explaining myself clearly enough.  Let me put it like this.  If all your life the rain simply followed you about and did not touch others would you question it.  The answer is no because that is the way things are for you.For Truman to one day start thinking this is a bit weird is not only unlikely and out of character, it could never happen.  Similarly he would not only not find it odd that people around were constantly advertising products, he would adopt that speech pattern himself.  Ultimately this would lead to the failure of the show itself because Truman would no longer be a real man to the viewers, instead he would be more like a trained monkey performing tricks.  But this is straying from the point (though it does demonstrate how examination of the film proves how badly thought through it is).Now onto a second complaint, why is it that the people around Truman have no feelings for him?  They have grown up with him, gone through life with him. Yes, I accept he is their life line but I find it hard to believe that a man who has played his best friend for the best part of 30 years cannot care for him in the slightest.  Not even his 'parents' seem to have any real interest in his wellbeing, despite the fact that they have brought him up as if he were their own.  Are the makers of this film so cynical that they cannot give even the smallest amount of humanity to these characters?I have several other problems with the film, particularly the ending which was one of the most utterly contrived moments on film I have ever seen, as well as the lack of scope given to the show's creator, Christof (easily the best thing in it) and the unnecessary 'love interest.'  However, the major flaw of this film was the idea behind it.  It was so good that I don't think anyone really stopped to think out the complexities before making it.It is such a shame because what could have been so good turned out to be so bad.",

Just as Truman could never sail to Fiji, no human can live long enough to transverse interstellar space to Alpha Centuri Proxima, the nearest star. Before the gods we must have demigods in the form of those looking over us, real or imagined. Does it make any difference? And as Christof says, we accept the reality that is given us, so we could be fooled. Anyway, \"The Truman Show\" begins with a startling premise marvelously presented. The script by Andrew Niccol is a work of art and the direction by Peter Weir sure-handed and seamless. He allows the story to unfold at a convincing pace and the fifties cum nineties TV Americana feel to the \"Seahaven\" sets is delightful. Jim Carrey is perfect as Truman Burbank, the poor sap in a fishbowl. Everything about his life, including his wife and best friend are totally fake. Ed Harris as the megalomanic TV artist Christof is creepy enough, although the scenes with him are ironically less convincing than those in Truman's world. I thought he came across a little too much like a mad scientist. Laura Linny as Carrey's TV wife/product spokesperson with the ever present TV smile is wonderful, and good too is his estranged girl friend, Natascha McElhone with the big eyes.Some unanswered questions. We know there is a camera in the bathroom. Do they switch to another shot when he is using it or does the world-wide audience watch him move his bowels? And is his wife a \"whore\" as well as a TV actress or is their relationship purely Platonic? Does the audience see them together in the bedroom? Does she have a life away from him? Weir chose not to address these questions. Although the premise looks a little messy when examined closely, the inspired and completely apropos ending is as crisp and clean as the dot at the end of this sentence.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

In the movie, Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man oblivious to the fact that his entire life is actually a TV show enjoyed by billions around the world. However, at 30 years old, Truman is beginning to suspect that all is not as it seems, which is a serious problem for the producers of the show.The staggering rise in popularity of reality TV has made it easy to accept the premise of \"The Truman Show\". That viewers would take an interest in the life of a relative nobody is now an indisputable fact. Although Carrey's dramatic chops may not be quite as developed as they would later become he effortlessly supplies the type of personality that characterizes reality TV stars.Apart from Carrey, the highlight of the cast is the always dependable Ed Harris as the mastermind behind \"The Truman Show\". While I find the character to be written almost too enigmatically, Harris nevertheless plays it with utmost gravity & precision. Laura Linney is also excellent as Truman's effervescent wife and there are some notable names in small roles as well, such as Harry Shearer, Paul Giamatti & Philip Baker Hall.Visually, the movie has an interesting look, with plenty of odd angles and lenses to represent the surreptitious filming of Truman's daily activities. The sets & cinematography are usually bright and idyllic, which is all part of the show's controlled 'reality'. Weir's direction landed him his fourth Oscar nomination of six to date. The Golden Globe-winning score by Philip Glass & Burkhard von Dallwitz also deserves mention.Overall, \"The Truman Show\" is an entertaining movie that blends comedy, drama and 'soft' science fiction. That being said, I think that subsequent events have robbed the movie of some of its novelty. It was arguably too prophetic for its own good when it comes to the mechanics of marketing 'reality' as entertainment. It's still interesting and worth watching but the story isn't as fanciful as it once was. Of course, others may have the exact opposite opinion - that the movie's remarkable vision makes it more effective today than ever before. Both opinions are equally valid, I think.",

This fear plays a primal in this funny and thought-provoking science-fiction comedy-drama set in an alternate reality, that tackles on the culture of celebrities. Directed by Peter Weir, This film stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a white- collar worker living an average life with this wife Meryl Burbank (played by Laura Linney), but dreams of becoming an explorer and taking his wife on a vacation to Fiji. Soon, Truman begins to encounter some strange events including visions of his father Kirk Burbank (played by Brian Delate) who was lost at sea during a violent storm when he was a child, and suspicious behavior by local residents around him. Truman eventually comes to realize that his world is not what it seems as he is unaware that his life is 24-hour reality television show created by television producer Christof (played by Ed Harris) with an audience of millions of people around the world. Truman sets out on a quest to learn the truth of his life.Not many movies come as original nor inventive as this one. This film sparks an exceptionally intelligent idea and brings it to life with some mesmerizing performances, ingenious writing, and themes that electrify deep imagination. Unlike in his usual comedic work like 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Ace Ventura', Jim Carrey breaks away from his goofy screwball typecasting and takes on a slightly more dramatic in this thought-provoking drama, while managing to squeeze out some laughs here and there. He is very energetic in his role and gives one of the most refined performances of his career. He's always funny during the right moments and always sincere during the more serious moments; and his character is someone you can't help but love. Laura Linney who plays his wife is also very charming in her role, and her chemistry with Jim Carrey works well. But the biggest gem comes from Ed Harris's portrayal as Christof, the television producer behind the long-running reality show that is the main character's life. He is a very interesting character and diligently written, a character who conveys a God-like resemblance as he is the creator of Truman's life. So yeah, there is a small religious theme in the story and it works very good.Director Peter Weir and writer Andrew Niccol bring quite a vision to this movie. They take quite an innovative idea and do many clever things with it. The movie takes an interesting direction and tackles many thought-filled themes including metaphilosophy, simulated reality, and existentialism. These are best demonstrated as the titular character experiences strange occurrences around him and tries to make sense of them unaware of the shocking revelation about his life. When he suspects the world changing him, he begins the test his boundaries, one scene for example where he tries to drive off a bridge. Then there are some scenes cutting to some recurring characters sitting in front of their television watching as Truman is subconsciously broadcasted via hidden cameras. This idea leads to commentary of the culture of celebrities and media officials' effort on exposing details on the private lives of individuals. The entire concept is of the film is very thought-provoking and powerful enough to leave viewers with a paranoid feeling, but at the same time pokes fun at itself with some laughter and clever characters.The Truman Show is truly a remarkable film sparkled with such an original idea and an incredible script. This is definitely that will appeal to many Jim Carrey fans including adults and maybe pre-teens. Viewers should not go into this movie expecting a straight laugh- out-loud comedy like most of Jim Carrey's films, there are some dramatic and emotional moments from time to time. Overall, this movie is something worth watching.",

            "content": "Jim Carrey is overdue being lauded as one of the Great American Actors, especially after his performance in The Truman Show.Written by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, 1997) in an audacious fit of prescience, Truman Burbank (Carrey) is an unsuspecting pawn in the most ambitious reality show ever conceived - while the world watches, a complete community of actors creates an Anytown America reality for one unsuspecting protagonist - Truman - raised from birth in a massive thunderdome, encompassing the town of Seahaven where even the weather and the sky, the sun and moon are computer programs.We pick up the story when Truman is 30, ambivalently married to Meryl (Laura Linney), downing the occasional brewski with best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich) and cruising listlessly through his unrewarding insurance job. One million hidden cameras broadcast his every move.He might have continued the Leave it to Beaver lifestyle till his death were it not for a few unrelated events that created a glitch in his perception of reality, allowing him to discover that his \"reality\" was someone else's \"fiction\" - an intricately complex microcosm of the real world.And therein lies the hook of The Truman Show. Directed by Peter Weir (Gallipoli, 1981, Dead Poet's Society, 1989), this movie poses the ultimate question, \"Is Reality what we perceive it to be?\" Long have we stood solid on the credos, \"Seeing is believing\" and \"Perception is reality\" but this movie proves the fragility of those precepts. We perceive all our \"realities\" through points of reference - we are told this is the sky, the sun, the city, we are told a day is 24 hours long (from an arbitrary measurement which is not entirely accurate); we have agreed on the nature of things (truth, murder, war, dishonesty) and though we think that all we see is \"real,\" and all we feel is untampered emotions, the media, through unreliable sources (television news reports, tabloids, governments) force our perception through a common strainer, molding reality to their ends.This movie is also testament that the inquiring mind cannot be contained no matter the inculcation. Truman WANTS to discover new horizons; to think outside his box. When computer glitches alert him to his being watched, it inspires him to get to the bottom of the mystery.The movie takes us outside the prison, beyond the dome, with creator of \"The Truman Show,\" Christof (Ed Harris in a chilling rendition of a god complex - the name Christof is no accident), giving us flashbacks of Truman's early years, including a chance meeting with a female extra, Lauren (Natascha McElhone). While the script called for Truman to meet and marry Meryl, he fell for Lauren; while Christof's scripters scrambled to excise Lauren from the storyline of Truman's life, his \"true\" emotions would lead him to forever pine for Lauren, going so far as to clandestinely construct a composite picture of her face from magazine models.Look for Paul Giamatti, pre-awards, as the sympathetic Control Room Director and Harry Shearer, perfect as Christof's interviewer. Brian Delate, who must be sick to death of people asking him, \"Are you Charles Grodin?\" plays Truman's father.Back in 1998, it may have been considered unlikely that the major players in Truman's fantasy - his wife and best friend - would give up their own lives and aspirations to be a part of Truman's fiction, but after the advent of execrable stupidities like Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire? (2000) or The Bachelor (2002), it has become somewhat acceptable for monetary gain, infamy and exposure as an ignorant git to replace brains, aspirations and even what people consider their very souls. Hollywood synergy (read as tacit plagiarism) also saw the release of a similar-themed, inferior \"reality\" movie, EDtv in 1999; whereas Truman exposed numerous layers of hypocrisy in our society, EDtv was as thematically deep as a Slip-n-Slide.Eventually, Truman undergoes a reverse Copernican Revolution, where he discovers that the sun, moon and society itself really DID revolve around him - and instead of finding fulfillment, discovers emptiness in being the center of the universe.In the greatest irony of all, Truman tries to escape his Seahaven prison, knowing that after escaping into the REAL world, he would become an unknown; unlike all the drogues in the \"reality\" shows that would come on the heels of this movie, Truman WANTS to be just another face in the crowd, not singled out or made a fuss over - yet it was his drive and uniqueness that enabled him to see beyond his imprisonment and yearn for fulfillment in the first place.At times poignant, at times funny, always an undertone of darkness, The Truman Show is a metaphor for the pioneering spirit which cannot be contained; never more apparent than the final scenes where Truman pounds on the blue-sky wall as Burkhard von Dallwitz's soundtrack swells to tear-welling proportions.The paradoxical and disturbing messages in this movie should be examined for decades to come. Instead, the voyeuristic aspect of The Truman Show has been catapulted to brain-leaching proportions by a society that would more readily watch \"reality\" than live it.",

            "review_title": "Why not serious?",
            "content": "The Truman Show confronts us with a question more than one of us has probably at one point thought about before: What if everything I take for granted is indeed just fake? What if the world I live in isn't real and I'm just entertainment for someone else? While it does so, it raises some critical points. It's sad to say, but I'm quite sure that there would be plenty of people willing to produce such a show if they had the chance to do so. Furthermore I can also imagine that plenty of parents would be selling their children for glory and cash.While I really liked the female lead in this movie, I slowly begin to worry that I won't become a fan of Jim Carey in this life anymore. Not that he played bad it's just always a bit over the top, the smile a bit too bright and the behavior a bit too enthusiastic to really take the otherwise very earnest plot serious. I did cheer for him to escape, not at least to reunite with his true love, but the end may be a bit uncreative. In an otherwise perfect illusion the best they can do is the most obvious staircase I've seen in a while? And a painted wall? But never mind, what is so special about this film is that it is not too far away from what could happen. Especially nowadays, with the technology increasingly modernizing, it would probably be not too hard to make a baby grow up in a perfect illusion. And that is, indeed, a serious thing.",

            "content": "I do wish that commentators would stop promoting this film as a deep and meaningful take on a voyeuristic society. Certainly, the plot line concept is a reversal of the sad US shock/chat shows with a twist of sci-fi.In this case the \"prisoner\", Truman, is unwittingly exposing his (sanitised) private life on 24 hour TV, and is happily trapped in a safe world until he actually finds out that he is trapped.But that's it really - the film is then plotted as a comic realisation of this concept with no further depth at all. It dips deeply into the American sugary sentiment pool,  and is a vehicle tailored for Jim Carrey - an opportunity that he does not waste to be less \"goofy\".Don't worry however, everything is handed to you on a plate in an explanatory section in the middle of the film, just in case you are a little confused. It's as sinister as a choc chip cookie.So - entertaining, enjoyable, well produced - but leave it there! It will run and run on US cable for years to come.",

            "review_title": "Look closer and this film may be about you",
            "content": "First off I have to say that I really believe that the majority of people that didn't like this were people that were expecting Ace Ventura to pop up on screen.  Like all of a sudden Jim Carrey's face was going to explode with laughter and he was going to break into fits of absurdity the way he did when he talked with his butt.  And if that is the hang up you have with this film, then I pity you because there is so much to this film that it could make you look at things a little closer.The Truman Show is what seems to be the story of a man that has lived a make believe life.  We all know what it is about and if you don't then this review is not the best one for you, skip down in the IMDb and there are many great reviews about what Turman is in the narrative sense.  I want to touch on something else and it is something that I hope other people can see as well.The Truman Show can be a metaphor for anyone's life, especially us that dwell in wealth of the Western Culture.  Because the one question arises in this movie that doesn't let go of you is a scary one, and that is \" What is real? \"  I'm not talking in the literal sense the way Truman has it.  His life is not real in the sense that he is there for everyone to view and take pleasure from.  But when I ask \" What is real? \" I mean what in our life is real?  I'm sure that you can get a myriad of responces to that question but after seeing this movie it makes me question every single one of the answers that I can come up with.  The Truman Show asks you to open your eyes and look around you.  Is what you see pleasing?  Do you have the white picket fence, the two car garage, the double income family, the kids that are going to make you proud and go to college, good friends, a few pets, an okay boss, a sense of security, a faithful spouse, a nice car, money in the retirement fund and so on.  Well do you?  If you do, is it possible to fathom that it could all be a sherade, that it is all a mirage?  That white picket fence could get destroyed by a tornado or vandals, your two car garage could get destroyed by a fire, your double income family could be reduced to nothing if one of you is caught cheating or there are budget cutbacks and someone loses a job or becomes expendable, the kids may not want to go to college, they may get pregnant or make someone pregnant and want to work in a hardware store for the rest of their life, your friends may not like you very much and just put on an act for propriety sake, in fact one of those friends may be sleeping with your wife or husband, your pet may get run over by a car, your boss may despise you, the stockmarket could crash and all of your sense of security with it, your nice car is just a machine to get you places and the retirement fund could be gone tomorrow, you never know.  The whole point to this is that The Truman Show wants us to look a little closer at what it is that is important to us.  It shows and tells us in a round about way that we have become strange and demented when we prioritize the things in our life the way we do.  And in a way, every character in the Truman Show could be us.  How many of us want control the way Ed Harris has control?  How many of us are the loving wife ( or husband ) who is happy on the outside and stark raving mad and downright miserbable on the inside? How many of us want to tell the world that something is wrong with it the way Truman's one and only true love wanted to tell him?  How many of us are the consumate actor when we need to be just like Truman's best friend?  And how many of us are Truman, a guy that knows something is wrong with his/her life but has no idea what or how to fix it?  I think we are all like these people sometimes.  And that is what makes The Truman Show as brilliant as it is, because it is twisted but so is life.  If you haven't seen this film I strongly recommend that you do, and if possible watch it back to back with American Beauty.  Both have a lot to say about society in general, they go about it in different ways but it is essentially the same message. \n\" It's never to late to start over. \"This is a great film and one that should be seen to be appreciated.  It is a gem and deep down it wants us to look  closer.  Sorry to steal that catch phrase from American Beauty, but it applies here just as well.  Life is what you make of it, it just takes a little work.",

            "content": "One might wonder how you would view The Truman Show without the knowledge of the twist premise of Truman's life. It would be impossible to market, but it would be an interesting study in deconstructing all the oddities in Weir's direction and Biziou's cinematography. Their work in creating the world of Seahaven is done with excruciating care and detail much like the work of god-figure and showrunner Christof. Thousands of extras and covert cameras, a gigantic dome complete with artificial moon and sun, 400 life sized buildings, props and costumes of all kinds...But Biziou also injects a sense of hyper realism into the film. The use of high key lighting, the scenes slightly over-lit create a subtle and controlled sense of artificiality. It's combined with the voyeuristic photography; sneaky povs from behind car dashes and vending machines and cupboards, vignetted frames suggesting surveillance, the way the edits will bounce from normal compositions to handhelds from the likes of Meryl's necklace or the neighbour's trash-cam. The almost too pristine and perfect production design of Seahaven's architecture and sets provides a lived in and yet unnatural world that Truman resides in.Laura Linney is the consummate professional, Hannah Gill, who in turn beats out 5 other actresses to land the star role of Meryl, Truman's college sweetheart and eventual wife. There's plenty of love and sincerity punctuated briefly by moments of consciousness and recognition. Linney portrays these moments with such genuineness. A nervous glance at the hidden camera at the back of the car as Truman goes for maniacal joyride, or the nuance of the startled expression and scoff that she quickly struggles to hide when Truman confronts her: \"You can't stand me...That's not true!\" But she quickly re- establishes the veneer and takes the opportunity to parade another product for the millions of viewers. On several occasions, her sweetness is turned up to 11 and the camera quickly and eagerly zooms her satisfaction (and a clear view of the product name). Ed Harris' Christof doesn't seek to hide the nature of his feelings; the first extended sequence has him pulling all the strings from a sleek and moody studio in the sky, heavily contrasting the cheerful Seahaven. He expertly guides the broadcast for maximum emotional attachment, but is himself distant. In the final scenes, we are treated to an almost tearful monologue, a last plea from the father figure to his son, beckoning him to turn back into his loving arms. Harris plays this part out with such a tender sincerity that it's easy to forget his showrunner persona (the character of Marlon was once given cancer amidst contract disputes). In the bathroom or the shower there are no cameras, and the sex scenes are only hinted at, but ironically Christof has no real regard for his son's privacy. There's still complexity and depth; after several lighting strikes and a violent storm, Christof witnesses Truman's heroics (\"There's our hero shot\") and relents. The Truman Show could be described as satirical, but also prophetic in a way. After all, the international hit Big Brother only debuted the following year, but even that never hit the heights of Truman's audience. It's clearly exaggerated in size and scope, but the real question is, by how much? Roger Ebert makes a telling point; even a decade ago you would not see the likes of celebrity culture focused so intensely on subjects like Snooki or Honey Boo Boo. These days we have that in materialistic excess, entranced by the manufactured stories and plots and the high turnover rate, obsessed by every detail of their lives. If 20 million can watch the Neighbours wedding episode and millions more watch the royal wedding of 2011, how many would tune in to a real life Truman special wedding episode, especially with someone as accomplished as Christof to elicit the maximum emotional connection? I really like the role of Natascha McElhone as Sylvia, as a college extra who falls in love with Truman. It would have been easy to limit her character as just a unrequited love, but she eventually transforms into a protester of sorts, frequently calling in and pushing her agenda: Free Truman. It's such a pinpoint reflection of reality; it would be exactly the sort of protest group that would form if a Truman Show replica existed in our world, with the ever raging controversial debates on free will and the ethical and moral implications of such a show. The scary thing is that apart from Sylvia the world is sparse of this sort of concern; the parallel edits of the various fans of the show in different locations cheer and look on with hope and horror as Truman attempts his sea escape, and they burst into applause when he speaks his famous catchphrase and exits Seahaven...and then they switch channels and look for another source of entertainment. They are, like many reality show fans, hugely invested in Truman as a character, but oblivious to his nature as a real human being. I wonder how the film would play out with a more serious actor; whether Weir would forgo some comedic elements and add more drama, but then you lose the charm and appeal of Carrey in scenes like the beach pizza shop and the mirror astronaut play-acting. But even then, it doesn't matter. The illusion is never shattered; the audience only care for the final catchphrase. Linney and the fake making-of documentary reveal a little insight on the character of Gill; as a child actress who finally hits stardom and is very concerned with the nature of her contract. She's managed to negotiate a sizeable payment every time Meryl and Truman have sex. It's very easy to focus on that rather than the heartbreaking revelation that Truman is faced with at the end of the film.",

It's one of the very best that the 90's had to offer. At the same time, it's still underrated as a classic movie. Is it because Jim Carrey is the star? Because without him, I feel as though this film would have been more warmly accepted. But I defy you to think of a better actor to portray Truman than Carrey. In his first non-comic role, he captures tremendous vulnerability and childlike optimism. This role isn't a footnote in his career, it was the next level entirely. Peter Weir presents the film through the lens (literally) of hidden cameras. Every minute of this film, it seems that someone is watching him at different angles.

This Peter Weir comedy drama was the first role Carrey was able to give a more serious and dramatic role which earned him his first Golden Globe, showing the viewing public he could perform at a serious level, rather than constant slapstick. His sentimental portrayal of a man who wants a bit more out of life is excellent, dramatic and also a sign of hope for the watching audience of the Truman show, which was vital. Though I love Carrey's humour in previous films, I personally felt it was necessary to see a different side to him, and he pulls it off so well.The character Truman is a real joy to watch, a symbol of hope and joy for the viewing public. Having a lot to deal with, such as a stressful job and a complicated life with the loss of a loved one puts viewers at ease as it embodies what other people go through, to watch someone else go through it with a positive energy justifies the viewing audience. Having a goal also is inspiring and a great human characteristic.The plot is consistent with an excellent setting and idea behind it. We see typical objects and ideas associated with the reality TV genre, such as acting, props and of course the main setting for the show, which is the whole world Truman lives in, a real landmark for the reality genre and is executed brilliantly with a real sophisticated approach to it, where everyone is in certain place at certain times, which all revolve around the central protagonist, which makes the film slightly humorous to.Great support is given from Oscar nominated Ed Harris who plays the creator of the show. Laura Linney (Love actually) also performs well as Truman's wife.And with such a joyous and determined central protagonist, the Truman show will keep you hooked right to the inspiring and heart-warming final.",

            "content": "There's a point at which some works of fiction ask you to convert the \"willing suspension of disbelief\" which we must bring to any fictional work into \"throwing all critical faculties completely to the winds\", and that's what happens here. This film is mildly entertaining for a while..until you start actually thinking about some of what it asks you to take for granted. 1. Weather on demand. While we've all seen wave making pools, has anyone actually seen the technology to create violent localized storms? (While there are some who claim the \"secret\" government has such weather control technology, even they supposedly can only do it over a large area.) On a sound stage, this could only have been done with giant fans and large, obvious water-spewing machinery. Where were the fans and the other machinery? Or are we supposed to believe all that weather just came out of thin air? 2. Ventilation. With all the car exhaust and heat generated by the community and the artificial lighting, there obviously would have to be giant air conditioning systems (remember, the dome was supposed to be a closed, sealed location) to dissipate the heat and provide fresh air. Where were all the giant vents that would've been needed? The a/c equipment? The constant noise that large a/c equipment generates? 3. Wouldn't Truman have noticed that there were never any airplanes or helicopters seen flying anywhere? Wouldn't he have asked \"why don't we have any aircraft here?\" I can't think of any \"excuse\" for that which would have been even remotely plausible. 4. For this \"community\" to have gone on so long, it would've meant that all of Truman's \"schoolmates\" weer actors who grew up there along with him. Does anyone really think that so many children (actors, no less) could have kept such a big secret for so many years? Come on, now! You can bet that more than one kid over all that time would've felt the need to spill the beans. 5. Laura Linney's character was initially shown as a cheerleader. That means that the island's high school played competitive sports with other schools. So...does that mean they NEVER played an \"away\" game?? Wouldn't Truman have thought that to be a little strange? And would all of the opposing team's athletes have agreed to be bought off and keep silent? How much money would it have cost to buy the silence of those kids, in addition to all of those mentioned in 4. above? No t.v. show would have been able to marshal the huge budget necessary to pull all of this off on an ongoing basis -- not to mention the huge budget just to pay all of the hundreds of actors. 6. All t.v., radio, magazines, newspapers, movies and internet (yes, internet existed when this movie was made) coming to the island would have had to be censored of any references to The Truman Show. There's no way a t.v. network would be able to exercise such total control. Truman would have noticed that the only media were locally generated. Wouldn't he have asked why he was cut off from everything else? 7. Even if the supposed explanation that he was adopted by a corporation was valid, the moment he was restrained from free movement of any kind the corporation (and thus Christof) was committing the felony of kidnapping -- a federal crime which wouldn't have been excused. 8. There were even internal inconsistencies..e.g., \"Christof\" said in the Harry Shearer interview that all revenues for the show were generated by product placement. If that's so, then why did \"Meryl\" have to hold up various products to the camera and deliver spiels? 9. We're supposed to believe that \"Meryl\" was so upset by some of the manifestations of Truman's waking-up process that she breaks into tears and claims she \"can't work under these conditions, it's not professional\". But at the same time, we're supposed to believe that living for years in a sham marriage with a man she doesn't love (and presumably, routinely having sex with him) was perfectly okay with her, simply because it was a paid gig! That's pretty cold, even for Hollywood.",

The Truman Show is a film on the level of grand classics, a frenzy of Bizarro Humor and life time morals. The movie manages to touch on themes of Life, Faith, and all while being a satire of Reality TV.Now I'm about twelve years late to the party, but even in the new decade Reality TV takes over the airwaves like no ones business. The Truman Show is still culturally relevant if not more so nowadays than when it was released. Seriously, the movie came out in an era where Flavor of Love hadn't existed yet.The story of The Truman Show is easy enough to say. Truman (Carrey) is the center of a reality TV show, and has been since his birth. The story begins to unfold as he begins to discover this fact. And if I said anything more I'd spoil the movie. Needless to say, the plot weaves through the key themes I mentioned before.There is no reason to not see this movie. It's a classic, an instant love. Its easy on the real melodrama, and if you were going to poke holes in it you'd have to work hard to find one that mattered very much. Overall, this movie leaves a message that is resounding.One of the best films to be released last decade, one of the best films ever made.",

            "content": "The major factor in this is one of the best screenplays i've ever seen. Its a thing of beauty the way it progresses, shifting gracefully through different levels of reality: first we begin inside the show (with opening credits like \"Truman Burbank as Himself, Created by Christoph\"), along with interviews with cast members to establish the concept that Truman Burbank is naive to the fact that his entire environment is contrived by a television producer in the ultimate reality television experiment, everything from the weather to the dialogue of the actors who play the people close to Truman. This terrific concept never loses its impact: each time you see it, it takes you on the journey again. Even considering the spate of actual reality TV that has invaded our homes since 1998, which this movie foretold (or perhaps inspired), this movie will always retain its appeal because its specific situation, raising a baby in a reality-TV environment and keeping them from knowing they are on TV and that they are fake (in other words, what reality TV strives for, giving viewers genuine reality to watch, in the person of Truman), is not likely to happen in real life.Each moment is so beautifully rendered in cinematic language that film buffs the world over should feel like applauding it at every turn during a second viewing in particular. Take the scene where Truman goes to the travel agent to book his trip to Fiji: we see Truman standing in the agency, with bags in hand and beach-holiday clothes, and the most precious musak plays in the background. When he sits, we see a poster on the wall behind him with a plane being struck by lightening and big letters \"THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!\" So simply, it conveys to us that they are going to try and stop Truman travelling by plane as well.And the much-praised performance from Carrey really holds the movie together. He's got the tone just right for this movie: which might be perfectly described as \"wry.\" It has a fable-like quality, each moment infused with humour, yet we never lose sight of the eerie reality that this is a human being trapped in this situation.The full credit for achieving this delicate balance of tone goes to Peter Weir (Australian director of Dead Poets Society, Gallipoli, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Witness, Mosquito Coast and Master and Commander).The Truman Show is without a doubt one of the best movies of the 90's. A rare perfect film. 5 stars.Best bit: the two most famous scenes, the stopping traffic scene and the incredible final scene.",

The film takes amusing potshots at everyone: people who are utterly absorbed by television shows, the producers as well as the actors.

Yet he dreams of going away.One day a series of curious incidents lead him to believe there's something strange about his environment, like if the whole world is revolving around him. And funnily enough it is: Truman is, with out his own knowledge, a start of a reality show, that had begun the very day he was born. Among unwanted babies he was chosen to be a star of the Truman Show, a live broadcast viewed by millions of people all around the world, dreaming of more simple world they live in.The Truman Show is a well woven satire about the extremities of reality television. Despite it feels like a show revolving around a single clueless individual would be far fetched, it doesn't feel like that at all, when you compare it to a stream of \"reality\" nonsense in the TV today. While the movie itself comes a tale of a man, who is trying to travel to the edge of his own reality, the other aspects of the movie good deal of criticism and very justified questions about the whole nature of reality TV graze.All in all the cast is solid and does a very good job. Ed Harris is especially good as Christof, megalomaniac director/creator of the show, who is trying his hardest to keep Truman in his place. Jim Carrewy gives one of his best performances, showing he can do serious work, if given good enough script to work with. While the music is used sparingly, the soundtrack contains some very memorable tunes.The Truman Show is one of those movies I usually watch from beginning to the end, if I happen to catch it from the TV.

Jim's funny personality really drove home the humor in the movie. Serious scenes were expertly acted by all members of the cast and I found myself enjoying every minute of the film.The Truman Show included many satirical elements inside some of the funnier scenes in the movie. The film uses satire as a means to show the audience that forcing your own ideals on someone is not always a good idea. In the movie, the director tries to play god and run the life of Truman. Truman eventually finds out that his entire life is a lie and tries to escape. After Truman finds the exit of his artificial world, the director tries to convince Truman to stay by telling him that the world he has been living in is better than the real world but Truman decides to leave anyways. The message behind this is a strong one and the movie did a good job of getting it's message across.",

            "review_title": "A Reality Shift",
            "content": "The Truman Show is one of my favourite films of all time. I think that even though it's fairly simple to follow the story, there are layers beneath the surface. There are so many stories in this film that are unexplored, and a lot of major pieces of the story are hidden in the background of shots or barely referenced. Something that I feel is a major part of the film is the activist movement, led by Silvia, to free Truman. However, we barely get a glimpse at her work, only hearing about it through her phone conversation with Cristof, and seeing the countless 'Free Truman' banners, posters, and memorabilia in her apartment. We don't know the extent of what she's done to free him, and that's a layer that I think really adds to the film. Another layer is that nearly every person shown watching the show is absolutely thrilled to see Truman escape. Other than Cristof, no one is upset or angry. It begs the question, why did they watch the show in the first place? If the general public was happy that Truman escaped, did they already believe that his imprisonment was wrong? And if they knew that the show was inhumane, why did they watch it in the first place, and buy Truman merchandise? My theory is that, well, people are lazy. I think the general public assumed that eventually, Cristof and his team would give up and set Truman free. The two security guards at the end of the film sum it up very well- 'What else is on?' They don't really care about Truman's life. TV is TV to them, and seeing someone escape after being lied to for thirty years is great TV!\nI think that the Truman Show has an incredible story, and the imagery, style, and cinematography has stuck with me for years (since I first watched it). Truman's last scene, where his boat hits the wall of the dome and he walks on the 'horizon' is breathtaking. The combination of the impact of the story and the beautiful colours of the cinematography makes it a truly iconic scene. Another feat of technical excellence in the Truman Show, in my opinion, is the way that almost every shot feels like it came from a hidden camera somewhere near Truman. You can tell when a shot or angle comes from a camera hidden on a person, like in a tie or brooch, or when someone carries a camera, like the old man with the garbage bin.\nIn the second half of the film, Cristof becomes a major character. He is the creator of the Truman Show, and, in his eyes, a god. However, not everyone sees it that way. Because people around the world are cheering for Truman's escape, they must hate the person keeping him imprisoned. Cristof is the villain to Truman and the viewer, which includes the viewers of the Truman Show in the film, and us, the viewers of the film.\nAs Truman's world begins to unravel, Cristof is hurrying to try and put it back together. Throughout, he remains nonchalant and almost boasts about his creation. When asked why Truman has never figured it out, Cristof says 'We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.' I believe that this statement is very true, especially for someone who grew up in that world and that reality. When, as a child, you are presented with a world, you will be curious about it, but before long you accept that it is real. We accepted the reality of our world just as Truman did, but how do we know we're not part of a bigger-scale secret reality TV show?\nOur world isn't that great, and there are several realities that I wish could be changed. Our current reality may seem a little similar to Truman's; we cannot leave our homes or towns, but that's where the similarities end. After this is over, it will be strange to go out into the world and see what has changed. After Truman leaves the show, he'll have a hard time adjusting, just like we will.\nThese shifts in reality have huge impacts on us, which I think is another layer of the film that really adds to it, making this a film I would enjoy watching over and over.",

Ed Harris, a good actor gives one of his greatest performances ever as Christof, the creator, the \"father\" and the villain who obsesses with the Truman Show so much that he makes Truman a prisoner in his world.There are some flaws though. Why did Christof have to obsess about Truman so much? What was so special about Truman that made everyone watch him on the TV? And what was Christof trying to prove in his show? That people's private lives must be watched by others? Though the flaws kind of drag the movie a little, it is nonetheless a masterpiece and one of Jim Carrey's greatest and I think he should play more dramatic roles that one day will get him a Oscar that he deserves.9 out of 10.",

Writer Andrew Nicol and director Peter Weir take us into the extraordinary world of Truman Burbank, a sheltered young man with an alleged perfect life whose life, as it is slowly revealed to the viewer, is a 24-7 television show, directed by a God-like dictator (Ed Harris)who has televised and controlled Truman'life from birth and is determined to hold onto Truman even after he has caught onto what is happening. The thing I love about this story is the way it unfolds slowly...the story is told at a leisurely pace and we are only thrown subtle clues at first. There's a wonderful moment where Truman is walking down the street and is almost brained on the head by a spotlight. The expression on Truman's face at seeing a spotlight fall from the sky is just priceless and we are scratching our heads the same way Truman is. Once Truman realizes what is going on, he wants nothing to do with it and attempts to escape. Whether or not Truman escapes is unimportant, what is important is watching Truman trying to figure out what is going on. Jim Carrey redefined his career completely with this completely captivating performance in the title role. Carrey proved that he knew how to do more than pratfalls and mugging with this thoughtful and riveting performance and it was outrageous that Carrey was not nominated for an Academy Award. I don't know about winning but he at least deserved a nomination. Ed Harris, as Cristof, the director of Truman's show, gives the performance of his career that should have won him the Oscar. He was nominated but was robbed. A wonderful film that is worth seeing if for no other reason than to marvel at the amazing performances of Carrey and Harris.",

He has a jolly, cheerful character inside of him, and is toned down from his past films, which is acceptable. Consider him a world famous television icon, if you will, because THE TRUMAN SHOW is how simple, everyday life compares simultaneously with a never-ending broadcast. In other words, \"All Truman, All The Time! 24 Hours A Day, 7 Days A Week!\". (L.O.L.) Many will miss Carrey's goofball personality, which confirms a local newspaper out here giving this one of the worst five movies of 1998. Well, go figure! You have many options of how to describe the movie. Is it based on real life accounts or is it an imaginative fantasy about the world media? Does it mean to be heartwarming or just made to be the highest-rated television program in the world? Will it be funny, or will it make you shed some tears? It's obvious that the first half tends to be tedious, only for the second to be more meaningful as we finally understand our pal Truman being under surveillance by a special broadcast control center past the heavens. This bares a similarity with God in control of everything around him on the earth. It appears like Truman is the inspiration for every one of us who tune in. Overall, I discovered the second half being the best feature, but while it had the best entertaining value, it goes by way too fast along with its final ending, making me beg for more. THE TRUMAN SHOW isn't a bad idea on Peter Weir's part, but it might not be appealing enough to attract our strong desires for solid enjoyment. I fare this film better than the newspaper gave it, but as a whole, I say \"above average\".",

However, what we got was a feel-good, cop-out ending of such massive proportion that I literally felt like shaking the filmmakers and saying, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?SPOILERS AHEAD\nThe main reason for my wrath was the ending. If you have not seen the film, you are duly warned to stop reading here.We are supposed to cheer for Truman along with the television audience as he finds the doorway to freedom. I felt that to be a MAJOR cop-out. Truman needed to confront the people who turned his entire life into a lie. I wanted to see him confront his \"so-called\" best friend who lied to Truman POINT-BLANK. Where was the payback? Where was the justice? Where was the ethical outrage? We get humorous scenes of \"Free Truman\" factions attempting to alert Truman to his plight, but does Truman ever make anyone feel bad for what they did to him? Christof certainly felt justified in his approach, as did all of the paid actors AND the TV audience. But, if I was Truman, I'd use the opportunity to teach Christof, the actors, AND the TV audience a lesson about how to treat people. But it was an opportunity squandered.In my opinion, there were only 2 good characters in the film: Truman, and the woman he loved. Other than that, EVERY OTHER CHARACTER lies to Truman. EVERY OTHER CHARACTER deceives Truman. There needed to be some satisfactory confrontation, but there wasn't. It was the most empty feeling I've ever had watching a movie. I only rated it on film quality and not script content because the film is actually very artfully executed.But my point is this: Escape (in this case, Truman's) sometimes isn't enough. You sometimes must teach those who wronged you a lesson. You must show them the error in their ways, and those responsible should pay dearly for their moral and ethical transgressions.

            "content": "It makes me feel so good to see that this film is in IMDB's top 250 films! This film completely deserves it!  Jim Carrey is one of the best actors of this generation and I hope he continues to make excellent films like this one.  Usually, I'm not one to like films with a \"deeper meaning\", but I really like this film, because it gives you so much to think about and makes for an interesting story.  At first I thought this film was absolutely improbable, but after watching for my 3rd or 4th time, I don't think it's all that absurd (extremely unlikely, but not completely impossible).Director Peter Weir did a fantastic job with this film and this is probably one of his best films.  The cast was excellent throughout the film.  Ed Harris was just as great as always.  Laura Linney was superb as Meryl. Also, I think Natascha McElhone and Noah Emmerich deserve some special notice for their work.  The rest of the supporting cast was good as well, Paul Giamatti, Harry Shearer, Philip Baker Hall and everyone else.If you like Jim Carrey, then you really ought to see this film.  Be aware that this film is more of a dramatic comedy, as opposed to his complete zany comedy films made prior to this one.  I really hope that you do give this film a chance, and I hope even more that you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading,-Chris",

            "content": "An outstanding creation based on an extraordinary scenario, this title does not disappoint even for a second, is engaging, funny and mysterious at the same time. But most important \"The Truman Show\" is a film that launches a question shocking but completely necessary: Is the world we live in an illusion ? Are we treated with arrogance and are our rights violated?Truman is a common individual, who works as an insurance salesman in town. He sincerely loves his wife, and always had a strange desire to go to Fiji, desire which never came to life.What he doesn't know is that his entire existence is, in fact, a very popular reality-show, produced and directed by controversial figure Christoff. Truman's life experience was, so far, fake and distorted. Everything he does is caught on tape. His life is rendered with accuracy 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Obviously, the television series was suggestively named \"The Truman Show\".As time goes by, Truman begins to become suspicious.Step by step, he rebels and decides to claim his entitled right to freedom. Will he get out of the universe created by Christoff, or not? Watch Truman Show and you will find out.I was particularly impressed by this movie. Peter Wier managed to render a masterly psychological and challenging experience in a concise way, simple and to the point, accessible to all. For that he deserves all the praise he can get because, as far as I'm concerned it is enormously difficult to express a profound message in a manner so classy and suggestive.The acting was good enough, not great but still good. Jim Carrey did very well as Truman Burbank the central character of this title, not as well as he did in \"Man on the Moon\" for example, but still he was satisfactory, Ed Harris has exemplary shown Christoff's character and perspective, an eccentric genius willing to overlook any moral law in the name of television. Laura Linney did just fine as she was quite convincing in her very intriguing role, taking into account that she played a pretended wife, who played an actress, if you appreciate the irony.To conclude, Truman Show is an impressive title, which can not let anyone indifferent because of it's spectacular scenario presented in such a suggestive, sometimes even hilarious, manner. I appreciate it as one of the best films of the last 50 years, and accordingly deserves a maximum ***** out of *****",

The metaphor is very, very potent in this one. So much goes into criticizing our current publicity/promotion oriented society, governed and determined by money, where man is turned into either a slave (Carrey) or a machine. This film is a big, big eye-opener on what free-will has become in our societies, free-will which we supposedly have more of now than ever before in our history. This film is quite subtle, pays attention to detail well enough, and delivers an incredible metaphor that seems too great for anyone to miss out on. Just one of these main, essential ideas that should've been made before but wasn't, and now this is it right here, and you have to watch it. Oh and although it makes for a great watch, a very entertaining, eventful, catchy watch - the ending is clearly a level above the whole thing.",

He was born in a cinema studio, he is property of the studio, and his life is transmitted all over the World: The best of all reality shows, a real life on TV: He has a father, mother, friends ... all actors but Truman who suspects nothing about the deception.

To keep someone in a place and intrude on their life is not in my mind good viewing but evil. Ed Harris' character should have been arrested for kidnapping not given awards. I thought Carrey's acting was just the same as the rest of his stuff just toned down slightly. The ending was totally implausible and unbelievable. I do not have one nice thing to say about this film, all Truman's co-workers obviously were too greedy to see what they were doing was wrong. I know it is just a film but with the way television is going this type of thing is potentially just round the corner and it will be a big mistake the day that someone actually does this.

The concepts in both movies are similar, and more importantly, The Truman Show came out before The Matrix did.Dunno why there was not a single Academy Award for this great movie. I just love it and couldn't stop thinking about it.Just one question about it (a little spoiler in it, but...): When Truman was sitting in the beach, why was the rain falling on himself only but not anything else? If the crew's purpose is to make Truman believe in the \"world\" he was living in, they shouldn't have made this error, should they? I mean, if I were part of the weather crew, I would downpour the beach area where Truman was sitting. From the movie, it looked to be an important prompt for Truman to realize that there was a plot around him. The crew has been controlling all this for about 30 years, and it is hardly believable that they would have made such a stupid error.By the way, I found the director character Christol is quite likable. I happened to find he was also the Marine General in The Rock (1996). The opening speech by him in front of the Marine cemetery was touching and the following mutiny his command staged was pretty impressive.",

            "review_title": "My favourite film of all time!",
            "content": "The Truman Show is a movie I would not claim to be the best movie ever made. However it is one of the best movies, and it is definitely the one I care most about. The reason why this movie works so well for me and why i think it is so unique is that this movie lies perfectly in the sweet spot of what i like. The movie is not too long. Not too short. Its sad, but not too sad. Its funny, but not to annoying extend. Its a clever film, with an interesting plot but not in a way you have to use 150% of your brains to keep up. The characters are unique but none is acting over the top. The music is beautiful, original and perfectly fitting. The decor and setting is very well done. Just perfectly balanced. Most of the times when I am watching a masterpiece, there is always a drawback (like for instance a film being too long, or having boring bits or being too complicated or forced at times) The Truman show has no drawbacks for me.Another thing i need to point out is the message of this film. This film is about a man who is trapped in his own reality show without knowing it. Ever since he was born he is recorded and everyone surrounding him even his parents are actors in the film. He lives in a complete lie where all of his surroundings is a construction for his television show. This means that he never left the film set for his entire life due to fears of traveling that they gave him when he was younger.This is where i think this is one of the most poetic films of all time. You have a kind man living in a created paradise where everything is perfect. If he will just stay where he is, he will always be save, with a good life, without any harm or problems. And the only thing he wants is to get out! It shows how people are not made to live in a perfectly controlled environment and that there will always be a natural desire for imperfections and freedom in a lifetime.Also Truman finds true love with a woman that start to care about him. But she wasn't one of the actors that he was supposed to be with. She is the first one to try to get him out of this place. I'd love her part because she is an active being trying to help him out even though she doesn't have the power to do so. (I think this is important because I feel a lot of classic and well received movies unfortunately tend to portray women as kind of useless beings at times). So to have her as a character that means much for his desire to escape but also her active role of getting him out i find very refreshing.So they take her away from Truman, and they make sure he will never meet her again. They make Truman mary another woman who is just an actress. Their love isn't even real. Now the beautiful part is that the other woman can still follow The Truman Show on television and see how truman still thinks about her. I think that is both sad and romantic at the same time.She also has a button on her clothes that says: \"How's it going to end?\" Both Truman and the audience is wondering the same thing throughout the movie. And that is also the main question of the film itself. How's it going to end?Another thing i love is that this movie has no clear villain. The only person you may consider a villain is the person that took most care for Truman his entire life, but also destroying him at the same time even though he doesn't want to. And that is the director in the film. You feel that everything he does, is meant to do right yet he does everything so egocentrically wrong. There are scenes in which you can feel his sadness about his own undoing. Directing The Truman show made The Truman Show also become his life as well. And he loves Truman more then anyone else. He honestly believes what he is doing is the right thing for Truman. It makes you wonder, who actually lives the lie here? I have never seen a 'bad guy' being portrayed so originally.Besides all this, Truman is played by Jim Carry. And it is in my opinion together with his part in Eternal Sunshine his best role ever played. He is not as Jim Carrey-ish as you picture him in most movies. An absolute must see film!",

It would have been great if the director died. During the film, I imagined myself going up to him with a gun and shooting him in the head. The sad thing is that there is people like him in real life that would do anything to make a profit even if it included brainwashing someone for thirty years.

            "content": "As a satire this movie was decent, as a movie for pure entertainment purposes it had a weak plot and no real climax point. There were many places where satire was seen in this movie. The first satirical element we saw was irony when Truman agreed to take part in a job that he needed to take the ferry to get to, except he was prepared to go and then he did the exact opposite, walk off the pier and not go. This was a good example of dramatic irony. I think that the target of this satire is reality television. There are many similarities between the Truman Show and reality television such as, both give others insight on people's' lives through television and both are a little too invasive in the stars' life, especially the Truman Show because the people can watch Truman for 24 hours if they'd like to. Because the target of this satire is reality television it could be said that the Truman Show is merely an inflation of reality TV to show people the problems that are present in reality TV. The Truman show shows Truman as a baby and you get to see him grow up, most have been watching him his whole life, and in reality TV when there are child stars, like Kendall and Kylie Jenner (who have been on reality TV from a young age), the audience watches them grow up as well, the Truman Show just takes it to the extreme. Reality TV and the Truman show are also similar in the fact that they don't want the stars to leave, so they create obstacles. In reality TV the obstacle that most stars face when trying to get out of the limelight is media backlash/loss of fame. Both of these things can be very hard to face, that's why the star will continue to be a star and make their boss company money. The obstacle for Truman is that he is terrified of water. This fear was instilled in him by the producers of his show, made so that even if he wanted to leave he would be too scared because Seahaven is surrounded by water.",

The perennial story of the fight for freedom, told in a truly original way. If you think you are left unsatisfied with the end, you are potential viewers of the fictional Truman Show.

But something is wrong, and he can't put a finger on it. Until one day, he sees his thought-to-be-dead father, and things start falling into place. His life is one, big TV show. From birth, Truman was adopted by a company for the express purpose of televising his life. From the day he was born to the day he would die, Truman Burbank is a TV star, even if he doesn't know it.This movie is all about Jim Carrey. The big talk was how he signed for $13 million (a pay cut from his normal $20 million salary) so he could do a more serious film. Could he pull it off? And I'm here to tell you, not only did he pull it off, it's an award winning performance! Anytime the audience feels so strongly for a character on screen, the actor has done his job, and in this movie, I felt like I was a part of Truman. He's a sweet, loveably guy, who was put into a situation without permission. Nothing in his life is real, from his marriage to his friends, to the guy selling him his newspaper every day. And Carrey makes you feel sad for him, but he gives Truman a heroic quality that makes you cheer for him to break free from the ties that bind. The story itself was unlike one I had ever seen before. One man (Ed Harris) controlled an entire city. From the sun rise, to crossing the street, everything was timed perfectly. And billions of people each day sat and watched the life of Truman Burbank. I read that Jim Carrey felt The Truman Show was like his own life, in that everything he does is seen by millions of people, and sometimes, you just need to be left alone. I'm glad he chose to do this movie, because maybe now people will understand him a little better.  It was just a shame that he didn't win the Academy award for Best Actor, I mean he didn't even get nominated.  What a shame.

In their prison. It doesn't matter that Seahaven Island might in fact be the greatest place on Earth, and that the real world is \"this sick place\". Truman should still be afforded the luxury of choice that we all have. And when you consider that he didn't even get to choose the girl that he married, it makes you feel that much more for him. And I think there is SOME truth to the statement that \"We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.\" At least, Christof wasn't so blind that he actually realized, \"He could leave anytime, if this was more than just a vague ambition, if he really truly wanted to leave, there's no way we could stop him.\" He was right.

With the right mix of comedy and drama to go down with it too, The Truman Show shows us what a show is all about and in a true sense shows us how obsessed the ordinary person is with certain peoples lives. I felt the film was safely a great movie, and here below is why I felt that about it all.The story is superbly smartly done and whoever even thought if this idea is just awesome, it brings us all the elements we want to see from a film like this too and certain moments when Truman is finally seeing what the world is all about are just fantastic. The film isn't scared to be fun either as the story although is serious, the things we see in it sometimes aren't and we can get a few laughs out of this but as I said before, it incorporates the right amount of drama into it's plot too. One minor thing is that the for it's running time of 103 minutes it manages to fit such a complex plot into such a short amount of time, just brilliant in my opinion.Jim Carrey portrays Truman in the way we always expect from Carrey, loud and very crazy, although this isn't like all his roles as Carrey has to deal with the drama too and manages not to always be trying to be funny, a good job from him. Ed Harris as the TV network head is kind of a strange mix of evil and goodness, where as he wants the show to continue, you can also tell it slightly eats him up that Truman is shown to people like this. The entire cast do an excellent job and even the odd policeman or shoe owner seems to do there performance with a hop and a smile, just good fun had by all.Peter Weir does a fun job and really makes this his prime artistic vision that is brought to life perfectly, this is probably his best piece of work in my opinion. Andrew Niccol the writer also chips in with his artistic vision in writing to create dialogue that just keeps are eyes on the screen to see what this insane thing is all about. I loved the sets used and not to ruin some cool things which you will see for yourself but some things are positioned in some pretty neat places too.Although the film is great, it isn't without maybe minor things which stop it from being superb, Like for example I didn't find this that funny and although it fun and bouncy when trying to be funny, you won't be crying with laughter at this. I also felt the ending was poor and although it makes for an interesting end and one you definitely wouldn't expect, we don't get to explore much of it and just ends right there right then. It isn't perfect but it is has very little problems so if you ignore them things, this could be one of the best films you will ever see.For those who love Jim Carrey well this is probably one of if not his best work in film and although as I said he holds back on humour slightly, he still manages a fantastic performance as Truman which mixes a lot of elements together. I think if you ever wanted a thought provoking film then this is it, I don't think it make you think philosophically, but it makes you think about human nature and lying etc, what the world really thinks of other people and how we talk about each other.Overall will give it a 8/10, Safely a Great movie, I couldn't recommend this much more to you and especially to those who consider themselves as film connoisseurs as I feel this could be essential viewing. Have fun with this movie and it will reward you, come in thinking of it as super serious and you will be disappointed, I can assure you that watching this can give you a little smile and although sometimes you might feel like shouting \"GET OUT OF THERE TRUMAN\", you still just feel happy for him the entire way through.",

At least 20 times later, it still moves me and excites me just as much as it did the first time, which, to me makes it one of the best movies ever made.Jim Carrey sheds his hyperactive manic personality that has earned him so much money to play the straight man, and conjures up a believable and endearing character. As Truman, Carrey brings a feeling of wide-eyed innocence to the role, and effortlessly portrays Truman's realization that the world around him is all a farce.With enough imagination, wonder, humor and emotion for five movies, The Truman Show is a brilliant, somewhat overlooked masterpiece that can easily hold it's own against many classic movies.

            "content": "(Warning: spoilers ahead) For me, The Truman Show is as close to a perfect movie as you are likely to get: not only it provides you with abundant food for thought, but also it is beautiful to see and very, very entertaining. It goes beyond the simple speculation about the value of privacy and the lack of ethics in the entertainment business, but it leads to ponder about weightier things, for instance the matter of a sheltered but not very interesting life vs. a life of adventure with nothing guaranteed. Also, the reason why utopias don't work: Christof thinks that a world that resembles a fifties movie is the perfect world, whereas Truman's dream is to explore some South Pacific island never visited by man. And, of course, the quest for truth vs. a beautiful lie: In his obstinate search for the true world, Truman understands that truth's beauty surpasses any lie, no matter how shiny or cozy.The movie is full of visual beauty, especially towards the end, when the \"perfect\" world starts to unravel with Truman's flight. The Magrittesque images of the moon-as-a-spotlight, the boat ramming the sky and Truman walking on water to a staircase apparently suspended above the horizon are the kind of thing that you just can't forget.Jim Carrey plays a perfect Truman, innocent but also determined. In fact it is hard to imagine another actor playing this role. Ed Harris is also perfect, truly frightening in a role that would have looked ridiculous in the hands of a lesser actor. Laura Linney, as Truman's dimple-cheeked \"wife\" plays very well the sinister side of her character.Of course, everyone is free to dislike this movie, but there are some things I'd like to say about the negative comments: to begin with, lots of people wondered about the possibility of anyone wanting to see a TV program like this... The only thing I have to say about this is that I'm surprised at how fast (only within a couple of years) this objection has become irrelevant. The other objection was about the movie's allegedly \"happy\" ending. I don't think the ending is \"happy\": Truman and Sylvia disappear both through dark doorways, and, although we are free to imagine that they will eventually be together and happy living in Fidji, we don't know if this is really what will happen. But this is the point, isn't it, not to know how's it going to end?",

            "content": "Sporting performances of depth and subtlety and with a brilliant storyline, \"The Truman Show\" is an exhilarating satire on media saturation in the modern world.  Whilst it is certainly flawed to a degree, the picture's plot and theme ring true all too often.  The effect is chilling.Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a quiet, mild-mannered insurance worker in the small coastal town of Seahaven.  What he has been unaware of up until this point is that his entire life, from the day he was born, has been filmed as part of 24-hour TV show and that everyone he knows, even his wife and best friend, is an actor.  Seahaven itself is really a gigantic set built for the show.  But little by little, Truman begins to suspect the truth, culminating in a rebellion that shatters the very foundations of his existence.With shows like \"Big Brother\" and \"Castaway\" playing with the very idea of \"reality TV\", not to mention media obsession with celebrity, \"The Truman Show\" really hits home and acts as a very powerful cautionary tale about media greed, power and intrusion.  The film argues that surrendering to media power will mean we lose the ability to think and act for ourselves. \nThe film ties this in with an attack on small-town life, seeing it as stuffy, restrictive and fake.  This theme is embodied in Seahaven's surroundings, which are beautiful but ultimately synthetic, and the people that inhabit them, actors who have become too used to routine and who repeat the same lines and moves day in and day out.  The analogy to the real thing is both subtle yet shocking.Gradually seeing through all this is Jim Carrey as Truman.  Unlike films like \"Ace Ventura\" and \"Dumb and Dumber\", this is a role where Carrey really gets to stretch his acting, as opposed to just his facial, muscles.  He pulls the role off very well, creating a convincing character who never loses his essential goodness even as the disturbing reality of his life eventually becomes clear to him.Another terrific performance is Ed Harris as the show's creator Christof, who controls Truman's every move from a room hidden in the set's moon. Christof appears to care alot about Truman, but he's really only concerned with ratings and money and this is what finally proves his undoing. \nCarrey and Harris are supported by an array of brilliant, well-cast supporting players who served very well by a witty and suspenseful script. \nThe scenario isn't entirely perfect.  In fact, the whole setup appears so fragile it seems a wonder Truman didn't work the whole thing out earlier. But this is a very minor flaw.Well-directed and very well-acted, \"The Truman Show\" stands as a frightening but thought-provoking parable on media power that is still very relevant in these chaotic times.",

I have seen Jim Carrey in a some other movies like Bruce Almighty / Ace Ventura and other films were he is funny however for this film funny does not describe it enough !! this movie is funny , real , fun , charming , has heart , intriguing , juicy , touching , has a lot of soul in it , witty , clever and very unique in many ways. Well first before I talk about the movie I would like to say that Peter Weir seems to be a great director - although I have not seen his movie Witness that stars Harrison Ford( that people seem to mention the most on here ) I have seen Dead Poets Society and Fearless that I would say are underrated masterpieces ( i should review those movies on here soon ) !! and this film belongs in the masterpiece category as well it would only make logical sense for me to put ' Witness ' on my Netflix list to watch eventually. So let me talk about this movie a little bit here Truman Burbank is a star of a 24 hour TV show that he has no idea about when he starts to realizes something is wrong in his life his goal ? to be free - he has to \" BREAK out of the CAGE \" but who gets in the way Ignorant / stubborn / arrogant Christof who as well was brilliantly played the actor whose name is Ed Harris. He is the villain of the movie.Outstanding !!!! this movie is 100 % creative / great actors and Jim Carrey is real innocent emotional human. Ed Harris did a great job , there's a beautiful flow start to end with a wonderful ending of Truman , sound track is amazing , camera shots were greatly unique / lines * the movie had a bunch of great / comical one lines that i need to remember and script gets an A + its rare for a movie to get 10 out 10 however this one deserves it !!!!",

            "review_title": "Definitely Different but broadly entertaining",
            "content": "There is one fantastic reason to see this movie, it has broad audience appeal yet at the same it is very different from other movies and no one has ever recreated it....yet. Truman, played by Jim Carrey (Great acting, but not really Oscar quality material) lives blissfully aware that he life is just a television program. But his journey is to discover the truth about his life and attempt to escape the illusion.Australia director Peter Weir has often delved into the theme of isolation, in the Australian outback with \"picnic at hanging rock\" (I went there but I was disappointed not to disappear), on the Ocean in \"Dead Calm\", in the mind with a post traumatic syndrome suffering plane crash survivor \"Fearless\" and in an exotic community \"Witness\" (The Amish in the big city and Cop in the Amish community both experience this). Often disappointing for people who love Peter Weir, the Truman show appears on the surface too light and fluffy, but we find the same themes being repeated here. Does this movie reflect the relationship between God and humanity, children and parents or government and society...yes to all the above. However I feel the main theme is the relationship between the American people and the unreality of American TV.Truman is trapped in a giant studio with an artificial sun and weather. He can't escape because people try and stop him and his own fears. Fears that reflect how television and movies (which appear on TV) make viewers feel about the rest of the world. Most criticisms of this movie fail to see the truth behind the illusions. The overly constructed world that Truman lives in reflects the reality of TV but makes it harder for us to identify with Truman and his personal despair. This movie requires you to watch it with your brain turned and you must attempt to deconstruct this world. Something that is not common in a mass market appeal movie.Sometimes criticised for not being dark enough (just because the lighting is bright and shiny and Truman is a happy and wacky guy these people say it is not dark....they need a good slapping). Sometimes criticised for being too superficial (that is the point, that is what TV is like). Sometimes criticised for not keeping many of the incidental characters around long enough (Truman exists in a world where he is the only \"real\" person so it is a solo journey and only the shows producer, who represents the world and not a person, are part of).Sometimes criticised for not showing Truman's interaction with the real world (I agree but that is a different movie and something done better many times over \"Being there\" for example).What does it all mean, my own take is this. Television is not trying to keep us down, but challenging us to take on the adventure of life. Television doesn't want us to avoid reality but to go turn off the television and find the best and most exciting reality we can. If you are not brave, clever or good enough for the world, don't blame television.I would challenge those who didn't like it the first time to revisit it. For those who haven't seen it, watch it dude, there is nothing else like so you are either going to like it or not.Oh...and one advice for Mr Weir...people who like art-house movies are not really that intelligent. Next time use lots of spooky dark art noi lighting and they will like it too (that was irony by the way).",

You'd be forgiven for thinking someone is watching what you're doing, especially with the abundance of CCTV nowadays.That's what inevitably happens in the life of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). Unfortunately he's not gazed upon for reasons of security, as he is unaware his life is actually a 24/7 hour show for the rest of the world. From womb to tomb, his actions have kept millions enthralled, but a few broken set pieces and a lost love may finally pull the blanket over Truman's eyes.This is probably Jim Carrey at his most mature so far. He's a performer who has such a wonderful bounce in his step, that makes him devilishly cartoony in everything he's ever done both comedic and serious. Ed Harris is fantastic as the show runner, and for as serious as the film gets emotionally. I don't think it ever underwhelms or overwhelms either.Regardless, you sympathise with Truman because his life has been manipulated so well. But maybe that was another subtle point the movie was making, that someone's misery is abused for ratings despite differences from right and wrong? Saying that, I don't really think I'd ever question my existence to the extent of Truman's, and I really admire this quotation from director Peter Wier: \"This was a dangerous film to make because it couldn't happen.

An absolute gem of cinema.\nThere is so much about this film that I love. The overall idea of a man's life controlled and watched entirely by a TV corporation is intriguing as can be. I especially love how the TV set resembles a '50s nuke town, architecture wise and how the civilians (all actors) dress and speak. It's a perfect environment in which the protagonist, Truman Burbank, can gradually find small hints and clues as to what elaborate, insidious plan is taking place over his life.\nMore to add is the stellar cinematography it has. The shots are arranged as if we are seeing it through the hidden cameras put on the TV set, and it can be in the most peculiar of places - light-posts, trash cans, posters, magazines, even Truman's wedding ring. This aspect adds another layer to the film that is unique from most other films' standard camera framing.\nThe musical score fits the film in the most absolutely perfect way - that is unparalleled to anything I've witnessed before. Yes, I have since come to learn that the musical score was in fact not composed for this film, but for a 1989 foreign film - but the notion still stands. The way it is incorporated into the setting gives off an eerie mood, as it fits the film's eerie feelings.\nAnd finally, I simply must acknowledge the absolute feat of the script and acting that is present in this movie - notably from Jim Carey. I have to admit that Jim Carey isn't really a favorite actor of mine. He's a decent comedian, but from what I've seen of his, I realize his best work is actually in his dramatic roles. The Truman Show has Carey's best acting. It's literally perfect. I honestly prefer him in more dramatic roles. The supporting characters also put up a phenomenal job with their line delivery and overall acting, also thanks to the intricate screenplay.\nMy favorite of the entire movie is the ending, when Truman crashes his sailboat into the edge of his world (the TV studio). As he walks up the stairs to the blended in exit door, the emotion is in full swing. The elegant music, stunny cinematography, and heart-wrenching dialogue between Truman and the creator, Christof. It's then when Christof tells Truman the truth, saying:Truman: Who are you?\nChristof: I am the Creator - of a television show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.\nTruman: Then who am I?\nChristof: You're the star.And at that moment, to Christof's dismay, and as the TV transmission of The Truman Show ends, Truman walks into the real world, leaving one where he really was the only \"true man.\"",

            "content": "A quiet, topical observation of society, The Truman Show is a deep and thoughtful film. The thoughtful premise, expanded under Peter Weir's competent direction and the boundaries of human imagination, its simply delightful to watch.Jim Carrey's performance is much acclaimed, and deservingly so. He's charming, but he despairs, panics and explodes when the only world he knows begins to collapse around him. He invites empathy and sympathy when the people closest to him turn out to be completely robotic in their approach. In supporting turns, Ed Harris steals every scene as the paternal puppeteering show runner Cristof, a man with nerves of steel and an almost single-minded focus on his passion project. Imagine a diabolical version of Richard Linklater. I also think Laura Linney's performance was hugely underrated - cheerful but out of her depth, hysterical and yet the perfect wife of a TV character.The screenplay is simply perfect. At times its a thoughtful observation of Christianity, with divine intervention by Cristof, and others its a meaningful reflection on reality television, with everyone rooting for and against his trials. What it does best though, is capture every realistic aspect of such a setting - actors don't know how to respond to spontaneous behaviour, actors force product placement on camera, outsiders campaign for Truman's release. Its all great, right up to the film's closing line.\"What else is on?\"",

Repeated looks are bound to let us explore flaws...but, dammit, I was trying to give the thing a break. Really. It IS the kind of thing I should love...) What's wrong with Truman? It's one of those things that SAYS it's going to do something. It tells us what it intends to show, then proceeds NOT to show us, but to restate the thesis! And the audience is expected to buy into the notion that the film has actually explored the issues... whatever they are.Truman, for me, is all statement and no delivery. It gives us a wonderfully correct theme...a charming, easy to root-for hero...a potentially exciting and interestingly equivocal villain...then blows it all away because it hasn't got the courage of it's own set-up.What WOULD make Truman, despite a lifetime of conditioning, get on that boat? NOTHING!! He so easily accepts the unacceptable, he so easily overcomes every problem the film gives him, that there is no dramatic tension, no questions, no... Okay: no film! Of course, it presents us with a user-friendly, feel-good ending. The sit-com man takes charge of his life. Victory. Vindication. And we don't even have a clue what Truman's life -- or Life in general -- is about... nor, alas, does he.Sorry. Too facile...like Jim Carrey's talking butt...an easy laugh, a go-for-the-guaranteed-result.

            "content": "The Truman Show You probably know  the basic plot of The Truman Show by now. And  that's probably due to the power of  television advertising. A baby who is called Truman Burbank is nurtured to manhood for thirty years as the subject of a generations long soap, but he is never told that he's a television star. Every one he knows is an actor, including his wife and best friend, who have been contracted to act on a specially constructed set for five thousand hidden cameras. They are all recording the growth and life of Truman Burbank on 24 hour television. The soap, called The Truman Show, is a runaway success making billions for the producers through product endorsements, but runs into problems when Truman starts to realise that something is wrong. He starts to discover the lie. Jim Carrey plays Truman as a bland everyman, as far removed from Ace Ventura or even The Cable Guy as could be imagined, although there are still elements of Carrey's manic characters hidden behind the ordinariness, in particular that peculiar throwing the head back laugh of his. Most comics ache to do drama, serious acting, and Carrey has enough clout and money now to throw in the odd comparatively straight movie. This one is still a bit twisted though. He's blessed in The Truman Show by having Aussie Peter Weir in charge, a thoughtful director with an amazingly impressive C.V. including Witness, The Year  Of Living Dangerously,  Fearless, Dead Poet's Society, Mosquito Coast, The Cars That Ate Paris and Picnic At Hanging Rock. Weir with The Truman Show has concocted a very steady, pensive film, which is a comment on the processes, evilness and effects of live television. The Truman Show is thought provoking because it seems feasible. We could believe that a television corporation would invest the millions it would have taken to create The Truman Show, buy itself a baby lead actor and then deceive that child for decades for the entertainment of the masses. We can also believe, I think, that it's possible that the viewing public, and a government, could have sanctioned such a process, arguing no doubt that since the child/adult is living an idyllic (suburban) life style, then what harm could possibly have been done. And anyway \"let's entertain the public, give 'em what they want\". The public, the audience of The Truman Show love it. They avidly watch this soap during the intervals in  their own lives, in Truman Show Bars and I can imagine them living Truman's life with him in their own toilets, on buses and  in post offices and banks (if there still is such a thing in this future as a post office and a bank!) Such an audience would hate to miss a thing. After all it is often easier to confront someone else's problems and life choices rather than your own. Then there are the deceptions themselves. Just how fanciful are the scenarios suggested by this movie? A subplot of The Truman Show involves an actress (played by Natascha McElhone ) who gains a conscience and tries to tell Burbank about the lie that is his whole life. But what about the others? In particular his best friend played by Noah Emmerich and also his wife (Laura Linney), who seems to be in a particularly invidious moral position. Is this how low mass entertainment might stoop.? Can we expect worse in the future? Have we already seen worse? The Clinton affair, the Di soapy and most of the Oprah stuff is pretty weird already. And what about the audience, the consumers of Burbank Truman's life? They cheer Truman on when he rushes to escape but you'd bet that they would demand a replacement quick smart; a dream filler from TV land. How could the addicts of a show like The Truman Show live without another shallow dream to take its place? The Truman Show puts interesting questions to us all and is a strongly realised social comment from one of our fabulous Aussie directors. Nothing new is suggested really, except for the scale of the deception in The Truman Show but Peter Weir does create his film world with great precision and believability. Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers was on a similar theme and even The Simpsons has had a good go at sensationalist TV in that famous episode where Homer gets into trouble for allegedly pinching  his baby sitter's bum, (for those who might be interested!) The Truman Show takes two hours to tell us little we didn't know already and for all of its superior qualities seems a little thin.  I would have liked to have followed Truman Burbank out into the real world, perhaps along the lines of Bad Boy Bubby, but The Truman Show still has me thinking, and that's an achievement these days.",

There are a lot of interesting touches, such as Truman's wife constantly doing advertisements for all kinds of rubbish at the worst possible times, and the reactions of the people viewing the show. The idea behind the movie raises some interesting issues on privacy and on exactly what the media should be allowed to, although these issues could have been investigated a little further. When you really start to think about it, however, the movie just doesn't add up. The idea of a TV studio the size of a small island and a man not knowing that he's in it are just a little too much to swallow, especially when you realize that nobody on the island can do ANYTHING at all. I mean, is it that hard to actually hire a bus driver or a ferry captian instead of an actor ?

In fact I am duly impressed with the completeness of the entire project.  The script, direction, performances and attention to detail all mix to create a veritable trompe l' oeil, much like the fictitious world of Truman.This innovative film appeals to so many compelling concepts: The ubiquitous dint of television, the inclination of people to live vicariously through others, the turbid line between reality and the illusory, and the paranoia that someone is always `watching us'.  At times I think that I must be some unwitting actor on a giant stage, being manipulated by some demiurgic force, because the world seems too ludicrous (not to mention the people that inhabit it) to be real.Of course the most piquant aspect of the movie is the exploration of the idea of a higher being.  Truman's quest for the truth of his specious world is analogous to man's search for the meaning of religion, and ultimately, God.  This is played out masterfully here.  When the transmission is cut a person from the barroom exclaims `Jesus, God In Heaven!'  As Truman nears his escape Sylvia (from outside of the fake world) ironically prays for his deliverance.  Christof (catch the name?), played by Ed Harris, sits in his control room as the eminence grise of Truman's world.  As the `creator' of the TV show that Carey's character dwells in, his position is plenary.  The trouble is that Truman has questions that his ostensible family and friends cannot answer.  Truman knows his life is a mendacious trap and he wants manumission.  Ultimately Truman and Christof collide at the boundary of the fa\u00e7ade as the former forces a theomachy.  The omnipotent entity tries to force his recalcitrant subject to repent and return to his existence, but he refuses and finally rejects his originator. Other moments in the film are as entertaining as the concepts are deep.  The technological glitches are amusing and the people trying to get on the set and warn him are great (esp. the guy jumping out of the Christmas present). The viewers are interesting too; the lady who ignores her crying child in order to see the show, the elderly women who watch so intently, and of course the security guards who provide the movie's prescient ending when they realize the show is finally over, `What else is on?'",

This movie is flawed on several counts: There are at least three or four Twilight Zone episodes based on the concept of someone unknowingly living an artificial life. The Twilight Zone (TV show) has everything that this film lacks: artistry, conciseness, originality, bite, and that gorgeous black and white, with plenty of shadows. The Truman Show is a one-idea, one-gag movie. Moreover, the whole notion that artificiality is bad is flawed: we are all artificial, knowingly and unknowingly. We all play roles all the time. Thus, to deplore artificiality amounts to deploring life itself. If Truman doesn't know his life is artificial, that makes it non-artificial, doesn't it?",

I remember that the Chinese teacher at that time was very good, read my diary did not say anything, in fact, I was sick to the point that after she read will knock me out and then to god that report: \"boss, this guy has seen through.\" When I think about it, I really fit all the characteristics of paranoia.Now, maybe it was because I had a strong sense of self, and my life was too stereotyped, I had too little contact with new things, I was out of touch with the society, so I could not have a sense of integration, so I fell into a passion. But these are normal junior high school students at that time of the common disease, why other baby although is also a pair of homework pressure wilting not pull that bird but its mind is so simple so sunshine so bright? It makes me wonder if I have a personality defect. I could not accept such a terrible fact, so I could only comfort myself with the thought that they all thought like this, but only kept silent.Later, when I watched the Truman show, my eyes filled with tears.

Then I found that tengzi no. 2 male and tezuka have a number of short stories said is the same theme, so I wet, I feel good, my waist is not sour, my legs do not hurt, I go upstairs also have strength!

Tengzi fujio's short story does give this feeling a name, the Hong Kong version of the book is translated as \"sense of alienation,\" I think this word is only seven or eight accurate.Then again, that Chinese teacher may really be god's hand. Because I thought that if she knocked me unconscious that would prove that I was thinking the right thing, then she might also be thinking, this guy must be thinking that if I knock him unconscious that would prove that he was thinking the right thing, so I'm not going to knock him unconscious. So I thought: she knew that if she knocked me unconscious, she would prove that I was right. So she didn't knock me unconscious.

If the BBC gave me a video camera I could make them a much better reality show that'd get top ratings. There's this women only gym near one of the industrial estates and if I climb up some of the builders scaffolding I can film the women getting changed.Do I get a response from the BBC about this idea? Do I hell? I swear that Nicole Kidman must work in their post room or something. People complain that there are not enough women running major companies, but Kidman couldn't even respond to one letter that I sent her. NOT ONE! So if she's typical of most women then it's probably because they don't send back their job application forms! Stand up for yourselves and be counted women! Don't be like Nicole Kidman!Anyway the film stars Jim Carey as the hero of the story who doesn't realize he's being filmed. Some people say that's a bit far fetched, but you'd be surprised how easy it is to film people without them knowing. Truman lives this ideal life, however deep down he's sad because he wants to do so much more. He wants to travel and go places, but he's afraid of water and lives on an island, which is a bit dumb. Not as dumb as the Brody family in the 'Jaws' films though. Oh man, were they stupid? They were like a bearded version of the Brady Bunch, but with a much lower IQ. People watch the Truman show all the time, even when he's sleeping and he's quite a celebrity, ignorant to the fact he's the most famous man on the planet.Luckily they couldn't secretly video me because I do stuff that 'makes baby Jesus cry', according to my mum, who blamed it on the 'Erotic Witch Project'. I don't make Jesus cry THAT much though so there'd still be time to check me out doing cool things, like climbing over my neighbors fence and pretending to be dead. That's always funny! It's really funny when I get up and pretend to be like one of the zombies in 'Dawn of the Dead' and try to break into their house. I normally only do it when the husband is away on business though as he doesn't laugh and scream hysterically like his wife does. She mostly screams rather than laughs though. But they'll be moving house soon, so I guess I'll have to stop doing it. They only moved in 3 months ago, which is a shame, because I thought we were really getting along well and having a laugh. The funniest time was when I hid in the boot of the wife's car. That was really funny!As with filming people secretly in real life, Truman gets suspicious and starts trying to avoid the cameras. He doesn't shriek or scream or call one of the shop assistants over to the changing rooms like people do in real life, but instead tries to outsmart the whole production company, which he does. Obviously that leads to the end of the whole TV series. If I were watching his show I'd be like 'Oh thank god that's over with! That was such a dull program.' and providing that they didn't put snooker on instead I'd be happy.I really don't like snooker it's the world's worst sport.Neonsamurai film rating for snooker: Code Alpha Foxtrot Tango",

It's sad that they didn't show Truman after he left the show, but it guess that wasn't possible because they couldn't film him anymore, because he was off the set. I loved the idea, they wanted to create a perfect life for a person, where they don't get to get in trouble and can just live peacefully, if it wasn't for Sylvia, Truman probably wouldn't have escaped the set ever. It almost made me believe by his last line, that Truman knew all along, that it was a show and he is the star of it, or did he know? That's a question i haven't seen explained anywhere.Nonetheless, a great watch, perfect idea, maybe it had some flaws, like almost all the movies do, but still - something different and interesting, that makes you think.",

Jim Carrey's performance adds to whatever's left out of the film, Ed Harris delivers nicely his character too.

I don't think he deserved the Oscar, but I recognize he has a very good performance in the film. Ed Harris has the best performance of his life as Christof and he deserved the Oscar more than James Coburn, although I think Billy Bob Thornton was also superb in \"A Simple Plan\". And there is Natasha McElhone (Truman's great love in the story), and we have to pay attention at her.The screenplay is unique, but I don't know if the thing that is missing is fault of the director or the writer.

            "content": "When I saw Peter Weir's film on its release, I was so engaged by Jim Carrey's wonderful performance as Truman Burbank, that I regarded the film overall as positive and life-enhancing. Seeing it again three years later, I find it a much bleaker experience. Ed Harris as director Christof is such a megalomaniac manipulator that he has perhaps drawn attention away from everybody else involved in the conspiracy against Truman, from the merest technician to the actors playing his best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) and his wife Meryl (Laura Linney). But not only are the production team and players involved in the conspiracy, but so are the millions of viewers of the show. So while we may applaud Truman's brave decision to enter the real world, we should be clear that he will find it full of voyeurs of low intellect and even lower moral standards, who for 30 years have been willing to be entertained by spying on him and depriving him of a real life. Some people might think that the film's satire is too severe, but I think it is fully justified. Day after day TV puts out programs every bit as inane and manipulative as that depicted in the film. It might be argued that, unlike Truman, the participants in \"confession\" TV and such programs as Big Brother are volunteers and know exactly what they are getting into. But in a sense they do not, since most of them are unaware of the ridiculous and unattractive sides of their characters which they will reveal to the cameras, and which are the real point of these programs.\nThe Truman Show stands comparison with George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-four as a satirical polemic against totalitarian interference in people's lives - but the threat now comes as much from the media as from Government.",

I really liked the first half, where Truman Burbank slowly began to realize that something was going on. That was really exciting! On an other side, I wish this build-up continued throughout towards the end of the movie. The big reveal kind of spoiled everything in the midway, and things got predictable. I wish we had to follow Truman's perspective all the way, and didn't get any reveal of his life's truth until the very end. That would be a big surprise. I think the actors were great, though! Especially Jim Carrey (as Truman Brubank), Ed Harris (as Christof) and Laura Linney (as Hannah Gill). Very convincing! I realized that camera work that had to types of perspectives: one we as an audience watched, and one as the audience of The Truman Show (and surveillance) watched. A nice technique!

But why carp? It's better than the average Hollywood film for sure and well worth the admission price.I think it's something to do with the things in which you've been immersed for a lifetime. The average film critic falls over in amazement when she discovers something that is not European and not utterly brainless because she has been raised on a vapid, soulless, utterly boring diet of literature and film based around the emptiness of family drama, where middle-class comment passes for politics and consideration of real intellectual ideas is anathema.

Through this the audience believes that they are watching the TV show Truman is unknowingly starring in.But most of all along with the excellent acting of Jim Carrey, the music really helped this film bring about its emotional core. The music really added another layer to the film's overall essence.All-in-all \"The Truman Show\" is a story of exploration and desire--Wanting to be so much more than just normal, Truman wishes to be removed from his mundane activities and turn his dreams into a reality...",

Then, as the movie got further, I started to understand what it was about. I've only seen it once but I plan on watching it again soon. (So sorry if I mess up some things in this review I forgot about some things in the movie.) This movie is about a man named Truman who thinks that his life is simple and boring. He then discovers that his life is actually a TV show. Wow. That's a sad thing to find out.  There are so many things I liked about this movie. I liked that I can really relate to it. There have been times where maybe I thought that what if my life isn't really what I think it is? What if people have hidden secret cameras everywhere I go? Can anyone other than God see me when I use the bathroom or see me when I go to sleep? Another thing I liked about the movie, (if I can remember correctly,) is that Truman never actually gets angry about finding out his life is a TV show. Instead he seems to be trying to curiously figure out why this would be happening to him. He shows the audience that he knows what is going on and seems to be almost challenging them. \n \n Like I said, it's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember it pretty well. I can't wait to watch it again!",

            "content": "A few months ago,before the release of the Truman Show,I read reviews that acclaimed the film as the most interesting and brilliant film ever done by Hollywood.I thought that those reviews were really impressive,after all,to receive the label of one of the greatests films ever done,certainly the story should have been very well related in the screen and the cast should have helped a lot.The names in the cast didn't impress me:I've never liked Jim Carrey,Ed Harris was a good but not brilliant actor,and they also had a young actress who worked in Congo and who I have already seen before in smaller roles,like in Dave.Her name was Laura Linney.But I admired a lot Peter Weir,and when I knew he was the director,I concluded that,well,the film could be what the critics were saying and writing.He had already done one striking movie,Fearless.I watched the Truman Show three times,but not for thinking that the film was a masterful piece of storytelling.I agree that we're not talking about a horrible movie,but also the film isn't excellent.We have here a good movie,with good moments,but,when analyzed conjointly,doesn't compensate.It is just another big and expensive box-office attraction that tries to be original and innovate,but tied up into the big studio's system of making movie in a commercial sense,it  ends up being the kind of movie Peter Weir wanted to avoid.He wasted the possibility of constructing an unforgettable drama,and made a weak comedy.I watched it three times because I saw a magisterial interpretation that came from I less expected:Laura Linney.As Jim Carrey's wife,she created a memorable character,always with a giant smile engraved on her face.She should be nominated as best supporting actress and she should take the Oscar home.She builds her character as a woman who,despite her beauty,her caress devoted to her husband and her impressive smile,hides the truth from him,sustains him under her control,involves him with her personality,fights to make him give away his suspecions,but,gradually,begins to fell compassion for him.Laura Linney managed a smiling woman into the most astonishing character I've seen.",

By now, everyone knows the premise of the story (young man's entire life captured on live television without his knowledge).  Of course, cracks begin to show, especially when a lamp from the top of the huge dome that represents Truman's fictional world falls to the street.  (It's later revealed to Truman on his car radio that a plane has been shedding its parts in flight)  I found myself thinking of celebrities, even of Jim Carrey himself, who are constantly harassed with cameras and TV exposure.  This is the hidden message of the movie, because Truman is the victim of television exploitation without approval, which is wrong.Don't expect an over-the-top performance by Carrey, who does a good job of balancing the character's mildness and his insanity while discovering the weirdness that surrounds him.  One question remains unanswered throughout the film:  Does Truman actually have sex with the \"Co-star\" who plays his \"wife\" ?",

            "content": "I don't know about you, but as a kid, I went through a phase where I thought my life was a sitcom. I'd dance while brushing my teeth, pretending that my theme song played as I got ready and I'd pretend to be on talk shows to talk about the show. Now whether I watched Truman Show or not back then, this movie reminded of me of that time in my life. It really is an interesting concept if you think about it. There's plenty of theories about us existing in a simulation, so you never know.So Truman's life is a television show and he doesn't know it. Not only is that a premise for a unique story, but it led to really interesting camera angles. There were \"hidden cameras\" everywhere, from cameras on the wall, the mirrors, and even buttons on clothes. What I like was that every shot with Truman was from the point of the view of the Truman Show, so we were watching right with the audience.One of my favorite shots was that moment right after the storm. After Christoff released his \"wrath of God\" with the storm, there's a moment where Truman is lying on his back hanging over the side of the boat with rope wrapped around him. I've read someone compare this to Jesus being on the cross, with Truman & Christoff paralleling with Jesus & God. I want to add to this and point out that the \"hidden camera\" is looking down on him, rather than how we look up at Jesus on the cross. So while there's that parallel, there's also a contrast because Truman isn't a powerful holy figure, he's just a guy.And that brings me to the character of Truman himself. The very very first scene, Christoff makes it clear that his goal of the show was to present true, candid emotion rather than acting. So for the past thirty years, Christoff and his God complex controlled every major event in Truman's life. But Truman's life was honestly pretty ordinary (besides the tv show part). He had a normal job, a normal house, a normal life - he was a normal guy. And the audience of the show was able to sympathize and empathize with him because of that.As Truman began seeing the cracks in his universe, he goes insane. He acts spontaneously and tries to escape Sea Haven, of course being interrupted every turn. Then he faced his biggest fear, the ocean, and sets out into the unknown. This was a very brave and inspiring sequence, as Truman determinedly didn't let anything stand in his way.Christoff announces himself to Truman as his \"Creator.\" He gives Truman the option to stay in the safe world he created for him, or to step out in to the cruel world of reality. He chooses to leave, following his life long natural curiosity to a new chapter in life.I loved the ending, but so much was left in question. Did him & Sylvia meet? (I'm sure they got a happy ending.) How well does Truman adjust to the real world? What happens to Sea Haven? It's all left to interpretation. This kind of goes back to the religious parallels if you think about - Is there a god, like Christoff, dictating every single important event in our lives, or are we really in control of our own free will, like Truman?The supporting cast was great, but the literal star of the show here was Jim Carrey. We all know he's type casted as the funny or crazy guy, but that's because he's so good at it. There are several scenes in this film where he had the opportunity to use his comedic skills as Truman went absolutely bonkers, and those were fun scenes. But the reason why this film is considered such a Jim Carrey classic is because there were many dramatic, heartfelt moments where Carrey was able to show the emotional side of his character. This is a movie that shows how diverse Carrey is as an actor. I'll be sure to watch some of his other dramatic roles in the future.",

This isn't a movie where you can just sit back and enjoy the ride.  You have to think, and if you look close enough, you will see the quietly powerful message; the message of hope and freedom, the idea that no innocent man or woman can be kept in some place against their will, and the idea that if deception is involved, then eventually truth will prevail and hope and freedom will be restored.",

The preformances are amazing and the camera work is so authentic. Watch this movie and get sucked into it's world.We follow Truman, an ordinary person whose life is about to change forever. He slowly realizes the world is not as it seems and slowly uncovers the truth around him.The camera work is so well done, authentic and innovative. It mimics the reality tv set up and creates both uniqe and beutiful frames throughout the movie. It dares to not do what every movie dose and gets away with it. A downright beautiful use of cameras, lighting and framing is on display here.The movies preformances are so well done. Jim Carrey delivers an emotional and funny preformance, that really sells Truman as a charecter. This is one of his best roles I've seen him in. Another amazing preformances comes from Ed Harris that really sells his role. He is both disgusting and iconic.The script is so tight and well written. It doesn't overstay it's welcome or is too short. All the moments, in universe gags and lines are all beutifully made. All the preformances are amazing since they have to play an actor playing a role and they all sell that so well.The world of Truman show is great. From in universe advertisement, to camera placements, too actors and crue on cues. It is so wonderfully done. The choigraphy most actually have been hard to do. Everything in the world has to run like clockwork and be so pricise that it's a marvel the movie works so well. It is so well done.The story of having a charecter realize his world isn't real is done amazingly. Realising everything is fake makes Truman spiral into more and more unsertenty. Course who are you when you're no longer the person you thought you were?I think later worldbuilding should have been done earlier. More like The Cabin in the Woods(2011) did it. The gig is up in this movie more and less from the get go, so why not lay all the cards on the table earlier? This is more of a personal thing to be honest. And after the implementation and worldbuilding the movie truly elevates itself and it's story.There is so many iconic lines and scenes in this movie. \"In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and goodnight\" will be stuck in your mind. The mirror gag towards the end is amazing and the ending is one of films finest. The ending is an experience you have to experience once in your life. It elevates the movie to so much more and truly says a lot about life itself.Watch this movie. It is a most. It's funny, clever and well executed.",

We had to study this film in English and I actually got quite excited. This is an astounding movie and is done so well. Jim Carrey plays the main character, Truman Burbank (True-Man). Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life. He has a wife, a home, a friend he's known for most of his life and a desk-job at an insurance agency. What he doesn't realize is that he is actually a star in a 24 hour, live show which is showed all across the globe which documents like a soap-opera his life.The whole film tackles the themes of the power of the media and even religious themes about the God if you look hard enough as Truman starts to realize that his life is different from everyone around him. The script is more than perfect, the dialogue is wonderful and there is an excellent mix of heart-warming stuff as well as some comedy to lighten the mood (a necessity). The film is not too long, which is a good thing because a considerable length for a movie like this could ruin it. The acting is another stand-out along-side the excellent script. Jim Carrey does a great job and I can see how they casted him instead of another normal actor (Yes, Jim, you're not a normal actor). All the actors do a good job but keep an eye out for the man who plays Truman's friend, Marlon, who does amazing and a few scenes you would see why. There's nothing more I can really say about this film, it's thought-provoking, it's wonderfully scripted and acted. It has a few funny scenes to lighten the mood but overall its serious. I must say that it is not a popcorn film but it is also a film which is worth more than one viewing. Watch it twice in a week and you will understand a bit more of the themes and nuances which help create this world.

We want to see Truman escape this world that he has been essentially trapped inside, as do the audience of the show as we see them in the film. However they also want their show to continue.

But as I watched the trailers, I began to think that Carrey has been holding out on us. Perhaps he was just preparing himself for this role. Here it is. Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank is my nomination for one of the finest (if the the finest) of all movie characterizations. Believe me. I know of ALL the movies. I know of Jimmy Stewart in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, of Cary Grant in BRINGING UP BABY, and of the other great performances. My knowledge of films is not just of the past 20 years, so believe me when I say Carrey has, with this one film, earned himself a place in the history books.He works on several levels.First of all there is the comedy. He makes us laugh. And at funny things-not just a lot of crude silliness! This is talent unseen since the days of the great comics. Carrey could, if he continued making intelligent comedies like this one, be ranked alongside Chaplin and Buster Keaton in his use of pathos. Most comics, no, ALL comics of the last thirty-some years have been afraid to use pathos in their routines. Pathos is basically mixing something sentimental with something funny, making it touchingly funny. This is real skill. Jim Carrey has that talent, and will hopefully realize that he is capable of acting not obtained since Charlie Chaplin! This is an honor. Hopefully, he will select other intelligent projects like this one. He has the talent to become the greatest actor, not just funnyman, in the cinema of the future! Everyone I know shares this opinion. I saw the film on its theatrical run twice, and yet, I don't want to run to the video store to get the latest copy of it and lounge in front of the TV with it on. Why? Because THE TRUMAN SHOW is so brilliant and SO intelligent, that it must be viewed with intelligence itself. Somehow, you are much more inclined to sit up and pay attention, and think, in a cinema, than you would be popping the video in the VCR and lounging back with a bowl of chips. The film has a wonderful musical score. Although it has now been some 8 months sine I saw the film, the incidental music themes still pop in to my head every so often. And again, although it has been 4 months short of a year since I saw the film, it seems like it was just last week. That is how timeless and meaningful it really is. You just don't forget this one. It is incredible and unbelievable. I was intrigued from the first time I saw the trailer on television. The film has stayed with me like no other. A local cinema that runs nothing but the best films, old and new, ran a print of this film for a week. It is such a magnificent experience to see THE TRUMAN SHOW that both times I saw it, I left the theatre truly feeling glad to be able to see the film. I hope that it earns its proper place in the cinema history books, and that is as the greatest film in the latter half of the 20th Century!",

            "content": "Comedy is a barren wasteland. It's mostly populated with bad actors in good roles (Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller), or fantastic actors in terrible roles (Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci). However, once in a while a movie defies all that. Once in a while, people come together to make a piece of comedy that is truly great filmmaking. It happened in \"Silver Linings,\" \"Joy,\" and \"What About Bob.\" And it happened here.From the director of \"Dead Poets Society,\" another dramedy with a comedy actor, comes this beautiful tale of Truman Something. When I saw this movie, I did not think it was about what it was about. I thought it was more along the lines of \"Good Morning Vietnam.\" But instead, this movie acts like Inception, and in a great way, too. It's thought-provoking.There's a moral dilemma in this film, and that's the idea that the viewer is trying desperately to cast the blame. At first, it doesn't even seem like it's necessarily an evil thing to do. I mean, his life is made to be great. But as the film progresses, it's clear Truman is being made a victim. But who's the villain here? The catch is: it's hard to tell. Is it ever actor and actress on that show for putting up with it? Is it Christoph's, for designing it? It is his parents', for allowing the show to adopt him? Or is it everyone watching, giving the show high ratings to make them keep going? The film has a deep undertone, saying \"If we give publicity to people we hate, and a system we hate, is it just proving that their system works?\" And that message rings truer than ever in the desolate landscape of politics we live in.But all that thought-provoking stuff is peppered by Jim Carrey in what is -I'll just say it- far and away his best work ever. And it proves that this world has something against Carrey by constantly putting him in roles that are so incredibly poorly written and just say \"act stupid\" and you feel like you're watching a terrible movie. This movie proves that he's a real actor. He can give real performances, if the writers will for once, give him the chance to act once in a while.But there are things that prevented this movie from getting those last two stars.The first is a lot of little oversights, like the CinemaSins kind. I usually don't care, but there were just so many here. I won't list them all, but the most bothersome one is that they claim to have the world's smallest cameras, and yet when Meryl gets scared, she knows exactly where the camera is to look into it. There's about six more I could list, but I won't.The second, and more important, is Christoph's character. I get that he's a little hypocritical, but still. There's a lot of \"who is this guy\" with Christoph. Not in a good way, in a bad way, like, it doesn't seem like the same guy would do all the different things he did and say all the different things he said in this movie.That being said, this is one of the nicest movie reviews I've ever given. This truly is one of the greatest comedies to ever hit the small screen and Jim Carrey can call it his masterwork.",

            "content": "For quite a while I refused to watch this based on who the star was. I was familiar with his \"style\" and didn't care for it. I finally gave in to all the assurances that this film wasn't like his other performances, and I really liked it.The reviewers who say it's like an episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" aren't far off. But I like the fact that it's not taken too seriously, unlike many TZ episodes... this subject matter, as evidenced by many of the \"hated it\" reviews, could easily have been presented and intended to be taken in a deadly-serious way, but it's not, and I like that.There could easily have been a \"show-down\" scene at the end between a disappointed, unbalanced, angry Truman and his \"creator\", Christoph. I usually don't like open-ended conclusions, but in this case I thought it worked. Truman remains the nice, trusting guy he always was... he sees his newfound freedom as a gift, a long-awaited chance to see what the actual world has to offer, and he takes it, with no visible hard feelings. Why not? That's his character and his nature. A confrontation scene would have been interesting and most likely well-played by both Carrey and Harris, but it wasn't necessary. The payoff for the audience is that Christoph loses everything in the blink of an eye (fame, power, income, and the biggie: complete control), while Truman goes off to begin his REAL life (and presumably track down his lost love somewhere along the way).It's especially interesting to view this today, with the reality-TV wave cresting. The real people on these current shows are called \"cast members\", their lives are called \"storylines\" which are played out in \"seasons\", and sometimes it can be hard to remember that they're actual human beings.\"The Truman Show\" started, by Christoph's own admission, with an unwanted pregnancy. So did \"Teen Mom\".",

Having your life televised is one thing, but doing it without informed consent and only deceit and trickery is the primary reason this film strikes chords with people.

Truman represents the once helpless, mind-controlled man who gradually starts to break free by pushing the limits of his reality's already given axioms. Some may not like this saying it represents a breaking away from god (represented by Christof, the show director), but I think it just encourages man to think outside the box and pushes him to refuse whatever reality imposes upon him... to, simply, unleash his imagination.

            "review_title": "Satire in high definition",
            "content": "The first one who imagined a concept similar to \"The Truman Show\" is Plato. It is known today as the \"Allegory of the Cave\". The great philosopher told the story of a man chained up in a cave and forced to see the shadows made by a fire, assuming that it's the real life. Ultimately, he discovers that what he saw was fake and he tries to accommodate to reality.Twenty-two hundred years later, Plato is replaced by Australian filmmaker Peter Weir and the sinister cave is now called 'reality television'. The allegory is now called \"The Truman Show\".Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, an insurance company employee who is also the star of the show, although he's not aware of it. He lives in what for him is Seahaven, which is in fact a giant domed-studio located just outside L.A. He (obviously) never left Seahaven of his life.Seahaven is supposed to be a peaceful city located on an island on the seaside. In order to keep Truman in the city, the crew finds many ways, including cutting off bridges and simulating a nuclear accident. Moreover, Truman can't leave by the sea because the producers voluntarily infused him with hydrophobia when his father 'died' in a boat accident.However, in recent days, many strange events occur and lead Truman to believe that something is not right in Seahaven. A 'plane piece' falls from the sky, but Truman finds that it strangely looks like a projector. And there's also that elevator, whose back falls and let see the crew for a second.This sounds like a crazy and overly exaggerated media satire. But there's one place where \"The Truman Show\" wins: the timing couldn't have been better. In a modern society where reality shows invade the little screen, \"The Truman Show\" is a strong metaphor of the dangers and the consequences of permanent broadcasting of a person's life.The movie is not perfect, but just its concept makes it a winner. The acting is good, especially when you think that this movie is 'fiction-within-fiction'. There are two movies in a single one. Jim Carrey is only aware of half of it and it looks real. Carrey gets one of his greatest roles, mainly because he finally shows what he's able to do and he shows that maniac comedy is not the only thing he can do.Ed Harris appears as Christof, the creator and the director of the show. He's responsible for the Machiavellian tricks made in order to thwart Truman's escape plans and to keep him in Seahaven. This determination is well-hidden by his cold regard and his continuous calmness.The greatest characters of the movie are perhaps the viewers themselves, as we regularly see them at different moments. Every time, they're at the same time at the same place, doing the same thing. Just like if there was nothing else to do. Or maybe nothing 'important' to do.They are the figures that stand for today's reality-show viewers. They're stuck in front of their TVs like if nothing else mattered and there was nothing else to do. Like if it was as essential as breathing. They're not aware that they're wasting their own lives watching the same person living his own life.There's a quote from Christof that I like: \"I am the creator of a television show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.\" That's how a real TV director would speak. By telling lies. By telling what appear to be good words, which are in fact empty words. This is the kind of hidden quotes that are part of the linking between the satire and the reality.The only major gap between satire and reality in \"The Truman Show\" (and perhaps the most arguable aspect of it) is that Truman Burbank is not aware that he's constantly filmed. In reality shows, people know that they're filmed. It's just that the overabundance of cameras and tests ultimately drive them crazy. It would have provided an even more powerful movie, but as long as this movie is good, it's less worrying.What is different about Plato's allegory and \"The Truman Show\" is that the latter doesn't have any conclusion. In the Allegory, the man gets out of the cave and has to face the sunlight and, after a long time, he succeeds. The last image we get from Truman is when he gets out from the studio and we never see him contemplating the real world. So we don't know what's gonna happen. We don't know how he will face the sunlight...We don't see him, so good afternoon, good evening and good night Truman!",

The success of reality television has defined much of the entertainment world in the 2000s and blurred the line between public and private. Moreover, social media is all about building fasads, living in a fake reality and striving for fake happiness. Nowadays smartphones monitor our everyday life and collect data for the algorithms run by big tech corporations. They certainly know how to keep us entertained and in our own bubbles.One of the main ideas of the movie is summed up in Shakespeare's famous quote \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.\" After watching the movie one can not help but think how the world we live in and the everyday activities we perform truly differ from the ones of Truman. It is also easy to find traces of Plato's Allegory of the Cave and the philosophical discussion of our world being the best of all possible worlds.It is an interesting thought that if everything would be handed to you in life just as scripted would it be possible to be happy. In the movie the best of all possible worlds built for Truman resembles the middle class dream whereas the outside world might be more meaningful but filled with uncertainty and struggle.Despite the interesting ingredients something is missing to make the film an all-time classic. The treatment of the main themes is light, the resolution comes quite easily and the movie does not dig very deep into the psyche of Truman. Unfortunately, I am not sure either that Jim Carrey is a perfect cast for the role of Truman. Even so, I would recommend watching the movie. It is just that after being originally amazed by the idea of the movie it does not generate many new thoughts that would stick and grow over time.",

Did he and Sylvia find each other?  How did they manage to build such a large set in the first place?  Was the marriage to his wife legal?  Did she audition, did she get time off?  Why did Marlon's parents let him act in the Truman Show ever since he was small?  How did they make him keep it secret?  Did he even know right from the beginning? Did Truman's mother really love him?  What if a tornado had knocked down the set?  Did Truman have a chance to learn religious education?  Did they ever make it rain on the day of the school picnic?  What technique of discipline did his mother use as an example to the world, and did it work?

He is married, has a house, has a decent job, and has a decent life. Little does Truman know that he lives in a world created around him. Truman is the star of a TV show broadcasted around the world. His own life is on display for the world to see. In the film Truman becomes suspicious of the world around him. Events occur that baffle him. Truman knows something strange is going on but does not know what.Christoff, played by Ed Harris, is the creator of the show. As you watch the film you see that boundaries have been set for Truman. At a young age Truman was discouraged by everyone to not explore. Of course, being that it is a TV show everyone is an actor or actress, his mom and dad, his best friend, his wife, and everyone he sees on the streets everyday is a professional actor or actress. Truman's whole enviorment is fake and scripted except for himself. He doesn't even have a real father or mother. Truman was a test-tube baby. His life is controlled. Its almost like he has been enslaved. Truman's own enviorment is not even real. The entire town and area he lives in is inside a huge dome. The sun, moon, wind, rain, and clouds is all fake. Christoff plays God and controls Truman's life.Truman progresses through the film. He begins to notice that strange things are happening around him. Things he can't explain. He knows his wife does not love him and he notices that everything seems to be repeating itself like a routine. Everyday seems the same. Nothing changes. During the film Truman conquers his fears and breaks through barriers that he nor did Christoff think was possible.This was definitely Jim Carey's best performance of his career. He plays this serious role very well and at the same time adds a little zest to the character that no one else can do. Jim Carey is very good at showing emotions which was needed in this film.This film also tackled the possible future of entertainment. During the film there are random clips of people watching Truman on TV. People laugh and cry with Truman as they watch. But as a viewer of the film you want to curse at Christoff and all those people who watch the show because you feel sympathy for Truman. You as the viewer start to care about Truman. As you watch the film you want Truman to find out what has been going on.The film had great directing, great cinematography, great acting, and great music. Everything in this film flowed very well. The initial plot grabbed me and the great acting and writing sealed the deal. I would call this film a border-line masterpiece.If you are a fan of Jim Carey or if you want to see a great film, then look no further and watch The Truman Show.",

            "content": "The motion picture,\"The Truman Show\" is not so much an interest but a shock.The picture is not only a discredit but such a fallacious argument as to set back the human race some 150 years.The reference to 150 years was to refer to a time when there was a Civil War in what was then the United States against the Confederate States of America.The conflict was to cause the abolishment of slavery as an exercise in any state right issue whereby a human being was denied the right to life,liberty and the pursuit to happiness.The Truman Show is a latter day attempt to undermine the very foundations of that which there was given the last full measure so that we might enjoy a new birth of freedom.A paraphrase taken from the Gettysburg Address when spoken in July 1863 by then President Abraham Lincoln.There is in fact such an arrogant position had by this film that we might be said to enter into a new world order whereby a state is indeed introduced as a Godless Overseer and right holder to the human being.There is such an inbred contempt for Trevor Burbank who is the victim of this raid of the heart that a story told by Civil War historian Shelby Foote,told of a slave who was the property of an over seer on a Virginia Plantation.The slave managed to escape and won his freedom by moving stealthily through the underground railroad to a community North of the Confederate territory.He was, as fate would have it,to join union forces and at a time later was to be part of a Union move against the South whereby he would come directly across the very land whereby he was once a slave.The story told of the very deliberate seeking out and killing of the overseer with whom he was in slaved to.If this be worth anything it would be that Trevor Burbank should not only seek out and kill Christoph but every person directly associated with the broadcast.This is more than a mere crime this is slavery.The degree to which the ways of this world have parted is that we hardly recognize ourselves because with the passing of time came the advent of telecommunications and the conceit of another form though in fact it was to be the same old story yet in another form.That is what we are in fact looking out in this,\"The Truman Burbank\" Show.It is a very real attempt to thumb there noses at the foundations of a Democracy and flaunt their victimization of one Truman Burbank.The characterization of all those around the life of Truman Burbank share not common ground to such an extent that all of life seems merely to be lacking in color and even back bone,such is the offense!This coldly impersonal affront even onto decency is so vile as to be culpable and worthy to die as many times as necessary so as to rid the world of this malady once and for all.Christof should be sought out as stealthily as the story told of the former slave noted above and killed,because he is a Godless Monster.This order should be done with due diligence and with prejudice aforethought so that all associated with this event should see the end of their days on this Earth.There is nothing timid in this attempt to silence a heart beat and there should not be anything timid in its roar back as well.Let the human heart roar back at the attempt upon its place here as this system is as in human as it is a new world order.There is nothing here but a discredit and it is nothing but a discredit that is represented but this attempt upon our place in this world.Though we are in fact looking at a Motion Picture,the entertainment vehicle that it represents is not entertaining at all but in fact represents a hatred for honesty,for nature and for love.This film is an un-natural affront to entertainment and goes beyond mere viewing pleasure to a virtual contempt for civilization.This film is in fact a very violent attack upon life and can be construed as a promise of what maybe coming to a theater near you.You as a theater going public are warned of the propensity to pooh pooh this hatred and dismiss it without the right of way being taken back.The inability to right the wrong breaches the very cloth so sacred in our devotion to duty,honor and fidelity.There is present a matter of life and death with only judgement to wish for in the passing of the days.The end time is now upon this world and it is indeed a time to judge those who have sought to judge us.Let this be a prophecy foretold!",

            "content": "(WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILER) This is one of thoughs movies where you can't really form an opinion. One thing I can tell you is NOT to expect Jim Carrey to act like Ace Ventura, Fletcher Reede, or The Mask. In this movie he is not the silly, funny, Jim Carrey that we've all gotten used to. In this movie he acts a lot like Matthew Broderick. Notice that this movie is NOT a comedy. I made the mistake of assuming it was a comedy because Jim Carrey was in it. I can't decide whether its \"Good\" or \"Bad\". I CAN say, however, what my experience was while I was watching it. This movie started off very slowly and I was getting very board for the first 30 minutes or so. I like movies that get to the point quickly and The Truman Show definitly takes a lot of time to really start off the story. The ending disappointed me a little bit because once Truman leaves the giant studio he is living in, the story ends instantly. I was hoping that I'd get to see Truman step into the outside world for the first time and react to it. But instead, Truman just walks through the door and that ends the story. Also, once he learned the truth about his whole life being a set up, the audience is never clear on his true feelings about this discovery. This movie is kind of like a hilly road when it comes to Interest. It starts off boring, gets interesting, then gets boring... The only reason I decided to see this movie was because I like Jim Carrey and I didn't have to pay to rent this film. Jim Carrey is a very emotional actor who shows his emotions well through his facial expressions. In all this movie is very DIFFERENT and in a way, kind of strange. I hope Jim Carrey's next movie is a comedy, because I think actors and actresses do best when they stick with parts they are GOOD at. Jim Carrey is good at making comedies, so I think he should stick with that. But, something different every once in a while is good too.My rating: 7 out of 10",

This is the true philosophy on which this interesting movie is based.A sequel to \"1984\"and \"Brave New World\" which stresses how modern techniques have evolved to a point where their hold on human beings has become an all overwhelming god-like power. Jim Carrey is great at finding the right balance between humor and seriousness. The plot evolves well and succeeds in convincing the viewer that all of this could happen or is happening now, admittedly in a deliberately exaggerated representation. When Truman steps out of his fictitious surroundings, one asks oneself if he is going back to reality or just to another form of an imaginary world. This is a powerful movie which really makes you think.",

The moment you watch it, one is made to think \"can such ideas be really crafted in a motion picture?\" The director Peter Weir and writer Andrew Niccol must be specially praised for such a work.Now don't overlook Jim Carry, he is a master man as always with Ed Harris' intense performance. This movie may also remind one about the story of a frog in a well who thinks that the well is everything, the whole world. Not like that but being a comedy it shows what might happen with such a life entrapped yet unaware of anything. At the same time we see the desire of freedom and lusty minds who seeks entertainment. It questions as to what do we prefer, humanity or false entertainment at any cost for momentary escape from reality in our life.The film is certainly not preachy but makes one to think about various cobwebs that are and that may entrap us time to time. The thing that lacked in the movie are, as i felt, editing and cinematography. It was typical and simple. Some special things should have been done to provide complete impact to the viewer but i wonder if that would make the move more artificial. But still it could have been better in the part of sets and camera.",

I think Ed Harris has done an outstanding job! As someone mentioned, his character could have risked looking ridiculous in the hands of some other actor. However obnoxious it may have been built to be, Harris actually humanizes it to such an extent that in the end his relationship to Truman is almost paternal and we feel sorry that he's losing him! Jim Carey, I felt, over did his part in some scenes. But he's superb in the scene were he reaches the horizon of his artificial world and touches the blue 'wall' that's there instead of the open air. His horror of encountering a dead end, of being trapped, of not being in the real world of nature comes across brilliantly in this scene. This movie brings together two of the most beautiful actresses. Both Laura Linney(excellent in 'Blindspot' among other movies) and Natasha McElhone('Surviving Picasso') do their parts really well!  What I was left with after watching this movie is a sense of \"Now what will happen to Truman?\" O.K. he's escaped from his artificial world and he's going to be with the woman he loves. But really, it cannot be that hunky dory. The movie almost ends with an unsaid, unwritten \"And they lived happily ever after\" note. Even if Truman has escaped the controlled world, can he really lead a normal existence in the real world in which he's such a huge celebrity? Being a celebrity, constantly under the public glare and media-hounding, is almost as bad as being 24/7 TV feature. The only consolation to this is the thought that probably he doesn't really enter the real world at all. May be he escapes to some parallel universe called Fiji?!",

Truman Burbank must have the illusion of complete freedom, but he can't have it. He must also have the delusions of privacy and the genuineness of all of those in on the 24-7-365 scam. If he ever figured it all out, he'd go insane from the absurdity of the situation.All is beautiful, and everything is a set-up... even his 'love interests' who must be in on the plot to delude him into thinking that there is but one accessible reality -- a world in which everything is a sham, if a pleasant one. Truman has been part of a 24-hour TV show, the ultimate reality program, now in its 10,909th straight day... and knows nothing else. He's beginning to chafe in a world in which he has been \"legally adopted at birth by a corporation\", an enterprise created by one \"Christof\", a TV producer. Everything depends upon Truman Burbank staying right where he is, in an unreal set-up. If you enjoyed the old British TV series \"The Prisoner\", then you will enjoy this too as an intensification.

The media candidly acknowledges the low level of quality in their product and makes very lame attempts to cover it up.   The Real Worlders, and the people who watch them, know the show is cut, chopped and edited into something very far removed from what they experienced.  And the argument that we as a society watch too much TV has been around from the day TV was mass-produced.  The Truman Show doesn't make the media shake it makes them nod their heads like, \"Yep, we're that bad.  And if we had the resources at our disposal, we'd do something like The Truman Show if we gave them enough reason to tune in.\"  That said, The Truman Show really isn't satire at all, just a copy of a copy with an expensive set to mitigate this fact.",

The film takes place in a modern day film set.The film starts off with a man named Christof (Harris) telling how he created a television series where a person's life is watched from beginning to end. This person is Truman Burbank (Carrey). Truman is a very nice person and he has no idea that his life is not normal and that he is actually on television. He is married to Meryl Burbank (Linney) who is an actress that is not really married to him. So basically Truman's whole life is scenarios set up by Christof for the entertainment of the world to watch. But soon Truman starts to realize things and believes that something is wrong...The screenplay is from Andrew Niccol and it is his second, his first being Gattaca. Niccol received an Oscar nomination for his writing and he does deserve it. The film is extremely original and is a true pleasure to watch. It is funny and full of drama, and I just couldn't wait to see how it ended. There are only a few minor problems with the screenplay and none of them made it not enjoyable. One of them was the fact that there were no strong anti slavery groups against the show because in a way Truman was a slave. Another is that there were some convenient slips of the tongue which made Truman more suspicious. Besides those though it was an excellent screenplay.The direction of this film was also quite good. Peter Weir as well earned an Oscar nomination, and yes he did earn it. He really knew how to get great performances out of his actors, every single one of them played their parts great. The shots in the film were excellent as well and I just felt so absorbed. I was rooting for Truman the whole time and it is hard to get a person to like a character that much. Overall very good direction.The acting in this film was superb. Jim Carrey gives a great performance as Truman and this is one of the few performances that Carrey has that is not a comedic role. He is great being so innocent and warm hearted. I just loved it whenever he said \"If I don't see you again later good afternoon, good evening, and good night\". Laura Linney was great as Truman's pretend wife. She acted like a not so great actress and it was really quite enjoyable to watch her try and make Truman believe that his world is real. One of my favorite parts of this film for me is when Truman is questioning her and she just starts saying how great cocoa beans are for an advertisement. She was just great. Ed Harris was the creator of the show, Christof, and he gave an excellent performance. He received an Oscar nomination for the intense creative mind and he deserved because while I was watching I could really feel how much he loved the world he created. And the last thing he wanted to happen was for Truman to destroy it.Overall I give this film a very strong 8/10. I would recommend This film for anyone who likes creative films, Jim Carrey, or just really enjoyable films.",

It's quite meta and out of the box with the lengths the creators go to to ensure Truman is left unaware and creating a 24/7 running show.Jim Carrey killed it in his role. It's such a quirky film and making it not come across as fake and going through all the revelations organically is no easy task, but Jim Carrey pulls it off and remains in our hearts as Truman.The best part of this movie is the amount of layers. Superficially it's about a guy finding out his life is merely a part of a show and how he escapes. Going into more depth you realize that the show has crossed multiple ethical boundaries and be deemed unethical. However, another angle to look at it is a symbolic film where the show runner is a spiritual being, i.e. God, and Truman is realizing he is a set piece in this large play orchestrated by God himself and is realizing his place in the universe. In other words, it can also be seen as a symbol for finding thyself.Overall this is a brilliant film with philosophical undertones.",

            "content": "Back in 1990, at about 3pm I was watching an episode of The Twilight Zone where a man had caught someone removing a hidden camera from the wall in his house. This leads to a series of discoveries, such that he is on a television station dedicated solely to showing him and everything he does, 24 hours a day. Furthermore, he finds his life has been manipulated, they have set him up with a better job and even his marriage and so on - stop me if you heard any of this before. Obviously on a smaller scale but close to identical, the difference being he has benefitted as much as he has lost out in the invasion of privacy, maybe even more, thereby leading to an intriguing and enigmatic ending.This in itself isn't a problem really. However, there are problems in this film. The foremost one is that, as with any long running enterprise of any kind, it when things go wrong, it's quite believable that they occur in a cluster.It is not believable that for such a long running and highly controlled operation as The Truman Show that the operators would miss Truman's father getting back on the set AND him finding people waiting \"off stage\" where there should have a lift AND not having anything prepared if Truman were to ever want to see what his wife does at work (what, no contigency plan written a long time ago, only something thrown together at the last minute that only just works?) AND the policeman at the \"nuclear accident\" by name AND the truly clumsy fashion cars block his attempts to leave which might as well scream TRUMAN, you're living in a dome and we're all watching you on TV.Yes, things would go wrong and almost inevitably a whole lot at once somewhere along the way but it's hard to believe the operators would be so inept so many times in succession over such a short period of time. The script falls down in clumsily presenting these scenes instead alternatively, have things that don't fit together perfectly (the people setting it up only work there, Truman is living it every day and would spot things they wouldn't) but are more subtle with Truman picking them up piece by piece and eventually working things out that way. Becoming gradually aware over time in a much more gradual and subtle fashion than the way that happens.Ed Harris is excellent and the way (to Truman) his voice looks like it is literally coming down from the heavens is great. Jim Carrey and the rest of the cast do quite well in the acting department.Of course, just to extrapolate from the ending knowing big business the show could go on after the end: imagine the interviews with Christof, the following and documenting of Truman in the outside world, tours of the dome, even the sale of houses inside it. Inevitably the selection of another child and starting the thing again. There'd still be money in it all.So anyway, just remember, not bad but could have been better and don't whatever you do call it original, almost exactly the same thing has been done maybe as much as 10 years ago or more.",

Many of our nation's best critics realized to one extent or another how great the film was - perhaps not as much its prophetic nature - which, if you saw it originally in the theater - you might try viewing it again - to see.The featured review is on the right track. 1998 was a bumper crop year for Hollywood film - yet, few in Hollywood seemed to realize it. True, Carry's goofy reputation, if somewhat deserved, caused many to miss the point - but, at the end of the day, all of the latent denial in the American psyche - specifically catered to by the Hollywood elite - produced the most blatant Oscar night debacle in a long history of this tragically repeated motif - great art once again denied the laurel wreath in deference to crass commercialism - in this case two of the greatest English language films ever made, The Truman Show and American History X, shunted in favor of a shameless piece of fluff based on dubious if not downright dishonest premises, Joseph Fiennes' vaunted backside, and the rather gauchely revolting nepotistic spectacle of Gwynnie dancing with Daddy...Truly, the American public really did not get The Truman Show - it got by most of us - perhaps, it requires repeated viewings - such an incisive critique of the American psyche as it is - where even the most sacred things are trampled under our incessant self-created need for security and the lies we're willing to tell ourselves to perpetuate it. The final conversation between Truman and his life-long 'friend', Marlin, is imo one of the greatest scenes ever filmed - revealing the depth of the corruption of our wayward civilization - enough to make Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor blush with shame.Weir has made a number of very good+++ films: Dead Poets Society, Last Wave, Witness... but...THIS IS HIS MATERPIECE A FILM ONE SHOULD SEE AGAIN AND AGAIN.

Ignoring its low budget and certain dated aspects of its production, it is far more thought-provoking.In the final analysis, \"The Truman Show\" would have worked better as an episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" and without the needless chase and escape scene at the end.",

There we had a much more intimate storyline and original ideas. Some of the highlights there were that the location was New York (!), the scene where Truman accidentally discovers the word \u0084Trumanesque\" in the dictionary, the building of the fake town Sydney, Chloe's marching in into Christof's room and telling him that Truman didn't masturbate for 2 months, the dialog between a caller and Christof ( \u0084I enjoyed your work, Christof, but I can't say I saw all of it.\" \u0096 \u0084Who can?\" ) or when Truman disguised himself while entering an xxx store all the while some two viewers had an ironic dialog ( \u0084What's with the disguise?\" \u0096 \u0084Maybe he doesn't want to be recognized.\" ). I can't understand why those scenes were deleted. True, the script ending is much weaker than the movie ending, but all in all it gives an better impression - and elaborates the plot more.

The movie somehow manages to be weird, original, funny, and disturbing all at the same time. However, if you haven't seen it, be warned. When I saw it the first time I didn't have a happy feeling. However, after watching it many times, I really liked it. The story goes like this: Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is an ordinary guy, with an ordinary house, and an ordinary wife...or so he thinks. But he's actually the subject of the biggest, most controversial reality show of all time. His world is controlled by the God-like Christof (A Brilliant Ed Harris) who runs Truman's world from the \"moon\". Meanwhile, Truman wants to travel and go to Fiji and find a girl who he fell in love with in high school but was taken off the show because she was determined to tell Truman of what was really going on. All through the movie he grows more and more suspicious of his surroundings wondering \"Is this all real\"? Jim Carrey, who once made his butt talk, really shows that he has come a long, long way from doing a slapstick Kung Fu routine in Dumb & Dumber. And Ed Harris...he really makes you hate and love his character who has locked Truman up in a prison and videoed him for his own profit. Truman is really the only likeable character in the movie because everyone involved with the show, except him and Sylvia, are all the meanest kind of criminal. An emotional criminal. Everyone from his wife to his own mother has falsely loved him and are manipulating him for their own profit. But the strange thing is...they are truly horrible people but the actors who play them make them very likeable. The Truman Show is a very uncomfortable experience yet it is extremely great.",

It was a little cheesy though. The whole town looked like a video game. The effects were a little off. This movie was also sad and funny. I recommend this movie to anyone. You will like it.

I was reminded of it's quality in script, performance and oddly enough presentation. It's realism is confirmed by my nephew who, at the age six and a half, cried because he thought Truman was a real person caught in a real mouse trap. He is no fool, not then, not now. Ten years on and we now have a plethora of reality TV shows. It leads to the question, when will we get tired of them? When will we demand more? Face it, a lot of us see them as more ridiculous and counterfeit than reality. But, in the end, it is the entertainment value that continues to draw me. And, of course, how can I pass up Jim and Ed.",

I was going to give it a 9, but this is exactly what movies should be about: originality, ambition, great directing & acting, and an immersion into a world built up within it. Truman Show has all those qualities. This is something that has never been done before. Those of you who want to take something philosophical away from this film and look into it deeply will find you can do just that; it's deep enough to incite thought, and those of you who just want to sit through a feel-good movie with a few twists and turns that will leave you gripped need look no further. I think this was the first time we saw Carrey shy away from comedy, and although there are parts of his humour that shine through, the film is all the better for it. He plays this part perfectly, right through to its epic climax. His humour is not utilised in this film to give his center stage and an open floor to be as silly as he can, instead this film allows you to laugh with him, and not feel as if you're watching a stand-up show. The rest of the cast are perfect, fitting in well, including Ed Harris as the \"director\". He surprised me here, because he is just the \"right\" amount of his usual badass self, mixed with some emotion and empathy. This is definitely an original concept, and executed well. I haven't seen this film in a few years yet still remember much of it. You won't be disappointed.",

Jim Carey was perfect; a seriously funny person but he has another brilliant personality up his sleeve. He can look seriously insane. Jim brings a refreshingly interesting and masterful edge to this film. He plays an ordinary insurance seller in a world that seems to revolve strangely around him. Slowly he begins to realise that things are not as they seem. A strange object plummets down from the sky that appears to be a stage light. It starts to rain... only on the spot where he is standing. His car radio suddenly has strange interferences and then starts reading out his exact coordinates. Jim Carey plays the role very well and one of my favourite scenes is where he and his supposed wife are alone in the house and Jim snaps. The wife's - (actor's!) - desperate attempts to suppress his confused anger and realisation is very cleverly done, but the whole idea, though being original, does seem a bit too far-fetched. Jim Carey as always adds his hilariously wacky touch to the film and overall this is a masterful and original film that impressed and intrigued me massively!

            "content": "Of course you could do the same as most other people do: describe this movie as `a satirical and sometimes hilarious comment on the role of the modern media' \u0096 or something of the kind. But you would do `The Truman Show' wrong if you left it like this, it contains many more truths than just that.There are two opposing concepts of life which stand out. One is firmly anchored in the shores of Protection, it means that you do not feel any inclination to venture out into the unknown, for you are happy where you are, and by no means you want to alter the present state of things. For such people the town called `Seahaven' would be the ideal one: it is a haven against the dangerous outside world, here represented by the sea, a place where you can feel absolutely safe.But Man, throughout his history, has always shown his discontent with staying at home and just maintaining the knowledge passed on to him by his ancestors. He has always felt a desperate craving for new experience. Explorers like Magellan, who was the first man to surround the Earth, stand for such endeavouring energies. Truman Burbank, although his position as a life insurance salesman might let you presume the exact opposite, is a would-be explorer himself and worships men like Magellan. When he tells his friend Marlon that he wants to leave his secure `desk job' and go to Fiji he also mentions that `there are still islands in Fiji where no human being has ever set foot.' His aim is to see something of the unknown world, add new dimensions to his life.But Truman's plan is counteracted by the requirements of the show in which he is the unsuspecting hero. By no means is he allowed to become aware of his true condition. Therefore all his attempts to leave Seahaven must inevitably fail. It is as if his life is guided by invisible strings, held together by the godlike Christof. It is only by a superhuman effort that he manages to set himself free, surmounting the fear of the element that he dreads most: water. By undertaking an unlikely escape voyage across the ocean that strikes the TV-program bosses by surprise he finally gets to the boundaries of the world that meant reality to him.Now he has finally achieved what he always wanted: to find the exit door of Seahaven. And there is nobody who can stop him. He resists the entreaties of his `creator', Christof, and boldly advances into the land beyond the `iron curtain'.Of course, we might be tempted to regard this scene as a metaphor for the passing of the ultimate threshold of human existence: from the land of the living to the land of the dead. That view seems coherent, but only if you exclude death as the end of the line. For what Truman has in mind is clearly continuity. He is carrying the identikit picture of Sylvia (the woman he once lost and always hoped to find in Fiji) and refers to it as his `map'. Thus his innate discoverer's energy is enhanced by the power of love. And it is this explosive combination that finally smoothes the way for his escape from the protected slavery into the realm of infinite freedom.",

Not every film is as instantly recognizable as The Matrix or Star Wars, but their set-ups are crucial to the intrigue. As with Groundhog Day, the Truman Show may just be one of the greatest and most intelligent comedies of the 1990s.Some may find the satire here too heavy handed, thus making it shallow. But the pertinent themes of self-determination, the relationship of institutions like the State, Media, and religion in tandem with the idea of free will, and the concept of what it truly means to be a happy person are all explored for better or worse here. Some of the imagery is a little too obvious, like Truman literally piercing through 'the edge of the world' and having a conversation with 'God'. The natural source of comedy in Truman slowly realizing his world is a TV set is woefully underused, with only about a third of the screen time dedicated to Jim Carrey's priceless antics among the straight faced actors and television crew around him. The film remorselessly lampoons network television with views inside the control room. A perfectly cast Ed Harris as a maniacal parody of a Steve Jobs entrepreneur/artiste, complete with beret and turtleneck sweater, anchors the story as the plausibly divine instrument of Truman's fate. The use of product placement invading the character's life is another stroke of genius.The film ends somewhat abruptly, but the tale of a single human life being born out of and fighting against the ratings is something to aspire to, ironically. The metaphor couldn't be more appropriate in this day and age of increasing surveillance and invasion of privacy. Apart from that, this is certainly the best Jim Carrey film after \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\".",

There are many movies now that begin by showing us an everyday, mundane, version of our world and then have the central character \"breaking through\" to something much more meaningful and significant.Probably The Matrix is the best example of such a movie, where a computer message implores Neo to \"Wake Up!\" and begin a journey that has him uncovering an alternate reality. And then there is Groundhog Day where a nice cosy small town visit leads Phil Connors to move beyond the selfishness that has trapped him, to being a more expansive and loving human being. Even Star Wars has a dual reality theme, with a deeper reality being evident in scenes with The Force; the light sabre scenes with Darth Vader, in particular, are fights between spiritual warriors, not ordinary beings.And then we come to the Truman show, where wide-eyed Truman (True Man) Burbank (Jim Carrey) begins to suspect that his calm and routine everyday existence in the town of Seahaven has another side to it. Nothing is quite what it seems. It's as if Truman is in a prison and gradually he pieces together the jigsaw puzzle of his entrapment, faces his fear (of water), and literally opens the door to another world.The Truman Show is yet another example of a movie that can be enjoyed at two levels: a popular film from Hollywood as well as a spiritual allegory that raises fundamental questions about our lives. What could have been an ordinary film is lifted up by an intelligent script as well as good acting and directing. It's a movie that is well worth seeing more than once.",

In Truman's world, everything is perfect, from his perfect wife, Maryl, to his desk job just a short drive away. In short, Truman is living the American Dream. What he doesn't know is that his life is just an illusion carefully tailored by a television producer broadcasting his every move live, 24 hours a day and that everyone in his life is an actor. After a series of small mistakes and mishaps by the cast and crew of the show, Truman slowly begins to question his world, peeling back layers of the giant set. In this movie, the producers of the show act as the media, constantly stimulating our minds with directionless static that, without careful attention, can fall onto our radar as all-consuming. Truman, in this show, acts as the everyday person, completely absorbed in our world of media, news, and mundane reporters. The repetition of Truman's daily life reflects our own, in this day and age. What, really, then, is our objective in life if we continue to live the same loop for so many years? We have goals, yes, but why are we still stuck in the cycle every day? I loved this movie because the viewer acts as both the observer and part of the issue at the same time. Because we were so focused on the story, we weren't aware of our surroundings in real life, which was brought into clearer focus when Truman became justifiably paranoid. The viewer here is both Truman and the creators of the TV show. This was an incredibly real movie, especially in this day and age where we are so engulfed in media 24/7 and I would recommend it to everyone, especially children who are more vulnerable to media influence.",

While some may argue that The Truman Show is in fact a horatian satire piece, the deflation used to downplay the actual inhumaneness of the show portrayed in the movie is only hiding the actual dark things going on, such as using \"plot twists\" to make traumatic event actually happen in Truman's life. The entire thing is an ironic take on Truman's life; Truman has no clue that viewers are watching his every move, while the audience and the viewers of 'The Truman Show', as both the show in the movie and the movie are named, are in on the false narrative set by the directions of the show. By inflating the viewership of The Truman Show and portraying everyone as constantly watching and being obsessed, the movie furthers its satirical intent of showing how obsessed everyone is with media, and how the media can manipulate our lives. The subtle innuendos of Truman getting subliminal messaging through the radio and television programs is also an innuendo to us as viewers, and is an eye opener as to how much we, to, are subconsciously impacted by the constant stream of information going on all around us. In the beginning of the movie, Truman is shown to be going about his daily life, just like many of us, and bumps into an object that seemingly fell from the sky. He later hears a program on the radio about how a plane flew past earlier that day, dropping parts as it went. Truman did not react at that time, but the connotation to the viewers was that it was an explanation to Truman that he didn't even consciously register, but was subconsciously filing away the incident with the explanation.",

The beginning of the movie definitely has a few innuendos to what is actually happening. Everyone in Truman's town are actors and no aspect of his life is real, but he doesn't know this. Throughout the movie, the idea of having a \"perfect life\" is definitely inflated as a reason for why Truman should stay in Seahaven and why be kept unaware of what is actually going on in the world and what he is actually apart of. The actors all try to keep him in the dark and anything that could give him a hint to what is actually going on is hidden. This eventually leads to the paranoid side of The Truman Show. As we view Truman's world, we watch as he begins to find one thing odd and then another, until he is very paranoid and he wants to scrutinize everything in the town that seems odd.

            "content": "From the moment we are old enough to grab a marker with our small fingers, we toy with the idea of creating our own world within this one. Artists are simply the lucky ones who manage to grow up while retaining the possibility of making a living out of the creative act. But the idea of playing God is inherent to all of us, so much that the idea that we are simply part of a bigger creation is deeply ingrained within our cultural genoma.The Truman Show takes this to the ultimate end: the possibility of creating an entire world from scratch, the possibility of playing with someone's life and control it in every single extent. It is noteworthy how such an experiments ends up looking an awful lot like George Orwell's 1984. In the end, God might not be much more than just a (benevolent?) totalitarian dictator.The resemblance to Plato's allegory of the Cave is quite clear. And as such, it is not hard to figure out what will happen once Truman begins to notice that his everyday life is simply shadows cast on the wall of the cave. No matter how much the Creator tries to distract him, the idea is already incepted in his brain: he will try to leave the cave.But the notion that the outer world, outside the cave, is our own world, is somewhat disturbing. One tends to think of Plato's allegory of the cave as a quest for the Utopian, but if the world outside the cave is our own, dirty and imperfect world, wouldn't it make more sense to remain in the cave? Confronting ourselves with the real world will render all quest for the Ideal futile. No wonder the existentialist had such a hard time once they denied the existence of God. The only thing left to do, then, is to turn the allegory of the cave upside down: if the outer world is so imperfect, we might look for perfection within our own, personal caves (which is what Creators do).The Truman Show is a very engaging movie, that tricks us with its looks of yet another Jim Carrey blockbuster, only to have us trapped into a thought-provoking experience that will keep us awake at night. It is a turning point in Carrey's career, in which he proves that laughs is not the only thing he can provoke in the viewers. It is a movie full of hope, that encourages all of us to leave our own, personal caves.",

As was the casethen, here again he tackles a very important and relevant issue inmodern society, and poses quite a few important questions.

This world is placed in the middle of Hollywood and everyone is watching him from their TV sets.I think the main point the director was trying to put across was that maybe the perfect world would not be a good place to live eg.

Example, Truman's \"Who the hell are you talking to?\" as his wife drones on and on to an invisible audience about the wonders of a Nicaraguan coffee.  Ed Harris' final line sums up the whole TV mentality \"say something, goddam it, you're on television!\"  This is one of endings that draws tears no matter how many times you've seen it, just because of Jim Carrey's brilliant portrayal of a man who realizes that his entire world has been a fabrication.

The kicker is that he does not realize it.  Every part of his life, his daily routine, from when he gets up to when he goes to bed and even while he sleeps, is broadcast to the world.  He exists in kind of the ultimate fishbowl: a gargantuan artificial terrarium (\"one of only two structures in the world that are visible from space!\") that contains within it the village of Seahaven, a coastal town where Truman Burbank, the unwitting star, lives and works as an insurance agent.The film provides a semi-serious role for Jim Carrey, an actor who I at first found tasteless but have recently grown to respect, not the least because of his performance in this movie.  He is required to walk a fine line between comedy and wistfullness.   It is a tricky job but he pulls it off, creating a believable performance as a man who is just beginning to suspect that there is something off in his universe.More than anything else, the movie gives the audience a lot to think and talk about.  The modern media has entered into our private lives to a unprecedented degree over the last two decades.  Although I doubt such an undertaking could ever be seriously contemplated, just how far are we from the Truman Show?  How far are we willing to go?  The film also raises serious questions about the quality of life.  Is is better to live a life in paradise and never know it is fake and that everyone is watching, or to live in \"our\" reality?

His life is one to die for: no controversy or chaos, but he feels empty and unfulfilled. There are many moments of Truman is overjoyed, but on the other side of the curtain are actors, simply paid to manipulate his emotions.

At the same time, he struggled with memories, but don't we all? As the viewer, we're left to determine the morality of the happiness of millions versus the freedom of one. We're also left to consider whether Truman's cage was better than his freedom. A child born into a system that doesn't have a great track record or a life of relative safety with no knowledge of the cage. The viewer also has to determine the sturdy nature of reality. What is reality besides our perception of it? What's real to Jim or to Bob? Are the things that are real to them real to me if I've never seen or heard about them? Beyond the philosophical questions the movie poses, the film itself is solid. Jim Carrey pulls off the part wonderfully. He's more than just a comedian, although he can bring the humor the instant the scene needs it. The supporting cast fell right in line.

This is one those ideas, which can make a man lose sleep, and his mind churning for weeks. Its one of those ideas that can inspire even more ideas or destroy existing ones. It can manifest itself into a reality, or make us realize it was there all along and we just never saw it. It brings up front what we think is normal, and makes us question why is it normal. It is an idea that gets implanted in your mind, and you can never get it out. Once you watch this movie, a part of it will always stay with you.\"You accept the world you're given\", the filmmakers suggest; more thoughtful viewers will get the buried message, which is that we accept almost everything in our lives without examining it very closely. When was the last time you reflected on how really odd a tree looks? Are we doing what we actually want to do, or are we just performing what system dictates, or what everyone else is doing? Do we ever get to break free from this cycle of pleasing everyone to be able to actually work on pleasing just one person, that is our-self? Like I said, many ideas and question can grow out from this one little seed of an idea planted in this movie.\nThe movie is about a common ordinary, upbeat man, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). However, unbeknown to him, he is the star of the most popular show in the history of television. For 10,909 days, it has been on the air, using 5000 cameras to show every moment in every day of the life of one man.\nThe public loves it -- there are Truman addicts who go to sleep with the TV on and who have sets installed in the bathroom so they don't miss anything when they're taking a bath. Every individual in \"The Truman Show\" is an actor with one important exception: the lead character himself. For, while everyone around Truman is playing a part, he is cheerfully ignorant about the truth. He thinks this is all real, and his obliviousness to the situation gives the program its core appeal -- that there's nothing counterfeit about Truman.Truman works as a sales executive at an insurance company, is happily married to Meryl (Laura Linney), and doesn't find it suspicious that she describes household products in the language of TV commercials. He is happy, in a way, but an uneasiness gnaws away at him. Something is missing, and he thinks perhaps he might find it in Fiji, where Lauren (Natascha McElhone), the only woman he really loved, allegedly has moved with her family.Truman's world is controlled by a TV producer named Christof (Ed Harris), whose control room is high in the artificial dome that provides the sky and horizon of Seahaven. He discusses his programming on talk shows, and dismisses the protests of those (including Sylvia) who believe Truman is the victim of a cruel deception.The movie's story follows Truman's journey in finally discovering and realizing his life is an elaborately constructed ruse and escaping it.\nThe story is unique, thrilling, well presented and very close to reality. It's like watching an episode of Black Mirror. In fact, I see the episode White Bear from the Season 1 of Black Mirror drawing references from The Truman Show directly. In The Truman Show, Ed Harris is playing this pivotal role of Christoff the director of the show, who rules over Seaside with a sinister, God-Like-Authority, that amounts to the film's most satirical aspect, since it so easily links divinity with hip, media-savvy grandiosity.\nHe created the character Truman for everyone, and through him he controls his audience. He manipulates his audience into buying the products he choses, he has them emotionally vested into this characters lives, and he can induce in them thoughts and judgement of other people. White Bear was like a modernized version of The Truman Show, replacing Truman with an animated character. It picks up on the theme presented in The Truman Show and expands it further. What if Truman kept on growing and didn't realize where he was trapped? Wouldn't Christof be able to manipulate people's thoughts on the political front? Would one day it won't be Christof running this but actual government agencies, knowing how powerful the character and the show has become? And that is just what White Bear does! It expands the idea originally presented in The Truman Show.Black Mirror isn't the only show to have expanded on the Truman idea. If we look at it, even The Matrix Trilogy is also based on the similar theme of, \"What if the world we are living in, is not real, but a simulated one.\" If The Matrix was stripped of it's technicalities about breaking the system, fast action sequences, neo-noir look and hi-tech sci-fi and replace it with media, colors, comedy, drama and an ordinary man and his ordinary life, you'll get the inspiration source of The Matrix, which is The Truman Show.\nAs the story unfolds, however, we're not simply expected to follow it: We're invited to think about the implications. About a world in which modern communications make celebrity possible, and inhuman.One of the ideas presented is that the media in some way or the other does control your life, and one doesn't really have the free will that they think they do because everything is influenced! It so resonated with me, that tragic nature of it.Remember this movie was released in 1998, and at the time, reality was negligible or none actually. It was a year after this show that Big Brother started to air. Reality TV, I feel, was one of those ideated predictions made by this movie that actually came true.\nBy Reality TV I simply mean what is meant by the word, \"Real lives of people or unscripted actions and dialogues displayed on TV, and following their lives or a quest\". Truman simply lives, and the show's popularity is its straightforward voyeurism. And, like Big Brother, Survivor, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real. While I feel the current reality TV is still more acting and just a part of the lives of its characters, it can eventually maybe change to something of the Truman sorts, in a horrifying Black Mirror kind of experiment. The Truman Show is all the more noteworthy for its remarkably prescient vision of runaway celebrity culture and a nation with an insatiable thirst for the private details of ordinary lives.But there is a part of me, that also believes that the story while it introduces the concept of reality TV, it also signifies the falseness of the Reality TV that currently exits. When you know there is a camera, there is no reality. In that respect, Truman Burbank \"is the only genuine reality star.\"\nBut on another level, I also feel that as an audience, we just blew past The Truman Show's cautionary subtext even more; we've elected a reality star as our president!Going above the reality TV aspect, I personally feel Truman show is actually about the Power of Media and its control on us. Truman's life inspires audiences around the world, meaning their lives are controlled by his. In the end, the power of the media is affirmed rather than challenged. These films and television programs co-opt our enchantment (and disenchantment) with the media and sell it back to us.Our world and its people want new things that connect us to reality using our technology more and more. With the advent of social media, this is proof enough of how the power of media over us has evolved even 100 times more.\nThose of us without official series are essentially starring in and producing our own reality shows, via constant Twitter updates, Instagram Stories, Snapchats, Facebook videos, and YouTube videos. When I sit in a car or in a van or a room, and I see 90 percent of the people with their faces glowing and their eyes in the palm of their hand, I go, 'This is Orwellian.' Their consciousness has been reduced to what other people think, period.In addition to forecasting the power of media, the film also predicts the scope of modern product placement (as presented by Linney's impeccably named character, Meryl Burbank, who plays the role of Truman's wife on the show), privacy invasion, and the existential quandary of whether to live for yourself or an audience-be it television or social media. Truman must ultimately decide between accepting the artificial world he knows, or venturing into the unknown in pursuit of truth.The underlying ideas made the movie more than just entertainment. It brings into focus the new values that technology is forcing on humanity. By and large the film is extremely witty in its ways of blowing the television show's cover. Early on, Truman is puzzled by a piece of lighting equipment that falls from the sky. Later, he is sprinkled by his own little rainstorm. And when Truman moves, the stage rainstorm moves, too.\nAndrew Niccol came up with the idea of writing this script from an episode of The Twilight Hour. But the original version he wrote was very dark, set in New-York and was a more serious and sci-fi. It didn't resonate with Peter Weir, the director. It was Peter Weir who loved the script when he read it, but questioned, \"Why would the audience of the show be glued to it, watching it 24X7, if the show was that dark?\". This kind of makes sense as we are shown in the movie that some audiences are falling asleep right in front their TV sets, or even watching in the bathtub. Why would someone want to watch this series if it was so depressing? So with this thought and Peter's guidance, Niccol changed the script, making it more lighter, colorful and more easy to connect to the audience. For this, he did have to re-write it 12 times!Peter Weir thought a lot about the back story, as he believed if he isn't convinced by the idea, how will the movies audience be convinced? He even created a look book, with cut outs of images from a 1940s sears catalogue to get an idea of how",

I think it was the idea that Truman and all of the other actors were equal under one producer. This went for the staffers as well. There was also the allegorical concept of the film, such as Truman's name. Truman, was the only \"true man\" on the island. He was also true to himself at the end. Then there is the motif of the eyes. The cameras serve as eyes, but we also see Sylvia's eyes gazing at Truman, and Christof's piercing gaze. A fascinating motif. Finally, there is the aspect of water. Biblically, God created a flood that covered then earth. Christof creates a storm that kills Truman's father. It was chilling to watch Christof stroke the picture of Truman on TV. It was a sickening reminder of the lie that Truman was forced to live.The entire concept of the film is frightening.

This dark comedy-drama with its beautifully and precisely webbed plot, cinematography and string of ideas is definitely deserving many academy awards, but will not get them. I was overwhelmed (and scared) by everything the director superbly presents us what we already know, and enjoyed every moment of being the voyeur (and when I got out of the theater, the voyee). The soundtrack is definitely worth buying, and the movie itself is worth seeing for a second time. But the trailers, thanks to the well-praised (!) media I think spoil the surprising and spooky feel. Ed Harris steals many scenes even from the superb Jim Carrey. A must see for the media-aware crowd.",

            "content": "A film about a reality show with the same name, in which Truman, the main character, was seen for everyone on their televisions; Truman just didn't know his life was a show, he lived a \"normal life\", he was not acting and this was the magic of the show. One of the main is the director of the reality show, Christof, performed by the talented actor from New Jersey, Ed Harris. He was playing the role of God, he was directing the cameras of the program from a false moon in the sky and he decided all the aspects in his life, even his dead. It's not amazing, if we think about the power he had, the similarity between the name \"Christof\" and the name of \"Christ\".This movie was starring by Jim Carrey, as Truman; his performance was amazing because, as expected, he took advantage of his comedy skills, but surprisingly he showed he is a brilliant actor who have great talent in drama. His character was the most watched man in the all world through the show broadcasted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The show began airing since his birth, through his childhood, even the unfortunate and terrible loss of his father, his hilarious adolescence and, when the movie was set, his mature man stage. At this stage he wanted to take his own decisions and to do what he had always dreamed. These desires triggered a series of events which led him to discover the truth behind everything he thought was normal and incidental.. the people, his family, his job, even de weather.Truman's name could allude to words \"true\" and \"man\", it's just a sign that the protagonist was the only who was honest and real in his perfect own life, which was nothing less than the live television program more ambitious, with a recording set so large that, according to the film, it could be seen from Earth's natural satellite, the Moon.A breathtaking fact is that Truman was the first child legally adopted by a company, an allegory for the idea than capitalism and consumerism can buy people and lives, even make people buy things they do not need: \"the whole show is for sale\". Another important fact is that in the plot Cristof really wanted to be an almighty a god, controlling all the aspects of Truman's life, but the only aspect he couldn't control at 100% were Truman's feelings and thoughts. In his college days, a girl who studied at the same school caught his attention, whenever they saw her they exchanged romantic glances, but this was not just another actress on the \"Truman Show\". She seemed concerned Truman knew the truth, she had real love for Truman. She was Lauren, a classmate teenager inside the show but outside the show she was Sylvia a not exceptional actress. She also told him her real name and she mentioned that everything that Truman saw was done for him.Music wasn't a special element, it didn't have an important or recurrent presence, it was used as a fake support for the show, exaggerating the tension and sentimentality. The film only had background music, which is purposely used to set the reality show. All music in the film was instrumental and was composed by one of the most relevant academic composers of the second half of the 20th and 21st century, and one of the main exponents of minimalism, Philip Glass. Another artistic work element can be highlighted, the photography and focus, an important example is the last scene, there was a great resemblance to \"Architecture au Clair de Lune\", a painting by the Belgian painter and exponent of surrealism, Ren\u00e8 Magritte.I agree with the main themes that the film criticize, these are the consumerist and liquid society. The movie can also become a critique of current entertainment, which exaggerates moments of tension and the way in which people are hooked to live other people's life, instead of take care of their own lives. As soon as the show is over, nobody knew what to do with his life. An example of that was given in the end of the film when two guards spectators of Truman Show, saw the TV guide after the end of the show, they just were looking to entertain themselves again instead of living their own lives",

In fact, I decided to watch it when I realized that all magazines were saying it was incredible, beautiful, touching, ... And I really found it!I thought the movie was more comedy than drama. It's a multi-genre movie, it's very hard to tell. I loved the scenes where they showed  how Truman's life could be (and were) controlled. One spotlight falling from the sky, all the days were sunny, the same people doing the same thing every day, and the most amazing, when Christof (Ed Harris), trying to find Truman, makes the sun rise in 2 seconds at midnight. I have to say that I was a bit afraid of Jim Carrey. How can a movie with Jim Carrey as the main character be a drama or even be good? But this time his grimaces didn't affect the movie. As nothing is perfect in the world, there are some small \"problems\" in The Truman Show. I think the theme could be more explored by the director Peter Weir. The end, that some people said was revolting, didn't look so strange to me but I agree that they should have shown what happened to Truman after his decision. OK, Truman is free. And after it? In summary, you must see this movie. It's almost perfect. 9/10",

It is so multi-layered that you can spend hours and hours discussing and dissecting it and still you may just have missed one important aspect of it.On the surface it is a story of Truman a 30 something guy who realizes one day that his whole life has been actually a TV show. Everybody around him, including his wife and best friend, are mere actors and everything around him is a studio set. Bizarre concept but not so bizarre if you think about all the reality shows these days. The movie is kind of prophetic because it came out before the reality shows had not yet flooded our cable. One can also interpret the movie from the way media creates, manipulates and destroys personalities these days.Jim Carey has given an excellent performance but it is sad that it went unnoticed by the academy. But they can't be blamed because he has become a prisoner of his own image so much so that no one takes him seriously. Had it been Tom Hanks instead of him I am sure this movie would have made a clean sweep that year.One of the most relevant movies of our times.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a fantastic film, it is about a man whose entire life is a TV show, he has been monitored and been on since the day he was born all the way to his mid thirties. Although he is not aware of this fact all the people around him, his family, his relatives, neighbors and friends are all actors hired by the TV show also to monitor him.The film starts out pretty basic and simple, you wouldn't think anything extraordinary is happening, you will just be seeing an average man going about his daily routine, things keep on going pretty basic until an unforeseen event unfolds in his life, and he becomes confused about what is going on. Some of Truman's actions do not make sense early on as well, tearing the pictures of girls from magazines. Soon after some events Truman finds out something is wrong and there are people following him and monitoring his moments, and soon after the twist is revealed in it's full form, that Truman is in a TV show only he is not aware of it and everyone he knows in that town is a hired actor and the city he lives in is also a film set.This was a wonderful plot twist which not only makes the film so much more interesting and makes you want to re-watch the whole film again, from a different perspective, and closely watch the early scenes and listen to the dialog carefully and see how the actors are behaving around Truman. The ending was also great because it leaves it up to interpretation if Truman will be able to survive in the world out there when he has spent his entire life on the film set, the ending is not something i would call a HAPPY ENDING because it leaves it up to interpretation about Truman's future. Performance wise this film is great, anyone who says Jim Carrey cannot do drama roles should watch this, he plays Truman at his very best, although he does bring humor to some of his scenes he is mostly playing a dramatic character and his antics, dialog delivery is all done well. Ed Harris did not get that much screen time but he played Christof spot on, he was perfect in playing a man who would go as far as he can to make his TV show a success and make sure Truman never leaves. The rest of the actors on the Truman Show did well they were all playing two roles, one of the actors in a TV shows and their characters in the TV show and it was well executed. The direction is also fantastic there are camera which focus closely on Truman with the screen having a background which is the film's way of showing that Truman is on camera and is being watched by people around the world. The other camera angle is the one we see from out perspective. The setting is also done well, the whole island has been designed well to look like a TV set.The music is also good, as it suits most of the scenes the film is in, the music that plays in the intro and the conclusion when Truman is talking to Christof specially suits those scenes perfectly. The only minor issue with Truman Show would be it's slow pacing and slow start and slow development at least during your first watch, by the time the major event start to unfold and the film starts to get interesting and reveal the big twists, you may be kind of bored and may have grown restless. You may want to watch it a second time from a different perspective knowing clearly from the start that Truman is being directed the entire time, but the slow scenes may still put you off. Regardless Truman Show is a fantastic, ambitious in-depth and thought provoking film about social satire which makes you think deeply. The film's storyline music and performances are all well done, and the fact that it's twist makes you watch it from a different perspective completely also makes this film that much better. Overall rating: 9/10.",

            "content": "I absolutely loved The Truman Show! What a film, both funny and mentally stimulating. It's as though every single camera shot and every single line of dialogue is used to conceal an Easter egg. A flash of lightning illuminating the moon to suggest the orbital satellite is much closer to Earth than it should be? Truman taking vitamin D pills with his breakfast every morning to hint at the fact he has never been exposed to actual sunlight? These are just a couple of the clues I picked up on my first watch that give away the intricacies of Truman's world - I cannot wait for my second watch to discover more.I honestly believe The Truman Show might be the founding father of 21st century reality TV - I wouldn't be at all surprised to find the idea for Big Brother was born after the producers watched this film.Jim Carrey carries the lead superbly, influencing the viewer to really sympathise with Truman and want the best for him (this is what makes the ending so triumphant). He was hard done by not to receive an Oscar nomination for the role. The supporting cast are all detestable in their efforts to block Truman from discovering the truth. I don't think I'll be able to watch Ozark now without questioning Laura Linney's genuineness as Wendy Bird - is she really in it for the family money laundering business or is her role simply to promote and explicitly advertise tourism in Missouri? After the impression she has left on me as Meryl Burbank in The Truman Show, watching Ozark may never be the same again.I really wish the runtime had been longer, even if only by an extra 15 minutes to take the total up to 2 hours - it's just one of those films I was willing desperately not to end! Also I wish we got to see what happens to Truman after he walks through that black door, particularly his reunion with Sylvia. I guess the ending was purposefully left open to interpretation, but it would've been a satisfying feel good closing scene to watch the star crossed lovers finally unite.Overall, my only criticism can be The Truman Show left me wanting more. 9/10.",

Worth the wait 10/10.The direction and style of the film reeks of a 80s mainstream comedy. The film improves throughout and expounds many interesting philosophical ideas by the end. It is no short of clever political and social commentary, and there are lots of great details, for example showing a still shot on TV draws an all time high viewership (subtly referring to real live TV shows and the audience's taste). There was a sequence in the middle where the creator reveals his throught process behind writing a scene for Truman, which make for an ingenious touch. There are a lot of moments like that, and they clearly show how well-thought the film is compared to many contemporaries of its time. It is certainly a film that demands several rewatches, and it provided how joyful of a ride it turns out to be, it is not hard to do so.Jim Carrey delivers a solid performance that showcases the full extent of his talents. His usual antics aside, there is also surprisinng amount of emotional depth at certain scenes. He is an underrated dramatic actor, and if you haven't seen him in Eternal Sunshine, I highly recommend it. The villain is also pretty awesome for a comedy of this calibre. Intelligent, electrifying and fundamentally human, it is a villain that we sympathize with, not the kind of cold and despicable stereotype that Hollywood movies haven't grown out of yet back in the 90s, and to a smaller extent today.My expectations were rather reserved before I saw this film. I am pleased to say that they are absolutely defied upon my first viewing. A very rewatchable and memorable comedy.",

Truman is brilliantly played by the often un-brilliant Jim Carrey.  He's a nice guy. We like him.  We like his wife (Laura Linney).  We like his best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich).

Another movie having a similar concept (and effect?) was Edtv.10 years ago the concept was original. Now, the whole thing is ALMOST plausible as a television show. In fact in Germany they had a Big Brother format in which they had a whole village as their \"Big Brother house\". The main difference to this movie being that the contestants naturally knew that they were on a TV-show (but what if they had had babies?).So basically this movie is not so original anymore. Except for the concept, the plot is pretty thin actually. As most Jim Carrey movies, this one relies a lot on his skills. The movie is entertaining, because Jim Carrey is entertaining.This isn't really a comedy, and definitely nobody would even consider this a comedy, if Truman was played by somebody else then Carrey.",

            "content": "Like another of the commentators before me, this movie reminded me of \"The Prisoner\" television program. The Truman Show is a somewhat thoughtful little film, and raises some interesting questions about the nature of privacy and of freedom and free will. The problem I had with it was the premise. I can sort of allow myself to be convinced that a man can be raised under such circumstances and not be any the wiser, providing he is kept happy enough not to examine his world too closely. Heck, I know people like that. What I can't swallow is that so many people could be so enthralled by the act of observing him sleep, eat, pass wind, pick his nose, etc., that it could survive for thirty years on the air. The most surprising thing about this film is Jim Carrey's performance. Sure, his comic persona may peek out once in a while and might be a bit inapropriate, but it's the mark of a potentially great actor who is still a little hesitant to let go for a while of the thing that made his career soar. I've heard it said before that he has the makings of a first rate actor if ever he is given the right opportunity to develop. After seeing The Truman Show, I'd have to agree. What were Tom Hanks and Robin Williams doing fifteen years ago?",

Placed as Truman Burbank, however, Carrey is given a more poignant role, to which he does more than justice. Through his immaculate characterisation this film makes the audience feel as though he is also watching 'The Truman Show.' What perhaps makes the film so interesting and deep is the moving relationships that Truman experiences, something that Carrey brings across greatly.Most of the film made me thinking about the possibility and actuality that is posed by the director. Indeed, it seems that there is much philosophical debate about matters such as those addressed in the film, giving a graphic representation of what a human being experiences throughout his life. Truman's realisation and 'wanting to break free' also seems to be a reflection of typical personal experience when we run into trouble...however, Truman alone has this power.Overall a stunning film that presents deep issues and a valuable message, with fantastic performances...a top film!",

It might have given the movie a certain sense of pathos and let the audience identify a lot more with Truman.  As it was, I think that too much was given away too soon...knowing that it was a TV show in advance, made it harder to identify with Truman's dilemma.  It made all the show's action seem stilted, the reintroduction of his father obvious, and subplot with the mysterious redhead, unconvincing.  Even the social satire came off as overwrought.  As such, The Truman Show was not the great movie I was hoping for when I went to it.  It had great potential, and squandered it. So consider this, my could-have-been-better pitch.",

Sylvia ( Natascha McElhone ) who tries to help him to escape, was my favorite character. I liked the show but theres one thing I have to criticizes sometimes it's a litte unrealistic that the camera is right infront of his face cause he would notice. Jim Carrey is a very sympathetic and funny character. The first half of the movie was a little bit boring because nothing really happens until the second half.All in all I liked the show even tho it isn't the kind of movie I would watch usually.

Stick to making thrillers, Sci-fi, romance, mainstream comedy etc which they excel at, but leave subjects like this to the European cinema or at least to the East Coast tradition. Failing that, only a director of the stature of David Lynch has the breadth of imagination to tackle a story line such as this.Quite simply the problem is that the film cannot make up it's mind whether it's a moral fable or (by a huge stretch of the imagination) a representation of some form of reality. As a result, it continuously flips between these two genres and cannot quite make up it's mind which path to take or which one to stick to.As a representation of reality, quite apart from the corn like the director wearing a beret (gimme a break), the wife trying to do product advertisement in the middle of a flaming row (!!!!!!) it's just too full of illogicalities and inconsistencies to bear even a remote resemblance to any real life situation. One might just about accept that were the whole populace of the 'set' also in the same boat as Truman himself, the scenario might ... just might ... work, but a solitary figure in a landscape of actors and extras???? Anyone with any experience of working in entertainment media sector could tell you that's simply not feasible. And the 'fable' angle doesn't work either because direction and production strive too hard to show film pertains to a real life situation.But the most glaring hole in the whole storyline is why go to such lengths (and expense) to examine human reaction in a supposedly 'Real-Life' situation. Just stick enough CCTV's in any small township or village, pay the inhabitants some dosh and tell them to get on with their life. As has been proved time and again, subjects fairly soon tend to forget that they're the subjects of a study and begin to ignore the cameras.",

Nevertheless, I do believe that the movie started off rather monotonously and only got suspenseful in the last part, when Truman instantaneously started realizing the truth.All in all, I really enjoyed watching this movie and I would definitely recommend this classic slice of '90s cinema for people of all age.",

Therefore, he lives in a fake town called Seahaven where cameras film every moment of his life. Furthermore his friends, even his wife Meryl who is played by Laura Linney, neighbours and colleagues are all actors. Truman lives an ordinary, but boring life until one day he gets suspicious about numerous odd events. From there on the main character tries to escape his false reality while the producers of \"The Truman show\" try to stop him.Although the director did a good job introducing the characters to us, Truman, the only person who is supposed to act completely himself behaves a bit over the top in my opinion. Apart from that everything appears believable, and the colour scheme of the film makes it enjoyable to watch.The film was gripping from the first minute on and in the end, you could feel Truman's pain especially because of the dramatic music. If you want to, you can really think about the deeper provocative topics in this movie, such as the loss of privacy, loneliness and living in a delusion, all of which our main character has to suffer but you can also just watch it for enjoyment with your kids, as there are a great number of funny scenes in this film as well, for example Truman's wife advertising different objects, without him noticing. Precisely for that reason I liked the movie so much. During the play, you get to know the characters better and better and you find yourself rooting for Truman. In case of the plot, it's in a way predictable, but it didn't bother me much because the director constantly throws in little events that I didn't foresee which kept me attentive.Overall \"The Truman Show\" is a thrilling and touching movie which impresses with its closeness to reality and its actuality. Therefore, I would definitely recommend it because I think it is of great worth for our society and everyone can profit from watching it.",

His portrayal of a man trapped within his own perception of reality was more than deserving of a nomination, and leads us once again to the age-old debate of the academy and its low success rate of selecting the most appropriate nominees and winners.Take a closer look and you'll realize that the same lack of attention from the academy applies to the whole film, let alone Carey. \"The Truman Show\" is one of the most stunningly original and creative films of the nineties; A clever satire, loaded with sharp wit and genuine drama from a carefully selected cast. If it has any flaw, it may be that it was too much of a clever satire, flying over the heads of an audience which was strongly infatuated with \"reality\" television.Still, for the picture's innovation and genius to be overlooked by the academy, which seems to be lost in its own perception of reality, is inexcusable and unfair, especially for Jim Carey, who may never get another opportunity like this again.Intriguing and compelling, \"The Truman Show\" deserved more respect than it got, and still does today.",

I consider this to be one of the greatest films of all time.Peter Weir is, undoubtedly, the best director Australia gave birth to. I found out that Andrew Niccol, the writer, is a New Zealander not long after. Funny that Hollywood would consider such a biting project. Also the fact that it is poetic, not too long, superbly written and containing elements of film craftsmanship that I have never seen used to such brilliant effect. Why would Hollywood consider such a project? Proabably because Jim Carrey showed interest...The whole experience is a detached one because it seems as though we are watching an assemblage of footage gathered up from shots of the Truman Show itself along with interview footage and just general \"fly-on-the-wall\" stuff. Looking back at the profound originality of the concept, I never suspected someone would want to use the idea presented in the film as the basis for an ACTUAL TV show. But, boy, did I underestimate the gullibility of general audiences!!!!This can now be looked at as a satirical masterpiece because of all the stupid \"fly-on-the-wall\" shows we see on TV now. It truly is a statement on the influence of the media, etc. After seeing this movie, I was appalled at myself for being drawn into the world of TV. Now, after being there for that long, I pat myself on the back for making better observations.This is the ultimate story of a man trapped by the influence of pop culture and an addictive source. It is subjective from the music and nothing else. I always believe music to be the anchor for everything in a movie, and the sparingly used soapie music in this is superb!!! What a beautiful film!!Once again, 10/10.",

            "content": "\"Truman Show\" should have won \"Best Picture\", without question.  The Academy, it seems, has its own bizarre criteria as well as its own agenda. I think it's an outrage that it didn't.The story itself was simply brilliant.  Not only that, when you think about it, the concept of the story is a very difficult one to execute successfully.  It would be very hard to show an audience that a certain fellow is living in a made-up world, discovering the nature of his world bit by bit, and then trying to get out from a life where everyone and everything around him existed just to keep him there.  A story like this could very easily have been screwed up.  In \"Truman Show\", it was executed flawlessly. For those who used their brains during the film, it would have been easy to feel trapped and frustrated.  I know I was.  Although most people would have liked to see a more \"final\" ending, i.e. actually see Truman finally meet Sylvia in the end as well punishment of Christof (most of us like are denouement spelled out for us), the ending was just the right amount; not to little, not too much.  Truman's escape brought him to Sylvia, and cut the legs out from under Christof.  It was absolutely clever.  An average person writing this ending would have ruined it with detail and similarity to other movie endings.An Oscar for Jim Carrey, and one for Ed Harris as well.  Prior to this movie, I knew Jim Carrey had talent, but didn't know he could be so versatile an actor.  His performance in \"Truman Show\" was superb.  The writing was also superb.  I thought the scene where Sylvia watched Truman sailing and holding the picture he made of her was just amazing.",

The plot is quite original and even though t has its similarities with EdTV, personally I like the treatment it got in this movie. The subtle psychological manipulation of Truman Burbank to keep him from finding out that he is just a character in a Reality Show has some \"orwellian\" spin (1984?, Big Brother?). The final scene, when Truman overcomes his fears and finally finds out the truth it's really well done. All and all, it's not a really big film, but it's good enough for a rainy weekend at home with the family. Rent it. 7/10",

The people around him continue to manipulate him and want to convince him that he is the one who is crazy. The only reason why he keeps going on, is his love for Meryl.

Jim Carrey delivers a flawless performance as Truman Burbank, a made-for-television character unknowingly viewed by millions 24/7 around the world. Truman's 'world,' the lovely 1950s'ish town of Seahaven is the creation of Cristof played wonderfully by Ed Harris. All the townsfolk including his wife Meryl (Laura Linney), best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich), and even his mother (Holland Taylor) are in on charade. All goes well till Truman starts discovering how the town is staged. Wanting to see the world (including one true love Lauren (Natascha McElhone)), Truman desperately attempts to leave the Island and discover what's beyond Seahaven.I didn't see this movie when it was in theaters. Jim Carrey in a serious film, no thanks. Did rent it years later and couldn't believe how great this movie is. The story, cast, music, etc.. Everything perfect. This movie MUST be viewed more than once. Took me 3-4 times to truly appreciate the depth the film has to offer. It's an absolute shame this film didn't receive more Oscar nominations.Carry's performance is genius! Even subtle things, like when he repeatedly taps the light that fell from the sky, exactly what a child would do to first test a foreign object. I liked Carrey a lot in his previous comedy movies, with this performance though he REALLY shows range. Ed Harris is perfect as (Christ)of, the creator. The film really slams it's own industry. But how do you intend to explain his 22-year absence? Amnesia. Brilliant!! This is one of those movies you get really get lost in, not concerning oneself with believability issues. I also loved the way it ended with so many issues left to the viewers imagination instead of normal feel-goody Hollywood ending.

So the movie is definitely not just about an all-day story, therefore I think that the plot is quite original and innovative. The fact that the spectator of the film gets inducted into Truman's secret even earlier than Truman himself makes his actions really funny and gripping.However, the story of Truman isn't funny at all, it's rather tragic. The plot and the well- fitting music keep the film quite moving and the spectator begins to feel sympathy for Truman.Finally, the movie turns out well, but the story keeps you thinking about today's TV and its influence on people.All in all, the Truman Show is a beautiful movie with a fascinating story and moving background music, and though it's already more than 10 years old, I can thoroughly recommend you to watch it!",

I really enjoyed this tragicomedy with spiritual core! The plot is an allegory of a spiritual reality, which is created for the protagonist ( and read between lines - for every and each human being) in accordance to develop his consciousness, i.e. a soul.The \"one man show\" is revealing a huge investment and effort of a Higher World (Director of the show and his crew in the movie) into a human being as well as human's challenges to get rid of the illusion of the tough magnetism of materialistic reality. Young and charming Jim Carrey is awesome in the role of Truman Burbank. That character is probably the most positive role of Jim Carrey.The culmination of the movie was when the director of the show dramatically increased the volume of the storm and Truman almost died in the waves. This could be considered as an allegory of a spiritual challenge and Burbank's victory.The end is open: what will happen the next to this guy? This movie is a wonderful sample how a very complex spiritual idea could be implemented into entertaining movie. BRAVO!",

            "content": "\"The Truman Show\" is probably one of the most underrated movies ever. It was a success at the time, and it got some Oscar nominations, but somehow it didn't get the recognition it deserves. When I say to friends the sentence in the title of this comment, I usually get a reaction between laughter and astonishment. It is much easier to pick Scorcesa's movies, and to prefer De-Nero over Jim Carrie, that absurd comedian.Why is this movie so underrated? One reason may be the identity of the hero, and the disbelief that the star of \"Ice Ventura\" can be part of a masterpiece. Another reason may be that people find it hard to believe that a film can be both entertaining, and funny, and light in character, and yet deep and sophisticated. And maybe the reason is the prejudice against what is \"Holiwoodic\". Whatever the reasons are, they are wrong. Truman is a movie that should be watched again and again, and to those who will do it, a very enjoyable experience is promised.To make things short, I will skip the obvious details (such as acting, directing etc.) and move to the most important stuff, and that is: what was the movie trying to say. There are three levels of meaning in the movie. The first is a satire of the current media, predicting the current trend of \"reality TV\". This level is obvious enough not to discussed thoroughly.The second level is a subject dealt with quite a lot in our era: the tension between \"high\" and \"low\" art, or between art and kitsch. While Truman is a film beautifully designed, \"The Truman show\" is not only a bizarre TV show, but also an extremely low-standard show. Anything around Truman's life is a kitsch, and this is a paradox which is in the basis of the movie. In addition, the movie brilliantly moves between the \"inside\" and \"outside\", between the atmosphere of the movie and of the TV series. Philip Glass' music has an extremely important part in that, making this movie an outstanding example for the importance of film music.The third level is in my opinion the most interesting, and that is the religious one. The creator-created relations between Truman and The director, which holds the name \"Chrostoph\" are clearly of religious context. But it takes several views of the movie to see that these relations are really what the movie talks about, and are apparent in almost every scene. Many questions arise from that topic, and they are dealt with brilliantly, with the climax of the last minutes. One does not expect a light Hollywood comedy to be a deep theological essay, but that is exactly what \"The Truman Show\" is. Go and see for yourselves.",

With its wide range of interesting cinematography that fits into the world of the film, it's interesting story line and its compelling acting, it is definitely a motion picture that will be remembered.Now, an interesting argument is whether this is a film or a movie. I have had difficulties deciding where to stand on this, because it has both commercial interest and artistic integrity throughout. Either way, I think I would sway more towards the side of it being a film. Because of its swelling orchestral soundtrack that offers moments of peace and freedom, its cinematographical style and its commentary on modern society, I believe putting it under the category of a movie would be doing it an injustice.I think this film was a good mix of technical elements and a good story, specifically how the two played into each other. The cameras inside Truman's world are mentioned, and we get many different shots that offer that sort of wide-angle type look which plays into the idea that Truman is being watched by the audience, and us subsequently. While it does this, it's still making it easy to understand and compelling to watch when it comes to the story. The reason this is the case is because of the characters, specifically Truman. His character is not only relatable but driven to overcome his fear and fulfill his dreams. This is inspiring and relatable to us because we empathize with him and we often feel trapped in society and consumer based living too.Cristoff's point that \"We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented\" is true in Truman's world, but not in ours. Where as some may stay close minded, most of us have art to show us the truth and commentaries of our own reality, but Truman doesn't. He lives in his own world where everything is catered to him and dependent that he doesn't find out his life is staged, so of course he isn't going to question it. Therefore, I disagree with Cristoff's statement.I would like to see the reality that most lives are run by products and the next consumable goods, whereas I believe we should live off of love, kindness, art and the simplicity of life itself.I think there are quite a few positives to the current situation. For example, the world itself and nature is becoming healthier, most of us are able to reflect and enjoy the small things in life, and many other things. It's always important to be optimistic and I don't see why a shift in reality would change that.I think many parts of society would consider him a villian, as it is obvious we are rooting for Truman, and so is the audience within the world of the film. However, many immoral critics and snobby artists would praise him for his \"art\" of showing Truman's life. Even though it is fake and all constructed, they may see it as a fascinating masterpiece of a TV show.This film is definitely worthy of discussion and quite good at telling its story.

I would venture to suggest that they are the kind of individuals who watched every episode of Dallas or Dynasty (or for my fellow Brits, Coronation Street or Eastenders). These types do not like to have their addiction mocked, which this movie does so well. REAL life is not perfect, with every little thing being organised to suit. As someone once said, \"s**t happens\". Although I may not have cast the admittedly excellent Carrey as Truman, his eventual desire to find out if \"the truth is out there\" is human nature at it's most real. Don't we all want to know the truth to our lives? Overall an original movie, and God knows, there are few enough of them. Check it out, and don't forget to engage brain before viewing!!",

            "content": "Jim Carrey portrays Truman Burbank, a man raised from birth by a corporation to star in a televised life in a town that's merely a facade, surrounded by family and friends who really only regard him as a coworker.  It's certainly not the comedy I was expecting, though it stars Jim Carrey and does contain some comedic moments.  Upon viewing, I found it to be intensely dramatic, and quite moving when all was said and done.  The film can speak on a very literal level, aptly skewering our society's obsession with voyeurism and the media's rapacious appetite for conent,  or on a spiritual level, with the gigantic set upon which Truman's \"life\" takes place becoming an allegorical Eden.  While it makes some remarks about what could be considered rather dark characteristics of the modern media's role in society, the film itself is far from dark, and in fact contains a very uplifting message in the end. Jim Carrey turns in an excellent dramatic performance as his character slowly comes to realize that the things happening in his life are sometimes quite odd and surreal.  Ed Harris is good as well as the producer who watches the events in the manufactured town from on high (another obvious spiritual metaphor).  All of the main characters, in fact, do a very good job of switching between Truman's acquaintances and actors simply moving on and off of a set, turning off and on their apparent feelings for the main character.  My favorite scenes were the ones in which Truman appears at his most human, doing something outside of the producer's tightly scripted goings on around the small town. Even if you ignore all of the messages and just take the film as a simple narrative of the events in a man's life, it is paced and filmed well enough that it will probably entertain most people.  And while I've read a few reviews that speak poorly of the ending, I thought it was perfect considering the central theme of the movie.  I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "I loved the concept of the movie.  The idea of a reality show based on one man's life and following each and every of his moves was brilliant, especially when you consider how millions of viewers are attracted to today's \"reality\" programs, such as \"Survivor\".  I believe this movie alone may have paved the way for some of today's shows and were inspired by real-life shows that preceded the film, most notably MTV's \"The Real World\". When it's done properly, you get a movie which centers around a man who begins to question what is real in life and what's not as the world that he is raised in begins to unravel.  Two major problems, however, plagued what could have been an instant classic.The first is the lifeless reactions of the viewers.  To me, the film portrays the viewers mostly as people who sacrifice their own lives to watch someone else's.  Now I know this is true in the lives of millions, but even for a phenomenon like \"The Truman Show\", a show will also have millions of critics, although not as many as there are supporters.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I saw there was only one standout skeptic who understood the whole thing, and there were many more who shared the same views but were not seen or heard at all.The second and the most unforgivable error was the ending, which I felt was an anti-climatic conclusion to a movie that built up a great deal of drama before it.  The ending was terribly written and did not have much depth or thought into it, and its closure was much more predictable than it should've been.  I'm not asking for much;  I just wanted a final conflict featuring the best and worst of both sides, which I felt didn't happen.All in all, a 7 rating in my opinion may be a bit sympathetic, but I felt they did everything else so well, only that it deserved better.  It featured Jim Carrey expanding his talent and playing his role almost to a tee, backed by a strong supporting cast, and featured a good plot outline and great scenery.  I would still recommend this film to anyone, but I would keep in mind the two significant flaws that kept this movie from joining the ranks of the elite.",

Truman represents all of us. He is the every man, the true-man. That may sound pretentious, but it works beautifully.

            "review_title": "Truman Show attacks media but upholds imperialism",
            "content": "The Truman Show, starring Jim Carey, satirically documents the life of Truman Burbank, a man raised from boyhood by his corporate adoptive parent in a fictitious Hollywood, continuously-televised world where actors work to convince him of the legitimacy of his life and surroundings. The film correctly exposes the artificial nature of the media, and the decadence and delusion of the Amerikan populace. But it incorrectly portrays people blindly led by the media and ignores the possibility of an objective reality. The film incorrectly boils the world down to a simple dichotomy of the creator and the created, ignoring the ways people can be bought-off by those in power and thereby dictate, or remain complacent to, the actions of the oppressor.The Truman Show has been running 24 hours a day, for Truman's entire life (30 years), and has no separate commercials. Instead, product advertisements are included as part of Truman's interactions with people. Truman senses the artificiality of his human interactions (why do the people walking down his street come around and around again if he doesn't move?) and begins to rebel against his life by attempting to escape and committing violent attacks. In order to prevent such incidents, the \"creator\" of the TV show writes experiences into the script that would prevent Truman's escape, like making Truman fear oceans by staging his father's death at sea and then having actors continuously blame him for the father's death. This method of psychological warfare is accurate as far as how imperialists have worked to suppress the oppressed desire for revolt. The oppressor takes away the land and resources of the oppressed and justifies it with religious or biodeterminist examples of racial superiority. In both cases, material interests are the principal motivation for oppression. However much Truman's life is artificial and alienating, it is not at all materially comparable to the lives of the international proletariat. His meaningless life is nevertheless free of violence and provides all the necessities and commodities of a bourgeois existence -- when his \"wife\" flips out and quits the show, the producers even provide a new love interest to improve ratings. Yet, loosely interpreted, the film tries to make Truman's life a parable on the emptiness of Amerikan life as subject to media hype, and ultimately the constructions of the capitalist class. While Amerikan in the movie do little more then stare at the Truman Show, they also rejoice when he finally escapes the set.Every time Truman questions his white picket fenced, paper-pushing Amerikan lifestyle, an actor comes along to tell him to stop chasing stars and accept his lot in life. Most Amerikans have unproductive and meaningless jobs, too, but the film fails to question why few viewers questioned the psychological torture that Truman experienced. Instead, like real Amerika, the characters used their sympathy for the oppressed (Truman) to feel better about the meaningless, but materially rewarding lives and jobs they have.In the same way, very few Amerikans have or do question the information that the media feeds them. When the media says \"terrorist\" or \"military target,\" it doesn't matter to most in the Amerikan populace if either one is fighting for national freedom against imperialism or the other is composed of unarmed civilians. The fact is that imperialist actions and media have served the material interests of bought-off Amerika. For there to be successful propaganda, there needs to be a populace willing to accept the message. MIM doesn't buy into the idea that people are stupid pawns of the \"big guys.\" People have the ability to make everyday decisions regarding the oppression of themselves and others. Available to all is the choice to work to overthrow imperialism, but that choice is a lot less attractive to decadent Amerika. In the end, Truman chooses the uncertainty of the violent and deceptive \"real world\" over a continued existence within the equally deceptive but safe life on the Truman Show. The decision is presented as the ultimate answer to alienation. Individual choice to subjectively define reality is framed as the greatest subversion to the controlled interactions in Amerikan society. Although individual ability to experience life without the fear of repression is a good ideal for the future, this model for ending oppression is not in the interests of the international proletariat. Instead it pretends that each individual can escape from group power relations that exist innately within an unequal world. MIM says that Amerikans wishing to end oppression for good have to commit class, nation and gender suicide in order to unite with the international proletariat against oppression. Escaping within the myth of supreme individuality only ignores the fact that people benefit and are oppressed as groups.The Truman Show brings the role of the media to light, but insists on upholding imperialist ideals, especially the one that says most people are basically stupid and weak -- though they like individual heroes who stand up for themselves without challenging the system. But the film, like most of Hollywood, is not attacking, or even mentioning, the destructive forces of U$ imperialism. The only lip-service given to progressive organizing is when the \"Free Truman Movement\" is said to be rallying against Truman's oppression (and that's a single-issue movement around liberating one person...).Fighting imperialist media is about creating an independent media aimed at fighting the principle oppressive force in the world, U$ imperialism. Individual stories can be inspirational, but if we made the movie, it would have also featured a real revolutionary movement against the imperialist power structure and its media, not just the noble story of one man who decides not to play along anymore.",

However, his life is technically fake, falsely created and showcased on international TV. His wife, Meryl, and acquaintances, Marlon, are all actors and it's all for himself. You're watching The Truman Show, a first hand experience of extreme reality TV. On air and unaware.Jim Carrey (The Cable Guy, Ace Ventura) acts in an extraordinary, straight role as the unsuspecting Truman and, surprisingly, gives us a commonsensical and elegant performance. The bigoted view of Carrey is not a respected view, but The Truman Show hosts the verification that Carrey in actual fact can act without throwing himself around the set. I couldn't possibly see another actor playing Truman by any means. Jim Carrey has the enthusiasm of a child and something which on no account lets you disregard him, corresponding Truman.Ed Harris' amazing feat as Christof completes the movie's stratagem. Harris has an imperative role as the originator of Truman's world and the administrator of the show. Christof, who theoretically plays God, directs the Truman Show and creates story lines. As this God figure he guides Truman through a false life, introducing fresh citizens and unscrambling predicaments as a quantity of plots go wrong. Christof's control room is an impressive element of the movie, as you see hundreds of monitors concerning various cameras, a large screen overlooking the entire room and even computers which manage the habitat's weather and have power over daylight.The motion picture's plot is an, appreciatively, clear plot. The viewer watches The Truman Show similar to if it is a normal channel on television. concealed cameras first lead you throughout Truman's regular day as an insurance broker, stumbling across people he recognizes and being involved in subtle product placements. Yet, another day he meets his Father who, Truman believed, drowned after boating in a storm (this was a clever way to make Truman petrified of water so he can not escape from Seahaven). Unexpectedly, Truman's Father is taken away by unsystematic people and Truman is left bewildered. Feelings of a previous love-at-first-site, who broke in to the Seahaven studio, confound him more, believing she was taken to Fiji. Truman, in conclusion, decides he will getaway from Seahaven and escape, oblivious that he's in a film studio.The production begins with introducing the appealing concept of actors. Instead of opening by introducing the authentic actor's names, they are specified two names in the motion picture. for instance, Meryl, Truman's wife in the show, is named Hannah Gill in the real world. This tells us that merely Truman, who's name by opportunity can be pronounced as True-Man) is authentic in Seahaven. As well as these, a succinct interview with the show's foremost actors explains The Truman Show.The Truman Show is based on reality TV and has an analogous perception to Big Brother. Seahaven, Truman's home town (fashioned for Truman by Christof) has approximately 5000 cameras, several as minuscule as a pin head. The cameras are located where Truman can be seen perpetually. Cameras are even in the most incongruous places, like Truman's office pencil sharpener, in addition to a dog collar. George Orwell's 1984 can strongly be compared to The Truman Show, with the concept of someone being watched all the time and being trapped in one place, in Truman's case, stuck in Seahaven. The issue of voyeurism can also be concerned within The Truman Show, and if a program of such correspondence should actually be aired devoid of Truman's authorization. The Truman Show is a tremendous film for the whole family, and can be enjoyed even after the 103 minutes. Issues concerning such a product being created in our lives can be safely debated with your family. A second watch is also recommended, as many new features are unlocked after the end is revealed.",

It focuses on Truman Burbank, a man whose life is nothing but a routine. Truman then realizes that everything in his life has been the same, and the story begins to unravel from there...Peter Weir is a great director, he was able to fool the viewer in making us believe that Truman is living in a normal world and not a TV show. He was very successful in making the story evolve around Truman and make us feel the tension between the characters his camera angles were great as he sometimes uses the \"hidden\" cameras that were used in the show, I felt that was very creative.The Truman Show is written by Andrew Niccol who also wrote and directed the very successful Gattaca. He does a great job writing the film as he made the viewer know only what Truman knows and did not have any dramatic irony which I really loved, this helped the story to focus on Truman and develop around him, which made the film much more entertaining. I have to admit, when I watched the first 30 minutes of the film I was lost, I didn't understand anything, but once Truman finds out that his life is fake the viewer finds out with him and suddenly I understood everything. The character development is one of the best thing in The Truman Show, as Truman develops into something totally different than what he was in the beginning of this excellent film.The acting is of coarse amazing, as Jim Carrey does his best ever acting in this film, seeing him happy, sad, angry and dramatic Carrey truly proved himself to be an excellent actor.Overall the Truman Show is an excellent and unique film, it is a must see!!",

I fully agree with the people who feel it has a strong script, superb art direction, beautiful music, very interesting ideas in the plot, extreme care in the details,... and, yes, Jim Carrey does a great performance, as well as all the actors.However, it suffers a sad weak point: I feel that the allegory of God through Christof (Ed Harris) -an allegory built not from the character name but from some events and scenes in the movie-, is very inappropriate. It's out of context, it happens just as a gag. It would be right if the movie portrayed Christof as someone who believes to be a god (which he does)... however, the movie does an effort going an step beyond, using some typical Christian-like imagery to establish the allegoric parallelism, looking like a God's caricature rather than Christof's.The Truman Show is a great movie. One of the best made movies I've seen in the last decade, despite its inappropriate allegories.I voted it 7/10.",

However, what soon comes to follow as a shock for Truman is that most of his life is a set-up and he is the star of a reality t.v. show. Truman's suspicions starts as a plethora of deplorable actions from the crew occur; from common mess-ups to breaks in character. He soon realizes that this is not the life he wants to lead and that there's something more than SeaHaven: the truth. One of the more interesting aspects of the movie is the fact that it is actually a very satirical piece. The film calls to notice media manipulation, it inflates the concept and uses a blame by praise to scrutinize the issue. If you do watch this I'd personally suggest actually looking into and interpreting the deeper meaning rather than just watching the movie without a thought. If you are more into Carrey's funnier movies only manufactured for laughs then I wouldn't suggest this in consideration of the fact that it hits closer to sci-fi, drama and is a lot more than just a comedy. All in all it is an interesting movie and definitely one of Carrey's better works.",

But when I thought about it more, I realised that my disappointment regarding the first half was due to what I knew already. A total stranger to the film will see the first half, be confused rather than impatient, and then marvel at the unravelling in the second half, rather than say 'yeah, and this should have come earlier'. All in all, a very good attempt to cover an ingenious topic, which is so complex most producers would probably shirk away from it. A final word: Jim Carrey is absolutely superb. 8.5 out of 10.",

From the seemingly clich\u00e9 lifestyle Truman lives, with friendly neighbors, a steady job, and even the typical adult look with his suit and briefcase, Truman lives the life that the average American in the 80s would want to have, and there is nothing wrong with his life at all. But is his life really perfect? Since meeting his first love, nothing in his life has seemed to be quite the same, and he wants to know why. This movie is a perfectly executed film about how the perfect life is unachievable, but his life may not be as great as everyone seems to think.The film was very well done. A few of the things that the movie did well were the way that it gave the main character, Truman, personality with almost everything he did, whether it be his personality quirks or the very catchy things he says, almost every part of Truman is extremely memorable. All of the characters meshed well, and had very good acting to go along with it. Despite being a funny twist on a problem that society faces, being the media and the issues with it, you do not really find yourself laughing at this movie. It takes a tone that really drags you into the thought processes and feelings of Truman using dark humor which is hard to catch onto. Going with the actual movie and its plot, many small things fit the movie perfectly to add to the overall experience, such as the soundtrack, and make the movie really great. The greatest part of the film is one that you will really feel upon seeing it, and it is the ending (no spoilers). It was perfectly executed and left a huge lasting impression on me after seeing the film, wishing that the movie was not yet over. Overall, the movie was well done, with a genius way of presenting a satire. If you would like a great movie that will require some thinking to really get involved in, this is the movie for you.",

He took what could have been a strange, goofy movie, and turned it into an almost religious experience. He also chose to not tell us what happens after Truman leaves the studio. A wise decision, as some would be tempted to show what happens next. But an intelligent artist knows you should always leave the auidence wanting more. And that is what he has done, yet it is still satisfying. Jim Carrey's performance is excellent. He's funny, but he plays Truman as a tortured soul, and because of the depth of his performance, you can't help but feel tremendous pity for Truman. You almost feel proud when he reaches the edge of his world. Philip Glass and Burkhard Dallwitx both worked on the score, and both composers worked perfectly. Instead of using one composer for the film, using one theme, Weir \"stole\" certain bits because they fit his movie so perfectly. When Truman falls in love with a beautiful woman, and tries to talk to her, a piece by Chopin palys. A composer hired to write music for the movie wouldn't have been as good for that specific scene. Dallwitz's score was almost sparse, but it perfectly fit the mood of the story. It was manipulative. This whole movie is. You'll wonder if THEY want you to like the movie. There wasn't a single element that didn't work perfectly. this movie lacked violence, sex, foul language, and all the other filth that movies have today. That's what sets it apart from others, to me. Pleasantville is often compared to the Truman Show, but only because they both deal with TV as subject matter. In fact, these movies are radically different. The Truman Show is an innocent movie with a darker, more ominous undertone to it, that has a message to it. It's funny, touching, and thought provoking. Pleasantville is about teenagers who fornicate. It's full of smut, and at its core, there's nothing but filth and a shallow story that seriously strains credibility.

In The Truman Show, Truman Burbank (Carrey), the first person to be born on TV is the unsuspecting host of the television show named, simply, \"The Truman Show\" which has sparked \"Trumania\" in the nation.  Truman goes unsuspecting of his certain-to-be-trapped doom in the TV show.  But one day, while heading to work, an object falls from the sky.  He listens to the radio, suspecting the odd, but the DJ's cover it up saying an airliner dropping parts.  Thinking nothing of it, Truman goes on, continuing his life in his little town, while the day, night, weather patterns, and even Truman's life is controlled by one man, Christoff (Harris) AKA, The Creator.  His pleasant life is disrupted, though, after odd things happen, his dead father comes back, a man Truman's never met before knows his name, an elevator has no back to it, etc.  He slowly catches on that his life is not what it seems to be.  With a fabulous Screenplay written by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca) this turns out to be one of those films where after you see it, you come out feeling good and thinking.  What if your world is like that?  Is your world like that?  This movie is definitely Oscar bound, a sure fire nomination for Carrey in his second serious role, his first being in the fabulous made-for-TV-movie Doing Time on Maple Drive.

Jim Carrey and Ed Harris shine as the star of the TV show and the creator of the show respectively; both worthy of Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor Oscars without a doubt. The sheer originality of the film makes it stand out from the rest as one of the greatest films ever made. We find ourselves drawn towards Truman and his life and are all the time longing for the eventual climax of the film to occur. This climatic part of the film is surprisingly moving and makes you realise what a truly great film you are watching. It's one you will not stop talking about afterwards with the people you saw it with - the sign of a great film. No one has an excuse of not seeing it - it makes you think, question yourselves and your surroundings and marvel at its concept.",

            "content": "In an age in motion pictures where heists, explosions, action set pieces, love stories and comic book adaptations dominate the silver screen, it's remarkable to come across a picture as fresh, as original, and as all-together fascinating as The Truman Show, director Peter Weir's part drama, part comedy, part social commentary on the nature of television and one's right to privacy and a normal life.Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is an ordinary man, good natured and kind to all, who lives a sweet life of bliss in Seahaven where he works for an insurance company. He has a nice place, good neighbours, and a loving wife (Laura Linney), but what he doesn't have is any knowledge that everybody he's ever known is an actor, that those he doesn't know are extras and that Seahaven is a concealed dome: a giant stage in Los Angeles. He has no idea and that every second of every day of his life has been recorded by over 5,000 carefully placed cameras and broadcast to the entire world. He's the star of the Truman Show, the first unwanted child legally adopted by a corporation. When a figure from his traumatic past revisits him on the streets of Seahaven, Truman begins to notice a series of strange occurrences that offer clues of his actual existence. I suppose it's an inevitability that Truman will eventually discover the truth, it's not the film's best kept secret, but the way in which it all occurs to him is certainly more than half the fun.In all his films, Jim Carrey has never put in a performance so composed and articulate as he does in The Truman Show \u0096 possessing just the right amounts of humour and innocence necessary for Truman Burbank. In some ways, he's even funnier than he can be with any number of the over-the-top faces he has in his comedic arsenal. Ed Harris, as the show's creator and director Christof, has a small role but delivers well, and the scene where he and Truman finally speak like man and God is terrific.There's nothing flashy in the production of Weir's documentary-style approach to The Truman Show, bar a few well-composed shots from various hidden cameras in Seahaven. What he achieves is effective, though, in the way he proposes that what society can be so engrossed in \u0096 of all things \u0096 is an ordinary man living an ordinary life, that we are willing to accept the complete sacrifice, even if not in a literal sense, of a man's entire life for the sake of entertainment. It's what makes The Truman Show ultimately so interesting for the audience, who watch it as beings even higher than Christof. It's so captivating that I felt a little dissatisfied at the end of the picture, having wanted more of Truman, more of behind- the-scenes, more of the same monotony. If it weren't for the story feeling a little too rushed before it was all over, The Truman Show could have been even more deep, felt, and enjoyable than it was, but that being said, it is an excellent and highly original motion picture.",

With a great and somewhat quite fantastical premise, there was always the chance the film would not be delivered to its full potential. But credit to Weir, he has constructed one the standout american films of the nineties; One which deserves more recognition than it already recieves from within those stuck-up critical circles. The film is not the most in depth around by measure of symbolism and other such what nots, but this is preferred since it is thankfully devoid of the sort of seriousness and pretension that these elitist critics often hold in such high regard. Films shouldn't have to be Bergman or Fellini, to be considered great. Greatness comes in other forms, not just in charting human nature etc. (although its certainly essential to have a wide variety, as with all things in life). Similarities to Hitchcock then, in that its glorious entertainment fused with subtle humour and intelligence, and brought into fruition with great aplomb. This is a film which will linger in your mind long after you leave the theatre. Carrey's performance is great. Famously billed as his first great serious performance. I was not too convinced on first viewing, since he plays it a bit tongue in cheek at times. But on further viewings his performance, and that of the cast is now recognised by this individual, as extremely understated in its brilliance - complementing the tone of the film perfectly, as it elicits subtle laughs as well as more touching moments of poignancy (complemented by a breathtaking musical score).\nTruman is certainly one of the most likeably characters since Mr George Bailey himself and that in itself is a feat achieved. By the dramatically moving and nailbaiting denouement, you too will be cheering Truman on. Plus he gets the girl.RECOMMENDED WITH EXTREME CONVICTION.",

The connotative language throughout the deeper parts was absolutely moving. It made the watcher think about what it would be like for them if they were in that situation and feel horrible for Truman. The idea of media control is still in today's society. We are starting to see some debate over the way the media manipulates public opinion. It reflected perfectly how amoral and invasive our culture industry is becoming. At the time the movie was produced the world was just beginning to see reality television and today it's everywhere and has progressed so much from even the movie. It in under the assumption of being another hilarious Jim Carrey comedy but turned out to be a thought-provoking and rewarding film that it is. The inflation of the idea of the power abuse of the media was big. The morals and the point of the film wasn't overwhelmingly beaten into you.

            "content": "The Truman Show is a satirical film that represents the craze of \"reality\" television and the media's manipulation of society. Though the film was made over 18 years ago, it is still very relevant today. In a giant domed community, Truman Burbank is living a perfect life that revolves around him. There are cameras everywhere and everyone, including his loved ones, are actors. The only person who doesn't know his life is a television show is Truman. In our current society we are heavily influenced by media. Throughout the film you can draw many connections to the media's influence on our lives. The media influences what we believe and what we do with our lives. Perhaps we are all being controlled under a figurative dome which is being held up by the media. The Truman Show also targets \"reality\" television. As reality television continues to grow in popularity, (such as Keeping up with the Kardashians, The Real Housewives, Duck Dynasty, Jersey Shore) the movie attacks the connotation of \"reality\" in these shows. We believe that life can really be like what we see in television, even though life is far from what goes on in reality television.While I was young I had liked to think about the concept of what if my life was a television show. This made The Truman Show extremely enjoyable as it brought back those memories and truly showed this concept in action. The movie contains great humor along with a perfect example of dramatic irony, being that Truman is the only person that doesn't know his life is a reality TV show. Overall, the movie is very enjoyable as it has a dramatic plot full of humor and entertainment. However, this movie is far different than others as it requires far more thought about how society is being portrayed in the film.",

As the story progresses the satire of the story becomes obvious. The satire of the Truman Show is the amount of manipulation that the media goes through in order to produce something for their audiences. The producers built an entire town for Truman, ruined lives, and psychologically scarred Truman with the \"death\" of his father. Another interesting point concerning the Truman Show is the way that nothing is truly fake, it's just manipulated. Most of the characters had genuine emotions concerning Truman, but they were fed their lines as to manipulate the scenes in the way that the producers wanted for it to go. The Truman Show also brings up the private vs. public life argument. Celebrities are often struggle long and hard for a private life. This causes damage to relationships for those celebrities. The Truman Show illustrates that with the fact that the television show is 24/7. Truman is watched while sleeping, while brushing his teeth, and while they do pan-away during restroom scenes we hope, one of the goals that the producers have is the first ever live conception. The Truman Show has many different satires targeting a wide range of topics surrounding the spectrum of media influence.",

Let's agree before i begin that Jim Carry himself is one of its kind, he is the king of Comedy of all time, but this film isn't comedy despite some plot here and there. Yet Jim Carry was magnificent as always, just fail to disappoint.No Spoiler but the beginning of the movie is too boring, and it meant to be, it will take you till half the time if you haven't watched the trailer before to understand what's going on. When you do you actually be part of the show without even knowing it. They say in drama the biggest thing is to break the fourth wall. Well i saw the fourth wall with my own eyes thanks to this movie.I gave it 9/10 although it actually deserve 11/10, the reason however was in the first word of my title review \"Terrific\" , this word has two meaning and the movie fulfil both, The positive way i already tried to explain, however the negative one here is the fact this movie makes you think, like force you to think even if you are in solidarity with yourself and \"reality\", that's the reason i watch the Comedy Jim carry not the Drama one or anyone else in that matter. Now as i am writing this review it feels like this movie is like a Dark hole, once you there it pulls you with some kind of force to watch it.I am actually shocked.

I'm grateful for that, but when I found myself asking why it hadn't grabbed me as powerfully as some of Weir's other films, I realized that he hadn't really made me CARE what happened to Truman - I could see the horror of the idea, but I felt no real emotional link to the hero. It's significant that IMDb categorizes the film as \"Drama/Romance\". Romance? That side of the film (= his emotional life) flopped completely, perhaps because the real climax of the film is the revelation of Christof's up-in-space studio: the focus of the film switches totally  to the Evil Film-maker and we succumb to the glitter of high-tech film-making, even if we're supposed to be as frightened as we once were by Big Brother. Why were we not shown the full impact of the reunion with his \"father\"? (What on earth would they have said to each other? What pain/joy would Truman have known?) And why are we not shown the wife walking out? (We're told that it happened. What pain must that have caused!) This sort of gap left the protagonist too one-dimensional - which is a great pity, because the parable is a powerful one, worthy of our full involvement.Was the casting of  Jim Carey responsible? Much as I like him, he seemed far too happy and 'normal' for a product of such an upbringing. There could be no existential angst in such a chirpy grinner (though he did try). Would someone with the permanently perplexed expression of a Harrison Ford have fitted better? Interesting, because then it would have been heavier, less amusing. Amusing? Was it a comedy, then? Perhaps there's a genre-confusion here, too! Comedy/Drama/Romance?  It was  really a Sci-fi Parable that would have been more effective if it had been pitched somewhat higher.

Carrey's great performance as Truman, a man predestined to be an eternal innocent and denied the full knowledge of how his circumstances came to be, makes this film. In spite of an over-the-top 'Twilight Zone' style plot, this film has more to say about the 'human condition' (and is far superior) than 'Good Will Hunting' which aspires to the loftier heights of 'realism'.The cruel director, played by Ed Harris, is not a million miles away from the so-called 'fly-on-the-wall' documentary directors, who manipulate real people and pepper our screens with tedious, victim based documentaries which claim to be great social insights. Carrey's portrayal of the innocent Truman has great pathos and a touching quality. In being denied the truth about his real existence, Truman is unknowingly imprisoned in a childlike existence that he has never had the opportunity to shape for himself.Carrey's brilliant performance wins the audiences' sympathy when he finds out the reality of his 'constructed' existence and tries to break free from this cruel manipulation and tyranny. What makes this film stand out today is that it is one of the few films of recent times, based around the theme of personal liberty. When there is so much false theorising in the real world about what constitutes 'liberty' and we are being told that fewer liberties is a new consequence of fighting a 'war for civilisation', it is refreshing to watch a film that is funny, entertaining and wholly sympathetic to the idea of personal freedom.",

The show evoked fear and made me feel sad, giving me the impression that it is Juvenalian satire. The show had great examples of purpose, acceptance of the status quo, and morality. First, the purpose of the show was to make the audience reconsider their opinions on capitalism, and our current society. Watching a large company sell someone's life makes one relate to their emotions. This gives the impression of a deep impact on the watcher's viewpoint, and helps them understand the intended impact. The viewer finds a relationship to Truman, and begin to root for him while watching the show. This is relating to the humans ethos, and deflating the worth of human life. Second, the show has a deeper message about humans as a race. Generally, humans accept what they know, and live with the status quo. The whole movie, all Truman knows is the life that he has been shown. He takes over 30 years to actually start reaching out, and desiring to find new things. The system dampered his desires to travel and adventure, but he eventually wanted to overcome. This tells us that we need to try and go beyond what we accept. The directed target seems to big businesses and media, yet seems to give direction to the audience as a whole, no matter if they are the target. Last, the show makes you question the morality of large businesses. As you watch all of the satirical elements, and mainly the inflation of a desire for success, the viewer begins to question what limit we should hold to capitalism. Where should morality be weighed against a human desire to win? The show was highly entertaining, and with the funny moments such as product placement, and ironic/ evident moments of control, the show always keeps the viewer interested.",

Throughout the movie he begins picking up on clues like actors telling him \"it's a TV show\", the same actors walking around the block over and over again for no reason, and the fact that somehow, everyone seems to know what he's doing, where he's going, and stops him whenever Truman does something that's out of his \"character\". I personally thought that The Truman Show was a fantastic movie, for many reasons. I find it interesting that the movie is so unlike any other movie I've seen, for the movie itself almost appears to be The Truman Show. While it messes with your mind a little, it really makes you think about what true reality is. I also liked the overall theme of the movie, that we accept the reality that is given to us; it's an interesting concept that could be applied to our lives today, making it a great movie and theme for people even today.Not only did I like the movie for those reasons, but The Truman Show is also an excellent example of satirical techniques and devices. It's easy to identify dramatic irony in the beginning, as the audience knows that Truman is in a TV show while he does not. It's also ironic that the character Truman seems to have a sense of freedom, although he couldn't be more confined. The audience can also see deflation and inflation, two very important satire devices. Deflation is apparent through the demoralizing of human life in comparison to corporate success, and inflation is obvious through the exaggerated use of props (in once scene a forest fire is instantaneous, in the next there's a sudden meltdown at a nuclear plant, showing that the producers will do literally anything to stop Truman from leaving the island). I would highly suggest this movie for anyone that wants a fun and interesting movie to watch, or examples of satirical techniques in media. The Truman Show is, in my opinion, a great movie for anyone to watch, especially those who feel \"trapped in the world they're presented with\".",

A man fighting to reclaim his own freedom from those unseen forces keeping him captive. I've never got tired of this movie, the performances, the humour, the social engineering. The overall themes seem to ring true for all of us at one point in our lives or another. Watching this movie I felt myself identifying with Truman, and I suspect most people do, because he too works and lives a predictable lifestyle that he yearns to get away from and have an adventure. Ed Harris' performance is astounding. I felt for him just as much as I did for Truman, and I think that's the beauty of this picture. Knowing that we're seeing all sides to the story and not just one perspective is unusual for a movie that typically revolves around one main character. Without question I give this movie five stars. The soundtrack is good too.",

Although the government-is-watching-you-scare is now less than it used to be, our lives are becoming more and more public. Not in the least because of this great Internet. But mainly because media is bringing everyone much closer to each other and giving us the opportunity to know much more than before; Making information available on every subject possible. What then, can assure us that eventually our lives will NOT be like Truman's? One big show, for everyone to see. And fake from the bottom up.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a great satirical piece. Staged within a giant dome, Truman lives his life alongside actors, and he is the only one that doesn't know he is star. During the video, he begins to figure out that his life is a lie. He ends up escaping in a boat, overcoming his fears, to find freedom. The Truman Show is a representation of the control media has over our lives. Wherever we go, we are surrounded by it. In the show, there are a couple of occurrences in which people try to alert Truman of the control the media has over him. In response, the character is removed and the media tries to destroy their credibility. Later on, Truman is able to avoid the cameras by covering some of the cameras and pretending to sleep creating a gateway to escape. The directors of the Truman Show (the movie, not the show) are able to create some sense of freedom, showing how escaping the prying eyes of the public and media allowed him to have his own liberties and control his life. Near the end of the movie, as Truman is trying to escape, Christof, the director with a God complex, tries to scare Truman into going back to the city and living a \"normal\" life. Instead, he chooses to die rather than living as a slave and continues on his path (but he survives). In one of his final lines, Truman says, \"You never had a camera in my head,\" in response to Christof stating that he knew Truman better than he did himself. The accuracy of how the media feels it is in control was brought to mind by the techniques used by the directors of the movie. Overall, the Truman Show is a great satirical piece, helping to bring its audience into the realization of the effect and control the media has over them.",

She tells him the truth that everything is fake and everyone is pretending. She is then whisked away by her \"dad.\" Her \"dad\" then mentions that they are moving to Fiji. Flash forward a few years and Truman is out of high school and questioning everything around him. He then suddenly wants to go to FIji and find this girl. When Truman tries to leave there is always something that stops him from going anywhere. This is of course where the producers of the show come into play and the question of whether the show is treating Truman like a human being. One second it is that all the flights are booked, the next is the traffic, and then there is a hazardous waste spillage on the road out of town and he is tackled and subdued back into his own personal house. The directors sit there and feed lines to all of the people around the place to make sure that Truman never goes anywhere. Bringing his father back from the dead. Whenever Truman decided that he really wanted to leave they cut the stream for the first time ever and made it so that no one would know what is going on behind the scenes. He was so determined to leave at the end of the story they have to almost kill him to keep him in the dome. In the end Truman is confronted by the director of this whole story and he is told the truth. He has a very important choice to make will he stay in the dome and continue entertaining or will he leave.",

Stever Spielberg will grab it for the much over-hyped 'Saving Private Ryan')Technical stuff: Jim Carrey is a perfect Truman Burbank. Others could have played him just as well, but Jim Carrey was spectacular, and should not be penalised for not conforming to the roles the public wants him in.Ed Harris is unbelievable as Christof and deserves an Oscar Nomination.The story is scarily possible. All that's needed is that the government legalise a corporation adopting a child. From there, very, very few laws would be broken. The only possible one I can see is Illegal Arrest. We can assume they managed to beat that one once early on, and from then on simply refered to the precedent. Otherwise, all the technology exists. And if the ratings are as good as the film claims, it'd probably be profitable.Now the meaty stuff.This film, at its core, is not about human mentality, or about the morality of captive lives. It is about Predestination. Truman is the Job or Peter figure of the story, a 'true man' among a sea of false men. Christof, (whose name clearly derives from Christ) is a powerful God figure, deliberately written as on a God kick. And why not? This is his world, with his perfect script in action. To him, when Truman's old 'father' tries to come back into the show, it's not just a rebellion. It's sin.The question, ultimately asked, is this: \"If you know the way your life will progress, and can't change it, but it is a happy path, will you accept it, or attempt to take the reins of your life back into your hands?\"Truman Burbank is told, ever so subtly, 'Shut up, and we'll get you the best life you could ever have.' When his mariage breaks down, a new wife is conveniently found, because he's behaving to plan. When he misbehaves, he's quietly shown back to his house.And yet he keeps persisting, now certain that something lies beyond his life, and that somehow, that something else is better. The final confrontation, deliberately cast with biblical overtones, emphasises this point. And when Truman passes even this test, with his life in the balance, Christof talks to Truman with infitite pride and love. This is his son.And, as we learn, a prodigal son.",

The Truman Show is a horatian satire because it addresses a group of people as a whole, and it was humorous. Many uses of the language of satire was found within this film. The use of inflation overstated how reality show effects society. Their corporation adopted Truman and placed him into a fake society. Almost how reality TV stars are basically living in fake societies. The use of situational irony showed how everyone watching the Truman show knew that Truman was on a show, but he didn't. The use of deflation understated how commercialism is so ingrained into our society. They made it seem like it was no big deal when advertising things in front of Truman. The Truman show has a great cast and a great plot, but I feel that it was more of a science fiction/drama/comedy movie before a satire. I understand the undertones of the satire addressing reality TV, but I think that the movie wasn't really to make you think about reality TV in today's society, but the idea of reality TV in the future.",

We have elements of humour, satire and quite a few jabs at present day media practices, i.e. turning \u0091ordinary' people into celebrities, through the medium of television, evident in British shows such as Airport and Hotel.This is done on a much grander scale though, with all Truman's life being turned into a television show. What interests me most about this film is the way in which the 5000+ cameras are represented on screen that film Truman on a day-to-day basis, and how products are plugged \u0091on air'.In my opinion, ranking up alongside \u0091Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' as one of best films of 1998, The Truman Show will soon become regarded as a modern classic.",

I couldn't believe how fast my adrenaline was pumping or how hard my heart was beating. This obviously isn't a James Bond flick or a movie with Mel Gibson. But this isn't Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. When you begin to watch this movie, forget everything you know about Jim Carrey. Why? Because you will meet a different actor, a totally different man. In my opinion, the movie was robbed of an Oscar nomination, Jim Carrey was robbed of a Best Actor nomination, and he absolutely deserved the Golden Globe he received a few months back.If you don't believe anything I've said, believe this: Please don't avoid watching this movie because of what someone else said. Don't avoid this movie because of Jim Carrey. Watch this movie. If you don't, you'll be missing out on one of the best movies of 1998, if not of all time. And that's what I think.",

So I endured a second viewing.  The third time was another very long story that I won't even get into.  The 5 times I've seen this movie I enjoyed it every time.  Jim Carey really is an actor!  I was amazed at how unike the story was.  No story I had ever seen had come up with an original plot idea like this one.  Laura Linney was great as Jim's \"Wife.\"  Ed Harris also did well as an insane creator of The Truman Show.  This movie all together had something.  It had a sort of \"feel-good\" yet \"sad\" yet sometimes \"funny\" attitude.  The film breathed ideas.  Could a person really live in a place like this.  The movie demonstrated how corrupt network executives could be.  Ed Harris almost tried to kill Carey.  Overall I think this movie is definetly going to be a classic.8/10",

In fact, it is a sick and violating feeling knowing that they government have been torturing and brainwashing you for decades and have been kind enough to film everything and put it out there for the whole world to see turning you entire life into a sick joke. I have very mixed feelings. This is a once in a generation movie. You only get movies this profound and interesting once every 10 years if you are lucky. So I have to like and respect it for that. It is also an amazing performance by Jim Carrey, he is a great actor who has made many great movies, but I think this is his best movie by far. The visual style is interesting and at certain points the music punches me right in the heart and makes me want to cry until I die. It is just sick the way they traumatise and manipulate a person all for the sick entertainment of the unwashed masses. There is nothing that could make up for the hell that I have been through, but one thing I do find almost comforting is knowing that the same psychopaths who have been destroying my life and taking pleasure in my suffering are being brainwashed and manipulated just as much as I have been, they just don't realise that yet. Natasha is mouth watering. I know I'm a sexual creep, but in my defence the woman is gorgeous. I want to break free. Like Truman I want to escape this cell (and hell) they have created for me, and I have to believe some of you believe that too.

Peter Weir=Dead Poet Society his only good film the rest forgettable Jim Carey=first saw him in Once Bitten - he played the character straight, he can act, it's just that this performance is not worthy of any award. Ed Harris= I defy any of you to name one film in which this man has played anyone other than himself. He plays a character that would only be believable if this were a farce, his character is so unnaturally evil, am I suppose to believe in this film that his character is so obsessed that he is crushed when a fellow human being wants to be free. And what is with the hand gestures, I want everyone to pay attention to his hand gestures, almost homoerotic in a way, if this were done on purpose it might be funny might be fitting, it's that method acting isn't it? The woman who plays his love interest=one word-TERRIBLE her face is shot in such an annoying way it is almost unbearable to watch. PLOT: if you are going to do social satire with a moral dilemma it must be believable(i.e. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (FILM and NOVEL) 1984 (NOVEL) and NETWORK (FILM)) you cannot do a STAR WARS treatment to a supposedly serious film. For example, we are supposed to believe that a man in his early thirties has been on film for his entire life: 1. if he were born sometime in the sixties the technology simply would not be available to carry on with this charade. 2. and most importantly as bad as we are as human beings I cannot believe that any of you would allow this to happen to a person, therefore what is the point of this film? It doesn't make me think of anything other than Hollywood made a great deal of money off of us and we are starting to appreciate the sh** that they give us. So now that Stanley Kubrick has died where are we? The only thing that I can think of is that I am going to have to start making movies, I can't be any worse than these guys!!!",

That's also just good writing so kudos to Andrew Niccol.The costume design and set is very interesting. The costumes give the set of the city a vintage era, but it's the 90s obviously. Also just the set in general, imagine the set of Edward Scissorhands but not as creepy. Also, the music is fantastic. It's not original but it is an enjoyable sound for your ears.It's a movie that I finally got to see and it made me happy. Truman Show is a film that will not disappoint audiences with its great editing, music, acting, and everything else overall. Only grouch is that I wish there was a bit more to the ending.

            "content": "Directed by Paul Weir, starring Jim Carrey, Ed Harris and Laura Linney, 'The Truman Show' is a satirical comedy-drama about an insurance salesman who discovers his whole life is a television show. Released in 1998 the main character 'Truman Burbank' played by Jim Carrey is perfectly summed up in the films tag line: 'On the Air. Unaware'. Jim Carrey obviously steals the show with it being centred on him with a genuine serious role instead of his usual crude, wacky, comedy self like in 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'. Truman is an insurance salesman living a lie. Unbeknownst to Truman he is the star of the biggest television program in the world. Everybody he knows are actors. He lives in a town inside a studio with cameras everywhere. The character of Truman is easy to like as he is honest and easy to sympathize with as he is a good man. Jim Carrey suits Truman in the sense that he is versatile. In parts Truman can act a bit manic and in others he is quite serious and emotional. This plays into Jim Carrey's hands because he is, as I've said surprisingly versatile. Ed Harris has a very good performance as a supporting actor playing 'Christof' the creator of the television program 'Truman has been trapped in. The best part of Harris' portrayal of 'Christof' is that you are not sure if he wants to help 'Truman' and believes he is helping 'Truman' or if he is doing this for himself, for his ego, money and overall fame. In my opinion, the films deeper meaning is that we have to question news and we can't be trapped in this fabricated world that reality television and the idolization of celebrities like 'the Kardashians' that the media has made. In short, there's a whole other world outside of your television, laptop or phone screen. That is why I feel this film is extremely relevant today because of people being constantly on their phones. In conclusion the Truman show is an extremely thought provoking film, Jim Carrey's performance anchors the film and the deeper message of the film is relevant in today's society. Overall I give it an 8 out of 10.",

A lot of our society could still be considered the target, relating back to things such as reality television.

The same could be said for those who create video blogs, or vlogs, and videograph the best parts of their lives as if that is all of it.\nIt was almost aggravating to watch, considering how much I wanted Truman to realize the truth of his reality and speak out about it. It made me both sad and mad to watch the movie because of how it felt like a cruel joke against him to me. But, despite that, I really enjoyed the movie. The way the movie shows the reactions of those watching The Truman Show is a very good addition in my opinion.\nThe irony of the audience knowing that Truman's life is fake but him not knowing is the most essential part of the movie. Though it could have been shot entirely inside the set of Seahaven, with the audience realizing that it is a television show set along with or slightly before Truman, it would have been a far different movie than what it actually is and watches like. It is hard to say whether that lack of irony would improve the movie or not, as it is such a stark difference.",

There are countless examples of of reality TV shows that have gone horribly wrong. As well as several times where individuals in the entertainment industry have snapped from the pressure that producers, directors, and even co-stars impose on them on a daily basis. The audience however is for everyone because we as viewers can also contribute to the problem by supporting the show, and making the producers feel like they have to exploit their actors for more views and better ratings. It is interesting to see Truman's growth as a character develope in such a unique way. The Truman Show is funny, ironic, and wonderfully made, but it also continues to convey a deeper meaning that even the members of today's society can connect with.",

This man was this life because he lives in a television show, unknowingly. Almost everything about this movie is great, the amazing acting, the script and the plot. The one thing about the film that I thought could have been a little different was the ending. Even though you kind of understand that Truman and Lauren will be reunited, I would have liked it if we actually saw that. Throughout the film, as Truman starts to uncover that the truth about his life I started to think about his actually imperfect life. While some people would say they'd be happy living in this world ignorantly, imagine this. Nothing you have experienced is real, nothing, your wedding was a fabrication for a large TV audience, your wife doesn't love you, hell even your parents are actors. In this discussion I feel like it's just not fair for Truman, while he eventually escapes from the massive set that is his home, what does he actually have in the real world? At the end Christof is trying to convince Truman to stay, by saying that here he has the perfect life and is free from the horror of the real world. When Christoff says \"We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.\" I believe this is pretty true. Sometimes we wish that our reality would change, such as in these trying times, but we know that we can't do anything about it so we simply try to accept it. While people will always try to fight a reality that they dislike, most will soon simply try to accept it and move on with their lives. In every reality there is something, even if it's very small that we can take away. For example, right now I believe that we can all learn new things at home, and when it's over we'll come out better. While of course there are aspects of the real world that are not very good, it's still real. It's better than any fake life, just as Truman realizes at the very end. The film itself is just amazing, the story is something very original that had a powerful message but still remained very interesting to watch. Jim Carrey's acting is just superb, how you can feel his emotions and his weaknesses. In the film, there are some funny moments in which characters suddenly pause and literally advertise a product. This was funny, but I think it's also an analogy on how every day of our lives we are thrown with so much ads everywhere so we buy things that we don't really need. There were some unrealistic things in the movie, such as how the show would get so many viewers during the first years of Truman's life, I mean I just feel like that would be pretty boring to watch, but maybe that's just me. The other thing is that supposedly the ginormous set is built in Hollywood, but jeez that real state must have been ridiculously expensive. While I get why they did it there, it would have been more realistic if they built it somewhere other that was cheaper. Also at the very very end when the two security guards are watching the Truman Show and when they see Truman leaving, they're like, \"Well we watch something else?\" This was a pretty funny way of showing the reality, like many people try to watch so many things that they can't fully get the essence of what they watched. In Christof's eyes, he is God in this world he has created, but to everyone against the Truman Show, such as Lauren he is a villain. For the media and the people who just love the show he is someone very special though. In conclusion, I felt like this film was greatly crafted, had strong acting, an original plot and real life issues that we should all think about in some way.",

After all, he made The Cable Guy one of the worst ever movies. Little did I know that Carrey would contribute in making The Truman Show one of my all-time favorite movies!Truman Show has one of the most nuanced and subtle scripts I've come across. The story simply nails you to your seat. Directing is brilliant, thanks to master-director Peter Weir, also responsible for the stunning Dead Poets Society. Here, Weir re-creates the world in which Truman Burbanks lives and is being (involuntarily) filmed 24 hours a day. Peter Weir actually places us there, on the spot next to Truman, shares us Truman's feelings and thoughts.We laugh as he laughs, and we cry along with him. Towards the end of the film, we sense Truman's despair and hopelessness deep inside of us, even though we already know all about his situation. The reason for this is that Weir manages to make Truman represent mankind. Truman could be any one of us.The Truman Show is a movie playing on many levels at once. It has humor and drama. It concerns our need for entertainment and reveals an increasingly shameless media-industry (\"the first channel to adopt a child.\"), as well as  man's fight and struggle to break out of tediousity and distress; basically   our need for freedom.There are so many details here: the pin with the words \"how is it going to end?\", the various ways Truman is being kept at Seahaven (the preventive posters at the travel agency has to be seen to be believed)... And notice how Christof falls forward at the end, as if he had lost everything, even his own life, the very moment Truman gained his.Acting is flawless. From the \"acting actors\" - Laura Linney as Truman's wife and Noah Emmerich as his best friend Marlon - to Ed Harris as Christof, along with Christof's companions. Harris carries out a truly awesome performance, he steals every scene. And finally: Jim Carrey is magnificent as Truman   Burbanks (from the Burbanks galaxy : ) He does everything right. He is goofy when it's called for, and genuinely moving and emotional at other times. I can't think of a better actor to portray Truman's everyday life.I've seen The Truman Show six times now, and I will buy the home video cassette and put it on my shelf.

This concept, coupled with brilliant screenplay, cinematography, and acting makes The Truman Show a definite winner.Particularly notable is Jim Carrey, proving once and for all that he is not just a rubber-faced slapstick actor, but can really give a character a personality.  Ed Harris is powerful again as Christof, the creator of \"The Truman Show.\"One of the largest gripes about this movie is its ending, and those reading this who don't want to know should stop right here.There are complaints that the writers left the audience hanging, that the audience wants to know:  What happens to Truman?  What happens with his true love, what happens to Christof?  Many people call this the downfall of the effect of the movie, but I find it to be one of the truest and most provocative aspects of it.  The reason that we do not see what happens to Truman, is because we are no longer seeing the \"Truman Show.\"  When he steps out of that door, we are no longer privy to what is, after all, HIS life. Why didn't the writers write out a more fulfilling ending for Truman? Because his life ISN'T written out for him anymore.  No longer is he subject to what others feels he should do.

Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comedies I've seen lately. The point (the media and its destructive powers) is subtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don't feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals. Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING at the Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn't ribald for once. The final scene--I will not reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless. Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here. This is a thinking person's movie. If you can't see the underlying message here, of course you won't like it!",

Only Truman and his true love, Sylvia, deserve to be called human beings in this story. The actors, producers and the audience are the true puppets here. I sympathize with Truman's search for truth, but in the end I can feel only pity for him, knowing that he had to live almost an entire artificial life. Anyway, despite the uncomfortable feeling, and despite the lack of humanity of the audience, who can live only through Truman's life (this is by the way the most shocking part of the movie, which most accurately represents reality, particularly now with all those reality shows out there), I thought it was very good. The end was particularly satisfactory and well stitched. The final scene with the guards was very symbolic: Truman's true drama, even with a happy conclusion, had been planned to be just another big fiction, and ends exactly like that: just another mass-consumption show among so many. A very strong message under the skin of what, I suppose, can be seen by some insensitive souls as a superficial just-for-fun fiction.",

Everything, from sunrise-sunset to each passer-by in the Utopian town named Seahaven, is in his charge, without mentioning Truman, the leading role in this show. Since the day he was born, Truman has been taken good care of by a crop of actors and actresses and functioned as the protagonist of an international televised, 24-hour-a-day series called The Truman Show. 5,000 hidden cameras follow Truman everywhere he goes, chronicling every trivia of his growth. Unknown to him is the trick known to all.Until someday, from nowhere falls a light equipment. Later, he is soaked in his own rainstorm. When he moves, the rain moves after him. Then, through an oversight, his lost-at-sea father is rearranged into the show again, appearing like a transient in the street. Truman is puzzled by all these inconsistencies. What's worse, on his way to work one day, the radio gets adrift to report his trace in every detail due to a slip of technique. It's paradoxical to call these inconsistencies deliberate coincidences. Because that's what Christof hates but Peter Weif and Andrew Niccol expects.We have no doubt carelessness beyond control is here and there in Truman's life. It's only a matter of time before Truman to piece out the loopholes together and find out the truth. He is determined to leave the counterfeit world when he is exposed, mercilessly, to the fact that this so-called perfect life he leads is no more than a show-biz illusion where only he is true while others exit merely as walk-ons. Since all other transport doesn't serve him, he chooses sea. (In order to keep him from leaving Seahaven, he has been inculcated with a fear of water. He has expectedly developed a phobia of water since the night his father lost at sea, a catastrophe designed to frighten him.) Having survived all weird rainstorms under Christof's control, he sails cheerfully to his dream world, only to find the sky, the clouds looking so beautiful in distance are pictures in a wall and the horizon itself leads nowhere.Jim Carrey plays Truman. He is so likable an actor that you cannot refuse any film he takes part in. Most of his films are characteristic of his hilarious performances. But his role in this one is, I should say, light year away from the antics he used to do. He is quite controlled and convincing.As a sharp-witted, intriguing and offbeat piece of entertainment, the film can be dissected from different angles. And it inevitably raises some questions. To me, the end is hallucination. I admit the end is hopeful to most audience. It seems to reach to consummate when Truman opens the door in the wall and strides out. We are about to applause. Wait a second, where will he go? Into a world full of new lies, leaving former lies behind? So I'd rather have a hateful end.",

Jim Carey is not very good at the beginning of the movie because he can't play really well just a normal guy but he nails it after Truman discovers he is in a TV Show. Carey has to play this person who just discovered his whole life was scripted and is going insane and Jim Carey is very good at. It also really makes you root for Truman and you hope he can get out of this \"Matrix\".

And those are the Jim Carrey films that I love to see, because when you take away his comedic appeal, you can get a very dramatic and emotional actor. Carrey plays a man who is unaware that his entire life is a television show. He has been on the show ever since he was an infant. Despite having kept this a secret for 30 years, Truman soon begins to suspect something different about his perfect life, despite the shows clever and hilarious lengths to keep him uninterested in the world outside of him. Where does Truman want to go? Well, in a very interesting subplot, we learn that Truman wants to visit Fiji. Why? Because the girl of his dreams, (previously an extra on the show, now an activist living in the real world with an ambition to free Truman with the help of political activism) was taken away by her supposed father, who hastily replied that they were going to Fiji. Now Truman wants to go to Fiji to reunite with the love of his life, and escape his blond and boring wife. If there's one thing that holds this film together, it's the acting. Not just from Carrey, but from the supporting cast, which has an exceptionally difficult job of being a good actor when portraying a good actor, and they pull it off flawlessly. One of \"The Truman Show's\" themes is feeding into ones anxieties. It carries this off by having Truman live in a world where travel is frowned upon and made to seem to dangerous and too expensive. There's a really funny and well done scene where Truman goes mad, and attempts to drive to anywhere in America, and the show tried to retail irate by presenting Truman with controlled dilemmas like traffic, forest fires and chemical leaks. It makes me happy that I didn't see it when I was younger, because it surely would upset me. But even still, Truman still attempts to escape, giving the character a sense of courage. And that's what makes \"The Truman Show\" work. The character is great. The character is relatable. He represents a great film character. And what great film character would be complete without a great film. \"The Truman Show.\" Check it out.",

Sometimes I feel like everyone is watching me. Some days I'll continuously look over my shoulder expecting some nutball to be standing behind me waiting to slash me up with an axe.

The concept of the movie is that Truman Burbank is the character in the worlds most seen TV- show. The show is called \"The Truman Show\". Truman doesn't know that he is the main- character in the show. The creators of the show has created a mini- world for Truman to live in.Everybody Truman meets is actors. His mother, his wife and his best friend. The studio is full of cameras and they plan his whole life. They fix every error that occurs. One day, the biggest error possible occurs.

What he doesn't know is that his whole life is a T.V. show. The world around him is a T.V. set and the people he interacts with including his wife, parents and best friend are actors. From the time he was born Truman's life has been filmed 24/7 by a complicated network of thousands of tiny cameras and broadcast unedited and uncensored to the public. Truman of course suspects nothing because as the creator of the show Cristof (Ed Harris) said, \"We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented\". Now that would apply to Truman if it were not for one thing. In high school a woman that he fell in love with (Natascha McElhone) told him what was really going on. At the time he didn't understand and, as a result remained more focused on the fact that the people escorting her away told him she was moving to the Fiji Islands. Truman has ever since been obsessed with going there and when his progress is continually inhibited he begins to suspect that something is going on.The Truman Show is a very fascinating movie. It is a combination of the book 1984 and those Star Trek episodes where Commander Ryker was in a holo-deck without knowing it. The cast lying through their teeth to through Truman off reminded me of those intense, intriguing stories. It is also a very strange movie. During the first ten-twenty minutes of the movie I wondered if it was going to be any good. Stay with it and fear not. Let me assure you that this is a very good movie. Once you get past the beginning then you should be fine.In terms of acting I think the cast pulled it off fairly well. Jim Carrey was excellent overall but there were several instances, and even the better part of the beginning where I felt they cast the wrong person. Don't get me wrong, Carrey was the perfect man for the job, it's just that he could have done a little better in a few select parts. This is a movie where you will have to suspend you disbelief a little. The basic plot pretty implausible with all the human rights groups and peoples T.V. viewing habits. But that is why it is classified as Science Fiction. But in terms of the way Peter Weir pulled of the story and Jim Carrey pulled off his character so close to perfection the movie seems very plausible. I highly recommend this movie.84%",

I just could not enjoy it based on concept alone. although objectively it is good it has great cinematography and subliminal messaging i overall did not enjoy it",

This is going to be funny\u0085 Right? \tThe Truman Show stars comedic actor Jim Carey (Dumb and Dumber), who plays Truman Burbank. As a child, a huge media corporation adopted him, and the evil CEO of the corporation is Christof (Ed Harris). Christof takes Truman, and bases his life on a TV show. The show becomes very popular, and almost everyone watches it. It shows Truman sleeping, and at work, and driving his car. But there's only one problem. Truman thinks he's living a completely normal life, and he has no idea that his life is a TV show. An actor plays everyone in his life. Even his own wife is an actor. \tI did not like this movie at all, but I like to call it, `A waste of Film.' I thought this was Jim Carey's worst performance in a motion picture. I thought this movie would be funny. But, no. It definitely was not.\tFirst of all, this movie is listed as a comedy. But it is far from that. I think this movie is not funny at all. This is not at all what I call comedy. \tSecondly, I think this movie is overly dramatic. The movie has too much, `Oh no!' and, `Awwww, poor Truman.' And, the movie is just too sad.\tTruman Show director, Peter Weir really did waste film, in my opinion. He directed a movie that was already boring, and even made it even more boring. I was very excited to see the movie, but when I saw it, I was bored almost immediately. \tThere is only one thing I liked about the film. Just one! The film did have some very good acting. Jim Carey did perform very well as Truman, but clearly wasn't allowed to unleash his goofy, and extremely funny self.\tOverall, I thought this movie was just horrible. My rating for the movie is a 1.5 out of 10 stars. I really don't recommend this movie.",

I would describe it as \"a brilliant and thought-provoking film starring Jim Carrey\". Carrey is incredible in this film, delivering an Oscar-worthy performance that is both humorous and serious. The Truman Show is about a man (Truman) who was adopted by a television company and then placed in a fictional world where he grew up in front of America's eyes, unknowingly, on television. It's the story of him discovering this and breaking free. After the film's terrific conclusion, you'll question your surroundings and your life. A sorely underrated movie.10 out of 10",

One it makes a a very ambitious story seem very real and thats mostly due to the fine acting (Carrey, and Harris giving the best performances of their careers). Two, Peter Weir and his fantastic direction ables to give this film an uneasy feeling, which is why it is probably really hard to give this movie a genre. The movie succeeds on giving the right amount of comedy, drama, eeriness, and romance, and doesn't seem to over due anything. The Comedy mostly stays between Carrey and Linney who give great chemistry and seem liked the really hated each other. The Drama is not in your face but it is extremely effective as some of the scenes in this movie are the most moving scenes I have ever seen on film (The Scene when Truman meets his dad and everyone is watching, and the last 5 mins get me every time.) The Eeriness mostly stays with its Twilight Zone Plot, and this uneasy feeling of how much the media can do, ecspicially now in these times when reality T.V rains supreme. The Romance might drag the story a little but it still is a good part of the story, it still gives the classic notion that you can meet someone only for 5 mins and want to spend the rest of your life with them. All in All Truman is good to watch, I still watch it every time its on T.V. and it still effects me in way that few movies have.",

            "content": "At last The Truman Show has reached the mainland of Europe. And after all the hype I saw on IMBb reviews, I must confess that I am a little bit disappointed. True, the movie makes its depressing theme \"life imitates the media\" very clear, and I would advise every critic who mistakenly calls this a comedy, to look up that word in a dictionary and compare the result with the things he has witnessed on the screen. The view on society that is pictured in The Truman Show is very bleak indeed. Still, good drama should be believable all the way and it is here that director and scriptwiter let us down. The suggestion is that people are watching the show day in day out and never consider switching channels. Why? Of course the idea of an actor believing he is leading a normal life is appealing (to the audience), but is it entertaining as well? What happens when Truman goes to sleep, and his house is dark and silent during seven or eight hours? In fact, what happened in the first couple of years of his life, when he wasn't up to anything more substantial than crying while lying down or whatever an infant does to pass the time? It is hardly likely that viewers enjoyed the continuous sight of an infant solely for the reason that it wasn't aware of this \"immoral\" intrusion of its privacy.Another weak point in the story is the fact that the artificial nature of Seahaven becomes rapidly visible during the film while up to then the phoney aspects of life in Truman's hometown were successfully hidden. How come never before a lamp fell down from the ceiling? How come never before the local radio channel was inadvertently intruded by conversations of the film crew? How come it took Truman thirty years to discover that the elevator in the building next to his office really wasn't an elevator at all? In short, what are the odds that it takes a not too dumb guy like Truman thirty years to discover within a few days the extent of the manipulation by the film makers? The really amazing thing of the movie is that, despite all these silly loose ends in the script, the viewer is as indignant as he should be about a man being manipulated for such a long time, for no other reason than making a megalomaniac getting his kicks.",

The story unravels in a somewhat choppy manner coveting easy laughs instead of fully realizing the satirical power at its core. In fact, the comedy, specifically, the cutaways to \"show viewers\" and the interview segment with the \"creator\", is rather banal and uninspired.

From the beginning to the end we have been watching THE Truman Show, and not the movie about Truman Show (although there are bits of that as well - and I feel that this is it's only flaw). I enjoyed every line and every scene in it. The movie is full of excellent writing and directing. The way that Peter Weir doesn't want to show Truman's deepest emotions when he finally finds exit, but instead hides his face from us and let us imagine how Truman feels. Or how motive of escape to Fiji evolves in the movie: first, it's just a remote place on the Earth where Truman wants to escape; then it's a place where his love lives; and finally, it's a map of Fiji that hides Truman's escape. And so, in a way, Fiji becomes Truman's escape. Also, the amount of our identification with Truman is amassing and unseen in Hollywood movies for years. And if you haven't seen the movie and you're afraid that it's very \"serious\", i.e. boring, I can reassure you: It's not boring - it's funny and time just flys by. I would say that this movie is a MUST for everyone, especially those who think that Jim Carry cannot act (I was one of those, but I've changed my mind). P.S.

Everything he's ever known is staged. It is a touching, likable performance that is complete and true to character.Ed Harris provides fine support as Cristof, the creator of \"The Truman Show,\" opting for a low-key approach rather than a madman performance that makes him worthy of pity.Andrew Niccol (\"Gattaca\")'s screenplay is one of the most creative in a long time, which presents intriguing questions about the nature of television, privacy and how far technology should be taken.

The point is Psycho was the only film from 1960 that people really remember no one remembers that The Apartment won best picture that year, and I believe that in years to come The Truman Show will be the most remembered film of 1998. The Truman Show is a great drama that tells the story of a man whose entire life has been filmed on camera and broadcast as a 24 hour a day show of which has millions of viewers addicted.  What makes this film most memorable is the direction by Peter Weir he turns it into a film that is at times funny but then quickly becomes sad because you feel Truman deserves an uncontrolled environment.  The cast is perfect, Noah Emmerich plays Truman's seemingly best friend who is a slave to whatever the shows creator tells him to do to keep Truman from thinking of traveling.  Laura Linney (who is finally beginning to get the attention she deserves) plays Truman's wife who tries to control Truman by telling him of his family obligation.  Ed Harris portrays Christof the creator of the show , he cares for Truman but honestly believes that Truman will be much happier in his world than in the actual world, Ed Harris' portrayal of the controling Christof is brilliant originally the producers of the Truman Show wanted Dennis Hopper as Christof but Hopper turned it down, I think Harris is a much greater actor and gives Christof more of a caring side.  Finally their is Jim Carrey (whose fantastic acting abilities will probably be overlooked for years because he is stil thought of as a comedian only) he plays Truman as he goes through the difficult days of understanding who he really is to everybody and that his world actually revolves around him. The Truman show will be remembered because of how unique it is as compared to any other film of the nineties, it is unconventional and in our computer age seems like something that could actually happen.",

Like, how did that parachute even get inside the dome in the first place? Throughout the movie it shows that the people have an extreme amount of security going on to keep Truman locked up inside their island universe, but this guy in the parachute comes in like it's nothing, I guess. Also, what kinds of cameras exist that they can be smaller than a zit? And what are they connected to get to the computers up above? Bluetooth sure didn't exist back then, and if they do need cords to connect, how do they stay on people? And what kind of television dashboard has millions of camera angles? How do they scroll through them so fast? No of this is explained.How did it take 20+ years for the elevator accident to happen? And why would they broadcast Trumans audio stalking into an easily accessible radio station that Truman can attain any time? And how has he never discovered it before? And if there are cameras everywhere with microphone systems, why would they not put one in his car? A lot of things can go on inside a car that would be dramatic and entertaining, believe me. But even if they did, which I don't remember if they did or not, why wouldn't they know he was listening to his radio if they had a camera in his car? They should've turned it off immediately.How was Truman not skeptical immediately that his dad was still alive? He saw him drown. There is no reasonable explanation for surviving drowning in the middle of the ocean a mile away from the shore.Ok, questions aside, I thought this was a very good movie I watched it 3 times. I thought that his fake best friend was a great character, most especially when it showed him getting directions telling him that he was Trumans best friend. It is very hard to tell you how betrayed and sad I felt for Truman. That was a classic scene. But I will say the big search scene it felt like he was a 2-dimensional character that was just used for plot. In fact, everyone in that scene felt that way.Can we talk about his audience? No? Yeah that's what I thought. They were boring and screaming \"We are only hear to fill up screen time and to remind you that he's on a TV show\" But the two cops were the best and funniest out of all of them.His girlfriend that was trying to tip him off all the time didn't do much for me. I like his wife more, because she was so funny with those commercials.The point is, the more times you watch this movie the more you see its flaws and inconsistencies. But, I will say that it was a good drama, most especially the bridge scene when his best friend was lying to him. That scene hit hard.A lot of the sequences that happened were shenanigans, but it was still funny and enjoyable.",

Some of us fear change and can't easily get out of their comfort zone. I think it's a big deal to have the courage to leave your home, that place that made you who you are to face the world and get to know yourself better. The human mind is a very complex \"toy\" but also fragile. Sometimes we prefer living a lie because it gives us sort of a sense of security, sometimes we reject new experiences just because they are...new, sometimes we like to live in our own little universe for fear of the others. This film has many morals and it's up to each of us to discover one. For me, the moral was: It's never too late to escape from the perfect little world you've created or the others have created for you and start to LIVE for REAL!",

At the time, I thought it was a very good film with undoubtedly the best performance by an actor that I'd ever seen, at the time, by none other than Mr. Jim Carrey. I was never a big fan of this guy until 'The Truman Show'. His performance alone is worth the price of a rental! Only the recent performance by Sharlto Copley in 'District 9' is somewhat better than Mr. Carrey's. Over the years since it was released, 'The Truman Show' has become more relevant, and far more potent and personal. I watched it again a couple of nights ago, and was shocked, realizing while watching the film, at how our current television programs have been overrun with 'reality' shows and 'entertainment reality' shows. With what may be divine foresight, Mr. Peter Weir and his crew created 'The Truman Show' which depicts our 'reality show' at its far extreme. If you haven't seen this, and are a 'reality show' fan, then watch this movie, and prepare to be shaken. A tie for my number 2 spot with 'The Green Mile', behind the number one film of all time 'The Shawshank Redemption'. And like 'Shawshank', I strongly believe that this film's list of admirers will continue to grow such that it will be, someday, in the 'IMDB's Top 250' where it so rightfully belongs!

We are used to see the things as they are and we accept the world the way it is presented. Very few people try to find the meaning of our essence and how the truth can be found in the deep oceans. We know that the place Truman lives is a simulation, but when we turn and look our world we can't see any difference between Seaheaven and the world we live in. The bed we sleep; the chair we sit or the book we read are just a simulacrum. We don't attempt to look for the original because the copies become the reality and that doesn't bother us at all.

Someone's going to say I took it too seriously, but I guess that's the way it is then.The reason that I didn't go see this movie before is that it had Jim Carrey written all over it. I have grown to dislike Jim Carrey for the very reason for which he is the star he is - pulling faces! I believe I'm not the only one who has been wondering whether it's all that he's good for. It works for The Mask and Ace Ventura... but a lot of others? I don't know.Having that said, I spent a few moments trying to think who else could have pulled this one off. Carrey kind of reminds me of Jack Nicholson. Every other actor sort of pale next to Nicholson and Carrey... They do the conventional acting thing while these two do their own thing. So props for that.I believe this movie was labeled a comedy just because of Jim Carrey and that he's supposed to be a comedian. However, this movie didn't strike me as a comedy. Instead, I was scared, disturbed.Everybody laments over how money makes the world turn around. Underneath, this movie offers a point of view on that: How far can that actually be taken? Surely, The Truman Show is an exaggeration on the subject... it also simultaneously exaggerates the fact that people don't care as long as they get their fix. Moreover, the fact that people don't care! There's even a part in the movie where it's freely discussed in the media, like it was okay to make a lab rat out of Truman Burbank. McElhone's character Sylvia/Lauren voices criticism and points out how cruel it is. (In my opinion, it's critical for the success of this movie. Props again.) And in the very end Christoph, the director, is brought on almost as if he was a God... and there's no denying that he's playing a God!Alright, I've said a lot, but if you guys are thinking I'm slamming this movie, you've mistaken. Read on.I feel that this movie has very little comedy value. Surely, some aspects of it are brought across by means of comedy, but that still doesn't make it one.

Peter Weir wrote and directed this film, and I'm beginning to think he could be a new person in a new line of directors, because many of his films have been just like that. The concept of putting an unwanted baby into a show filled with perhaps thousands of actors and hundreds of product placements is something I have never heard of before. If you wonder how Truman Burbank as he is called could be so gullible, you're doing the same thing everyday. Just refer to Cristof's line in his interview in the middle, after Truman met his father.

Now, if this were all true and the movie evolved as it should have along these lines, perhaps it would deserve all the praise it is getting.  However, everything that happens in the later 2/3 of the movie completely undermines everything we've been lead to believe about this world Truman lives in. Imagine my utter disapointment when during what seemed like a truely emotional scene between Truman and his best friend, we cut to the control room to find the best friend being fed his lines!  What was that about not cue cards?  What follows completely destroys what was one a wonderful premise and gives no hope of redemption.

It's all one big show, so don't tell us the ending, we don't want it spoiled for us.  We can't wait to see how this one turns out.  Somewhere in all this entertainment is the gem that enlightens us about the human condition, most of it is simply mindless drivel that babysits us with a neat and tidy resolution.That The Truman Show can be the first while perfectly embodying our entertained-to-death society only begins to demonstrate its brilliance.  Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey, in his best performance to date) has been the star of one big TV show all his life.  After over 10,000 days alive, Truman suspects something strangely synchronous and deadening about his existence. He's never left his picture perfect life in Seahaven, the hometown where everyone's either a principal or an extra and where the eponymous star of the show is intensely \"real\" simply because he doesn't know any better.  But the naturalism falls short on Truman's co-horts and even on the star himself.  Everyone's been overly friendly and uniform out of obligation to the master plan.  Truman was adopted by a corporation at birth who turned every moment of his existence into a financial venture and entertainment empire.  24-hour continuous TV has to be commercial free, so Truman is surrounded by meticulous, and sometimes blunt, product placement.Let's face it:  we're all whores to the corporate world.  At some point or another, every one of us has paid too much to support a dominant corporation or to join its clique.   Celebrities and entry-level actors reap the benefits after donating their soul to endorsements.  But the price can be steep.  Does Michael Jordan really have private space anymore?  And what about the millions of Americans who can only really strike a chord with their peers through Simpsons or X-Files references? \t Many of today's children and young adults are being raised by television.  Here's the story of a boy who was raised on television and just wants a little breathing room.  When he tries to escape, he's admonished repeatedly for wanting what the rest of us watching at home or in the theaters already , in theory, has.  Freedom to see things the way they really are.  The real issue is when we'll start exercising our rights to this freedom. \t It is with a certain trepidation that viewers will cheer Truman.  We don't know whether to laugh or cry as Truman's fans subtly remind us that simply by consenting to be entertained, we have surrendered so much.  Eventually, we've got to turn off the sets and face the world.  Can we?",

The script, by Andrew Niccol beautifully satirizes our television and media dominated era, incredibly being cynical and heartwarming at the same time.  The viewer is allowed to observe the ridiculous position Carrey's Truman Burbank is put in and at the same time care for the man, much like his millions of adoring \"cattle\".  While laughing at the ignorance of the apathetic world around Truman, one can not help but be fascinated by his story.  But the script is not the only genius. Peter Weir's stylishly executes  the story at a rapid pace, cramming so much into the film, and at the same time creating an entertaining and hypnotic movie.  The camera positions switch back and forth from an \"directorial\" standpoint to the \"hidden cameras\" all over Truman's world, giving a multitude of perspectives, and ultimately creating an amalgam of emotions.  \"The Truman Show\"  walks the fine line between comedy and drama, even surpassing the typical \"dramedy\", designing a world all it's own, perfectly capturing the bizarre place Truman is stuck in.",

The movie is about a man whose life was created and managed by a director to broadcast every aspect of his life as a massive TV set. Actually, he had lived his entire existence in an extremely huge TV studio and had been surrounded by actors playing the parts of his family, friends and neighbors before he realized the truth and decided to live the spurious town called Seahaven.I would consider the movie as an intelligent and insightful one in which the actors presented outstanding and believable performances. The idea and plot seem to be completely original which are developed perfectly and can astonish everyone. The movie contains a great deal of symbols and metaphors which make the audience to reconsider and question every single scene and dialogue. Falling a light from the sky which was a part of the show equipment is a good example as it gives us the insight into the collapse of Truman's world. Also, the sea is the main symbol for both freedom and confinement. It represents confinement as it is so vast and Truman is too scared of water due to the fake death of his father in the sea which was planned by the director to frighten Truman to make him stay in the town. On the other hand, it represents freedom as it is the only way to leave the counterfeit town and enter the real world. Truman's final decision to face his fear and sail on the sea can implant this idea in audience's mind that in order to fulfill a dream and win over obstacles, we have to fight against our fears and limitations.Although it sometimes seems that some movies are paying less attention to the concept of life and using the most unimportant ideas to form a story, The Truman Show is a proof that there can be great and high-grade ideas that are able to be turned into masterpieces. The movie shares both comedy and dramatic moments and the depth of idea and used metaphors have created one of those movies that we can think and talk about when it ends.",

            "content": "This movie is incredible. It is not just my favorite Jim Carrey movie, but easily one of my favorite movies of all time. Unlike most of Carrey's films, this is not a typical goofy slapstick comedy. This is Carrey's first dramatic role, and he is surprisingly good at drama, at least in this film. While Carrey occasionally overacts slightly, and you can see a small bit of Ace Ventura shining through, this fits with the film's tone, and for the most part his acting is very good.The incredibly engaging plot concerns Truman Burbank (Carrey), a friendly insurance salesman who lives a seemingly idyllic life in the overly pleasant small town of Seahaven. However, it turns out that Truman's entire life is actually a reality TV show he is unaware of. Seahaven is actually a simulated town built within a giant dome, and all its residents aside from Truman are actors - even Truman's wife, \"Meryl\". After living almost thirty years completely oblivious of this, he eventually releases that something is off after a series of unusual events happen - including a stage light marked with the name of the star Sirius falling from the sky; his car radio picking up frequency describing exactly what he is doing; and even his long-dead father turning up as a homeless man. Truman soon realizes his life is fake, and begins planning to escape the dome and make it into the real world, but must confront his crippling fear of water to do so.If you like Jim Carrey, you will like this movie, but being a fan of his other work is not a requirement to get maximum enjoyment out of this film. Chances are you won't like \"The Mask\" or \"Dumb and Dumber\" if you aren't a fan of Carrey's work in general, but you will most likely still love this incredible dystopian drama even if you don't generally care for his more comedic films. So what are you waiting for, go check this movie out right now! You won't regret it.",

I wasn't sure if the movie would hold up in the year 2022, but thankfully that's not the case. The themes explored in this movie are just as relevant today as they were at the turn of the century.Yes, this is a comedy, but not in the ways you might expect. There's a deep despair behind Carey's performance (fittingly), as his character is effectively an unknowing prisoner/celebrity. In fact, I would say that to fully appreciate this movie requires at least 2 viewings, just to pick up on all the subtle details (all of the forced product-placement gags are hilarious).This movie wastes no time introducing us to Truman and the world he occupies. Given how brisk the pacing is, there's an astonishing amount of detail about the logistics of trying to realistically pull-off something of this magnitude. Yet, somehow it's all presented to the viewer without coming across as exposition-heavy.It's really hard to find things to nitpick about this movie. There's no dated CGI. Everyone turns in a stellar performance. Laura Linney, in particular, does such an amazing job as Truman's wife, who grows increasingly frustrated with her scene-partner/husband, as Truman begins to figure out what's really going on. Although, in hindsight, Linney's character is essentially a sex-worker, which is a little icky when you start to think about it.Carey is also fantastic; this was before he started doing more dramatic roles, and his inexperience doesn't show. I imagine he must have improvised a bunch on set, which lends authenticity to several of his scenes.I'm so glad this film exists. It's so unique and lovingly crafted.

I don't know the name of the lens where the viewer sees just a circle of the screen, but I don't think it should have been used. If the camera was positioned to make the viewer THINK something was wrong, but not be quite sure, I think it would have been better. I think that soley unique camera angles would produce an awesome effect (and a greater \"Wha????\" moment when we realize Truman is on a show).

In the year 2014 are a dime a dozen but back in 1998 the dawn of reality television was just beginning. Truman was before Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton and countless others who lived their lives on television.Jim Carrey is so good in this role. In many ways he is ideally cast- a man who could not appear to be more ordinary on the outside but is so much bigger than the mundane world he is trapped in. Carrey's portrayal of Truman, who knows something is not right but can't figure it out, is both realistic and at times, appropriately over the top hysterical.The director is also what makes this film work. Peter Weir created this artificial world that looks seemingly normal and perfect. There are times where you as the viewer even forget that Truman's world is not real and actually looks like a nice place to live.

I must say I didn't enjoy this movie so much when I first saw it in the cinema because I didn't appreciate the concept. I was also a teenager looking for the usual fun and laughs from watching a Carrey movie. But after having watched Carrey films that followed, such as Man on the Moon, The Majestic (a personal favourite) and Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind, I appreciate what a fantastic actor the man is. His ability to play funny man is matched in his ability to be taken seriously. He should've had an Oscar in his hand ages ago, particularly for his performance in The Truman Show. I strongly believe that had this movie been released within the last couple of years, in the age of reality TV where more people would understand and relate to the concept, it would've received the appreciation it deserves and Carrey would've been nominated for an academy award.

At first I could not understand the connection between a film and a psychological problem. But then it became clear that both are about a 'fantasy'. Almost everyone in society is living a fantasy that can be as far removed or as close to reality as the person wishes. Of course, if the that person is a head of state dragging his country into war or running after Utopian dreams then the harm done is that much more greater.Now a film is also a fantasy, but it is the very exact and deliberate fantasy of the director. When we see a movie we are transported into that fantasy and we live it in vivid detail and color in all our visual and mental senses. We also live it in our subconscious senses as well, and herein lies its value. Seeing what has been thus far deeply embedded and intertwined inside us now on screen and out in the open helps begin the separation process (between reality and fantasy). Since the distinction between the fantasy of the movie and your current reality is very clear, and since you willingly entered the movie fantasy by your own choice until it overlapped with your inner similar fantasy; you can get to experience the willful 'exiting' of the movie fantasy that would subsequently help you to 'exit' your inner fantasy in the future. Well, it's a little more complicated than that, but this isn't the best place to discuss in deep psychotherapy techniques.Of course I'm not suggesting that, in and of its self, a movie would cure anybody of anything; that has to be the work of a professional, and it's his or her decision as to whether or not to incorporate it into the therapy process. But I am curious as to whether anyone else has ever 'used' this film (or any other movie) in this sense or at least experienced their psychological effect either consciously or subconsciously.",

Following some strange occurrences, Truman starts to think that he is being watched. Little does he know that he is soon to find out that his whole life has been broad-casted globally. Truman Burbank is a normal man, with a normal wife, a normal job. He has a normal life. At least that is what it seems. Truman fear of water stops him from ever leaving the perfect little town of Seahaven, or to see the woman he really loves. Lauren (Natascha McElhone) is Truman's high school friend/girlfriend. She knew about the Truman Show and tried to tell him about it. She was taken away. The creator of this simulated reality TV show, Christof (Ed Harris) controls all aspects of Truman's life in Seahaven, like whom he meets, what he does, and everything in the dome. Christof's antics are a little bit unpredictable. You don't know if his actions are trying to help or ruin Truman.The film is set in two time zones. The outside world is set in modern times, and in the dome is set to seem like it is from the 50's era. This movie includes flashback of when Truman is a child, including when is father 'died' causing his phobia of water.Starting of as a comedy, it is soon realized that this movie has a deeper meaning. One example is when Truman looks like he is walking across water to a door that opens into a black space. The director (Peter Weir) seems to be trying to show an example of Nirvana. He uses different angles and Mise En Sc\u00e8ne so it feels like you are watching The Truman Show and not a movie. Peter Wier has used the art of cinematography well in this movie.The audience that watched the Truman Show are a group of people who wanted to be entertained no matter what the consequence to Truman.

Carrey has carved a career as a rubber faced comic actor who acts at the top of his voice a lot, but the Truman Show demands he portray what at first seems a mid-life crisis but later develops into full paranoia, albeit justified.Meet Truman Burbank. He is the future of television. His show beams around the world 24 hours a day. Everyone loves Truman. People collect Truman memorabilia and videos. He has theme bars named after him. But Truman Burbank does not know any of this. He lives in a world populated by principal actors and extras. Truman's life is a carefully orchestrated soap opera. Controlled that is until he becomes dissatisfied with life and wants to move away from the sleepy island he calls home. His repeated failure to get away arouses his suspicion that his life is not his own.There are many faults in The Truman Show. For instance, onscreen the show's creator Christophe tells us the reason Truman is so popular with the audience is because his life is idyllic. Yet the character we meet is an insurance salesman living in fifties America. No offence intended to our American cousins, but it is never really explained why this irritatingly twee view of America should cross international cultural boundaries.Another down side are the unsympathetic characters on display. This is surely due to the fact that everyone is playing a character who is playing a character. The only genuine person is Truman and he is played by Jim Carrey and, worse, has led a life so mind-numbingly normal as to be almost abnormal.The good thing about The Truman Show is that the concept is very strong. Director Peter Weir brilliantly keeps up the Twilight Zone-style paranoia and the film is very well scripted. Despite being generally irritating, Carrey is not a disaster in the role and he does encourage you to sympathise with Truman.Most of the philosophy spun regarding our TV watching generation comes across as a bit hackneyed, however the final scene of the movie sums up telly addicts the world over.",

At any rate, the movie became more and more disturbing as it progressed.  I had thought that by getting a Jim Carrey film, I would have picked up a comedy.  Boy was I wrong.  This film, just like the Cable Guy, is seriously disturbing.  I guess if you are rating Carrey's acting, it would be a 10 (he has remarkable flexibility as an actor).  I was rating the entertainment value of the movie, however, and was unprepared for how disturbing and frightening the experience would be.",

This is one movie that makes you think.

This movie carries you like a dream, with great acting and imaginative writing. Anyone will fall in love with Truman, wishing the best for him, as he sets out to conquer the makers of the Truman show. As you find out how more and more people in Truman's life are fake, you will eventually wonder if you're watching a regular movie or someone's nightmare. Ed Harris is smooth as silk and cool as a cucumber as he plays the directorial genius, and at the same time, you will see little touches of a madman. I would not doubt it if someone starts out saying that the movie is dull, pointless and absolutely dumb, and finishes the film saying that it was the best movie they have ever seen.

All people around, whole town population are actors. Fake parents, fake emotions, fake job, fake friends, fake \"fate\". Everything in his life is secretly controlled by TV visionary Christof, including what woman he have to start dating and marry.\nIt's quite interesting, that despite Christof saying in first line \"We've become bored with watching actors give us phony emotions.\" and then \"there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts, no cue cards.\", practically everything in movie contradict his statement. Everything is phony and fake. So much resemblance with our life and world around us, isn't?\nHowever, despite such uniqueness, or maybe exactly because of that, there are too many plot holes. After deep analyze, such thing as 24hrs TV show of whole life one person, whom have no idea about that, couldn't really exist not even survive. Especially financially. Interesting moments from Truman life shown in movie looks fine, but if his whole life would be transmitted over 3 decades while show is on the run, those few interesting moments would be spread over that time so rarely, that hardly enough people would watch such boredom show, not even speak about financial aspect.",

I thought it was a very unique and realistic film, hugely enjoyable with just the right amount of funny and tense.

The Trueman Show is one example of many other films sending out this warning.Truman Burbank represents \"the people\" while the actors (bystanders, friends and family of Truman) on the ground are the \"gatekeepers\" of the \"illuminate\" who are hiding in the hollowed out moon. The audience may be alien intelligence (who in the movie some of which get on the \"set\" (inside Trumans world) to interact with Truman, could be representative of aliens interacting with us) watching us from another dimension or from \"above\", or might just be us the viewers looking into the \"looking glass\" (TV).His name says a lot and is like an overview of the whole meaning, Trueman is true + man = truth for man, while Burbank is Bur (prickly/thorn) + Bank (money/power) = corrupt elite or illuminate, therefore Truman v Burbank = right v wrong or good v bad etc.I believe the warning could be to inform \"the people\" who are prepared to see it for what it really is, that if we can overcome our fear of living we can set ourselves free from the illusion of our controlled reality and if we don't then we remain in bondage, as shown in the movie where Trueman overcomes his fear of the water (water represents the essence of all life, so he fears life or living) to eventually escape at the edge of his \"prison\". Truman's fear of the water was constructed through events orchestrated by his controllers and is a mirror of how humanity has been left in a state of fear through controlled and manipulated staged events.There is a screen shot of a view that appears to be a pyramid and is one of many examples of \"illuminate\" symboling used in the movie. Truman is in his car at the bottom of the pyramid, to get to the top he has to overcome his fear of the water by crossing the bridge. The sign post on the right looks like a police badge outline which is a reminder of control, and the light at the top of the lamp post representing the \"eye\". The long yellow line in the middle could be a reference to the yellow brick road from the Wizard of Oz.Andrew Niccol the producer and writer of The Truman Show also directed and was the writer for Gattaca made one year before, which has an interesting link as this is about how to overcome and beat the PTB in an Orwellian society through overcoming fear to achieve the ultimate goal for the main character Vincent Freeman of escaping earth, which is the same goal for Truman Burbank.",

Even though it has the air of a nice and sweet, and especially funny family movie, and I guess it is meant to be just this, the story is one of wild imagination. One could not imagine living in a world for 30 years, not knowing and not noticing that all the people, and I mean all the people that he knows, are actors, and thus not really the people he thinks they are. I mean, your father, your mother, your wife! How can this happen! It seems not possible, but when I got more comfortable with the idea, it seemed to me that this could be reality to a certain extent. All it takes, I guess, are some very strong actors close to a person that likes more to be noticed than to notice people around him, and Jim Carrey puts such a person down with great virtuosity, and a big group of part figurants, part actors, who are dedicated to their job, and ready to act when they have to. And then to think what he must have thought when he found out. You can see him getting more and more suspicious, and when he first starts to get this suspicion, you see him trying to act inconspicuous, not knowing which people are part of the conspiracy. Imagine the train of thought he had when he realized the vastness of this conspiracy, containing all the people he knows in it. This is too big for words. Normally when a person has this kind of ideas, people say he is mentally ill, and probably he is. But then to slowly find out it is real! What a tremendous doubt this would bring in a person! Not in the person Jim Carrey plays, because Truman has enough of a childs mind left to be able to accept this far fetched an idea.

It creates a whole fake city, a whole alternative controlled life. Though over the top, it makes you stop and wonder 'What if'.The movie is about Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) whose whole life is a Television show and he is unaware of it. It is about his journey from ignorance to slow perception. The film plot though in modern times is not very new, with the recent onslaught of reality TV but it does have its moments of clarity. Jim Carrey has once again proved that not just outrageous comedy or dark thriller roles are his forte but a serious mix of the two is also up his alley. He has managed to hook the audience. You find yourself rooting for him for the escape at the same time hoping to catch more of his drama. Ed Harris (Christof) as the creator of the show is again brilliant. Through fewer words he emotes more. His attachment to Truman as the father figure, as the creator is almost tangible. Though Jim carries the movie through seeing as he is in every shot, he got good support from Laura Linney,Noah Emmerich actors. They have managed to capture a fine line between scripted characters and real people.Overall, It is a simple unassuming film, which is thought provoking on many levels but still remains a thorough entertainment.",

He finds later that there is something strange about his surroundings that isn't authentic. There must be someone watching him because everything seems to be orchestrated.He goes on from this to the discovery this hypothesis is true and that there has to be more to the world than he has seen. He tries to escape his surroundings that he was groomed to be accustomed to, and finds that magically every attempt that he makes is unsuccessful because something always comes up as a block.This aspect of the movie portrays much of what one must imagine would happen in the raising of a wild animal in a controlled environment. They would either find that there is no way out of their environment and eventually give up, or they would rebel. This would be much like in \"Jurassic Park\", where the dinosaurs find a way out of the fence of the controlled environment. Truman is a wild animal that is kept in a controlled environment that is against his innate will and instinct. His instinct is to explore and find meaning to life. He is a wild man on the lose, and nothing can stop his aspiration to venture to the unknown. This is much the same in \"Jurassic Park\", in that the animals that once ruled the earth have an instinct of free range. They will, by their instinct, find ways to become top of the chain again.There are many that will find that the movie \"The Truman Show\" has some underlying spiritual meaning and that the producers had some great theological statement to make about how we view God and whatever else may come to mind. Many may even say that it is a statement of theodicy in that God has everything perfectly orchestrated to his will but makes mistakes in his outtakes. Others may say that much like what the Mormon church believes, God was just a man that was given high power of which he abused and screwed up thus bringing disorder to his creation.While all of these are legitimate statements about this movie, none are quite on par as much as to say that this was a movie for the sake of entertainment and poking fun at reality television. While reading many interviews of Weir, one will find that it was a satire on reality television and that it was to show how fake it was. It is almost as if it were to show the persons involved in reality television are pets that are subject to what the master throws at them. All of their responses are controlled and generated responses from a learned behavior in one way or other. These directors have simply learned how to manipulate those responses to get good ratings.Unfortunately, unlike \"Jurassic Park\", \"The Truman Show\" is not worth a sequel. The movie was poorly made and had a juvenile story line. The plot development was not adequate for the audience to fully connect with all of the characters. It was obvious that the prime focus was to give Jim Carey a character portfolio that would bring his career into a deeper, more meaningful position. While this being true, more than likely, this was the only way that a writer of a movie in this caliber could get his work published; one can find an actor with the need to diversify, come up with a budget, and create a film with a big name and it instantaneously happens, they have a career.For any person to say that this movie had any type of effect on them spiritually, would be to say that the \"Care Bears\" shaped their epistemology ultimately leading them to Jesus. There is about as much spiritual meaning to this movie as there is in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and to say otherwise is to deny that of the words of the director and to read cosmetology into \"Gandhi\".",

The director Peter Weir does a very good job making fun of us. He shows through comedy, triumph, and weakness how to advertise. The way that Weir makes fun of reality TV makes all Americans look like cruel idiots. The Truman Network that people watch almost 24/7, is pop culture at its weakest.

Reality shows are also addicting and as they show in the movie they make fun of the people who are so in love with the show that they always have it on since it is a show that just keeps going on and on. The American Dream is shown in that Truman's wife is pretending to be the perfect wife and be all old fashioned. The Sense of Safety is shown in that the town no one is able to leave and they live in this small area. The reason is for Truman to not get hurt but you have to learn from your mistakes.

Paradoxily, to really \"get\" The Truman Show, you have to see the big picture. If you analyze every bit of the film, it becomes repetitive. And that's the point. The majority of the people in the world DO NOT analyze films to death..what you see is what you get. And that's how you have to view The Truman Show. What makes it so amazing is that it satirizes (albeit DARKLY) so many unlikely cultural staples: gated communities, the viewing audience and media stardrom. Yet... you can't really see this unless you look at the film as a whole. Anyone understand what I mean? Jim Carrey gives us a wonderfully restrained, yet manic performance as Truman Burbank. Ed Harris' megalomanical Christof also adds greatly to the film. My one complaint? Overly saccahrine Meryl. Although I suppose that goes along with the satire. One of my favorite films ever.

He is happy, in a way, but he already feeling something strange. Something is missing, and he thinks that he might find it in Fiji, where Lauren (Natasha McElhone), the only woman he has really loved, is.But how does he get out of this fake world?Truman's world is controlled by a television producer named Christof (Ed Harris), whose control room is located high up in the artificial dome that forms the sky and horizon of Seahaven. Meanwhile, the whole world watches Truman's every move, since his birth, and some viewers even leave the TV on all night while he sleeps.

Jim Carey did a phenomenal job... of course having a fantastic director like  Peter Weir does not hurt! Weir does a wonderful job of using his actors in ways that surprises you. Holland Taylor does a great job as a woman who \"loves\" her son even though she is just acting...Laura Linney is incredible was the long suffering actress that must play Truman's wife... and Noah Emmerich does a wonderful job as Truman's best friend when in reality he is Truman's worst enemy. This movie is truly disturbing because in this media driven world that we live in it is not that big a stretch of the imagination that the networks would try something like this... or that we would all watch it whether we admitted it or not... I recommend this movie highly. If you are looking for a Jim Caery style comedy this movie is not for you.... if you want to see Jim Carey in one of his finest role you MUST see this movie",

Jim Carrey excels as Truman delivering the greatest performance of his career to date. I must admit that prior to this film I was not a fan of his, but I am forced to acknowledge his talent.

Having read the novel \"Running out of Time\"? Jessie Keyser, the young leading character in this book, has the same situation with Trumen. Living in Clifton in 1840, she didn't know that many eyes have watched their life until her mom told the truth, about the outside world in 1996. It just let me think about those celebrities. They have been chased by some paparazzi since they became a focal point. \"Princess Diana's accident\" might proved this. Some odious paparazzi, no, \"spies\" would said,\"This is just my job.\" for excuses. This movie told us, that the importance of the right of privacy and respectability to the others.

In our world, wannabe contestants would give anything for their five minutes of fame whereas in this Paramount Pictures flick we have Truman; blissfully unaware that he is living in a fake reality and has become a global household name.Truman Burbank is a simple man with a simple life - he has a perfect wife, and a fairytale home; what more could you ask for- right? Every day it's the same thing, greetings, run-of-the-mill insurance job, corny commercial advertising and his never ending search for a lost love. All desperate attempts to escape from the world of Seahaven end in failure. Of course, there is no escape. The clues are all there: stage lights falling from the sky, even the radio talking to him. Whenever Truman comes close to discovering the truth about his life, all the evidence is buried under a clever web of tricks and lies. From buttons to bowler hats, secret cameras have been plastered all over the neighbourhood and they're watching. 'Born a star', Truman's whole existence has been broadcast to the planet from womb to work, in the largest TV stage set of all time! Actors create a trained community of friends, lovers; even relatives, while the 'God-like' Christof (Ed Harris) gets to recite such lines as \"Cue the sun\", while concealed in his spacious viewing office hidden behind the moon. Natascha McElhone is cast as Lauren; Truman's bona fide love, quickly pulled from the show for attempting to tell Truman his true identity. Truman's father (Brian Delate) was also cut from the show early on in a boating accident resulting in Truman developing aqua phobia. Wier has managed to produce a small backbone cast so perfectly suited to their on-screen roles that you could say they were born to play them! However, these characters are only the framework of the movie giving the films major star Jim Carrey a chance to shine through.Naturally the success of this blockbuster hit would have been nothing without the presence of Jim Carrey and his leading role as Truman. In previous films Carrey has delivered first class comedy performances resulting in nation wide admiration for his cringy, OTT comedies such as 'Ace Ventura' and 'Liar Liar'. It doesn't matter if you've never liked him before. In this film Carrey has become a real human being (for the first time) and creates his character with powerful, captivating emotions never seen before. A masterfully moving performance with the perfect balance of humour and solemnity; Carrey deserves top marks for making 'The Truman Show' one of the biggest films of the year! Films this great don't come along often. Clever, funny and thought provoking; this big hit blockbuster has it all. You will never look at a reality TV show in the same way again",

The Truman show did surprise me when I saw it; it wasn't a cheap-laugh movie with ridiculous gags. Though the story line does sound silly, and can certainly, most easily be done with the crazy, koo-koo styles of other Jim Carrey movies, or any other big comedian. I really do like this film and the way it stands out in a genre all on its own.. as you watch it you really begin to feel angry for the injustice for Truman as he goes about his regular life, but can also understand the reason all the rest of the world is so engrossed with him. You can even understand Christoff's relentless obsession and greed towards his work. Its a great story of how humanity's passion for money, entertainment and technology won over compassion and guilt, how everyone else seemed completely willing to betray and manipulate his life and surroundings for the sake of T.V (kinda makes you think of a puppet on strings who doesn't know the strings are there) The Truman show is a great film and you'll be rooting for Truman the whole way.",

            "content": "If a child is told that the sky is purple, they will believe that it is purple, until they figure out that it is blue. I feel that this analogy rings true to life, as it is the previous views, that often corrupt the present ones, that are yet to be known. But what if the context of this analogy wasn't political? What if this analogy referred to every day of your life? We see this all the time in movies, but I believe, that the best example of this, is through the film The Truman Show. Personally, I would call this production a film as you come out of it with a slightly altered view of the world. Not only do you start to look at things differently, but I found myself second guessing if the things that I have always known were real. Although this was not my first time watching the film, I would rate it a 9/10. I have always really enjoyed the film because I love its concept and its play on reality. Above this, I believe that the Truman Show is in fact an incredible mixture of cinematography, and the perfect story. As previously mentioned, I love the films concept, but the film wouldn't be the same without its unique cinematography, as the camera often times takes the place of those that are filming Truman for the show. This is something that you rarely see in movies, and I think that it added an extra sense of individuality to the concept. To further push the main message of the film, each element of the production comes together to confirm the concept that we accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. Personally, I highly agree with this statement. This goes along with upbringing, to simply believing in the facts that we as a society have presented as our truth. That being said, sometimes reality can be a toxic thing. In the past, people were told that certain individuals were not equal to others due to their sexuality, gender, or race. Unfortunately, this implementation of reality has stuck in the brains of many, and admitting the wrong in what we previously saw as true proves to be a challenging thing to overcome as a society. This is ultimately the danger of reality. That being said, sometimes it's not up to us to shift reality. Sometimes reality shifts on us. The Covid-19 crisis has changed our world and ultimately changed our version of reality for the remaining months this year. Although terrible, this crisis isn't all bad, as urging people to stay inside has started to help heal the planet and put an end to our on going environmental issues. As seen in the film, many bad things can be seen with two sides. I feel as though the film does the best job in showing this through the incorporation the character Christof, who is the creator of the Truman show. Christof is seen as a hero to the viewers and marketers of the show, as he has provided them with 24/7 entertainment, and sponsored several products in the process, their for taking the place of adds that would normally be on television. On the contrary, he is seen as a villain to Truman, and those who do not agree with the show. As Truman sees it, he has stolen his life and forced him to live a lie for over 30 years. Ultimately, not only does the movie come down to reality, but perspective. Everything, and anything can be seen in different ways. So, what is reality really?",

He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.Weir, who directed the great 'Witness', uses different camera angles to make you feel like you're actually watching 'The Truman Show' and not a movie.

It's creepy, very much so, in the way that The Original Stepford Wives is but more so in a way, and I wonder about what would be said about the movie had it been released currently, instead of the late 90's when reality TV was just starting to cause a ripple. I first started changing my thoughts on Carey after Bruce Almighty, a great movie (and one that is a lot more thought provoking then many give it credit for.) But as good as he was in that, he simply shines in Truman, everyone does, I loved Laura Linney as Truman's annoying, cold on screen wife Meryl. I've seen many of Linney's movies, this is one of her best.I'd advise people who haven't seen Truman Show to see it more then once-the first time I saw it, I thought it was about an 8 or 9, it grows on you and it's the kind of movie you want to see again as soon as it ends. There are a few frustrating things to be sure, I wish it had not ended so ambiguously, I'd have liked to see more of Truman's life after leaving the set, his relationship with Sylvia and what the other characters were feeling gone into a bit more.

The Truman Show is a must see for everyone. Weir's take on The Truman Show was made to display the directors beliefs of what could happen if reality TV goes too far. A fictional idea that could be all to true. When someone is filmed non-stop for their whole life they ultimately are given no privacy. Weir named the director of The Truman Show on TV ,within the movie The Truman Show, Christoph because of a performance artist named Christoph who would use people and other object to create art. The Truman Show in some ways was made to show how artists might go \"too far\" in creating what they believe is art. Christoph traps Truman in what is basically a cage for his entire life. Everything Truman has been taught has been controlled by someone else. Truman has no choice in choosing what he can and cannot do. His entire life has been controlled by the outside world. Weir is trying to warn people that if actions are not taken soon people may go too far in the real world. Restrictions on what people can do without an individual's consent should only ever be needed as a fall back. Artists and creatives alike although they may want to finish their \"dream project\" should have the ability to restrict themselves from doing unethical things. Peter Weir has set a limit of what something should never be with his film The Truman Show.",

If the story wasn't generic, it may have gone weird, so I prefer the generic lifestyle.About the extra-role people repeating same thing. It wouldn't have took him 22 years to notice that. For 10,000 days they'll have tons of variations and dramas going on within the town. Also the advertisement wouldn't been subtle without actors vocally pointing it out.The television rating wouldn't have been high as well. Probably first year, and last year of his life. The scale of staffs involved would've been much larger. They'll be prepared for any situation and the townspeople'd be really just living in there, not even acting as a part.",

            "content": "The Truman Show, a heartwarming film yet disturbing image of the ideal American life revolves around a man, Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey, who lives his life unknowingly on a giant television set where his life is and has been broadcasting live ever since he was born, 30 years ago. \nThroughout the film, the director, Peter Weir, uses many shots that have a faded black circle around it or use a fisheye lens. This is a constant reminder to the audience that Truman is secretly being watched and televised. There are many other techniques used to help reinforce this idea that Truman is trapped in a false world such as unnatural lighting where a spotlight is seen coming from the moon. Many of the characters will also look directly into the camera, which is known as \"breaking the fourth wall\". This is seen when Truman is talking and looking at the camera through his mirror making it seem as if he is trying to communicate with the audience. There are also subtle comedic references that would hint at the fact that they are in a TV show such as Truman's closest friend, Marlon, and wife, Meryl, having names that resemble famous actors. \nJim Carrey balances comedy and drama well in the film, very different from his well-known roles played in Dumb and Dumber and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Overall, Peter Weir does a very good job at portraying how Truman's world has been manipulated and controlled throughout his whole life, forcing the audience to question their own world and the control they have on it.",

However I had hopes knowing that Peter Weir (Witness, The Mosquito Cost, Dead Poet Society etc.) directed the film. I also heard praises about the film.Well, I watched this film all the way, and actually I had fun during the second half of it. The ideas were really promising, and  the film had some moments, but the first part soap was far too long. People do not go to a cinema to watch daytime TV. It lacked acting too. The characters were playing soap actors and there is not much fun to watching that. And Jim Carrey, who supposed to be the real person in the show was no different from them. Sorry, this guy just cannot form a character because he is a bad actor. Weir should have noticed it since he had directed actors like Harrison Ford and Robin Williams before. Carrey's performance really hurt the film. No wonder the moment Ed Harris, who did a great job realising the allmighty producer of the show, started to dominate the film it got much better. But on the whole this film belongs to the group of movies you can write a lot about because of the ideas behind them, but you don't want to see them for the second time. In film-making it is fine to have great ideas and be able to talk about them, but if when you have to go out you cannot make them really work then you missed the point.",

            "content": "The Truman Show may be approached on one level as social satire exposing the emptiness of an American Dream defined by consumerism and purveyed by the electronic media over the last half century. Life in \"Seahaven,\" the vast dome-enclosed set/community in which Truman (Jim Carrey) has been raised under the watchful eyes of a worldwide TV audience of millions, is a sharp and elaborate parody of the corporate sponsored images of middle-class American material bliss and innocence first introduced to mass television audiences through such '50s sitcoms as Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best, and The Donna Reed Show. A closely related target of The Truman Show's satire is the pervasive voyeurism and passivity that has increasingly characterized American social behavior as witnessed in film (ED TV), entertainment television (tell-all talk shows, Reality TV, the talent search genre), and even broadcast news (disaster/victim footage).Yet, on another level, The Truman Show, like Gattaca, The Matrix, Dark City and other more obvious examples of science fiction, deals with broad philosophical themes such as free will versus determinism in human action, subjective versus objective perceptions of reality, the assertion of humanness through existential rebellion, and the quest for an authentic self/ identity. Most immediately, the names and plot functions of the film's two principal characters - \"Christof,\" the megalomaniacal producer/director of a 24/7 reality TV show, and \"Truman,\" the show's eponymous everyman figure - invite the viewer to approach the work allegorically.Legally adopted by a corporation (in a clever parallel to virgin birth), manipulated by the all-seeing all-powerful Christof (Ed Harris) into phony friendship and empty marriage with actor-minions, and psychologically conditioned (i.e. terrorized) into fearing adventure and change, Truman gradually begins to suspect that Seahaven is not the paradise it purports to be. To assert his humanity and escape his artificially prolonged state of childlike ignorance, Truman must ultimately undertake that most mythic of journeys, a Sea Voyage. At its end, he must turn his back on the secure, controlled environment of his \"heavenly\" father's house and step through a forbidding black passageway that leads to the true human condition: emotional and physical risk, scary freedom, and - perhaps - real love. In so doing, Truman ironically brings to his TV audience (whether they are still capable of appreciating it or not) the very affirmation that the false god of television claims they receive from the contrived \"hope and uplift\" pabulum the show has been ladling out for 30 years along with its subliminal primary diet of product placement advertisement.In its climactic scenes, The Truman Show reveals Christof to be neither a social visionary nor a benevolent deity. Rather, we learn he has much in common with Orwell's Big Brother and - allegorically - with the implacable, sadistic god that Melville's Ahab imagines is running things behind the sky's impenetrable veil. By literally rending the heaven of his imprisoning universe, Truman navigates his storm-tossed sailing ship toward a completion of the heroic quest that Ahab's mad distraction (and Melville's theological uncertainty) forestalls: he momentarily frees himself and us from the diabolical/divine puller of the chains of human fate. In its final act, The Truman Show recasts the tragic despair of Moby Dick as comic triumph.",

            "content": "Truman Burbank is an ordinary guy in an ordinary little seaside town of Seahaven Island where nothing really happens. Everything is clean, everything is perfect, he knows people but never really connects to anyone. The one woman he ever really loved is not his wife and has long since left for the other side of the world where he longs to visit but feels he can never go. We are shown that every turn he makes, every attempt to escape is blocked by malevolent simulators and high tech manipulators intent on keeping him inside. He is watched 24 hours a day, seven days a week and his life televised as a form of entertainment. Paralyzed by his fear of water since seeing his father die on a boating accident, Truman still feels he is missing something. A strange light falling from the sky, a man who reminds him of his dead father, a strange radio broadcast and the feeling that the world really stops when he shuts his eyes all combine to make him feel something is wrong.Some of the positive aspects of the film are that Truman is a well looked after person. He is treated kindly by everyone and has been given a normal life to live in \"I've given Truman the chance to live a normal life\" says Christoff. Relationships with our family and friends are the most important thing. We see this through times when Truman is upset or needs help. He goes to his mum and best friend Marlon for support and they help him out. His mum talks him through his problems and acts like a normal mum would while Marlon settles his problems over a 6 pack of beers. The audience also has something to watch on television. Live for the whole world to see 24 hours a day, 7 days a week people watch as Truman goes through his everyday life, Christoff makes money and the audience have a show they enjoy watching.Some of the negative aspects of the film are that Truman never actually had a family. He is trapped inside a fake world (town of Seahaven) where every single person except him are actors and he begins to become aware of the situation he is in. He is being misled into believing the lies that have been constructed for him to keep him unaware of the real events occurring around him. We realise that Trumans wife is just an actor playing a role, in which she was placed, she had no real emotional feelings for Truman. She is just playing the role of his wife and so Truman's sense of love and relationship is distorted. Whenever Truman tries to go someplace far he is always blocked. From the sudden masses of traffic to the apparent nuclear meltdown Truman can never escape and will be trapped inside a fake world until he finally has enough, faces his fears and sails a boat into the horizon. Overall this is a great film about Truman trying to find his way into the real world. When everything seems like it doesn't add up, it just keeps getting more complicated for him. In the end Truman couldn't handle it anymore and the will to live couldn't be quashed by anything. Not even television. \"Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\"-The Truman Show",

I would call this film though provoking, interesting and tense. There are many opinions as to whether this Paramount Production has a suitable ending, but mine would be yes, it does. I feel that often when watching films, if there is an undecided ending, the film becomes more personal to you because you can let yourself imagine the ending. Who knows if there would ever be a show like this in real life? Perhaps here would be, as culture becomes worse and people have less morals. Although the Truman Show is an individual and creative film, I think that perhaps the script leaves something to be desired. Maybe it could have delved deeper into what some of the actors were feeling\u0085 but still, a very tense and gripping film. Jim Carrey's performance shows that he can act much better than most think, challenging himself with more diverse roles. Although some people believe Jim Carrey to be a comedy-only actor, in the film, you see a much more emotional side to his acting. The Truman Show has a surreal feel to it. Often the light seems too bright, the moon too perfect, or the clouds too fluffy. It really adds to the film, making it seem even more like a fake world than it already did. But to be honest, even though I still have some criticism about the Truman Show, I couldn't stop watching it! It's truly 'edge of your seat' stuff and there is never really a boring scene or a dull moment. Overall, I give this film a 4/5 for its entertainment and I would recommend it to people of all ages.",

Jim Carrey plays well, Ed Harris is great and the scene where he speaks to his \"child\" from heaven is perfect. The movie has the exact length. Andrew Niccol's script makes you a witness to Truman's life and wonder, who is watching your life now at this moment.

It's an amazing plot, the way all of Truman's life was viewed by millions without him being aware. The only weak points I found involved the movie being a bit far-fetched (only in the effects, like being able to create artificial thunderstorms in a man-made dome).

Since Truman was just a baby, he was on the show. I know right, very unfair. Truman nether really had a real family, he was brought up by the Actors in the show. His real parents did not want him, so that's were the Director of the Truman show got him from. The Truman show is truly amazing. You must see it. My options to this show is that, it's a really good show. The hole town knows Truman and that's cool but also weird. Also that it is a very amusing show to watch, it makes you want to watched it over and over again. He is trapped in this fake world. He doesn't know it at first, but when he come's across some clues he begins to know. Truman decides to try to escape. He is a nice man, who has got a job and a house, but the only thing wrong with his life is that it is all fake. He also has a FAKE wife, that doesn't care less about Truman. She gets a bit scared when Truman begins to know all that he should know. The whole world is watching his every move! Even when he is eating. Will Truman ever escape? Well you have got to find out and watch the Truman show to find out. Truman is upset when he finds out that he is being watched. And very angry, so he goes \" bonkers\" and try's to escape from the fake world that he has been living in for the last 32 years. This is my rating for the Truman show, 5 stars out of 5 stars. It is truly this good of a show! If you do not watch this show, then you will miss out big time.This is a picture of the Director in the film, he was the one who made up his whole life. It was his idea. It is his show, and he knows that it isn't far to Truman to keep him trapped up in his fake little world with the Actors in the Truman show. Will Truman ever escape?",

Weir/Nichols don't dictate what reality is outside, and they don't just tell you what happens to Truman, because that isn't the point. The point is that anything can happen now, he's out! He's broken free of all the old, useless ideas, of ideas of himself and empty relationships. There were so many little visual things in this movie, like the boat being called the Santa Maria, and the physical beauty of the last scene. Perfect for the role was Carrey's vulnerability and the innocent dignity with which he carried himself. This is nothing new if you've ever seen him interviewed, he always seemed to me like a very sensitive man and an intelligent actor. He just has a sense of humour and few inhibitions--he does what he feels like doing, however loud he wants to do it, and everyone accuses him of being an idiot who can't act. Wonderful supportive artistic community! I also thought the movie said a lot about how people can be objectified, even when you really like them: at first Truman seems like a goofy sort of guy, harmless and sweet, but the movie opens up and you realize that there's this ...person inside, who's very wounded and yet very determined.",

The scene with him walking out the door. I'm aware that this is supposed to be the climax of the film, and I loved it as it is, but I felt that \"The Holy Grail\" by Hunters and Collectors would have made this scene absolutely perfect. Why?

No, I'm not a Carrey fan - though when I heard he was going to be in Truman Show I watched The Mask and knew why Weir had agreed to direct him.  In repose he has exactly the face that Weir seems to look for.  Anyway, I liked him in this.I'm no expert on technical matters, but the film looked great.  Acting has to be BAD for me to notice; nothing here was that bad.  Ed Harris played the obsessed director Christof brilliantly - a hypnotist's voice and an illusionist's hands.  The music was just right.  How many people spotted the ring-in in the soundtrack, Polish composer Kilar's The Preaching of Father Kolbe, and how it's used?  (For anyone who doesn't know, Maximilian Kolbe was a Polish Franciscan priest who died in Auschwitz in the place of another prisoner.)  But what hooked me was the story.   Truman Show reminded me of G K Chesterton  - not the Father Brown stories, but the theological polemics and over-the-top fantasies.  Surface glitter and intellectual wit concealing an emotional and spiritual double whammy.Yes, this film is a metaphor but subtler than it seems.   Christof ISN'T anything like the Biblical God but he's a pretty close image of the thing the New Testament calls \"the god of this world\", \"prince of the power of the air\", \"father of lies\" and \"a murderer from the beginning\".  Truman is all of us, a \"twentieth century boy\", modern/ postmodern man reared inside the closed universe of the rational materialists, an \"unreal city\", a God-free zone where Man is god and material happiness is the most we are allowed to hope for.  But what happens if we fall in love with someone who tells us it's all a Big Lie?  \"Get out of here.come and find me\". What if it's an open universe after all?  Open - but not empty.   The whole film works brilliantly as a Pilgrim's Progress for the heirs of the Enlightenment",

            "content": "The Truman show sits on a genre crossroads, with comedy, drama, romance and thriller all coming together to form one of the greatest films of the 1990's.The island of Seahaven is not far off being the perfect place to live, it is inhabited by the friendliest people of the United States, and with scarce litter and impeccable weather it is almost too good to be true. For all his life Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) thought that his lifestyle was no different to any other American's, with his perfect wife, delightful neighbours and 'loyal friend' Marlon (Noah Emmerich) who pops round with a four-pack of beer every now and then. It is when suspicions mount in Truman's mind, as to why members of the public ignore him if he runs in front of a moving car, or don't so much as turn a head if he curses in the middle of the street, that the plot line begins to unfold.As he strings together proof of his suspicions, Truman begins to plan his exit of the conspiracy that he feels is going on around him, at this point we meet the \"all powerful\" Kristof (Ed Harris), who is the director/producer/creator of the hit television program; The Truman Show. After meeting Kristof the audience realises that Truman is permanently being surrounded by a hive of actors and actresses, who improvise their everyday lives to create this haunting illusion of reality, so that Kristof can continue to run the world's most popular television programme.Kristof doesn't just want to make money from The Truman Show; he wants to mould the perfect man, by acting as the puppeteer above Truman's life. Kristof adopted Truman as a baby and from that day forward has put every emotion, thought and experience into Truman's head; I think that Kristof's character wants to create a world that contradicts the real world of poverty, crime and war.The Truman Show only concentrates on the last few days of Truman's life in Seahaven, but with the use of flashbacks the scriptwriters manage to give the audience a wide perspective of what has happened in previous episodes of the show - which were somewhat faulted by 36 year old Carrey attempting to play an 18 year old boy, a feat that not many actors can achieve without the help of plastic surgery. Needless to say these flashbacks inform us on the first girl that Truman ever loved: Sylvia; a rebellious actress who met Truman as a teenager, and attempted to tell him the truth before being thrown off the set by protective producer, Kristof.Director Peter Weir creates the idea of reality television by filming most of the movie with \"hidden cameras\". So wherever he goes, the fact that we are seeing Truman through a keyhole, or a car radio adds to the theme of the movie. I didn't tire of this, but at some points I couldn't help but wonder how there was a hidden camera filming Truman from underwater, but it's hard to enjoy such a momentous film if you pick out mere technicalities like that.The plot is tightly evolved around the idea of Truman feeling trapped, and he attempts to escape this incredulous lifestyle of perfection on several occasions.These actions conveniently allow Kristof to display his power, by trying to psychologically and physically stop Truman from leaving the island, using subliminal hints on the radio, and graphically showing aeroplanes being struck by lightning on posters. These unsubtle methods were one of the funnier moments of blatant censorship in the film, but when they fail to change Truman's mind, and he sets sail to leave the island, Kristof directs an electrical storm to strike his boat. This great film has got the nail biting climax that it needed to make it memorable in the film industry for years to come, as the film to create the craze of Reality TV.The Truman Show would almost definitely make my list for the top twenty films of all time. It gave Jim Carrey the boost in his career that took him away from his 'less sophisticated roles' such as; \"Ace Venture, pet detective,\" \"The Mask,\" and \"Dumb and Dumber.\" This serious roll as Truman Burbank proved that Jim Carrey has got more than one genre of acting style, and since then he has continued to show his true potential as an actor in recent hits; \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" The Majestic,\" and \"Me Myself and Irene.\" One thing that I hold against this film is that it began the reality TV plague that Britain has been infected with for the past six years. Programs like Big Brother, I'm a celebrity get me out of here, and Pop Idol have leached off the prospect that Andrew Niccol thought of when writing the script; filming the everyday lives of people for the public's entertainment. The fact is, I can no longer turn on my television without seeing a disgusting northern family get filmed \"swapping wives\" with an ideal posh family, or watch a celebrity eat a cow's testicle, and then puke it up shortly afterwards: and I therefore put the entire blame on George Orwell, and Andrew Niccol (writer of the Truman Show).I first saw this film when I was 8 and thoroughly enjoyed it, the sunny setting and funny scenes of Truman in front of his bathroom mirror are ideal for pleasing the younger audience. The concept of Truman being watched wherever he goes is probably more haunting for adults than children, so therefore I would say that it is suitable for almost anybody, probably not a film for the claustrophobic though.The turning point of Jim Carrey's acting career, and a film that caters for any mood! 9/10",

If they are obvious ones then fair enough, but this film is consistent and true to itself and paints a good enough picture of a world in which one man is put on a stage without him knowing it. But the true success of this film is how you cannot help but root for the guy (one of my personal top qualities of a successful film). You feel his pain and you just want him to get the hell outta there!!! I don't really like Christof much, he is a little one dimensional and a bit too on the evil side...a bit sick.

It can run your entire life, as it did Truman's. The media shapes who we are in real life. We are shaped by about 5 or 6 major corporations, which own everything around us. In Trumans case, he is controlled by one corporation. Christof will go to any extreme to give the fans what they want. At the end of the movie, he makes the whether so stormy that he almost kills his movie star for the sake of ratings. This is only a slight exaggeration of the extremes that the real corporations will go to for higher ratings. The real corporations tell you everything wrong with you, and they tell you the exact way you have to be in order to be acceptable to society, just so you will buy their products or watch their t.v shows.

So this movie could also be concerned as a satire.The director of the TV-serie, greatly performed by Ed Harris, had taken away the sence of the reality from Truman (Carrey) with his delusive, unreal world. The issue is, what does discriminate between the reality and the delution?Peter Weir, the director of Dead Poets Society, made this film excellent with his idiosyncratic style.

Who thought up this scenario, I don't know but it was an amazing piece to watch. I must tell you I cried near the end. I usually never cry over movies unless they are sad; but it had the music too and it was really good. Jim Carrey showed me that he can be sensible in one movie and I'm sure if you ask people \"What is one of Jim's best performances?\" They'd say \"The Trueman Show\" right back at you. I remember the scenes so well even though i have only seen it twice since it was released. I guess what they say it true: A good movie stays with you forever. Now I would recommend this movie to any of you out there, I gave it a 10/10 which is quite unusual for me.

Seahaven is a town that is portrayed as picture perfect in fact the set of a TV show. As a dramatic set of events occur Truman starts to uncover some clues and test his boundaries with things. I liked this movie because it always kept you on your feet with what is going to happen next. Multiple times throughout you just want to cheer on the underdog to unveil his ignorance and help him be enlightened of what is happening. Other times you are chanting on the other side wanting the story to continue. I would definitely want to watch this movie again and recommend it to other people due to its creative story line and way to portray the message they are trying to get across. Director Peter Wehr and writer Andrew Niccol do a fantastic job developing this concept and displaying it on the big screen.",

Bored with his life and desperate to travel, he begins to notice that something isn't right...Jim Carrey is excellent as Truman, proving that as with \"The Number 23\" (2007), \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004) and \"Man on the Moon\" (1999), he doesn't need to rely on silly faces and slapstick to give a great performance.

I didn't know the secret when I saw the film, and was able to enjoy the little doubts and wondering that the filmmakers so carefully planted. Truman's world is controlled by a TV producer named Christof (Ed Harris), whose control room is high in the artificial dome that provides the sky and horizon of Seahaven. He discusses his programming on talk shows, and dismisses the protests of those (including Sylvia) who believe Truman is the victim of a cruel deception. Meanwhile, the whole world watches Truman's every move, and some viewers even leave the TV on all night, as he sleeps.The trajectory of the screenplay is more or less inevitable: Truman must gradually realize the truth of his environment, and try to escape from it. It's clever the way he's kept on his island by implanted traumas about travel and water. As the story unfolds, however, we're not simply expected to follow it: We're invited to think about the implications. About a world in which modern communications make celebrity possible, and inhuman.",

Truman Burbank is the star of his own reality TV show and he doesn't even know it. He is the first star born on set and legally adopted by a TV show. We've all felt the sensation that \"this can't be happening to me, I must be getting Punked,\" But for Truman, this is his whole life. With a great cast and clever plot, Director Peter Weir weaves together a masterpiece. The movie points out the insatiable nature of TV viewers (aka US), and the extent that producers and directors will go to please their audience. Forget morals; forget people's feelings or reputations, \"we want to be entertained\". Weir compares us to the Romans. Just as the Romans craved entertainment at the expense of Gladiators, we crave entertainment at the expense and reputation of TV stars, athletes and regular people. How far is society willing to go? And at what cost? The Truman Show asks this of its audience.If you have not seen this movie, you must! It is just as, if not more applicable now than it was when the movie was released in 1998.",

By showing in the movie, the director clearly satarizes reality TV and shows how bad it is. I felt this was a very entertaining movie. It shows how Truman grew as a person and found the courage to search for more and to reach his dreams. He wanted to leave and go off to Fiji, but there was always something stopping him.

Isn't it false as Seahaven? Can people be so cruel? Just after the end of the show, the tragedy of Truman's choice... they ask for more. Niccol and Weir merit my special awards for best movie, script and idea. Carrey is perfect in his role. In Italy we say: \"10 e lode!\"",

            "review_title": "A great movie about sense of reality, fatherhood and desire",
            "content": "I think this is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen and I'll tell you why.The argument is about a guy, Truman (Jim Carrey) that lives a simple life, with no surprises. He grew, married, works every day, that's it. Just common and anonymous life like any other. But what his life definitely is not is anonymous, as the whole world watch every step he makes, every blink, every word, every snort. His whole world is a TV set built just to give scenery to his life. That means he lives in some kind of show being the only actor who does not perform. He really lives. The other ones are part of the set, a huge one. The purpose of this is to make a unique and completely naive show about a person's life, some kind of media true show / experiment. At one point, he became suspicious and tried to run beyond the scenes. Would he make it?There is not so much comedy in this picture, at least not when a take a reflective angle on it. Yeah, there are some scenes, here and there, and all throughout the movie wanders the sense of irony and ridicule. Still, the drama performs since the beginning.I always demand a good movie for show me the reality in the day by day and some perspective in a world that very often seems too shallow to worth analyze it. Reality and perspective, I've found them both here.Under the argument, original itself, there are two major \"themes\" that began to develop. The first of it, is the reality and solidness of the world we live. The other one is the fatherhood. And lingering all around, a third tune in this melody, the desire.Reality... How you define reality? Is reality what you touch, you smell, and especially what you see? Do the relations with the other human beings define reality? In Truman 's case the reality is a fake. Because he lives in a fake scenery, in a fake city, with hundreds of fake persons, all actors that perform all the time, but live not life at all (at least at the stage, of course). But the point is, doesn't does happen, in a lighter degree, in everybody's life? Because in one hand, we see what the TV and Internet shows, we trust that as THE source of information. They shape our vision of things. The media are OK for the show, the big entertainment show. However, can they be reliable to define reality? On the other hand, how honest about our feelings and thoughts are we in our normal lives? How much of what we are we show to colleagues at work, or fellow students, or friends, for that matter, or even our couples? How many times do we split appart what's happening inside and outside? Half and half, even less than that may be? So, if we define reality through our senses and relations, and those are not fully trustable, how can we know in what world are we living in? And that question remains all over the film.What made Truman discover the truth, that is that he was being cheated? Well, he started to watch carefully around, and began to question and test. At some point, he started to do so not because he was mistrustful, curious or just stupid. He started to search because he couldn't believe he would not be able to live his dream, to accomplish his wishes. Which were not other than to meet a girl his girl (Sylvia). Oh, yeah, Truman has his sweetheart. Took away from his life for the major of all sins, trying to tell him the truth. So his desire led him to the discovery of the truth, and so this is also a movie about desire. It's his desired what set him free at the end.Fatherhood... Why do I see that as a major theme in the movie? Well, Truman is an orphan, adopted by the company the director of the show rules. So he does have a father, and that is Cristof. He is legally and morally his father. But what a father! He can do with Truman everything many fathers dream to be able to do with their kids. He can supervise him every time he wants with countless video cameras. He designs his environment. He decides who he relates with, even who exist in his life, and manipulate Truman as deep as he wants to obtain the exact results in people interaction. He can take away the characters he don't like (Sylvia, his \"dead\" father). He can even order night and day in his son's world (literally). And all this, without paying any price at all. I mean, a father should suffer the reactions, critics and oppositions of his sons, but not in Cristof 's case. He doesn't have to suffer that because Truman doesn't know his life is being ruled, arranged. Oh, what a relief make all he wants with his son's life without suffering all the nuisances and the complains. Without any exposition at all.And at the end, what a furious father had Truman to face at. When the knowledge came, the rebellion followed. How could he dare? To rebel at him, the master, supreme power that make all decisions in his life. If he don't yield, Truman should be punished, with no remorse at all. Even killed, if necessary. And Cristof had the power to kill him indeed. This father is not just a father, he is a god. And who will prevail in the relation between this man and his personal god-father (!)? Is he just a puppet or a free man?Truman reminded us, no matter how it cost, freedom worth's it. His desire took him from his golden cage to a dangerous, unpredictable, tough world, but still a place within to be free. It's worth the price, no doubt at all.",

I think this was a very challenging role for him, because he has done so many comedy roles in the past. He should maybe make more movies like this one, although comedy is really his scene, but The Truman Show is a real winner for me. The story line is fantastic and the acting was really well done.

I will not tell you how the story goes because then I will say things that uncover already basic elements of the movie. You just have to see it for yourself.

The uniqueness in the story hits us so hard that we start questioning the reality around us.\nA man whose whole life is a reality show, all he does is shown live to the rest of the world. He has been trapped inside a set which is made to look like a city. Everyone except Truman is an actor who plays a part in his life and makes the show interesting. Truman is seen to have a perfectly normal life with his friends and his wife. Not even for a moment does he realise that his whole life has been a setup, a reality show. It is the arrival of Lauren Garland who tries to bring the reality in front of him. She couldn't put up with the fact that a man's whole life was nothing a hoax, a show to entertain people. She condemned the usage of human lives as lab rats. Eventually Truman realises the reality and goes all-out in breaking the barrier of the set and escape from this show.\nIt hits us with the paranoia of happening the same with us. The audience starts questioning their reality , whether they are in a reality show as well.\nIn my opinion, it also brings up a surprising fact.\n\"We accept the reality with which we are presented\".\nThe fact that Truman saw the same people everyday and they all did the same thing over and over again didn't bother him ever. That is true for all of us. We all are so habituated to our daily lives, which contains performing the same routine over and over again. This film shows us that our lives can be a reality show and it still wouldn't bother us as our perception of living a \"normal\" life has so narrow prospects.\nJim Carrey delivered a marvellous performance in the film, as always. His signature laughs along with the insane ability to express emotions shone throughout the film.\nThe film deserved all the awards it bagged, if not more. To me it is a creative and unique masterpiece forcing us to question our reality.\n\"In case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and good night\".",

This film had the potential to be a memorable and mindblowing dystopian vision of fame, media and how these provide people entertainment without any consideration of ethics or human dignity.Great film for people who are having the stereotypical Hollywood attitude of not engaging with the content and meaning of films after watching it.The whole concept of \"having a real human brought up in a fake world\" is in itself dumb. A person is only a product of their environment. Truman is/can not be a \"real\" person in his fake world but a fish in a fishbowl not knowing it's home is not natural. This show would have failed in this world because a person adopts the speech and behavioral style of others arund them. The concept of the TV show fails in not just basic human psychology but character building. For a being in specific reality and no resource to see other realities to know if its reality's nature is impossible. (Like the Obeying Absurd Norms experiment with the monkeys, bananas and ladders)\nHowever the film was well produced, directed, acted, so it's a good movie to watch. The only philosophy behind it that is worth thinking about is how for Truman there can be no real world because in reality to him, everything outside the TV studio (which is his reality) is fake.

Those who were looking for Ace Ventura were just dying to laugh at something - those who weren't saw the scene for the philosophical statement it really was.This is an intelligent, innovative take on what is actually a fairly standard SF convention - the idea of an enclosed universe, combined with the discovery by an inhabitant of that universe that \"reality\" is not what it seems.Many thought Jim Carrey got snubbed for a best actor nomination (most prominently Carrey himself), but the real injustice here was that the film was not even nominated for best picture.

It's also something that can infuriate you as the viewer when you see the show's producers try to manipulate him and keep him from living a real life. Very powerful stuff.When you watch this, the most difficult thing is figuting out Truman's character and getting into him, but once you are, you'll feel general compassion for him and he becomes a true hero. One of the rair times Carey actually plays a likeable character (the only other time I can think of would be in Liar Liar).",

In it's emotions, the pain, the helplessness covered in clownish behavior Jim Carrey's performance reminds me very much of John Lennon's music from the early 60s. A person who never stops feeling far too small and awkward for the big role he realizes to play. But he plays it. And people look up to him.",

Everyone around him, all the people he had ever met and met on a daily basis, were only actors and actresses. The whole world had seen him born, and they followed all of his stage of life ever since. From the first step he ever took to the day he got married with his wife, who also happens to be just acting her part in this show. The film plot begins to develop when Truman begins to gradually find weird things happen around him. He starts to go paranoid and believes people are following him. Truman show's directors are trying painfully to keep him in check, that he would not go beyond the script excessively. As the film approaches towards the end, this task is becoming increasingly difficult when Truman continues to test his limits and the doubt about the reality in which he lives increases. The film is gripping, you are anticipating the whole time what weird things he discovers happening next and how is he going to react in such situations. It is easy to keep interest until the end of the movie.",

Although of other descent - I usually favour European film - yet - more and more - and so often in the past - the US makes the most wonderful and deeply moving films - yet does not recognise its own art for its worth. Especially in terms of awards. But - they - the awards, are just objects - the celluloid evidence lives on and time proves the 'real' worth of films. Well - lets move beyond that issue. This is a disturbing and wonderful film. So well directed, so insightful, so moving. I am so sure this will stand the test of time. Have you ever thought - in a Shakesperean/Hamlet/clich\u00e9d sense that 'all of life is but a stage'? Have you ever thought of a 'Play within a play'?. Of course. We all question our existence - our god, our creator, our boundaries, limits, loves, the things we think we remember? This film addresses all those issues in a fun, deep, and very sensitive way. Moreover - in this age of 'reality TV' this film takes us to what surely must be the natural conclusion of this trend. The absolute and utter abandonment of the viewer to an existence of vicariously living through the 'idiots lantern' in the corner of the room. Any film that makes us think, that poses more questions than it answers is wonderful. Any film of that kind sensitively directed, wonderfully shot and with incredible casting, script and acting - is more than wonderful. Thanks Mr Wier et al for a masterful creation - I would recommend anyone to watch this - it works on many levels and will appeal to many people from all vestiges of society. Watch out for the boundaries in your life...watch and you'll see what I'm talking about.. AC",

There are moments in which the narration develops too fast and leaves some question marks (what happens to Truman marriage?).

Not surprisingly, Stuart is one of Jim Carrey's idols.A final testament to this movie's greatness is the stir it created at the Oscars. After Jim Carrey had won the Golden Globe for best actor, he was not even nominated for the Oscar.

He's actually living a life full of lies. He doesn't even got the chance to live as the person he really is. This movie is amazing and breathtaking because of the scenes. This will make you realize that not everything you see is real. This also shows how technology and media affects a persons' life. On the audience perspective who's been watching Truman for decades, the Truman show seems realistic because of the scenery, the place, sky and the settings. The ending left us all hanging because we doesn't have an idea what happened when Truman already left the studio and got to see the real world and Lauren, the love of his life. This is a must watch movie. The efforts of the cast and staff is worth it because the result of the movie is successful.",

The film is basically about a guy called 'Truman Burbank'(Jim carrey) who is put into a town since he was a baby, this town is actually a film set! and everyone around him are all acting! The whole world are watching on TV at his every move! Thats what I love about the film, it has a great story, it adds lots of suspense to the film where Truman starts finding out that he's in a fake world created by a master genius 'Christof'. My favourate part is where on the radio it starts saying everything he is doing and Truman is getting suspicious, it has great music at that part and puts suspense into the scene, I like the way that the creators of the show made 'Truman's' father fall into the storm when he was on the boat, because of that he doesn't like water, at the end of the film he escapes by going into a boat across the water, but no one looks for him there because he is scared of water, when they see him in the water christof trys to stop him with any means necessary, but in the end Truman escapes and I love the line at the end where Christof says 'say something, your on TV' to Truman and Truman replies 'If I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and good night' and then he leaves, its great! It would have been better though if you could see what happens when he goes into the real world, but oh well its still a great film. The other funny part is where hes going mad in the car, hes spinning around the roundabout in the car and shouts 'Help me! Im being spontaneous!' I also love the way that he is in a perfect world created just for him, its nothing like the real world, Its great! I think that the Creators of the Film have done a fantastic job of making a Film with a great storyline and a new concept completely different than other films! Well done! Excellent work!",

I'm not a movie critic obviously. I don't like to \"review\" movies. I like to talk about movies, without injecting a great deal of scholarship into the discussion. I have lots of education; an MBA and everything. But, some of these plots in new films are quite interesting. Who hasn't had experiences time that mirror some of these plots? I myself, have tried my hand at various occupations, like Truman's. I have been an insurance agent, and a real estate agent. All of us who have worked at these things know that fellow that gives Truman the seasickness. All of us no longer able to even \"eek\" any more. But there's is prosperity everywhere! The people are happy! The media is not complaining about anything! They're all too busy with the presidential scandals I guess. I wonder where Sylvia will take Truman. May she is going to take him to school, where they'll be happier in some sort bohemian limbo, not noticing their squalor. Truman is a bit old for it. I  don't think he'll be happy. I like Hollywood movies better than ever sometimes. But one has to wonder if the public understands them. I guess the public has no choice but to accept and tolerate. I wonder how many Trumans there are. How could Truman become a member of the tavern? Maybe all he needs to do is pick up a mild alcoholism habit. Well, at least is nice to know that the people at the tavern speak up for Truman. Poor Truman! Do you think Mr. Birbank Sr. was also an actor? Before he became a hobo, that is. Did he join the people at the tavern or not? Well if you haven't seen The Truman Show, you are missing out on a much better movie than Titanic.",

I saw many comments on that movie and some people find it too complicated or hard to understand. Everyone has a different opinion. Some people like it, some people don't. I even saw people talking about the fact that it's impossible that an human being stay alive more than 30 years without getting any light from the sun, and it's alright like that.I am personally a Jim Carrey fan and I think that most of the other fans of Mr. Carrey were ready for the transition he made in The Truman Show. Of course if you go to the theater with the idea to see a Jim Carrey movie like Ace Ventura or Liar Liar, you will maybe be disappointed. But if you know that the movie is first of all a drama, you will get out of the theater wonderfully transformed. It's like for The Cable Guy, some people went to the theater thinking they would see something like Dumb and Dumber and were disappointed. The Cable Guy was a dark comedy. The Truman Show is a drama. If you know that before seeing the movie you will not be disappointed.I said that The Truman Show transforms and it really does. Maybe not everyone will get into the story, but for those who will like I did, you'll search cameras in your bedroom (and I'm not kidding when I say that). I got the first ticket for The Truman Show at the theater of my city and I saw The Truman Show 3 times in the first 5 days it was at the theater. At all I saw it 7 times at the theater. I think that Peter Weir did a great, pure, touching and wonderful movie. The soundtrack is also wonderful and one of the posters of the movie (the one with the hundreds of pictures from the movie) is quite fascinating. I think that Liar Liar is the most funny movie of Jim Carrey but that The Truman Show is his most intelligent and touching movie. What can I say more? The Truman Show is an excellent and touching movie and a wonderful entertainment. Oh, and in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and goodnight!",

I loved this movie, it has the tightness within the conventions of the film that makes films like Die Hard so good, the camera hardly ever moves out of the confines of the \"studio\" that is Burbanks world.  From watching this we should question the morality of television, does it have the right to invade our lives, or has it become second nature to our lives and we should simply accept it as the normality of the way we live today.  The only real problem I have with this film is it ends too quickly, I would have enjoyed an extra 30-40 minutes at the end to conclude the film satisfactorily.",

There isn't much star power other than these two but people such as Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, and Natascha McElhone give great performances.After a strange chain of events including a light falling from the sky, being pushed against advertisements, and the reappearance of his dead father, Truman starts to think something is awry.When the Oscar nominations were announced on February 9, I was very surprised that \"The Truman Show\" could only get away with 3 nominations. Sure they were good nominations, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Original Screenplay, but I think that Jim Carrey was robbed. As he indicated with his win at the Golden Globes he indicated the Oscar would be pretty good as he did at the Oscars too that an Oscar would be great. Best Picture and Best Original Dramatic Score which it deserves slipped from their grasp.I think that this film didn't get the success it deserved.

            "content": "Warning: This comment deals with the ending of The Truman Show, so if you haven't seen it yet, don't read this comment.It seems that many viewers dislike the ending because it does not show us what happens to Truman in the outside world. Also, viewers tend to criticize the fact that the movie does not reveal the emotions of Truman as he finds out the truth.On the contrary, I believe that -- although the movie contains certain flaws -- the ending is perfect. By stopping as Truman leaves the set where the tv-show is recorded, the film brings across the simple and crucial point that as soon as Truman walks through the door, he escapes the cameras. Thus, whatever happens to Truman after he walks through the door, is no longer recorded by cameras and remains private to him. Whatever happens afterwards is no longer shared with millions of tv-viewers and, indeed, movie-viewers.For similar reasons, the movie does not show us the emotions of Truman as he finds out the truth. Just as the cameras cannot follow Truman as he walks off the set, they cannot record his private thoughts and emotions. Indeed, Truman himself explains to the director of the tv-show that he cannot know what Truman feels, because he is unable to look inside his head. Truman does not WANT to share his emotions with the rest of the world. Therefore, he turns his back to the camera at this point, and neither the tv- nor the movie-viewer get to see his private emotional reaction.In conclusion, it seems ironic to me that the ending of the movie has been criticised. Those who want to know what happens to Truman as he leaves the set of the tv-show and want to know what his emotional reaction is, are implicitly saying that Truman should not be allowed to escape the cameras. They want the movie or, in other words, the tv-show to continue. That is, those of you who criticise the ending of the Truman Show, are unknowingly endorsing the fictional tv show itself.Just take a minute to think about that.",

Subject matter is equal parts entertainment culture and life in private bubbles, with some interesting side commentary about education, intelligence gathering, little white lies, family matters, mass marketing, and many things.I'm not too pleased with the Academy Awards to say that Carrey, Harris, and Weir should have each received more than nominations for this. Some people have a quiet modesty about accepting and supporting the choices of the Academy Awards, and there is cultural impoliteness in reaction to criticism of Academy Award judgments. I no longer understand why people should feel modest about a system they do not take part in, but I can understand that people believe they've taken part in that system when its judgments reflect their own. In any case, sometimes seeing great artists receive nothing more than 'Lifetime Achievement' awards as a concession for the judges overlooking them for so long is not very rewarding. People who work very hard should receive at least recognition; people who are good at their work should be rewarded. When an actor's career is marked, as Carrey's is, by numerous upsets against the Academy's judgment, it becomes obvious that the Academy has seriously lost its way.",

This film is sinister. It will leave you feeling monitored and paranoid, if you think about it properly. The premise that your world could be entirely manufactured and that your every move could be being watched intently by thousands upon thousands of people (Big Brother, anyone) genuinely scares me. The film also manages to strike at the concepts of advertising ( the scenes which involve this, with the two guys pinning Carey to a billboard, are hilarious) and product placement and places it more in line with the anti-capitalist, anti-consumer society message which flows from both American Beauty and Fight Club. All in all it is a great movie and is very moving, with an excellent performance from Carey.",

The cast includes: \u0095 Jim Carrey (Truman Burbank) \u0096 a very different movie for what Jim Carrey would unsurely act in. He is more in the comedy movies and this is not that much of a comedy. \u0095 Laura Linney \u0096 (Meryl Burbank/Hannah Gill) A lot of movie experience starting from 1992-2006. As well as movies coming out in 2007. \u0095 Noah Emmerich (Marlon) \u0096 started movies in 1993 and is still in many movies today. Is different for this Noah because he is not normally a supporting roll is more a star roll when he is in movies. \u0095 Natascha McElhone (Lauren/Sylvia) \u0095 Holland Taylor ( Truman's Mother) \u0095 Brian Delate (Truman's Father) \u0095 Blair Slater (Truman as a boy) \u0095 Peter Krause (Lawrence) \u0095 Heidi Schanz (Vivien) \u0095 Ron Taylor (Ron) \u0095 Don Taylor (Don) \u0095 Ted Raymond (Spencer) \u0095 R.J. Murdock (Production Assistant) \u0095 Ed Harris (Christof) \u0095 Adam Tomei (Network Executive) \u0095 Paul Giamatti (Network Executive) I really enjoyed the movie and thought that it was serious but at the same time tricky and funny. I really like where Truman would always say Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night! I thought that it would was a nice thing to the movie. This movie is a littlie bit confusing and does take some time to understand. The movie starts with Truman living normal life and slowly finding out that something is wrong. Truman is the star of a hit show that is played 24/7 no adds or other programmes. He eventually finds out about this, and for time between then he has been acting all weird. Truman then become his old unmoral self again and makes the movie very cool. His life is a lie. He trusts many people and all those people are actors and are just making money of Truman. They are always told by Christof and the rest of the company what to say and what to do. The movie shows you a scene where the set is above the Hollywood sign. I feel that the movie ends in a fantastic way, the T.V show producer (Christof) talks to Truman trying to convince Truman to stay so that he can keep making money. In this scene Truman walks towards a door that he eventually exits from. This image makes it look like Truman is walking on water, while Christof is talking to him so it looks like Jesus is walking on water and God is talking to him. I loved the movie and I thought that it was well worth watching. I liked the way that the movie got a person that was funny and could be serious at the same time. The Truman show was great. Even though it was old and some people found it boring, I liked it.",

            "content": "THIS POST CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS ABOUT THE TRUMAN SHOW:\nThe movie The Truman Show has a huge satirical theme. The whole movie (and show) is about Truman, who is unaware that he is constantly being watched through secret cameras, and that everyone in his life is actually just an actor, and every event in his entire life has been staged.\nThis movie is still very relevant today, and might even be more significant. Since technology has improved since 1998, it's even more possible that there are small, nearly invisible cameras watching us. And there will always be the possibility that you're constantly being recorded, even if it's common knowledge that you are, such as cameras in traffic lights.\nThe Truman Show inflates the issue of cameras being just about everywhere by putting cameras everywhere in Truman's town, and it can be argued that Truman's character represents deflation. He's way too oblivious to his surroundings for way too long, which seems like a deflation of basic human intelligence.\nThis movie also uses connotation very well. In the beginning, strong, powerful words aren't really used that often, but after the movie reaches its climax, connotative words begin to appear a lot more frequently.\nThe audience of this movie is everyone in developed, fairly technologically advanced countries, and the target is likely the government or other institutions who may use cameras without permission or knowledge of the subjects.\nThe persona of the show is Truman himself, and is very effective as Truman realizes that he's being watched, and that everything in his life has been staged.\nThe Truman Show is practically based around a hyperbole. Everything that occurs in the movie, from the cameras themselves to Truman not being allowed off the island, are extremely overdramatized.\nThis movie also uses praise by blame and blame by praise to help get the satirical intent of the movie across. It \"blames\" Sylvia for trying to tell Truman what is happening. About a third of the way through the movie, the director/writer of The Truman Show is seen praising the show, and the entire movie shows watchers of the show completely invested in watching Truman.\nDelivery Notice for Liberty Public Schools: This correspondence and any attachments is sent by a student at Liberty Public Schools.

            "content": "\ufffc\ufffcTruman's dadMy Topic - # 1 Cassie Sharpe 8-4Chistoff's view of his created world is that it is, well to him, PERFECT. To others it would seem to be cruel, sick, unkind, corrupted and unusual to have a person TRAPPED in a world that is not real. I feel that it is a very strange thing to do to another living human being. Every thing Truman does the studio is prepared for. They know how to deal with him and his sudden actions. There are thousands of actors with one little ear piece. But there is one specifically. Truman's best friend since kindergarten and the one Truman trusts the most is Marlon. But Marlon is also the one who has to lie the most. Even though he doesn't want to he does. One of the most ironic quotes from the movie was said by Marlon as he talked to Truman. This is what he said \" Truman the last thing I would ever do is lie to you\". As I look at all of the personal and public things Truman has said or done, I disagree with Christoff's view of the world.In the dome that Truman's life is taking place, Truman is the only thing that is real. In the dome, there are more than 4,999 big and small cameras. Which, are placed all over the little town with lights and speakers. It is a little scary that everywhere you go someone is always watching you. At the beginning of the movie one of the lights fall from the very top of the dome so far up you can't even see it. Of course on the radio the next day they announce a plane was losing parts while flying through the air. Lucky for the studio and Christoff, Truman believes it. As for me I would become suspicious.Christoff, working as the main producer is a very smart guy. He really knows how to make a really good show. A very thoughtful quote from Christoff was, \"We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented\". Meaning, every problem, every speed bump we hit we will over come because we can deal with what we know we can handle. I think that this statement is a very true one, because if you are really set to some thing you can overcome any obstacles because this is what you really want. This quote is a very smart quote from a very unusual man, a monster some would say. some like many others too. I think he is an awful man and Lauren thinks so too.Lauren is a female actor which Truman meets at school and talks to in the library. Lauren tells Truman she is not allowed to talk to him. Truman replies with a cheesy answer \"Yeah, well, I can understand that, I'm a pretty dangerous character\". Lauren is determined to tell Truman the truth about his life. As Lauren takes Truman to the beach to tell him the truth she begins to tell him that they are coming for her so they need to talk fast. She also tells him her real name is Sylvia and that she is an actor and so is every one else and that his life is real but his reality isn't. For me, I agree with Lauren/Sylvia, if I were in her shoes I would tell Truman as well. A car comes rolling in. Her father jumps out and tells Truman they are moving to Fiji. As Truman grows older, he becomes determined to move to Fiji!Truman, as determined as he is, goes to a travel agent to book a flight to Fiji. He sees tons of warnings and safety precautions of why NOT to fly on airplanes. They say \"we can book a flight for you in July next year. Fiji is very popular\". Truman decides he wants to sail there himself. Truman is terrified of water ever since he was a little boy, because the studio made his father die/drown in the water. Christoff being so smart, made it so he would never sail away. I feel that it was a very smart move but still it was really mean to kill off some one who is so important to a child. But Truman is seriously determined to get out of his small town. Once every one is asleep Truman sneaks away, he tries to sail away. Christoff has a determination for himself: Not to let Truman escape. He thinks up a storm, literally. The storm is so huge he almost kills Truman. An associate says \"you can't kill him in front of a live audience\" Christoff replies with a smart but true answer \"He was born in front of a live audience why can't they be part of the end?\". As Truman recuperates from the storm he runs into a gigantic wall with his boat. There are stairs. Truman leaves and successfully got a real life. I believe that Christoff's view of the world was wrong. It must be scary to always be watched by someone you don't even know, or maybe its fun to always be the center of attention. I believe that you can do anything that you set your mind to. Truman worked hard to find out the truth once he knew something was wrong. This is a good way to be. In the end, I think that it is a good way to live your life. You need to be persistent and truthful and go with what you know is right.",

            "content": "Truman Shows us How to LiveThe Truman Show sets a good example for other movies, with hundreds of creative camera angles and shots. Music, one of the three sounds of film plays a drastic role in the structure of the movie. The score is mostly classical which sets the stage for the rest of the movie.\nThe Truman Show, directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol, takes place on the man-made \"Seahaven Island.\" The movie begins with Truman (Jim Carrey) exiting his home to commute to work. The sky is bright blue with a few clouds here and there. A day most would consider perfect. He greets his neighborhood with a smile and just before he enters his car, his neighbor's excited dog jumps up and greets Truman. He enters the city and the audience is introduced to a pair of twins named Ron and Don Taylor. The twins inconspicuously push Truman's back against an advertisement which is perfectly in frame of a close-up shot. This exact set of events happens everyday at the exact same time. This is where the audience really has the opportunity to puzzle these pieces together on their own. Once Truman arrives in his office, he makes a private phone call to an airline service in an attempt to book a flight to Fiji. We the audience are shown that Truman does not wish to continue life on Seahaven Island.\nThe issue with leaving the island is hidden from Truman. Seahaven Island is a live TV show, with everybody being an actor except for Truman. There is a group of people standing in protest of The Truman Show due to the unethical nature of the plot. One protester (Lauren Garland, played by Natascha McElhone) was able to contact Truman by disguising herself as an actor. They go on a small date and she begins dumping truth into Truman's ears. She explains that nothing he ever experienced is real and the whole island is made for him. Her father who was actually just another actor collected her and before he left, he told Truman that they're moving to Fiji. This is the reason Truman wants to leave Seahaven Island.\nTake into account that he was born on live TV, and continues to live on TV. The Truman Show captures the emotions one would feel if they were forced to experience everything in life being fake. Once Truman begins to discover what his life truly is, he does things unexpected and erratically. One example of this is Truman walking into his office building and immediately back out, then entering another. The stage crew never expected Truman to be in that building, and when he called an elevator, the door opened to a group of movie employees on break. They quickly try to cover up the mistake by having security throw him out of the building. While this is all happening, we are viewing a close-up shot of Truman with loud classical music as he breaks the simulation. This music gives the entire sequence a sense of unknown. The look on Truman's face reflects utter confusion along with determination. The confusion that Truman is able to convey when his father who supposedly died at sea is rushed off the set by men in black. By using Truman's emotion we're able to empathize with him and that is one of the biggest factors to making a good movie. Assuring that the audience is involved in Truman's conflicts allows us to experience the movie, not simply watch it. The director's motive with this strategy is to completely blow other mystery movies out of the water. Comparing this film to other psychological mysteries shows how devoted Peter Weir was in producing an effective film.\nThe goal of a good movie is to engage the audience, allow them to make assumptions about the film and come to their own unique conclusion. One story is split into hundreds simply because we all have our own experiences to draw comparisons to.\nThe Truman Show receives a positive review from me for a lot of reasons. Those reasons being: Suspense, Humor and the biggest being Creativity. When I watched The Truman Show for the first time I was astonished. I believe that this film deserves a spot on everybody's Top 10, the camera angles and positions emphasize the fact that they're hidden. If you haven't watched this movie, you definitely should soon!",

A few things i disliked were when the actors were advertising products they over did it, giving it away to Truman that they were talking to someone else. I think that the director wanted to show what a \"perfect world\" would be like and what it would drive people to do, I think that he successful in doing this. Compared to other Jim Carrey films he was not as crazy, but he still made random dictions and he was very determined to do what he felt he needed to do.",

This is also a very different sort of role for Jim Carrey to play, instead of being out of control and crazy he plays a quite normal average joe trying to live an everyday life. I think the director and writer were trying to show how interesting normal peoples lives can be.

Everyone in the town of Seahaven is an actor except for Truman himself and their job is to act like everyday town-folk and keep him away from the possible show-breaking truth. The closest people to him are his wife Meryl(Laura Linney) and his best friend Marlon(Noah Emmerich). One day an ex-show member Sylvia(Natascha McElhone) appeared and tries to tell him that \"it's all fake\", \"none of its real, its all a show\" etc so his wife and friend Marlon have to convince him otherwise. But he got curious and tries to escape and the creator tries to stop him but he insists on being free. Jim Carry's character is a little calmer and less crazy compared to movies such as Ace Ventura for example but makes up for it in other ways. This is a really good movie written by Andrew Niccol and directed by Peter Weir.",

The story got progressively better and I found myself screaming for Truman to keep going at the end. It was an extremely interesting plot line. The only thing I didn't like is kinda the ending because I thought it would be so difficult for him to live his life after his life being a simulation. They tied everything together so well. Amazing acting from Jim Carey. The plot thickened as the movie went on and it took so man turns. It was a beautiful story and it was told very well.

Then he started to realize and try to escape the island.\nFor the acting skill I just thought Jim Carrey played just Rom-Com movies. But this one on the drama scene. He did it so well so touched my feeling. Every character, they are in to it.\nI really like when they put the border in the picture to be the camera frame. It made a feeling, we are the audience in Truman show\nI think the music in this movie is really ear catchy. While in the movie, I just felt like I've heard this soundtrack before even it's my first time watching this movie.\nEnding is really sarcasm, they watch Truman for all of their whole life. But when he get out from that world, they just change the channel. Watching another movie\nI don't know what to say, This is one of the best movie I've ever seen. I like this movie a lot.

My favourite two scenes are: when Truman's father is reintroduced and the event is 'orchestrated' by Christof; and also at the end when Truman is sailing and hits the edge of the studio. The acting was top notch: in particular Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed Harris' performances were stunning. I must also mention the music- it captured the moods perfectly.

People only travel in a small area around their work and home.The whole world is living in a real Truman show/ Matrix.What people know of the real world has nothing to do with real life experiences but is second hand from books, TV and the Internet.People tend to visit the same places over and over again.On the Truman show the main character is imprisoned in a massive television sound stage that contains his entire home town. He fights to escape when he realises his world is fake. His world had defined boundaries, the walls of the sound stage.Intuitively we think that we understand our own natural behaviour...For research and more see: http://www.deathtoglamour.com/cat/3-blogs/articles/401",

As society is more and more relying on the digital world of television and media to entertain themselves, it's a good step back to see how it can affect others. Especially now, I think that we often place our own desire to be entertained above the well being of actors, with our view of the actors as just that- actors, with little to no regard of their own personal lives as fellow citizens of the world. With Truman, although viewers related to him and truly cared about him, the directors controlled his life from the moment he was born, caring very little for what Truman himself would have thought about it. I loved the way that they transitioned the storyline and how, at the end, everything was both neatly wrapped up, but also left for interpretation regarding Truman and his life outside of the TV set, as it should be.",

Carrey shines through in every scene with funny facial expressions as Truman struggles to discover the truth of his life. Other performances are equally strong, with Laura Linney and Ed Harris both delivering fantastic performances in their respective roles.The film carries a powerful message about the dangers of modern technology and the importance of knowing one's true self. This is powerfully revealed through Truman's journey of self-discovery, as he finally uncovers the truth of his life and the lies he was told.The Truman Show is a truly engaging film, with a powerful story and very good performances. It has become a classic, and will also be enjoyed by the next generations. Highly recommended.",

Little does he know that every single step he takes gets recorded and people admire watching him on their TV screen. But once he falls in love with Lauren, things start to change and seem more suspicious day by day when suddely his reality becomes just a reality show...In my opinion, the film was quite entertaining and enjoyable to watch. What I liked a lot is that the places and generally the environment matched perfectly to the vibe of his lifestyle. Admittedly, I was a bit disappointed of the sudden ending and would've expected to see what happened later. But in the end, his last and probably most often said line \"Good morning, and in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and good night!\" kinda saved it for me because I think it's something special and meaningful when a character has an extraordinary or unusual habit. Regarding the acting skills, in particular Truman's , there is nothing to complain about. I personally just think that some scenes that were supposed to be serious and dramatic seemed a bit funny instead of sad. What I can say is that it was not really my sense of humor but the elderly would be impressed for sure.To sum up, it's worth giving it a try, but it definitely is not a must-watch too. As I already wrote, I have the feeling that older people would like it more, so I would especially recommend it to them. You can say that it's a family friendly and fun film that you can even watch with your grandparents, which might save your from the difficult situation of chossing an appropriate movie.",

I think sometimes everybody forgets something or oversleep, and it is impossible for him to have a perfect day for his whole life.Since his birth, Truman Burbank has been the main character of the series without even knowing it Producer, Christophe designed an artificial world in which Truman is observed by over 5000 cameras, 24 hours a day. In order not to cause facade to collapse, his wife, friends and relatives are all actors. However, there are various accidental incidents that make Truman suspicious.So I think the message of the movie is that perfect lives never exist, and the problems or complications let our characters grow.All in all, I would recommend the film strongly, especially to watch with kids or teens, because it teaches them that to be perfect is boring and otherwise it is a must-see.",

The film allows him to be funny, but while keeping a sincerity about it meaning we are desperate to find out what happens.The directing is incredible in this film, \"Spy Cameras\" are used very effictively meaning we feel as though we are watching The Truman Show as a real programme on TV and not as a film.I left the cinema feeling the same as I did when I first watched \"The Great Escape.\" This is a feeling of sadness and hoping that something like this will never happen again, except with The Truman Show we have to remind ourselves one thing, it is only a film!",

It gives him the chance to really shine as an actor, combining the comedic and the dramatic to get an extremely likable character. Its his best role, in my opinion. And, honestly, he is the reason to see this film because I don't think it would be as interesting with another actor. I really liked the soundtrack to this film as well, it was very moving at times. The rest of the cast also did a fantastic job. The Utopian scenery blends in perfectly into this film and makes it all the more interesting.

While I do not consider myself a movie buff, I will say I have seen a number of movies in my life and this movie was not only captivating but it moved me.  While many people say movies are moving, this film made me truly think about the world around me.  It was a great cinematic achievement. By the way, one of the comments said that the town in which Truman lives (Seahaven) is unrealistic and I would just like to say that not only is the town realistic but is actually filmed in Seaside, a planned resort community on the coast of Florida.

            "content": "Jim Carrey is primarily known for his silly characters and odd roles. However, \"The Truman Show\" truly shows how brilliant he can be. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) has lived his entire life, literally, in a virtual reality. His entire life is broadcast on television, completely without his knowledge. His wife, friends, co-workers, everyone on the street are all actors. His existence is essentially created by a producer named Christof (Ed Harris, showing his own brilliance). The theme of \"appearance versus reality\" is apparent throughout the entire movie. Truman believes his life to be real, when it fact it is very controlled. The \"townspeople\" are all linked by radio earpiece to the producers so that they may receive instructions to keep Truman from discovering the truth about his world, the smallest cameras ever made are utilized to capture Truman's every move and the show even has its own satellite in order to broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. \"The Truman Show\" has been the most popular show on television for 30 years, literally since Truman was born. Eventually, Truman begins to suspect that something is amiss, such as a stage light falling out of the sky, an elevator without a back, even an alleged nuclear power plant meltdown when he tries to escape town keeping him from leaving. His suspicions become so strong that he eventually confronts his wife Meryl (Laura Linney) with them and she accuses him of having a nervous breakdown. At this point, Jim Carrey shows his acting talent and transitions from comedy to drama. The effect is profound and Meryl drops character, screaming that she can't work under these conditions and that it is unprofessional. Eventually, Truman realizes that his reality isn't real and escapes the town. The camera angles in the movie were interesting, many times using a fisheye lens to give a bugs' eye view from a wall or from behind Truman's medicine cabinet mirror. The cameras are scattered through town, Truman's house, workplace, even worn by the actors. Christof even admits in an interview that \"We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.\" \"The Truman Show\" seems to be the predecessor of modern reality television. It's touted as \"reality\", but it is heavily controlled by producers and an on-site crew and, at times, is scripted. \"Popular Mechanics\" listed \"The Truman Show\" as one of the 10 most prophetic sci-fi shows in 2008. Director Peter Weir actually stated \"This was a dangerous film to make because it couldn't happen. How ironic.\" when predicting the rise of reality television. \"The Truman Show\" certainly stands out among movies, especially when compared to modern reality television. Even if one isn't a Jim Carrey fan, \"The Truman Show\" is definitely worth watching.",

You create your reality every day with the way you think, your perception about things, the programs/scripts that you follow subconsciously and consciously.How many times have you found yourself doing something even though you know you shouldn't? You think you are doing so with your free will. Are you? Yes, if you always make rational choices. But it isn't possible for a human being to make rational choices for the thousands of actions we take each day. Many are automatic. Further, our emotions are largely subconscious and automatic. Think about people who are very emotional, and how little control they have over themselves. Thus the term \"prisoner to your emotions.\" To the extent your thoughts, feelings, and actions are automatic, you are a prisoner in a world of your own making.Consider that we are all being controlled by others to some degree--other people, other people's thoughts, other people's patterns, other scripts, the media, the government. Any time you allow yourself be led, you are being controlled in the same way. Now, this isn't always a bad thing, and most of the time it's a good thing. Consider what civilization has built with leadership: medicine, safety from anarchy, space travel, food, shelter and grand buildings, and so on. Consider too the horrific worlds which Hitler, Pol Pot, Stalin and too many others created. Will we let this happen again? Yes, if we let our minds become imprisoned by a leader like them, again.At first I thought the premise of the movie was silly from a legal standpoint: The TV Truman Show (in the movie) would be unconstitutional since it deprived Truman of liberty. I also thought it was implausible that an actor would commit a good portion of his/her life, as with Truman's wife, just for a chance to be rich and famous.But wait...we know that the movie makes obvious statements about greed, with the product promotion in the TV show, and Christof's goading over the show's ratings. Perhaps then the movie creators were suggesting that with intense lobbying by media companies, Congress could pass laws to make such a TV show possible, depriving Truman's liberty for his entire life. Scary thought, but think about the results of lobbying in the real USA: tax credits for SUV's, our government's position on global warming, industrial mercury emissions poisoning our children.

I watched Ace Ventura the other day, and was blown away by how annoying Carrey was in it. Almost all of his films before Truman Show were equally annoying. Yet Weir was able to turn him from a one-trick pony into someone that delivered one of the best performances i have ever seen. The same can be said for Williams, who was not known for his dramatic acting abilities, yet Weir cast him in a role that was quite touching. Ford was known mainly as an action star before starring in Witness, but in that movie he gave a realistic, brilliant performance. All i can say is WEIR IS THE MAN",

The entire world is watching literally every time Truman makes the slightest the move. This hilarious eye-opening film by award-wining Peter Weir includes the character of Truman Burbank, who is completely unaware that his whole life is an unending soap opera (running for over 30 years) for consumption, by the real world. Everywhere he turns, everyone he talks to, everyone he thinks he knows, are just actors paid to be part of his existence.The Truman show has many messages for the general public to consume, I think the most important message is that the media has the power to control every aspect of our lives so easily, and how so many people can be brainwashed into believing that something is so much more important than it actually is.In this surprisingly touching 1988 film - in the genre of comedy-drama \u2013 written by Andrew Niccol and produced by Paramount Pictures, Jim Carrey gives his character of Truman Burbank emotional honesty and comical intensity. Whilst other members of class include Laura Linney as Meryl, best supporting actor Ed Harris as Christof, Noah Emmerick as Marlin and Natascha McElhone as both Sylvia and Lauren.The movie is based around the character of Truman Burbank \u2013 a life insurance sales adviser, he has a successful career, a beautiful wife, a close friend and a very nice house. Nevertheless, he isn't satisfied with his life. Since he has never left his hometown of Seehaven, he begins to feel the urge to go and explore the world. But as his wife neither understands nor listens to him and everyone discourages him not to go away, Truman begins to feel alienated. To add to his growing dismay, a series of strange events unravel in his life, which lead him to suspect he is the victim of some kind of conspiracy. This show for me was 5 stars because of Jim Carrey who executed his role of Truman Burbank perfectly. if you loved this PG movie you will live Mr Poppers Penguins which also stars Jim Carrey, it's a hilarious family movie a lot like this one. What do you think? Watch both of these and see what I mean.And make sure your not the star of a TV show you are oblivious to?This one is for all you Truman Lovers ' Good afternoon, Good evening and Goodnight.'",

As the camera starts rolling and our 103 minute journey begins, we meet Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), a man who has been filmed since the day he was born. He lives in a made-up world with a made-up family in a made-up town full of actors. Meryl (Truman's wife) is an advertising 'perfect' wife as far as the eye can see. Many other reviews that I have read of this film (I do my research you see), have praised Laura Linney (Meryl) as a star actress. While the part is played to perfection, the fake demeanour is so obvious to viewers and so unclear to the gullible character of Truman. I however, find Meryl's character the only blemish in this film. I am not criticising Linney's acting skills, but the personality of her character. I find the fake and false charade grates on me and I find myself wanting to slap the practised-in-the-mirror smile right off her face. So while I can tell you the flaws of this film, I can also tell you its highlights. It's a funny, happy comedy in a sort of could-be-a-pantomime way. I liked it, I didn't love it, but it's a family film all the way through. My criticisms are trumped vaguely, by the staggering figure of $125 Million box-office takings (It started with a $60 Million budget). This film takes an unusual and unique approach to the family film market, no princesses or castles and while you could say it has a happy-ever-after ending, the cliff-hanger toned it down. It may not be the best film, it may not be the funniest but it was good. Kids will like it. 3 out of 5 Stars.",

His friends and family are actors as his life is made up. Truman tries to go on adventures but the under cover actors around him persuade him out of it. In the end Truman starts to be aware that it's all lies. Review: In my opinion, the film is funny and entertaining. The acting was believable and it's a great story line. At the beginning you have to pay more attention to understand what's going on and what's happened to Truman. Ed Harris, who played Christof, was nominated for 3 Oscars as best supporting actor, best director and best writing/ screen play. The Truman Show is a PG certificate and the genre is comedy and drama. Also it was first realised in October 1998 but still really popular and still good quality. The budget of the film was $60 million and the box office takings were $125 million, just from the cinema takings alone, which is a great achievement and great fro the show. It helped that the producers of this show was paramount pictures, a very popular company and it was directed by the amazing, Peter Weir. If you love the big brother serious then you'll definitely love this, however, you don't have to love it as I don't because I still enjoyed The Truman Show. I give this film 4 stars out of 5.

During the 30th year of the show running Truman starts to notice weird thing's about his perfect life like almost getting crushed by a falling light, the car radio pickups the camera crews radio broadcast following him around and he see's his dad who snuck on to the set, so Truman sets out to find out about his true nature even though Marlon(Noah Emmerich) his best friend tries to talk him out of it.I never really liked Jim Carrey's overreacting I just thought it was annoying and cringe worthy at best, but he's acting in this movie was much better than usual. And with great acting from the supporting actors like Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone and more, they made this movie a good time watching. The movie is reality television on drugs. The Truman Show foresees the current reality televisions mania. I have to say that the movie was a overall great movie watching experience. I strongly recommend this movie.",

The film is certainly uplifting due to Peter Wier's brilliant direction and it works brilliantly. The idea is a bit far-fetched (I'll be truthful, it is incredibly far-fetched and will never happen) because creating a world within a world is not humanly possible. Forgetting about that, it's very enjoyable and has one of the best ending climaxes I've ever seen in a film. The Truman Show is like nothing else and is different for all the right reasons! I don't normally like Jim Carrey (In-fact, I hate him) but I loved him in this film and I'd recommend it to anybody. Ed Harris's portrayal of Christof (the creator) is brilliant and he certainly contributes to the brilliant ending! It's a brilliant film...SEE IT!",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a 1998 film starring Jim Carrey that emphasizes the unfortunate circumstance of our own views of a perfect world. The main character, Truman Burbank, stars in a wildly popular television show about the picture-perfect little town of Seahaven, which resides inside a large dome in Hollywood, California. The ultimate goal is to entertain the general public by filming the life of one citizen's entire life without having been given consent to do so. Therefore, everyone in the town is an actor, and everyone in the world knows about it\u0085 Except Truman. The Truman Show is an example of many satirical aspects, including a central problem, irony, and connotation. The movie goes into great depth about how Truman's life seemed so perfect to everyone, until he finds out and he does not find it so perfect. In our society, everyone believes everyone else's lives are so much more perfect than their own. This is highlighted in the way that the movie directors have no idea why Truman is so anxious to get out once he starts to uncover the truth. Additionally, we find ourselves heavily identifying with Truman, and feeling his same pain as he struggles to break free of the world that was created around him. The world revolved around him, and it was all that he wanted to escape. The directors of the The Truman Show in the movie often disregard the fact that Truman is human, not a caged animal to be observed. They also fail to realize that his fighting for his freedom is more ethical than them trying to keep it away from him. Indeed, they often make it seem like the end of the Truman Show is the end of the world, but it's only the end of Truman Burbank's involvement in a world that was never real. The Truman Show is an excellent outlet for realizing and correcting our own human flaws of ideas of perfection and the lengths to which we will go to quench our own entertainment needs.",

It shows how this kind of \"utopia\" is not what the human race needs and in a way how when we have all the things we need, we find issues with it and other things to desire. The film possessed various elements of satire, using a strong persona, tone, hyperbole and irony. Truman's tone and view at the beginning was basically the view of people that think this society is possible and a good idea. Towards the end, his tone changes which propels the audience to continue to agree with the movie's creators or to change their mind completely. In the film they also use hyperbole in the case of how much all these people care about this random guy's life, and they over exaggerate the perfect sunshiny place that Truman lives in. Although this movie is about sixteen years old, it definitely still applicable to our society today. Now it relates to not only watching people's lives on TV (like Keeping Up With The Kardashians) but with social media, whether you are \"watching\" people you know on Instagram, Twitter\u0085 etc or if you are following the lives of people you do not know on YouTube or Vine. Although this takes on a much different purpose, The Truman Show could be related to the Hunger Games in the way that there is a central power that controls everything, and the weather-controlled, camera monitored dome is very similar to the arena used in the Hunger Games.

            "content": "The Truman Show tells the story of Truman Burbank, who unknowingly plays the main character in a TV show all about his life. Themes of the movie, including how the media influences our thinking, the perversity of advertisements, and the lack of privacy we have in our day to day lives (although inflated) draws many parallels to our lives today, making it more watchable now than when the film first came out. The direction that the producers want to send Truman in is made clear through thinly masked dialog. When Truman starts to reach his mid-life crisis and want to travel, his friend, Marlon, tells him that, \"You don't have to leave home to find out what life is all about.\" Today's news stories are being targeted here, based on how they typically lean in one direction or another, rather than report only facts. The Truman Show airs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. With a broadcast schedule like this, there is no time for advertisements, so advertisements are worked into Truman's life. Marlon is never present without a beer in hand, and Truman's wife is constantly promoting kitchen and gardening tools right in front of him. To see this on the show seems a little ridiculous, but from giant billboards to short ads before youtube videos, there aren't a whole lot of ad-free places in our lives today. As the main character of The Truman Show, Truman Burbank is on camera a lot, meaning he doesn't have a whole lot of privacy. When the show's creator, Christof, is being interviewed, the interviewer thanks him for the opportunity, saying, \"We know how much you value your privacy.\" It's ironic how this man values his own privacy so much, but can allow Truman to go on without any. Today we have a lot of issues with privacy, namely with the NSA monitoring scandals. These reasons are why I would suggest watching the movie if you haven't seen it and why I would suggest re-watching it now if you haven't recently.",

The movie shows a great example of inflation, as Truman was essentially a prisoner that was used for entertainment. This movie is extremely satirical, as it has dark undertones throughout. Even the way the actors had product placement was slightly unnerving. A good example of the unnerving feeling the audience gets, as well as of irony, was when Truman's \"best friend\" was being fed lines and said \"I would never lie to you, Truman.\" It also is there to emphasize just how cruel the entertainment community can be.This satire also shows that not everyone can be trusted, as even Truman's supposed \"loved ones\" were just actors being paid to interact with him. It makes the audience think about who is in their life and if they're really there for them. The target for this move is people who watch reality shows or shows that exploit the ignorance of one or more participants. These shows, however entertaining, still are using the ignorance of one participant to entertain the masses. There was an illusion to God at the end, when the creator started talking to Truman. I'm not quite sure if the purpose was to cause an existential crises, but that is how it affected me as an individual. It was very powerful, because the man who had protected Truman since the beginning was the only thing standing between his escape.

Playing a man growing up in a made up city run by a TV show that broadcasts his life is the much more literal and inflated idea of the media controlling everything the public sees. Weir targets the media and how they never give anyone any privacy. He shows this very literally in Truman's world, by showing his every movement and letting the whole world see it. The plot is a great use of Horatian satire to add the right amount of funny and light- heartedness, while also addressing the very real problem. It makes you laugh, but also cheer for Truman while he tries to find out the real truth of his world. The emotional connotations bring you closer to what Truman feels and how life changing an experience he is going through. You can see the fear and anger going through Truman as he finds out more and more about world. You can also see this fear in the director of the Truman Show, but for a very different reason; the fear he might lose the person he has grown up controlling and directing. The deflation of Truman's right to privacy can go hand in hand with what can happen in todays world. It may not be on the same level of the public watching your every move, but today, people can always be in contact with each other and see what everyone else is doing through social media and cell phones. Overall, the Truman show is a fantastic story that can be enjoyed at a simple level while you can laugh at Truman's world, but also enjoy it at a much much deeper level where his predicament can stand for much more serious real world problems that have become even more true 16 years after it was made.",

It uses irony to illustrate how he can't leave the island because he's afraid of water, yet at the same time yearns to travel. This is highlighted throughout the entire movie as he considers leaving to travel and find a certain someone. The other bit of irony found is when the director says that Truman can leave at anytime if he really wished to. However, you see that he is blocked at every turn trying to figure out what is going on and trying to leave. It's also a blame by praise thing. The director of the show and everyone who watches doesn't see Truman as being free to live his own life, making the viewer realize that he really isn't in charge of his own life at all, no matter what the people behind the camera want you to think. In fact, the people behind the camera are the ones controlling his life.To go along with that, they downplay important values that are essential or at least taken for granted by us. Values such as freedom to do what you want, privacy and the right to your own life. His life is not his own, essentially. Yet, he is deceived into thinking it is.

Unbeknownst to him, his reality is being controlled from behind the scenes. Truman begins to notice subtle cues that things aren't as perfect as they appear to be. The Truman Show points out our social desire to watch reality television to the extreme and shows the audience just how staged it all is.The Truman Show allows the audience to see Jim Carrey in a serious role. Often he has made serious points throughout his career, but always with a comedic edge. He tames his comedic expressions in order to appear the quintessential everyday normal man and yet is able to endear Truman to the hearts of the audience.When Truman's father attempts to tell him it's not real, he is removed from the cast of the show. Truman is told that he died at sea. This reinforces the fear of the open ocean that Christof, the director of the Truman show (Ed Harris) wants to instill in Truman. The final goal is to keep Truman contained. In college, Truman meets Lauren (Natascha McElhone) who falls in love with him and plans on revealing the truth. Again, Christof intervenes and she is removed from the show. When Truman fights with his wife (Laura Linney) a new love interest appears. His best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) appears to be more and more dangerous as he comes closer to the truth. Truman feels he is descending into madness. He counts how often the same car drives by to make his point. Stranger than Fiction (2006) also follows this line as a seemingly normal man begins to hear his life narrated.The Truman show starts off with a great deal of openness and lighting. Everyday appears to be a perfect sunny day. As Truman begins to notice things, the lighting starts to get darker. We see this when he tries to escape and is confronted by Marlon and later in the storm sequence. The lighting leads the audience to see just how unreal Truman's reality is. The openness changes as the film progresses. Early on the film uses wide shots showing the audience that the town itself is a character. As the movie progresses, the shots begin to tighten in around Truman. Yet even then the audience sees the enormity of Truman's obstacles in the final storm sequence. The camera pulls away from Truman and shows just how small he is against a seemingly vast ocean. When Truman's illusion of reality crumbles, he is finally free and no longer confined to a staged script.",

The ending is just brilliant - the script, the music, the bow, the exit etc. And Ed Harris really is superb in his role.I also love the way \"the show\" is only really introduced about half-way through, when the interview is done. Then you get just enough perspective to really get in to what's going on.I just can't put this down!!",

It was a great story about how a man can be born on a movies set where his whole life is fake. The movie pokes fun at reality t.v. and how they can change what really happens to something that would be interesting to viewers. It made you feel bad for Truman because he was trapped in a little town built inside a studio for the whole world to watch on a television screen. This story was definitely Horatian Satire because it was humorous and although it was sometimes dark it was meant to be funny. I am very glad I watched this movie. It was very entertaining and was a great example of a satire.",

            "content": "At first, this movie comes across as quite comedic, with very few hints as to what the underlying theme truly is. Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey, is a happy and well known denizen of a coastal town called Seahaven. His neighbors and co- workers are all great colleagues and friends, and he appears to have no enemies. After multiple uncanny events, he soon becomes paranoid and believes that he is being watched (which is dramatically ironic considering the circumstances that he is being watched). As he learns more and more about the reality of his world, he is quick to attempt an escape. Consequently, the actors playing as the rest of the inhabitants of the island try to sway him away from his beliefs, but fail in their efforts. Towards the end of the movie, he flees from the view of the cameras, and tries to sail to freedom. In a conflict between ethics and profits, the producer tries to kill Truman before he can reach the exit. Reluctantly, he is able to break out of the lie of the world that he lived in.As the plot developed, the true purpose of this movie emerged. The director of this movie inflated the issue of what the media does in a (desperate) attempt to increase their viewers. The fictional producer adopted an unwanted baby, which is good, but in hindsight, they enslaved him for the entertainment of millions. In note of the producers, the satire also addresses the argument of utilitarianism. Very few people rebel against the philosophy of entrapping an individual within a made-up world because the benefit of the majority is valued more than that of the individual. Even though this movie was released in 1998, its themes can still relate to modern day society because the media constantly goes beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable in broadcasted entertainment, with an ever-increasing acceptance of explicit and inappropriate humor and criticism.",

The movie executes showing this issue by taking it to the extreme and filming Truman's life 24/7 without his knowledge. Although The Truman Show was written in 1998, the problems the satire is exposing are still pertinent today. Today with all of the new technology we have these issues are even more prominent. Stars can't go anywhere without something being tweeted, posted, or a news report about the latest thing they've done. Overall I enjoyed this satire and I think it really helped open my eyes to just how much stress today's and past celebrities are put under to keep up their appearances for the media. Not only was The Truman Show a good satire but it was a good movie as well. I was entertained throughout the whole thing trying to unravel the mystery behind Truman's life and what was really going on. It was fun trying to piece it all together and it never got boring. I also really liked that it was comical and lighthearted without being childish. I would recommend The Truman Show to anyone looking for a fun and witty movie.",

People who watch reality television often do not think about the effects that this show has on its stars. The Truman Show is a good satire because it uses many satirical techniques. The Truman Show uses connotation when the lady is calling the show to try and free Truman. She uses the word, cell, to try and convince people that the director of The Truman Show is holding Truman captive, and that Truman would want to leave. The Truman Show is targeting the watchers and developers of reality television and saying that they should stop making reality television. The Truman Show is a hyperbole of the making of reality television because they greatly exaggerate the number of people and the amount on equipment that they need. In the show, the director says it takes the work force of a small country to run the show. The show, also, has a good bit of comedy. There are multiple lines that make the story seem very funny. Truman has lots of funny little jokes to keep the mood lighthearted. The Truman Show did have its worse moments. The show was not the best in the beginning because at first the story doesn't make tons of sense. The beginning has the director introducing the show, but it's the director of The Truman Show, which is watched by people in the movie. If you do not previously know that the movie is a satire, then you will have trouble understanding the beginning. The story does not make much sense until about halfway through the movie. Also, some of the people watching the show seemed very out of place. People today watch lots of reality television shows. Some examples are Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Dance Moms, and The Bachelor. These are some highly viewed shows. The Truman Show is still relevant today because of these shows. This satire is something that might need to be remade with today's technology because lots of younger kids will dismiss it. The real thing that makes it something worth remaking is really just the technology, the fashion, and the lifestyle. The Truman Show is relevant today, but just could use some modernizing for younger people, who are too young to understand this lifestyle.",

It made me re-evaluate how I saw the industry as a whole, as well as the media that surrounds it. The movie redefined what a \"private life\" was, and targeted the entertainment industry, and reporters that broadcast the private lives of those who are famous for a living. The movie made me realize that those involved in the entertainment industry don't really have a private life that they can hide from the world. Satirical elements such as irony was used when things in The Truman Show were described to be \"real\" and \"not staged\", there was inflation when they portrayed the idea of having no private life, because in real life, no one is actually filmed 24/7, and deflation was used to build the world, making The Truman Show, seem like a normal thing.

In the movie, it is clear how The Truman Show captivates the world to the point where it is all the people can focus on. This targets not just people from the past, but our own society today.

At the beginning, it is mentioned that the Truman Show is not just a job; it is a way of life. This is true for the audience of the show, as they are seen spending all their lives watching this show. One man is watching it in the bath. A whole bar is dedicated to the show, running it all day, every day. People have Truman Show memorabilia. People freak when the show stops airing for a small while when Truman is first found to have escaped. Even when the show does come to an end, they just decide to watch something else. Their lives revolve around the T.V. The show sucks them into this world. You are even shown this by the problem itself. You want Truman to leave, as do the people in the movie. You feel what Truman feels, want what Truman wants, and see what Truman sees. This movie is an example of the thing it's satirizing. The audience in the movie is a mirror of yourself when you watch it. The issue of the humanity (or lack thereof) in the movie is deflated, making you not think about how Truman is practically a zoo animal. We do this to unwilling T.V. stars all the time. When someone gets famous, we want to know everything they do. We make them an exhibit for us to watch. That was Truman's entire life, yet the issue is glossed over until it is brought up by his lost love. Of course, the entire piece is an inflation of T.V. in general. It takes the ideas of reality television and the money-hungry industry and takes it to an extreme. It takes a few well-placed jabs at the entire television industry and at the viewers, but it does fall a bit short. First of all, it is a movie. It is the media that it wants to bring attention to. This makes you wonder if the movie was actually made to bring attention to the corruptness of the industry or if it simply found another way to make money off of us and bring attention to itself. Second of all, the movie itself is not that satirical. You have to dig to find it, and even when you do, the satire never goes very deep. You, the viewer, have to add your own thoughts to make it truly satirical. The movie never blatantly states that is has issues with anything. This could just be a well-written story that just so happens to be satirical at times. Finally, this is just another work following a generic storyline we've heard countless times before. A character grows up in a Utopian, controlling society. He slowly learns about some major flaw in this Utopian world and his wish to leave is brought about. As he learns about how corrupt the world he lives in is, his wish grows. He eventually tries to leave, only to be stopped by those he loves, the society itself, and the creator or ruler of said society. He will overcome this and leave, only to join the real world or start their own modeled after today. This movie is a conversation piece, but one you'll soon forget about if it is not constantly brought up.",

This movie definitely seems to be more closely a Horatian satire rather than Juvenalian mainly because it is very upbeat and laid back. There are lots of innuendos that relate to the things we do in our everyday life. The author uses a type of irony called blame by praise by showing that the world he lives in is derived to be this happy perfect place when, in comparison to real life, it's not. The target of this film is most likely paparazzi and the people all around the world who get too caught up in knowing every little thing about every famous person's life. The film catches Truman living his everyday life, unaware of the fact that everyone is watching. It is a remarkably entertaining movie which sparks a lot of questions in your mind.

The movie is about a man who was raised on the set of a TV show, and knows of nothing else. I found the beginning confusing, as did others I know, but after half an hour to an hour, it will all fall into place and make sense. The satire in this piece is several layers thick, and much can be drawn from it. One of the main points is the comment on television. One of the things mentioned about what makes the show so entertaining is that Truman isn't acting and is thus very real to watch. This says some stuff into how TV at least at the time was not too relatable. Another comment was about how if it was too real, that can be weird, and not relatable. Some of the deeper stuff later, without spoiling too much, a comment is made by the director about how the real world is the twisted sick place, and the studio where Truman is is what the world should be like. This is a comment on how people perceive the world, and how people look at their own work. It is interesting he sees the world he created as the perfect version of the world, a vision of how it should be. Another message I drew from it was a comment on big brother spying. Whether it was intended I saw in the presence of so many cameras a comment on privacy invasions made by the government. I'm not sure if I'm drawing conclusions that aren't there, but as well as being entertained, I drew a good number of comments on society from this movie.",

But this also displays another human folly by showing that people often have an interest things they have shouldn't know about just because they are human and that is just a part of human nature. This is still prevalent to today because these issues are part of human nature and likely will never go away but people might eventually learn to control themselves and suppress these aspects.

Truman shows us that reality TV is more often than not nothing like real life. In real life, you don't get you're own individual raincloud, people don't look straight into a camera, people don't get escorted away for nothing, and, believe it or not, people don't parachute from the sky to tell you you're on a show. This movie, though it was made a few years ago, still applies to shows we have today.

During the interview there is deflation because he is saying something such as power of the media doesn't have much power but it actually has a lot of power. Another literary device seen would be the use of would be blame by praise. The Truman show, although having some people against it, mostly has an audience in love with the show. The show is praised along with the idea of the media. All this praise is once again just another clever mask that Weir uses to cover up the blame he is actually intending. This movie can very easily be tied to today's world. Media has more input on our decisions more than ever. So many news channels have reports and studies meant to influence the public's thoughts on their world around them.

This movie shows you how strongly media influences us through showing you the reality of someone whose whole life is built by the entertainment industry. One of my favorite parts about this movie is its use of satire. I would recommend this movie to anyone as it teaches a valuable lesson that everyone stands to gain from learning.Many satirical tools are used in The Truman Show to deepen the meaning of the movie. There is a lot of connotation in the film. For instance, the character Christof has many underlying biblical references. Christof is portrayed as god-like in many ways. First of all, his name has 'Christ' in it. Also, Christof's office is on a very high floor, and people tend to think of god as in the highest of all places. Furthermore, when people talk about Christof they tend to use names that are typically used to describe god. For example, when Truman comments about the beautiful sunset to Marlin, Marlin gives all the credit to Christof by saying that it is the work of 'the big guy up there.' The religious connotation of Christof is used to show how we tend to worship television, celebrities in magazines, and all other forms of media and the people in them. Irony is another tool that is geniously used in The Truman Show to develop the satire. Situational Irony is used to provoke humor in many scenes, such as when Truman goes to the travel agency and sees posters of planes crashing all over the walls. This is to dissuade Truman from leaving Seahaven, however it is also very ironic as posters exposing the dangers of travel are the last thing you would expect to see in a travel agency.This movie's lesson about the way too large role of media in our society is an incredibly valuable piece of knowledge. In fact the importance of this lesson seems to grow with time, as it could almost be considered more relevant nowadays than it was when the movie was originally made; this is because in the last decade, we have only increased the role that media plays in our lives. Overall, this movie is a great and hilarious satirical film that exposes how much media influences our lifestyle choices.",

For instance, there is product placement in Truman's \"life.\" These show how the world is fake, and this addresses the fact that TV is fake. Commercials that talk about how great their product is, when in reality, the person is payed to say what they do. Another thing, is the deflation of all the problems in the world. The only problems that usually happen are minor, but when Truman goes to leave the town for Fiji, all sorts of problems arrive. I think that this is attacking the fact that reality shows start problems when things start to drag. There is a lot of deflation when it comes to the fact that they essentially are keeping a human in captivity for entertainment, which obviously immoral. There is also lots of irony, when Truman sees the elevator is fake, there is an elevator crash the next day. As well as that his wife is a nurse but she is grossed out by surgery. With his whole life a lie, we can see the impact not only of the lies on television, but the impact every action we make on other people's lives, whether the impact was good, or bad.

This fabulous conspiracy is conveyed to audiences by its impressive lead actor, Jim Carrey. Because the main character is played by Jim Carrey who is one of the most cheerful actors in Hollywood, there is feeling of melancholy in the end of the movie.The story takes place in a city called 'Sea Heaven'. Truman Berbank (Jim Carrey) is a normal insurance planner. Ever since he saw his father pass away in the sea, he has had a fear of the water. So he never thinks of going over the sea. He is living his life as he has always done everyday. However, one day he meets his dead father on the street. His father suddenly gets taken somewhere by two strange men. After that, he starts to doubt his life. Finally he figures out that everything around him is very strange. After he feel that, he begins fighting back to the situation.There are two memorable points in this movie. First, the movie actualizes a situation that people may have dreamed of. The city where Truman was born and grew up was a perfect setting for the show. Furthermore all the people around him were actors who deceived him to believe that the set is a real world even his wife. Because the story is based on common conspiracy theory, it could draw sympathy from audiences. Secondly, Jim Carrey shows that he is not just a light comedian. He proves that he can tell a serious story. However it doesn't mean he acts depressed. He delivers the message which is worth considering while he still acts humorously.If you see this movie, you may not feel very comfortable when end credits roll. 'Truman Show' keeps us thinking about life skeptically. However, we feel something warm after the movie. If you are hesitating which kind of movie between comedy and drama, choosing this movie would be perfect. Then Truman will welcome you with his characteristic greeting 'Good morning. In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and good night!'.",

            "content": "Directed by Peter Weir, \"The Truman Show\" comedy-drama art film gained manifold nominations, including 71st Academy Awards, 56th Golden Globe Awards and etc, as well as a chance to merit a rank of \"Top Box Office Film\" and, therefore, to be a testament to a \"universal acclaim\". What has engendered such a success?Being set in the Seaside, Florida, in the 1998, the story revolves around the Truman Burbank, who has been unsuspectingly living under the thousands of hidden cameras and been constantly broadcast-ed world-widely since his birth for the sake of \"The Truman Show\". Things go smoothly until he gets to know the counterfeit image of his life and endeavors to escape, pending the disaster to the show's well-fare.Staring the typecast comedian Jim Carrie as a protagonist in a dramatic movie could be considered as a bold decision. Yet, so as not to result in a science-fiction thriller as a manifestation of a \"Simulated reality\" as it is seen in the \"Special Service\" episode of \"The Twilight Zone\", by which the script writer of \"The Truman Show\" Andrew Niccol was inspired, eventually it turned out to be well-founded. Carrie's charisma and his dramatic performance lend themselves particularly well in the comedy-drama film, that now may seem to us more funny than dramatic. Additionally, the acting of the rest of the cast has contributed in the overall positive impression of the films, that fully involves the viewer, fires his imagination and gives food for thought. Even though the futuristic theme of the life in a simulated reality might seem rather unconvincing, the director managed to realize this idea and make us believe that it's quite feasible throughout the entire film.To sum it up, in my humble opinion, \"The Truman Show\" is truly worthwhile watching. Although having come out at the end of the last millennium, it signifies the timelessness by its futuristic plot. It may also act as a starting point for a viewer's desire to get an insight in humanistic and post humanistic theories that this film implicitly enacts, give it or take it.",

The concept of fear which with this world is controlled has been brought beautifully with a subjective p.o.v., I think that was simply too good. Again the concept of creator or metaphoric to god, was impressive.I think similar stage comes in everyones life where one feels that all this world is false and our existence doesn't matter to all out there, someway or other they are hear to earn (that)per day from us.

            "content": "The Truman Show has come at a time when cloning and identity theft are subjects which are so often raised. It is now that these subjects penetrate our every day lives involving us,not just fictional characters in movies. There have been many attempts by multinational corporations to 'register' a life form as intellectual property so they can do what they please with what is their 'property' and so the cloning world has begun. This would allow a child to be genetically altered for medical reasons (to avoid spina-bifida or another ailment) and in the process be registered as the corporations intellectual property. They can then 'use' that child throughout its life to harvest blood or tissue without any legal limitations. All pie-in-the-sky stuff but this has been an issue discussed by governments and pharmaceutical corporations all around the world for over a decade. I loved The Truman Show for its humour and skillful use of present-day technology. It was a late night viewing choice of this movie on TV or our latest version of Big Brother on another channel here in Britain, which made me realise how prescient this movie had been in 1998. The other coincidence is that of a book written years ago about a woman who was diagnosed as schizophrenic and had delusions that her whole life had been run by people called \"Operators\" and she was just their\"Thing\" to be tested and manipulated for their amusement and curiosity. They revealed to her that Operators had been around since the dawn of Man and had constantly set tasks for their Things, which inadvertently caused Man to evolve. They said, \"If it hadn't been for us, you humans would still be bumping into each other in caves.\" Her life was a series of struggles to break free from this observing and testing by the Operators. Christof could slip straight into the guise of Operator in The Truman Show for it was his setting of tasks and emotional tests that caused Truman to grow and mature in the way he did. A great movie on many levels but a good piece of entertainment too. Hollywood doing it the way it should.",

            "content": "The Truman's Show is a rare gem of the 90's. It is very different from the movies that we usually see. Normally in movies, actors know that they are acting while following a script. While technically, this movie may be called as one of them, but the story itself is dramatically ironic. The movie starts a bit slow and boring at first but gradually draws interest of the viewer after interval. In this movie, Jim Carrey playing as \"Truman Burbank\" oblivious of his star identity, lives a normal life in a confined set created by the producer of The Truman's Show. Right from the birth Truman finds himself in the artificial world with artificial people without realising that he is actually acting on 24*7 show broadcasted live featuring him as the star. His every action, every moment was recorded on camera. However, lately he falls in love with her mate Sylvia in college. Owing to love, she tries to aware Truman of the reality by taking him away to a far stretch of land not seen by camera. Was she able to unravel the truth? What about the troubles that you apprehend? Did she save him? I am not going to tell the entire story now. Just know that \"love triumphs all\" and watch the movie yourself.The film tries to discover convergence between reality vs drama and marvells at its attempt. Although I feel that a better plot with could have done justice with the overall concept of the movie. The movie yearns for lost comedy and songs. I recommend this movie to the audience because its one of a kind but with a disclaimer to be prepared to get bored for most of it.",

At first I was really confused and it seemed pretty weird. As the movie went on the more things started clicking together. It was really well thought out. When you really watch it, you can see what they want to change. The message is still relevant, if not more now. The media is all around us, and sometimes it's hard to tell if they're real or not and if they're for us or against us. We need to break free from the lies of the media and live our own life. Irony was used many times. It was ironic when the creator, Christof, said that he guarded his privacy, and the other news caster said that it was understandable. They completely violate Truman's privacy by broadcasting his life to the whole entire world 24/7. It was ironic that the people who were cast to do certain jobs could not actually do those jobs in real life, which emphasized the point of just how fake his life really was. Hyperbole was also a main asset in the movie. They exaggerated everything in Truman's daily life by making it a bigger event. Ethos was used because you feel really bad for Truman. It makes you want to stop the media and directors too, which is the point of the whole movie. Overall, it was a great movie with a great message.",

I thought this was a great idea for a movie, because he is living in a studio with hidden cameras everywhere and everyone around him are actors playing their role while Truman has no idea. The Truman Show has everyone around the world watching. Truman thinks he is a normal man living a normal life and he has no idea that he is being filmed. This film can be seen as a satire because they are targeting the falseness of modern entertainment. Truman simply lives his life but just like the popular TV shows, Survivor or Big Brother, everything on set is fake. Since the power of media is so strong, the audience of The Truman Show or a show like Survivor think that everything is real. This movie is trying to show us how fake modern entertainment can actually be but the power of the media makes us think it is real. The whole time I watched the movie, I wanted Truman to break free of this false media. I never thought he would until one day, Truman finds out something is wrong. What will he do?",

Tiny cameras are placed all around the town, filming his every move of every day. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year, this footage is live streamed on TV as \"The Truman Show\". But what happens when Truman begins to notice that everything in his perfect town, is just a little bit too perfect, and a little bit too repetitive? The Truman Show, starring Jim Carrey, uses satirical elements to comment on actual society. Connotation is used throughout dialogue to inflict the fake and awkward feelings on the \"citizens\" of the town. The way they speak makes you feel annoyed with the situation instead of being in support of it like most characters in the movie. The movie targets Americans as a whole in a comedic and ironic way. Overall the movie comments on the way society is so attached to media, and that in some ways it completely controls American's lives.",

This movie was able to criticize the media, yet still keep the story somewhat light, by adding humorous bits throughout. Walking away from the film, I felt conflicted on whether or not it was funny or not, but isn't that the point of satire? To entertain, but also provoke thought. This movie perfectly achieved this.

            "content": "I really enjoyed The Truman Show I felt that it satirized a problem that is both far- reaching and persistent. I believe it was presented in a way funny enough to be palatable to the audience, while also unnerving enough to attack its target. Even when writing this, the fear still persists that this is all one big set, designed to sell your life for the viewing pleasure of a few million people. I felt that the audience was anyone old enough to understand how morally reprehensible the total invasion of privacy which occurred in the film was, however the target was much different. The target was anyone the participates in and/or propagates consumer culture, as well as supporters of invasive policies allowing for the unfair surveillance of innocent people. To do this, the writers had to highlight the immorality of the show, and present the benefits of having agency over your position. The immorality of the show was easy to expose, only having to show him being manipulated by his \"loved ones\" and the incompetency of the Kristof, the director. However, more importantly it showed Truman as the agent of his own fate. There was one specific quote in which Kristof said that we could see that Truman wanted to stay because if he wanted to leave then he could, which was quickly followed by Truman leaving. That quote from Kristof also reflects on the view of agency in today's society, in which people who have the deck stacked against them are blamed when they can't draw a royal flush. One contemporary example of this is the poor in today's society. Commonly people will say, \"Poor people just need to get a job and stop living off welfare.\" However statements like this and Kristof's completely leave other circumstances that are the reason why the poor people are poor and why Truman took 30 years to escape. Such as, Truman was raised in a society where people were constantly telling him that the weird things happening were regular so it makes it harder for him to tell that his life isn't normal, and poor people are born into broken families surrounded by drugs, crime, and gangs all of which make it very hard to not be poor. For this reasons I would highly recommend The Truman Show to anyone that wants to constantly fear that they are being laughed at all around the world, and also people who want to look into the complex socio-economic problems facing the less fortunate of the world.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a satirical movie that attacks the concept of reality TV as well as the media. The film begins with the seemingly average life of Truman Burbank but begins to make you as well as Truman question the reality of it all. It becomes clear that Truman's whole life is a TV show and has been watched by millions of viewers since the moment he was born. This satire appears to be attacking reality TV and how foolish it is. It seems to provide no purpose and the film constantly shows people all over spending their lives watching somebody else's. Although it exaggerates as the show is on 24/7 and no one is shown doing anything else, it even shows policemen who are continually ignoring their job to watch the Truman Show. Even though this movie came out in 1998, it also attacks the media we have today because it depicts Truman as someone who is caged, someone who has zero privacy and is unaware his entire life is always on display. Just as the media constantly follows celebrities and pries into their personal lives un-relentlessly. The creator of the show responds to a call from an angry viewer saying that what they've done to Truman is not right by telling her that Truman is free to leave at any time. In spite of this, every time Truman attempts escape he is stopped by measures that get more extreme each time, leading up to his car being set on fire and the producers' attempt to drown him. It makes it clear that they don't want Truman to leave but they didn't seem to care if he died, showing that producers of reality TV as well as the media do not care about who they are exploiting as long as they get a good story with lots of views. I feel that this movie was effective and fun to watch. Even if someone is to watch this without any thought to the satirical side of the movie, it would still be an enjoyable experience.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a great example of a well-executed satire. It is entertaining, has an interesting storyline/concept, and has a strong purpose behind it. The performances by all of the actors (Jim Carrey especially) only add to this already solid film. The first time I watched The Truman Show I was 12 years old. It instantly became one of my favorite movies, alongside Clueless, Forrest Gump, and the amazing Sixteen Candles. Since then, I have watched it probably 6 times, but it somehow never seems to get old or boring. And to be honest? When our English teacher made us watch this movie during our satire unit, I was extremely confused. Never had I considered that this movie was more than a cool concept with a hilarious actor. Now, maybe I was just not a very observant and/or an intelligent person at the age of 12, but I still couldn't understand why this was considered a satire.As we watched the movie in class, I begun to see it in a whole new light. I noticed things I hadn't noticed before, tried to dig deeper in order to find it's purpose, and most importantly tried to discover exactly why it had been given the title of \"satire\". After thinking about this long and hard, I came up with that the satirical purpose behind the movie was to show how the media controls us here in America. It uses inflation to exaggerate the situation Truman is in on the show, to help us recognize how controlling the media is not only in the movie, but in our own lives as well. While it may not necessarily use connotative word choice/language, it definitely evokes emotion in all of us as we feel sorry for Truman as he goes through life on a TV set. It uses dramatic irony because the audience knows that Truman's on a TV show before he does. I think that the movie targets less of the mainstream media, and more of the people sitting back and watching as our television sets and the internet take over our lives. We are taught to not take things at first glance for what they seemingly are and to always question the world around us. This can be related to the lies that both Fox and CNN tell us on the daily about politics and what's going on around the world. The people that blindly follow either news source no matter what they are saying are the true target of this movie. Now, of course our lives aren't being broadcast to the entire world, but similar to Truman some people's lives are being controlled by a TV station. And it's our job to discover the truth and get out. As Christof said, \"We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.\"To sum things up, this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. Learning the true purpose behind the movie has only made me like it more as I can appreciate the thought going into each line and scene to make it more than just \"entertaining.\" I truly believe that this is a movie every person should see, even if they don't necessarily agree with the purpose, just because it is such a well thought out and brilliantly executed movie. If you are bored on a Friday night, or just want to see something that will really make you think instead of just mindless TV shows, please give this movie a try!",

A clear view as to what the satire is criticizing, a lasting impression on the watcher, and just enough light- heartedness that pulls the movie together. The clear purpose of the satire is to expose the seemingly wonderful and well meaning but unintentionally benevolent nature of the media. The movie shows how awful the fixation that the media carries with certain people can destroy their lives in the end. What's interesting, in a rather sad manner, is how relevant and accurate the movie is today, now more than ever. The movie shows the deflation of personal privacy, which now mimics how some reality TV shows are set up. The movie also shows the inflation of shared interest in television, which has been on the rise for a long time. The movie, while seemingly outdated, is still a scarily accurate representation of modern society.The reaction of Truman to realizing something is afoot is almost odd in this day and age. He grew up without access to reality television, so he's unused to how some people would crave the fame that came with his role. It is almost odd to think how different his reaction may have been, had he been given access to the world of television.Personally, I enjoyed the movie. The acting left something to be desired for me, but the writing and setting were very satisfactory. The plot was complex, but not to the point that it was not understandable. The humor is typical of satire, but not too crude or brash, which is nice. I think this was a very well made movie, especially for the time period.",

It uses many satirical devices to further the plot, such as inflation and loads of irony. Even though this movie is over a decade old, it can still resonate with today's audience because reality TV is more popular now than ever, and watching every second of somebody else's life has been a rather disappointing norm in our society. However, our love for reality TV bridges the gap between us and the Truman Show, and really connects with the young viewers of the world.

Everyone in his life is in on the show and are actors. Eventually Truman starts to figure out that his life is not as normal on the \"island\" of Seahaven as it seemed.

Personally I feel like this satirical film was a good movie and something I would watch again. I especially appreciate the meaning and substance to this film. The purpose of the film is, to expose and display how the media in our society today controls and skews our perception of the world around us. The fact that a form of media was produced to portray this purpose about today's media is pure irony in itself. Throughout the film there was exaggeration of the way today's media sells and advertises products. All of the people in Truman's life would continuously exaggeratedly look into the camera and display various products. This displayed how we force products down people's throat and use every opportunity to exploit them. Also this is shown by the creators using everything in the show to make money off of Truman and his life. The whole idea for this film is inflation of the issue with media in our society. The writers of this movie exaggerate and make the problem huge using the plot of the film to prove and teach us that it is a big issue in our lives as consumers. An interesting quote from the movie is from the creator of The Truman Show, Christof, \"We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented. It's as simple as that\" (The Truman Show 1998). This I feel is the main purpose of the plot and really speaks to the audience of the film, which is the everyday consumer. This quote really spoke to me and I hope it speaks to you too. This quote really gets the point across that we need to be more skeptical of the information given by the media.

These themes include existentialism, freedom of choice, and the power that media holds over human life. It's also worth noting how much the Truman Show reminded me personally of the Matrix. Both Neo and Truman are a sort of \"chosen one\" character type. Not only that but they're both given choices to stay in the fantasy, or to leave and see the world for what it really is. The comparisons can even be found in the sort of \"captors\" of the two.

            "content": "The Truman Show is a thought provoking and satirical movie about the unrealistic expectations that the media puts into our lives. As a satire the movie completely inflates the \"perfection\" of a reality TV show, but hits hard on how you cannot compare your life to a show because it is not necessarily always true. Throughout the movie Truman slowly starts realizing that something isn't right. That life isn't supposed to be always perfect seeming and there had to be more outside of his little town that he could never seem to leave. Many of us sit at home and watch reality TV shows thinking that it is real life. That everything in the lives of the actors are perfect and we wonder why our lives aren't that way. But through the movie you start to understand the concept that behind the scenes may not be at all what you think it is. There is so much more going on behind the camera than what you see on the television screen. The movie uses connotation playing into the emotions of the audience members to help them sympathize with Truman. This helps the people viewing the movie to comprehend the harsh realities and connect to the theme and characters. In the end taking away the intended purpose of the movie. We see this in the world today through TV shows like Keeping Up With the Kardashians. On the screen they seem to have it made for them. They can travel anywhere, anytime, not have to worry about money and all of their problems may seem minimal or even humorous to the audience. But what we don't see is all of the behind the scenes. All of the real world family problems that happen or the fact that one or more may not want their lives broadcasted for the entire population to see. The Truman Show tries to expose these realities hoping to send a message to all viewers. The movie is very enjoyable while getting it's point across.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is an example of satire, and though the use of satire, it shows how media has affected our everyday lives, and has influenced us in ways that it probably shouldn't. In this movie, we follow the life of Truman Burbank- who lives in the community of Seahaven (which is actually a giant domed television studio). In Seahaven, Truman is the star. He is recorded, observed, and judged. Everyone else is actors- only Truman is real, and he doesn't know it. Right away you can link the Truman Show to what media does to us today. You can see the satirical tool inflation being used to get the point of the Truman Show across. The problem of being lied today in media is conveyed by making lies a much bigger issue in Truman's society. The \"dome\" that is Seahaven feeds Truman lies about his whole life- just as media does to us today. We don't know what to believe, just as Truman didn't know the truth about his life. Christof (the creator of Seahaven) put it best when he said: \"We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. It's as simple as that.\". And isn't it? People believe what they are told to believe, and this satire highlights that perfectly. The Truman Show also brings to light the issue of morality in the media- which takes place at the very end of the movie; when Truman finds out about his \"fake\" life, he asks Christof to explain. Christof states: \"There's no more truth out there than there is in the world I created for you. The same lies, the same deceit\". This can be compared to our society today. Just like Truman, we don't know what our beliefs are until we are forced to question them. I think that the Truman show is an effective satire that is able to pinpoint an issue that is still present in our society today. We are still looking for ways to solve this problem, but- In case we don't solve it, good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight!",

            "content": "The Truman Show is hilariously heartwarming. Set in the '90's, it follow Truman Burbank, an unassuming, naive but friendly man who lives in Seahaven, a small town where everybody knows everybody- well, where everybody knows Truman. In reality, Truman is the center of a TV show that has followed him since he was born. The director, Christof, built a dome behind the Hollywood sign, and inside that dome is Seahaven. Actors were hired to be Truman's parents, teachers, and friends. In fact, everything around Truman is fake- but it's real to him. He has no idea that he is living in a bubble built solely around his life. In the real world, people can watch Truman 24/7, and are almost addicted to watching him through life. The movie begins with Truman is almost 30, and is just starting to realize that things may not be as they seem in his little village of Seahaven. Studio lights are falling from the sky, a pocket of rain appears just over him, and the malfunctioning radio in his car suddenly switches to a mysterious voice documenting his every move! This leads to an adventure of Truman trying to figure out where- and who he really is. Despite being a lighthearted film, the entire movie touches on more thoughtful themes: the safeness of home and how far one clings to it, the addictive nature of the media- the director even suggests that the world in which we live in is corrupt, and Truman is being granted a gift by being shut off from reality. The film is also a satire, meaning that it brings to light a folly in human nature in hopes that we can change it. The main problem that the Truman Show satirizes is the media. The people in the real world are obsessed with the Truman Show! Throughout the whole movie it gives us glimpses of the people watching it, and they don't seem to move their positions throughout the 72 hours of broadcast of the Truman Show! It's as if all they've been doing in their lives has been watching this show- ignoring everyday responsibilities and staying glued to the screen. It exaggerates people's dependency on TV shows, but in a way it shows us the truth. We binge watch TV series on Netflix, we watch our own reality TV shows, and believe that we know the person we're watching. The Truman show is almost ahead of it's time- and that's why it's still enjoyable and relative today.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a movie that shows the lies that we are told by the media. Although we know the internet isn't always true, there are still so many false things that we choose to believe. In this film the idea of a life of lies comes to life. From Truman Burbanks birth he was in a phony reality that he was lead to believe was real, and everyone he knew were actors that lied to him. Everyone around the world is watching Truman on television 24/7 through secret cameras, and wants him to eventually find his way out of the dome he is stuck inside. Whether you are young or old, this movie is ridiculous and funny while adding a deeper meaning that is hidden below the surface. Even if you are too young to understand what the movie is trying to make you feel or if you are just laughing at the silly things Truman does, it is definitely worth the watch.This movie was very well thought out, and kept you laughing as you were slowly coming to the conclusion of what is was really about. The satirical elements are very strong, and clever enough to make you think without coming right out and saying it. The movie does a good job of showing how the media wants us to believe that everything is perfect in the world. They want to put us in a dome like Truman, and not see what terrible things are really happening around us. In Burbank's life, everything around him just happens to work out exactly right. In this same way, society tries to make us think that everything is just fine and there are no problems in this world, when in reality we know there are. Whether you get the true meaning of the movie or not, The Truman Show is very entertaining and funny, while giving you an emotional connection to the characters throughout the movie. It really gives you a true understanding of the influence the media has on our everyday lives, and opinions.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a perfect example of how an unusual topic can still make for a successful movie. Most popular 'blockbuster' type movies use generic plots about a bad guy who is stopped by a good guy, and these movies rarely address complex issues that permeate our society. The Truman Show, on the other hand, uses satirical techniques to make a powerful statement about the state of today's media on the whole. Throughout the movie, several examples are given to allude to the fact that Truman's entire life has all been manufactured for the entertainment of a worldwide audience, like the repetition that is seen across the movie, from beginning to end. Scenes from the beginning of the movie are repeated, almost shot for shot later in the film, and this really gives the viewer a sense of how synthetic the world he lives in is. Additionally, one line manages to find it's way into several key moments in the plot, with each delivery providing more and more meaning behind it as both the viewer and Truman gradually discover the truth. This sense of discovery that is felt as the conspiracy that has been hidden from Truman falls apart around him is, personally, an extremely interesting subject, and this aspect of the film may possibly be one of my favorite parts. In addition to the artificiality of the world that is seen, the idea that corporations can be considered people is explored as well. Christof casually mentions that The Truman Show was the first instance of a corporation legally adopting a child. Christof greatly understates the significance of that event, brushing it off as a mere byproduct of creating such a show.Lastly, the film is able to tie it all together with a questioning of the ethicality of the show. Be warned, however, this paragraph will contain spoilers for the final act of the movie. As Truman is sailing away from Seahaven, Christof demands that a great storm be created to stop Truman from discovering the truth. When he is questioned by the network executives, fearing that Christof might kill Truman, he justifies his actions by stating \"He was born in front of a live audience,\" implying that it's no different to let him die in front of a live audience. This shows us how Christof really sees Truman, as nothing more than part of the machine that is the Truman Show. Truman may be an important part of that machine, but the point is, Christof barely even considers that Truman is a human too.There are few movies like The Truman Show. Very rarely do movies really take the jump needed to kickstart the discussion on complex issues, but this movie was willing to do so. For this reason, The Truman Show is one of the most profound movies to achieve mainstream success in recent memory. Are there flaws, of course, but the overall meaning transcends the movie, which is why I give The Truman Show an 8/10.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is an intriguing cinematic experience that delves deep into the ethics of human rights and free thought in a semi-comedic way. The film follows the story of a man named Truman Burbank, an insurance sales representative who has a normal life. We soon learn, however, that Truman is the most famous man in the world, without even his knowledge. Truman lives on the sunny island of Seahaven, a man- made island rigged with cameras that are broadcasting live 24-7 to a TV audience. Every person in Truman's life is an actor paid to record him and to create good television. This movie seems to be a satiric commentary on several things, specifically the control and influence that the media has on our society. Throughout the movie there are various product placements and references to things the consumers of the show will see. It was also a satire over the treatment of zoo animals and prisoners, as well as the control the Government puts on our lives. Truman is completely controlled, and although he is treated fairly, he lacks free choice. He only has the illusion of free choice, which many believe to be a God-given right to men. The Truman Show was a well executed film, I would highly recommend this movie.",

The show constantly keeps you guessing and wondering what's going to happen next. The fact that it follows Truman's life without him knowing but then cuts to the other side of the camera where the TV show is being created makes it really interesting. Perhaps my favorite part is when Truman starts being \"unpredictable\" and the T.V. show producers have to scramble to fix it and make sure that Truman doesn't notice anything. Once Truman does start noticing stuff you almost feel excited/nervous for him because the movie really makes you feel like you're in there with him and figuring out the mystery for yourself. You definitely find yourself rooting for him to find his way out and it made me very much dislike the people behind the T.V. show who were trying to keep him in the show and oblivious to the entire world. Another aspect of the movie that I think the creators did well is adding in scenes now and then that showed other people outside of the dome in which Truman lives reacting to the show and experiences that Truman is having. Towards the end when Truman is faced with a decision on whether to leave the \"perfect world\" as said by the creator, or leave and go into the real world really puts the audience on edge because you really don't know what he will do. All in all The Truman Show is a very well made movie that keeps you entertained and on edge the entire time.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is an American comedy-drama film directed by Peter Weir in 1998, starring Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a man whose life is transmitted 24/7 with a worldwide TV viewers audience. The camera techniques, the unique scenario and the themes it touches upon, makes this film to stand out from all the other films of its kind and make it one of my favorite films of the 20th century.Briefly, Truman has lived his life without knowing that he is starring in a reality show. He is observed by millions of watchers all day and night allowing Christof, the creator of the show, to manipulate him and create the conditions of life that he lives in. He is the creator of his fake life. Seahaven, the town in which he lives is fake, the people who pretend to be the citizens of the city are just actors and generally he lives in a fake life. In order for Truman to remain in his inertia of what is happening many people try to stop him from wondering and averting him from wanting to explore more. However at the end, when Truman is 30 years old, he realizes in what lie he has been living on and he tries to escape from this town.Some interesting things about this film are its camera techniques and its setting. To begin with, the point of view is primarily from Truman. However many's the time that we watch the film from the perspective of the viewers of the show and the producers. This enables us to understand how these people think and feel when they watch the movie, while on the other hand when we see it again through the eyes of Truman we realize how he perceives the world while he is unaware that he is the protagonist of a reality show. Some of the camera techniques the director, Peter Weir uses are the following:1)He places the cameras in strange positions, with many close-ups and by shouting through circular frames in order to show that the constant surveillance of Truman. There are cameras everywhere.2)In some scenes, the camera is at a medium (eye level) shot, which enables characters to look at the camera sometimes. Although generally eye contact in films is avoided, here it is used so as we can understand that everyone except Truman are aware of the existence of the cameras.Moreover, the lighting must be examined because it is controlled by the creator of the show. He decides when to change the time of the day and when to day night and the night day. He gives us the sense of him being the God and that's what his name impels us too \"Christof\". Christof's name derives from Christ, and it is one more evidence that he is the \"God\" of Truman. In order to emphasize the fact that he is the creator of Truman's life, Christof has low lighting on account of his deceitful character. Furthermore, the film embodies many important themes, such as the theme of advertising and the effect that media have on us. Consumerism is evident throughout the film either in a subtle or in a direct way through the product placement as an attempt to lure the consumers. Due to the fact that the show is broadcasting 24/7 they had to advertise products during the show and everyone is aware of the advertising except Truman. For example, one advertisement was for vegetable peelers. Through the use of advertisements, the director of the movie is able to criticize this tendency that companies have to advertise their products in the movies.The effect that the media have upon us is one of the main themes in the film. The viewers of the show become so obsessed and addicted to it that they seem to forget what the real word is, ending up idealizing real world situations, shaping their own individual meaning towards it. The audience thinks that the world in which Truman lives is the ideal and they are shocked by his choice to leave from Seaheaven. This dependency on the show and the control that the media have is illustrated through Meryl. Meryl is a main character and she says that \"There is no difference between private and public life. My life is the 'Truman Show'. The 'Truman Show' is a lifestyle, a noble lifestyle.\" She and all the viewers forget the moral values and they do not think is wrong to keep Truman on the show. However Sylvia who appeared only a few times on the show says \"He's not a performer, he's a prisoner\u0085.. you're a liar and a manipulator and what you've done to Truman is sick.\" Despite the media's and people's denial he continues to fight for the human rights and the end for the reality show.One quote from the movie that was thought-provoking, is when Christof, the creator of the show, says \"We accept the reality with which we are presented.\" The way I interpret this quote is that directors and generally all the people who create a film, present us what they want, with their interpretations. Consequently, when we watch a film we have to bear in mind that everything is in the imagination of the creators of the film. We have to be aware of the devices used in order for an image for example not to influence us.Overall, I really enjoyed watching The Truman Show. The acting is very good from all the actors, especially the one who plays Truman because he managed to capture his feelings and act as an ordinary person unaware of his role in a reality. Furthermore, the directing was clever with the camera techniques. The themes the movie touched upon are contemporary and they appeal to a wide audience, making the movie more interesting. It is a movie that I highly recommend and I would definitely watch it again.",

Parts of the Truman Show give you chills up the side, and you really get a feel for the characters involved. The scope of scenery and the dome the movie is shot in is magnificent.

It is a great example of a satire because it shows that people can be very blind to things happening around them if they don't want to believe something. When Lauren tells him that it's just a big show, he doesn't quite understand and tries to make sense of it by just thinking she must've been crazy. There is deflation when people are talking about how keeping Truman locked up in a giant studio his whole life isn't that bad, because he doesn't even know it. There is also a lot of irony in which everyone is watching him, but he doesn't even see any of the people he truly knows. The target of this satirical movie is people who will believe anything that a person says just because they have only known one thing their entire lives. The target can be someone who doesn't listen to anything else because they only know one thing and try to block everything else out because they don't want to know the truth. It is still significant to people today because it talks about how people can be so blind to people around them because they refuse to look for something deeper, or the actual truth as to who they are.",

The Truman Show is an example of what directors in the movie industry should strive for. The idea this movie is something that is unique and unseen before. Using satire and thought-provoking visions The Truman Show makes for an entertaining and enjoyable film. Jim Carrey, unsurprisingly, does amazingly in his role. While some may not realize it, it takes just as much talent to portray comedy as it does drama, and even more to switch between. Carrey's excellent acting helped to bring the film up another level, he has good comedic timing and performs the script very well. The script is another element of the movie which helps to add to its acclaimed status. It is written very well and uses satire in subtle ways throughout the entire film. The script helps to express the underlying themes of the immoral ways of the media, as well as the obsession with those in the public eye. While Hollywood is often known for repetitive remakes and sequels to once popular movies, The Truman Show is a definite exception. Those who see it will realize quickly it is evidently different from a typical Jim Carrey movie, those of which usually involve obvious and slapstick style comedy. The Truman Show instead uses dark humor, and multiple differing satirical tools to reveal the underlying messages that are portrayed in various ways throughout the entirety of the film. These sinister messages become even more alarming when the audience begins to realize their actual legal viability in todays world. The pursuit of reality is an important theme in The Truman Show. Today, reality shows are already becoming more and more popular, and they are multiplying at every opportunity. These television shows are meant to provide the viewers with a sense of 'realness' to their shows and make the subject matter seem ever more prevalent and important to the audience. It has been nineteen years since The Truman Show was released, and the underlying messages are only becoming more and more important as time goes on and the media becomes ever larger. The Truman Show is wonderful film, with many thought-provoking layers, with philosophy, comedy, and well-written satire.

There is no leaving this community for Truman. Truman lives a life where everyone knows and revolves around him. Truman is not only a known person inside the domed community but also around the world. He is a star on a television show, The Truman Show, and he is the only one who has no idea about. There are over 3,000 cameras around town and everywhere that he goes. Every single individual in the dome are actors or actresses, even his family and close friends. The Truman Show is targeting what a lot of Americans are obsessed with, reality television. These include Keeping up with the Kardashians, Jersey Shore, Dance Moms, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and many more. What we think we would be able to have from a \"reality\" show, since it is \"real life and daily lives\", we will never be able to have.

Just like big brother not the reality TV show but the government surveillance, but it is real condemning surveillance of people against their knowledge. That is one of the reasons I liked this movie so much it had many different levels. The base level of funny humor and how that situation could never happen, but then it gets into levels where it makes you think about whether or not with the increasing technology it could real happen or if someone is already doing it. There are other meanings that are explored like that of free will and whether or not people want to make there own choices or to have them made for them. Or is ignorance bliss and the more knowledge you gain the more you become suspicious of the world and others.

Everybody in Seahaven is an actor, except for Truman. It takes him years to figure out what exactly is going on, but once he discovers the truth about his life, he begins trying to escape his utopia. This satirical film shines a light on the objectification that media stars are exposed to every single day. Truman's television show is broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week every day since he was born. This is a direct hit at how celebrities are constantly being observed and analyzed by the general public. There is a clear audience being targeted by the making of this film, and it is, ironically enough, everybody watching the film. The movie is meant to show audiences just how detrimental their objectification of television and movie stars really is to the people in front of the camera.

            "content": "In a time of reality television and social media, we have become more entertained by real people rather than scripted stories. The amount of people who prefer the Kardashians to a scripted television program is growing by the day. This movie is something that has become more relatable and closer to reality as time has gone by. Truman is the first child to be adopted by a corporation. He lives in a safe bubble of a town called Seahaven. Every day in Seahaven is a day with predictable but comforting story lines that all have a clean and tidy ending. Truman lives an extremely cookie cutter life, the only catch is that none of it is real. Every step he takes is televised live to the world and everyone knows but him. His closest secrets, that are only to be shared with his mother, are broadcasted for an eager audience. Truman's family and friends are all casted and their words come from their earpieces. Every turn and twist has been perfectly manufactured to shape a planned storyline for his show. The idea is that he would be televised from his birth to his death, but what would happen if the wholesome and family friendly Truman became unpredictable? In The Truman Show, be ready to experience the humor of Truman's world and also the darker themes of satire about the entertainment industry. This tackles the issues of exploitation in television and shows the irony of viewing people in staged and outrageous situations as \"relatable\" and somehow \"normal.\" I couldn't help but feel that I, a sucker for reality television, could be part of the problem. The horatian like absurdity of so many watching Truman do monotonous tasks as sleeping and brushing his teeth, made me reflect on what the message really was. As I lived through Truman's eyes I couldn't help but wonder, is it real life if I'm the only one really living it?",

            "content": "The Truman show is an awesome satirical movie with a lot of humor and some seriousness. I believe that this movie is awesome because it kind of gets you thinking about the world around you. For me I think about this movie quite often because, (potential spoiler alert if you don't know what this movie is about), what if the world around me is all staged and nothing is real. A quote from the movie struck me relatively hard, when the character of the show's creator, Christof, said \"We accept the reality of the world which we're presented\". This struck me because of how true it is, we go through our daily lives every day and do the same things over and over again, without questioning anything, and I think it is good to question things every once in a while. Enough of the philosophical stuff, the comedy in this movie is also great. It isn't a comedy movie but the humor is sprinkled in at the right places to create some comic relief. My favorite scene in the movie is when, (spoiler alert!), the very end when he denies Christof's offer to stay on the show and he uses his \"classic\" line, \"And in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night\". Overall this is a great movie and would give it a 9/10.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is absolutely one of the most thoughtful, well-written movies of the twentieth century. The purpose of this satirical film is especially pertinent in modern times as television and reality shows have become a central part of pop culture. From Keeping Up With the Kardashians to Duck Dynasty, we all seem to have that one television program that we just can't get enough of. But are these \"reality\" television shows actually real? The Truman Show is an impactful Horatian satire as a result of the effective use of light-hearted humor and satirical tools such as a clear target and audience, irony, inflation, and deflation. While The Truman Show is a relatively cheerful movie that people of all ages can enjoy, it provides a lense through which modern people can analyze reality television and how it impacts our lives.To summarize, The Truman Show is an effective satire that dissects \"reality\" television. Like all movies that are successful in the box office, The Truman Show appeals to a vast audience. As people living in the twenty-first century, we can't seem to get through the day without Instagram stalking our favorite celebrity or tuning in to our favorite reality show. I believe that The Truman Show is a must-see movie because it propels deeper thinking about the workings of \"reality\" television and how it affects real people. In conclusion, The Truman Show is a brilliant film that conveys an important message about reality television through the use of humor, satirical techniques, and real-world connections.",

            "content": "The Truman Show, a satirical movie about a man who is very confused about his life, and what his purpose is, has several beneficial and specific messages to take from it. As Truman, the main character, goes throughout his repetitive day, he runs into situations that nag at him, and get him thinking about what he wants to do, and how he feels like he can't accomplish them. Christof, the T.V. show's producer in the movie, has convinced himself and those watching and working for him that he has done this all to benefit Truman, rather than holding him back from the world he could be apart of. The love story in this very complicated, because of a sort of forbidden love that Truman is in. His feelings for a woman cause him to have a mission to find her, by planning to go to Fiji, where he believes she is. His journey to find this woman brings him to discover many important things about his life.This story brings to attention a couple of messages, such as the fact that you need to be cautious of the things you're doing, and be aware of those who you put your trust in. Another message is that sometimes, it's more beneficial for those who you have custody over, if you let them go and do what they really want to do. The character, Christof, does not want Truman to leave the amazing life he's built for him. Truman, however, is ready to create a life of his own. I related this to the relationship many have with their parents, and how eventually it really will be time to start a life of your own. When people are ready, you should let them go. I really appreciated this message, and loved the different actors that helped bring the plot to life. The Truman Show does a great job at bringing humor into this problem, and making it an enjoyable film for a variety of ages.",

            "content": "A compelling, humorous and exhilarating film, The Truman Show by Peter Weir, describes the life of Truman Burbank. Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life but what he doesn't know is he is being watched by millions of people. This is dramatic irony because we know that Truman is on a TV show but he doesn't. In his day to day life of being a businessman, Truman is being filmed by numerous, strategically placed cameras, 24 hours every day. Inflation is shown because reality television is extremely exaggerated. Truman believes he is living a normal life so people see his real life and not anything fake. The target of The Truman Show is people that are involved in TV shows and appear fake for the sake of looking better than they are. He was born on camera and raised on the world's largest television set with cameras on him constantly and actors all around him, which he is unaware of. Through his \"wanna be\" crush and a series of crazy events, he begins to discover that his life may not be what he always thought it was. Innuendo is shown when the girl he is interested in tells him that he is on TV. This makes him question his life and want to discover what she really means. He goes on the adventure of his life where he is challenged by the masters and makers of the \"perfect\" world he belongs in. By facing his fears and showing incredible perseverance, Truman finally reaches the edge of the world he has lived in forever. Here he is required to make the decision of his life, should he leave everything he has ever known and jump into the real world, or should he stay in the comfortable and safe world that he is told he always belonged in.",

I really liked how real they made the movie feel and how they didn't reveal the entire plot until about halfway through the movie. The whole point that the movie was trying to get across to people was a very good point that applies very well to our lives now with all of the advancements in technology and the large growth of social media. You can some what tell that this story is satirical because of how inflated the concept of the movie is but it is more of a horatian satire than a juvenalian because of the humor that occurs in the story and that there is no direct target that the movie goes after. There wasn't really any movies or television shows that this movie reminded me of because most of the other satirical shows and parodies are either juvenalian satires or just comedic parodies that don't really suggest change like 'The Truman Movie' does, I believe that this is why the movie won so many awards. In conclusion I really enjoyed watching 'The Truman Movie and I think it is a very good movie to watch because of how relevant it is in our world today.",

The stereotypes in the movie made it more humorous. It is comical to a viewer that Truman is unaware of the cookie-cutter, stereotypical life he lives, as he has not been exposed to real culture, he lives only inside his bubble. There are many examples of sarcasm in The Truman Show. Truman himself is often sarcastic, for example when he is pretending to act normal. I do find it ironic that Hollywood made a movie about how obsessive and idolizing celebrities is so normalized in society, but they are the ones promoting that because it makes them money, just like Christof in The Truman Show. All in all, I believe The Truman Show to be an excellent piece of satire and a wonderful movie.",

The first (chronologically later) was in the French film \"L'an 01\" which was based on the idea of a sudden change of perspective and life reality that would supposedly take effect when people all around would suddenly just \"get it\" and everything would start from scratch \"from year One\" so to speak.By the way this film occurred around the time of the events in Cambodia and I sometimes wonder whether old Pol Pot was a fan of it as there were a lot of those bastards in Paris (Ho Chi Ming,Khomeini )etc Anyway the other thing I remember was a cartoon in a \"counterculture\" magazine and the idea was that the character would be living in the mundane ,regulated monochrome environment of society when he would suddenly make a contact with a fellow human being and hey presto! they would notice a little crack appear in the wall.Of course on closer inspection it is revealed that they can look through the crack and even go through it .On the other side of the crack the cartoonist has painted in the alternative view of the world -Lots of cows I seem to recall and rivers.Maybe you get the picture?! So when I see the bowsprit of Carey's boat pierce the edge of the ocean sky it reminds me of that image but in an opposite kind of a way. Its back to reality and not some kind of a pipe dream!",

            "content": "The Truman Show is one of the best psychological thrillers because of its concept, choice of actors, filming and script. As I watched this movie I was blown away by how interesting it actually was. I find psychology incredibly interesting so this movie was great to me. The entire concept of this movie is about a man, Truman, who has spent his whole life growing up on a \"movie set\". His parents aren't his real parents, his lovers aren't his real lovers and his house isn't his own house. Yet, he has no idea that these people around him are all actresses and he's living in a fake world. The real outside world is watching through hidden cameras placed everywhere on this movie set that he calls his life. His entire life, Truman is being watched 24/7 and the outside world watches him as a reality TV show. Every move he makes, every emotion he feels and everything he sees and experiences is purely for the outside world's entertainment. The reason he was placed in this fake world, purely for entertainment, was because he was chosen from an unwanted pregnancy. There were six unwanted pregnancies and he was the first born, so he was the first chosen by the corporation producing the Truman Show.I really enjoyed watching Jim Carrey play Truman because as Truman began to experience signs that he was living in this fake world, it kind of turned into comedy. I love watching Jim Carrey because he never fails to make people laugh. He's done a ton of comedies including Dumb and Dumber, Liar Liar, Bruce Almighty, Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and many others. Carrey accepted this role even though he was getting paid 12 million less than what he usually gets paid for films. I'm glad he did though because I can't imagine the movie with anyone other than him playing the face of Truman. Jim Carrey tends to do a lot of improvising on set, which is exactly what he did during this movie. He didn't agree with some of the parts of the scripts and he would change things he did and said last minute as they were filming. Obviously as I was watching this movie I couldn't help but notice how it was filmed. I really enjoyed how this film other than the fact that it takes a while to understand what is going on in the movie. Many people may get half way through the movie and finally come to the realization that his whole life is being filmed as a reality TV show. However, it's also really intriguing how it is filmed. It's filmed in the perspective of hidden cameras. The angles are different than \"normal\" movies and a corporation logo appears in the corner of the screen in most scenes of the movie. This really showed how he was being filmed without him knowing. It gave the movie more of a reality TV show feeling than a formal movie which makes situations that happen more shocking. The script is very well written in my opinion because it makes you feel every core emotion. You laugh, you feel sad for him, you get angry at how they treat him and you feel excited for him. As the movie starts out he has no idea he's being filmed, however as the movie goes on he begins to realize and pick up on peculiar things that are happening to him. Characters in the movie start to feel sorry for him and try and warn him that he's being played. He starts to pick up on all these clues and try to figure out how he can overcome his fear of the water to potentially escape. The only way out of this TV set is to escape past the water, but unfortunately for him he has developed a strong fear for water. When he was younger, his \"father\" died in the water so he's never tried to travel past it. This was their way of putting fear in his head so he would never want to escape this TV set if he ever found out about what was going on. He eventually has the courage to get through the water on a boat which leads him to the door to exit the TV set. This movie provided such a thrill factor that I haven't seen in many other movies before. Watching him experience his situations and get past them is exactly why I believe it is one of the best psychological thrillers that exists.",
