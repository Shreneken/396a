            "review_title": "High Noon at Mega Suck-fest",
            "content": "First off, this is a kids movie so certain allowances should be made for its rubbishness. But I expect that the majority of 7 year olds would find High Noon an unrewarding and painful experience.The film concerns a group of extremely unscary baddies who decide that world domination can be best achieved by hijacking an amusement park. Two things prevent the villains from carrying out their evil plan. Firstly, the bad guys find themselves easily defeated at every turn by three children and Hulk Hogan. Secondly, those aforementioned bad guys are morons.The three children are, of course, the 3 Ninjas. They defeat fully grown men in martial art combat at every turn. Particularly remarkable, since one of the kids appears to be about four years old. Of especial note is the second youngest as he sports a haircut that is so abysmally misguided it makes Billy Ray Cyrus's mullet look tasteful. It is a bowl-cut/pony-tail combo; two haircuts from hell all on one head - it is truly horrendous and should really not be seen by younger viewers.An interesting aspect of the movie is that despite the fact that the fairground has been hijacked, no one seems to have informed the extras. They carry on enjoying the rides as if nothing has happened. As I said earlier, the bad guys are essentially idiots, so its just possible that they have not got their heads round the technicalities of hijacking. But, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter as the film is not exactly convincing in a general sense.Do I recommend it? Not really but it is an ideal birthday present for a child you dislike.",

Cinema is a beautiful art form, and no cinema is more gorgeous than 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain. Epic on a grand scale, the cinematic majesty on display would make Kurosawa's corpse reanimate just so it could kill itself in shame at never meeting the grandeur of vision presented herein. I saw this movie and broke down in tears, as I knew my eyes had witnessed the most beautiful sight since Stallone and Carl Weathers flirting with each other on the beach in one of the Rocky films. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll curse yourself for thinking that the greatness of the previous 3 Ninjas movies could ever be topped.Bravo. Bravo.",

            "content": "This movie was a real treat. I say \"treat\" in the sense that it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, hence I love it. The plot is ridiculous & other posters have done a good job at pointing out the shortcomings so I'll keep this brief. As someone alluded to previously & after a secondary viewing last night re-enforced, it is quite comical how the \"terrorists\" go through extreme measures to get into the park (ie; having a ship offshore, jet skis, scuba diving, underwater lasers etc,) when they could just pay the nominal fee to gain access to the park! That was great. Hulk Hogan as always, is a crowd pleaser. I like at the end when he knocks off the tops of the underwater breathing apparatuses with a single blow & they masquerade as oxygen diffusing projectiles! Jim Varney obviously was funny in his role as the antagonist, no doubt ashamed to be cast in such a lousy movie. And the three \"ninjas\"? Don't even get me started. So cheesy with the Ayais! over & over. Terrible actors, but it all adds to the ambiance of a wonderful film, albeit low budget & misconstrued, unintentional comedy. Would highly recommend, & it goes without saying that a solid buzz while embarking on such a journey will no doubt add to the enjoyment derived from this little gem. Cheers!",

It's been fun watching him laugh at it all over again. (BTW, my sons are currently 21 & 17...lol) Even though it doesn't have all the same boys in it as the previous 3 Ninja movies do, you don't need to have seen them to watch this one.

I enjoyed this movie because all the kids have action. They all have black belts so the action is really good. It's a great movie. I liked it. This movie is great entertainment for children. This is also a good movie to watch if you are bored or there's nothing good on. I enjoyed this movie a lot. I've seen all the 3 ninjas movies and enjoyed them all. This is also a good action film for children. They would probably enjoy it as much as I did. Victor Wong acted really well returning as grandpa mori. The rest of the cast is good also, and the movie as a good storyline.",

Think back to when you were a kid. Wouldn't you love to see a movie where kids your age can take on fully grown men and win?

            "content": "1992's \"3 Ninjas\" was a really cool movie, back in 2nd grade! I felt that it would of been best to leave it alone. But, like all money hungry executives do, they have to go and make 3 lame sequels that overexpose what made the first one successful: fighting. And I don't know what the hell the filmakers were doing while shooting these movies and casting the stars? I guess they filmed the third one right after the first and intended for that to be the second one, since the kids in it are the same as the kids in the first! (still with me?) But overall, this is the worst of the four. Was it supposed to be a prequel or something, 'cause all three kids look about 5 years younger than in the previous movies. And even if it was a prequel, the filmakers obviously didn't realize the kids don't get their names until later. Please don't rent this movie to enjoy it with your kids or yourself. Rent it to make fun of it with a friend or sibling, but beware, it might bore you or cheese you to death before you finish it!!Note: A black belt doesn't screech out a high-pitched \"HI-YA\" when doing something like throwing an egg at a bad guy or cutting a rope that releases an anvil or something of that sort that black-belts don't do.",

Watched it on a hangover with a mate and we couldn't stop laughing the whole time and, despite having a lot of work to do, were compelled to watch to the end to see if the 3 ninjas won. It's the most ludicrous story line I've ever seen in a film, I was just sitting there thinking how is that little kid beating up grown men 'ninjas' - surely just knee him in the head, he's about 6. And that ridiculous girl with all the gadgets, \"Let me just reroute the encryption through the CPU\" or some bollox, on what was essentially a toy computer. The female leader of the terrorist looks like an 80s porn star (so does the Hulk as well, I guess), speaking of which, Mr. Hogan put in one of his best performances since Muppets from Space. It is genuinely the worst, least believable film you will ever see and as a result is truly hilarious. Also, one of the kids has literally the worst haircut you will ever see, it's worth watching the film purely for that. Long live Dave Dragon!!!",

While lots of people rag on Hulk Hogan, he wasn't the worst actor. By far, the most wooden performance goes to Loni Anderson. If this is a family oriented movie, why in the world did they have her dress in that skanky leather outfit that was far too short? Terrible casting as far as Loni goes. She was supposed to be the evil Medusa but I didn't buy it. She just didn't have the quality of pulling off the 'bad guy' type of role. She was much better on 'WKRP in Cinncinati'. I got a little tired of Tum Tum's 'Ay-yahs' after a while. They were too high pitched and over done. All 6 stars go to Jim Varney. I was actually rooting for Lothar to become successful in his mission for he was the only one of the bad guys with the brilliance to pull off the heist. He easily outshone all the stars, as usual. He always gives 100% to whatever role he played as you can see here. Jim and Victor were the two best actors in this movie. Maybe if Jim had cast and directed this, it would've been a bigger box office success. The man was a brilliant actor and a genius. If you're a fan of Varney's, then yes, get the movie just to watch him. Otherwise, don't bother.",

Not dissimilar to Einsteins theory of bending light around the universe to see into the future (aka Paycheck). This movie is so terrible (just like the ones before it) in so many ways its hard to believe any production company would sign on to do it. Hulk Hogan is, as always, a terrible actor, but to reproduce the performance he gave in Gremlins 2: The New Batch, would be impossible for anyone.Watch this movie if you have a sense of humor and an hour and a half to waste.",

They fail, thanks to some geeky kids who apparently know martial arts. The most annoying thing though is how easily grown adults get beaten up by pesky little kids.

Oh, actually it was, but it was in code that I deciphered too late to save myself. It was the part which read: \"3 Ninjas High Noon at Mega Mountain.\" WOE! WOE UNTO ME!!!!I'm a man with, admittedly, unusual and quirky tastes when it comes to film and film actors/actresses. I like a lot of character actors because they tend to get the most interesting variety of parts. I really loved Victor Wong's career. Memories of his performances in films like 'Tremors,' 'Prince of Darkness,' and especially 'Big Trouble in Little China' (with another favourite of mine, Al Leong -- the Wing Kong Hatchet Man!!! *LOL*) have put me on a quest to see as much of his work as possible.A quest that died Saturday afternoon just past. This deeply regrettable, dreckish, foul excuse of a film and the knowledge that Victor Wong appeared in three other incarnations of it is enough to sour even the strongest movie-goers stomach. Victor's appearance in this awful thing is mercifully concentrated in the opening of the film. It gives him no chance to show off any of his inimitable charm and Victor Wong looks like a tired old man weighed down by the two hardest words that any actor will ever have to listen to: Contractual obligation.Music: insipid. Direction: insipid. Plot: insipid. Dialogue: insipid. Acting: hit and miss.The kids all deserved better than to be stuck in this film. For fear that they will track me down and beat the heck out of me with their ninja skills, just let me say that they all gave academy award worthy performances. Exhibit A: the two younger brothers manage to keep a straight face and wait -- holding their fight stance -- for thirty seconds as the three bad guy adults struggle to get out of their costumes and dress up again so that the kids can yell \"NINJAS!!!\" I don't blame the kids for this despite the fact that they were as unwatchable as everything else here. This film will bore parents to death so unless you want orphans, avoid, avoid, AVOID!!!Victor Wong (let me return to a bright light for a moment) died after this film. Jim Varney, who also appeared in this film, has also since died. You may draw your own conclusions.Varney, in all fairness, is probably the best thing in this film. His performance takes him in a scene-stealing direction with a bad guy turn. Out-acting Loni Anderson, Hulk Hogan and all three ninjas, he easily comes across as a bully who is picking an acting fight with unarmed opponents ... I said I wasn't going to blame the kids... this wasn't their fault, this wasn't their fault ...Final Verdict: (un)watchable... BEARABLE only for those who are die-hard Wong or Varney fans. Also bearable if one chants over and over again the words: \"this too shall pass.\" All others should give a miss with extreme prejudice.",

Some audiences did like this addition, but it was amazing film like the other 3 Ninjas movies. 3 Ninjas are awesome totally. Great selection on bring the legend Hulk Hogan into the picture he was cool.3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain was also a classic and really good kids family film. A kick-butt action-comedy-family film. The boys, Mathew Botuchis, Michael J. O'Laskey II, and J.P. Roeske II were so awesome in this addition. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain was so funny and full of true Martial Arts. Victor Wong who starred as Grandpa he did great and connected very well with the boys in this addition. Sean McNamara who directed film. Great work! Sean McNamara and Jeff Phillips thanks for writing such a amazing kick-butt story. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain rocks!We all remember watching the 3 Ninjas films as a kid and watching them via Television whenever they showed. 3 Ninjas was always a joy to watch because they kick-butt. There's nothing negative about the films itself. I recommend them for everyone and you should check them out if you haven't today. If you love them you'll love this one too. 3 Ninjas will forever rock your world. These boys are cool.",

            "review_title": "And Another Franchise Fizzled Out...",
            "content": "I loved the 3 Ninjas franchise when it was new in the early 1990s. The first film was brilliant and the actors actually knew martial arts and what they were doing, all having done it from a young age.Unfortunately the second and third films were released the wrong way round so you get ninjas with new heads in the second film and the original heads in the third film, and both films were financial disasters.Despite this somebody for some reason now lost in the mists of time decided they wanted another 3 Ninjas film and the result was 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain. It was filmed in 1996 but not released until 1998, and because kids have this annoying habit of growing up, the characters needed new actors.Unfortunately the plot was ridiculous. A theme park that's been hijacked and everybody else apart from those paid to speak continue to wander around aimlessly and quietly from ride to ride, as if nothing was up. A common trend in kid movies is bad guys who are blatant morons, yet somehow get themselves attached to an evil overlord who puts up with all this and then wonders why their evil plan falls apart.It perhaps stands to reason why many films decide a trilogy is enough. By the time a fourth film comes along the concept has usually been milked to death and/or has been handed to writers and cast who have no concept of what went before and try to reinvent things, usually with limited success. While it was plausible that the older Ninja would decide one day that kicking ass wasn't \"cool\" any more, it wasn't plausible that the middle one would lose in a fight with a lawnmower and end up with that haircut!Unfortunately the presence of Hulk Hogan, Jim Varney and a brief cameo from Victor Wong can't fix what was always going to be somewhat depressing compared to what came before. The best actors on the planet can't save a bad script. It's not completely unwatchable, it was bearable but ultimately disappointing because it could have been so much better, all of the 3 Ninja sequels could have been. But we are where we are so... Oh well.",

            "content": "3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain starts as a young girl named Amanda (Chelsey Earlywine) & her family move into their new home in Hidden Shores, they are welcomed to the neighbourhood by brother's Colt (Michael O' Laskey II), TumTum (James Paul Roeske II) & Rocky (Mathew Botuchis) who are all going to an amusement park named Mega Mountain that afternoon & invite Amanda to join them. While at the theme park the three ninja brother's & Amanda become aware that it has been taken over by a group of thieves, armed with guns & in complete control of Mega Mountain they hold the owner to ransom. The three ninja brother's decide to fight back & with the help of ageing television action hero Dave Dragon (Hulk Hogan) take on the criminals, can they save the day or will the bad guy's win?Co-written & directed by Sean McNamara this rather violent & childish slapstick action comedy that isn't particularly great & pretty silly at times but I found it passed the time if nothing else. The script is a sort of childish Die Hard (1989) but instead of ruthless criminals there are bumbling bad guy's, instead of the high rise building they take over an amusement park, instead of a tough cop hero there are three bratty child ninjas & their geek female friend & instead of a wisecracking Bruce Willis we get a tired looking Hulk Hogan as a washed-up television star (art imitating life maybe?). Here in the UK this film was quite heavily cut by around four minutes for scenes of nunchukas, head butts, ear claps & a kid wetting himself & having just seen the uncut version I am not sure what to make of it, 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is definitely aimed at a young audience with it's silly slapstick action & childish humour so the high levels of violence did sit a little uneasily with me. From the head butts to kicks & punches to sword fights & even a scene in which a young boy throw's darts at a man. Just think about how incredibly dangerous that is for a minute, seriously if someone threw a dart at you & it hit you in the face you would be in big trouble & another worrying aspect of 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is that none of this violence ever has any consequence. The guy who gets a dart thrown at him just catches it in his mouth, punches, kicks & being pushed off rooftops seem to cause no sort of injury to anyone & maybe it would have been better if the makers did emphasise how dangerous these techniques are. As an action comedy it moves along at a decent pace, it's silly & not particularly coherent (where did Amanda get that remote control helicopter from at the end? Why is everyone at the park enjoying themselves it being run by armed criminals?) & it's pretty predictable & safe in that the good guy's win & the bad guy's lose.The fights are played mostly for laughs with bumbling bad guy's being beaten up by kids, there's an exploding boat at the end & not much else in the way of action. One also has to say that Mega Mountain amusement park has some really lack security, I mean Amaanda manages to take explosives, razor sharp throwing cards, a razor bladed yo-yo & a remote control helicopter inside her backpack. Mega Mountain also seems to have many brilliantly placed CCTV cameras that track exactly what armed criminals want & from perfect angles.Filmed at Elitch Gardens amusement park in Denver in Colorado, rather sloppily made with poor continuity & lacklustre production values. The acting isn't great, the three ninja kids are terrible while Hulk Hogan seems bored & Loni Anderson is the main highlight as the whip cracking leather clad Medusa but what is someone dressed like that doing in a kids film?3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is a silly & childish action comedy that is probably a bit too violent for a film aimed at children & implies that violence has no consequence. I suppose it passes the time & as a silly Die Hard style kids comedy I thought it was watchable.",

            "content": "I reviewed this title back in November 2008, about 4 years ago, and while I still come to the conclusion that this movie still gets a rating of 1 because of how ridiculously bad it is, upon seeing it a few more times, I have to dig deeper into this movie and provide some more thoughts and ideas about it.First off, if you've seen the movie, Skip the next paragraph.In the recent years of the 3 Ninjas, They've grown older and more mature, and because of this, their interest in being ninjas has taken a backseat to more older things. While Tum-tum is still a young boy, Rocky has moved onto girlfriends, and Colt is merely stuck in the middle. Not only that, Tum-tum's Favorite Saturday morning hero, Dave Dragon, is about to cancel his 15-year long superhero show, due to low ratings and loss of interest. His final appearance will be at the Mega mountain theme park on tum-tum's birthday. So Tum-tum wants to go, and his older brothers tag along with their new friend, Amanda, who seems to be an expert on Computer Programming, hacking, and complex electronics. while at the theme park, a group of mercenary Ninjas, led by escaped convict, Mary Ann rogers, AKA Medusa, take over the theme park and threaten to harm it's people, but will let them go in exchange for a large sum of money. Will they succeed in their evildoing, or will the 3 ninjas save the day? OK, Upon seeing this movie a few more times and reading other comments left by users, There's lots to say now. First and foremost, i see 2 obvious references to mid-90s Role Playing games - First, look at Colt's hair. not only does it look ridiculous, it's a bad rip-off of Hero-class Bowie from shining force II, A sega Genesis RPG from 1994. Also, look at Amanda. Doesn't her character seem familiar to another girl from a 1995 SNES RPG? she does have thick glasses, knows her way around complex electronics and computers - Kinda like Lucca from Chrono Trigger maybe? Secondly, kids movies of the 90's can be totally remembered for kids outsmarting adults and leaving a trail of laughter in their wake. It started with Home alone, from 1990. Then it carried throughout the 90s, but around the mid-to-late 90s, the clich\u00e9 got really old. this movie feeds off that clich\u00e9 like Michael Moore feeds off of McDonalds.Thirdly, The aged stars of our show. First there's Hulk Hogan. Now i love wrestling, to me, it's entertainment and should not be looked at as a legitimate sport, cause it's not. Hulkamania was still running wild for the hulk at the time, he was in his 40s (if this was filmed in 1997, released in 1998, and hulk was born in 1953, he would've been 44 years old. For the most part, his acting isn't really believable, but his larger than life character in the ring more than makes up for it. then we have our other aged star, Loni Anderson. this was a few years after her divorce with Burt Reynolds, and i gotta admit, with all the leather, the make-up, lipstick, and sexy cougar voice, I was still turned on to her. How old was she around the time of filming? Well, she was born in 1945, making her 52 around the time of filming. Hot damn! But her acting skills in this film are as follows...Fourth, Loni Anderson might as well have starred in a porno, cause her acting skills, are totally unbelievable. And adding onto another user's comment, The Dialogue between Loni and Chelsey (Amanda) feels like watching a lesbian porno, about an aged beauty queen wanting to have her way with a young woman.So the bottom line, 3 Ninjas; High Noon at Mega Mountain isn't what you'd call a memorable film, i'd prefer the term \"Boring Saturday afternoon fare.\" it's totally forgettable, the only reason i'll ever remember it is because Loni Anderson was a total cougar in it. I'd rather remember hulk hogan for his Wrestling matches.1/10",

In fact, the only somewhat tolerable asset was the soundtrack, that was decent compared to how awful everything else was.What made the movie especially bad was the plot. It is incredibly lame and predictable, with one of the dumbest endings I have seen in recent memory. Production values-wise, the movie is not good either, the cinematography, sets and scenery are of shoddy quality and the editing is so slip-shod it hurts the eyes and makes the editing in a movie like The Medallion seem Oscar-worthy. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed with little or no drive or energy, while the script and direction are terrible. Same with the acting, the kids are all annoying, the villains are pathetic in both character and acting while Hulk Hogan has a poor character and is not given much to do.Overall, an awful film and not worth it. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

The film begins with three very white-bread kids being taught by their grandfather how to be ninjas in some sort of Mario Brothers-like training facility. Considering how similar all this looks to \"Pocket Ninjas\" (the #4 lowest ranked film on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), I knew I was in for a painful time! Soon after leaving grandpa's house, the three annoying brats go with their friends to an amusement park that is about to be taken over by the lamest villains in history--Loni Anderson and Jim Varney as 'Medusa' and 'Lothar'!! And, oh God say it isn't so, it's up to the thee kids AND Hulk Hogan to save the day. Can it get any worse?!?! Well, with tons of lame stunts, tons of special effects and minimal acting, the answer is YES! To show the FBI that they mean business, once the baddies take over the park, they make certain rides go SLIGHTLY faster!!! What beasts!! In fact, while there is lots of punching and kicking, this is only family-friendly violence--so the kids naturally win and no one shoots, stabs or even tickles their opponents. Because of this and the constantly insipid writing, the film is a total bore to anyone older than about 6.So should this movie be on the infamous Bottom 100 list? I think probably not for two reasons. First, very, very young kids will enjoy this insipid crap--and to me, a film should not be on the list if it is in any way enjoyable. Second, the production values are not that terrible and the film makes no attempt to be anything more than it is--a dopey little film that would most likely make a parent kill themselves or the kids if they are forced to watch it!!",

It seems the film makers were unable to think of anything original and just threw in every kids film gimmick they could find, except for cute animals that is. We have the classic conflict between older siblings wanting to be cool and the younger ones acting like kids. We have the three bumbling bad guys who get beaten up by little kids. We have the phony TV superhero becoming an actual hero. We have bad guys with guns who seem to never use them, nd if they do they never hit anyone. The list goes on and on, however there are other kids movies that do all of these things so much better, in 3 Ninjas it just becomes corny. The only original thing (not counting the other 3 Ninja films) is the fighting but that ends up being nothing but several minutes of three kids repeatedly shouting \"Ai-ya\". This clearly suffers being a sequel produced solely to cash in on the franchise. I say, go see the first one and skip this.",

However when terrorists seize control of the park and demand $10 million or they will start causing accidents among the customers. With the gates locked down and no help on the way, the boys find themselves calling on their ninja skills after all.OK, I wasn't expecting this to be Die Hard but I was genuinely surprised to find out what passes as kids' entertainment in the eyes of some makers. I had to check IMDb during it to find out if it was a TVM or not and again was shocked to learn that this made it into cinemas, yes, cinemas. It actually got released and was shown to a paying public as opposed to just let out on television. Personally I do not have an issue with the idea behind the film because kids will always love to see their peers beating adults. I'm sure many parents will have concerns about letting their children watch something with lots of fighting and kicking in case they imitate it, but I'll leave those concerns to them (even if I do agree with them). So in theory this should be a silly and fun martial arts film for children.However this is so cheap - lacking originality, effort and fun that I did wonder if the audience didn't deserve something better than this. The mixed group watching this on a lazy afternoon hardly let out a chuckle or any sign of enjoyment. The martial arts action did show that the movement is well done but that is about it. I expected the plot to be daft but it is daft to the point of being painful and it just felt churned out like a bad panto \u0096 the basics with little for kids and nothing at all for adults.The cast are roundly poor although this was almost always going to be a given. The kids can't act to save their lives even if they move well. Botuchis is unconvincing, Roeske is unbearably saccharine while O'Laskey looks absurd with one of the worse haircuts I have ever seen. Hogan looks so cheap that his wrestling days look like Shakespeare in the Park as a result \u0096 he is terrible and really should have more dignity about him than this. Anderson is poor and given little support by Jim Varney. Wong's last film on earth? Shame. McNamara's direction is TVM standard at best and the cheap incidental music just makes it all feel worse still.Overall, a popular one for inclusion in the bottom 100 on this site and it is indeed rubbish but it didn't have to be. The idea could have been fun if done properly but it is cheaply delivered in every regard and lacks any sense of fun, wit or imagination, leaving it feeling like it has been churned out as part of a money making process without a care for the audience (which, on this evidence, it exactly what happened).",

But even with a bigger budget, a few grownup \"guest stars\" and three new youngsters in the lead roles, \"Mega Mountain\" won't amount to a hill of beans at the box office. On the other hand, given the series' past track record, homevideo prospects are mildly bright.",

            "content": "1st watched 4/6/2008 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Sean McNamara): Harmless fluff, but poorly done at times. In this 3 Ninjas entry, the guys are spending time at their favorite amusement park for Tum Tum's birthday. A group of bad ninjas just happen to be attempting to take over the park for a ransom while they are there. The bad guys are led by Madusa(played by Loni Anderson) and assisted by a rare non-comic Jim Varney, who actually does a pretty good job as a villain. The movie starts with the 3 hero's doing a pretty cool obstacle course at their grandfather's place but learn a valuable lesson when he turns off the power and then makes them attempt it backwards. The lesson they learned, supposedly, is not to get a big head because they aced it going forwards but couldn't cut it backwards without power(believe it or not!!). This is later used by the guys in the final showdown with the baddies, which kind of brings their lesson back to them and creates kind of a purpose for their grandfather's teachings. I won't let you know what happens the 2nd time, in case you want to watch the movie yourself, but you can probably guess. This predictability, some obvious mistakes in the production(boom mikes and wires being visible) and the low acting expectations from most make this attempt at a fun kids movie even dismal to most kids, probably.",

Not a bad plot because it introduces some fun scenarios. And some of the training and fight sequences were pretty creative, just hard to get into considering how flawed this movie was.The previous kids who played the ninjas obviously had outgrown the roles by the time this was made but the casting was terrible.

            "content": "This is essentially Home alone 1 meets die hard in the sleaziest theme park in America. Yet the henchmen in this movie make Marv and Harry from Home Alone 1/2 look like green berets and or the American Seal Team 6. This is such a bad movie you'd need to be under some sort of influence to enjoy this. This starts off with three kids who are in this torture like room where you almost think it's Saw. They are all dressed in ninja gear and pass through this obstical course. I don't know why but I just think that the grandpa is disappointed the children didn't die. I wish I took a picture of my face to see my disappointment that the three \"ninjas\" aren't even old enough to buy cigarettes or adult beverages as they blurt out their 1990s rad out dated one liners.As crazy as it sounds though like it's insulting to get a little 9 year old like Michael (Tum-tum) beat you up but the kids can fight to a certain degree, the fights are better choreographed than some action movies from \"heroes\" two or three times their age. That's about all the nice I can say about this movie.The soundtrack is this whimsical spew of nonsensewhy is the guy who does Ernest goes to camp (Jim Varney) in this. At least if they make a remake John Cena can be in this.Why is the grandpa Asian. I'd have a better time believing the kids have an African grandpa. They have no facial features or anything to believe it. Even the mother of the boys doesn't look THAT Asian. I guess it wouldn't be 3 ninjas without some racial stereotyping. Sorry, sorry (takes deep breath) I swear I'm not a \"woke\" millennial. The actor who plays the grandfather looks so greasy like his hair is so oily I could fry egg rolls if I ringed his hair out in it.One of the boys has some sense. He is turning 15 and wants to get a car instead of going to grandpas to get \"ninja training\". The grandfather overhears it and is all disappointed. He drives them home and it's the littlest one tum-tums birthday so they all go to this third rate amusement park which is when this nonsense hits the fan. The dad has such a bad wig on.The CGI is dreadful they even edit over the tv screens. Were too lazy not to put the Hulk Hogan tv show on the tv, how hard would it have been to burn off a DVD what? Did they not have the budget. They had to spend it somehow as they didn't get any famous actors or actresses in this other than Jim, whatever the medusa actress was as she had a lot of IMDB credits and so forth. Why is the fat bad guy in so many shots?Hulk is such an idiot in this. With his outfit he looks questionably straight and sort of like a pedophile as hateful as it sounds with his outfit and his hair especially and by SOME CHANCE tum tums birthday he wants to go to that amusement park to see this creepy guy. It'll be his last appearance as Danger Dave or whatever his name is. I'll just call him diddler Dave.. actually no. Hulk.Now we cut to the kids in their room and they have what look like real weapons on the wall. What a great mother.The helicopter the girl flies into the window are her parents on Valium I'm sure a lot of peoples parents would freak out if the first moment they are in a new neighborhood their daughter breaks a window with her stupid toy helicopter. But remember everything is so lazily written I mean convenient. Oh yeah that 200$+ window is coming out of her allowance.Some reason the fat bad guy reminds me of Hurley in the tv series Lost. I guess there is a stunt double for everyone out there. The bad guy played by Jim Varney if this movie had a budget or a better script could have been Tim Curry or possibly Jean Claude Van Damme. When I saw the bad guys I immediately thought to myself tell me this movie failed.There is this one bad guy with a really awful wig in it that may have been purchased from the bad wig store that Michael Angelo Batio the guitarist, James Christian who sings for a band called House Of Lords , guitarist Jeff Beck got their wigs at. It looks so fake and stupid looking. Why would he wear it. I'd seriously go bald.At first it seems the Hulkster is too ashamed to be there and is in street gear so he can pretend he's not interested and then woosh he strips down to his questionable outfit that is just awful. If I had kids I wouldn't let them near the hulkster in that. I actually wonder why Hulk would ever sign up to be in this movie. I mean he was still in WCW as far as I know. He HAD to be making enough money to be able to say heck no brother! Did the steroid company he uses make him do this movie as a front to launder steroids. I'm getting a little ahead of myself! But thankfully that wig comes off. Hulk Hogan gets beat up and knocked out like 2 or 3 times in this movie. I know it's a kids movie and the kids are the stars but this is just insulting.The bad woman is like this dominatrix who looks like a washed up ring rat, stripper or something. She wants to sabotage the park unless she gets 10 million dollars which it'll take more than that to fix her face to make her pretty again.I love how the ONLY time the bad guys are called ninjas is in front of the boys these two or three mid life crises men \"strip\" their street clothes into ninja gear in front of the children. After that there is as much talent as there is this amazing film making and ground breaking story telling as well as originality.I love how the bad guys are firing AK47 looking machine guns into the sky, telling the cops to back off and think it's a good idea for these men twice the kids age to try and beat them up. However calling anyone in this movie ninjas is just insulting. I've believed worst WWF and WCW gimmicks over this and especially today that is saying something!It was so lazy how they sped up the footage in the roller coasters, then again I'm sure someone over 10 is not supposed to have seen this.The nerd girl in this movie and her silly weapons, I don't know why she isn't on the 3 boys fathers FBI watch list. She turns out to be this computer expert hacker.. can they share the drugs they were on to make this movie with me? How are they the only ones in the park that know that it's being over ran by \"ninjas\" an AK47 firing shots in the park and being surrounded by police isn't enough. They even lock all the doors. I've seen riots happen on the news for less.Jim Varney makes his presence known, he's so hardcore he steals a kids ice cream.What upsets me is, again it's a kids movie, but the bad guys have guns! Sure the whole point is the older kids don't want to be ninjas and this inadvertently makes them want to again but still. The bad guys have guns. Why don't they use them!The scene where the bad guys throw up must be after they read the script. Seriously why are there 4 of these? The only part I'll remember from this is when someone pees their pants in this.Why are the bad guys allowed to get photos of the kids that aren't theirs. Oh cool here ya go bro. I don't care if you're pedophiles or not. Every line the black girl with the other ones girlfriend she just wants the girl to break up with her boyfriend. Is she jealous? Does she want to date the blonde girl.Oh wow the second time they fire off the guns the crowd hears them. One nit pick I have is when Hulk gets punched out the second time NONE of the kids seem to care and it isn't until some 4 or 5 year old heckles Hulk Hogan that he becomes this bullet proof hero.Where did the nerd girl have time to hide her helicopter. Why is she this super hacker and how the HECK do you teach your 10-ish year old daughter how to diffuse a bomb. Does that come up before or after the morning cereal. To defuse a bomb they snap a part of the cable off her crappy laptop. That would not work getting rid of the ground prong and would most likely destroy her laptop thinking somewhat long term or worst case scenario not charge. Though I am still recovering brain cells to remember what I know about electrical engineering. That whole scene with the bomb is insulting.Seriously how did this come out? It's just awful. A straight to VHS or DVD I'd be ashamed to show my face or brag to girls or guys I was a part of. Even if I catered sandwiches there.Is there spoilers probably not, I'll put it anyways. This movie is so predictable it's not even spoilers.",

            "content": "That math problem sums up this whole movie. It is \"The Karate Kid\" divided into three smaller karate kids. Then you times that by zero effort and you get one big fat goose egg of a movie. It is the fourth installment in the 3 Ninjas saga, and it is by far the worst. The other films I will review in time, but this is the big one. This is the one that everyone hates. It has terrible acting, terrible fight scenes, and an awful story. When it comes to the acting the only person I liked was Jim Varney, but that is not enough to make up for the rest of the cast. As you would expect the child acting fails completely. The 3 ninjas are all annoying especially the little one. As for Hulk Hogan I didn't hate the performance, but it is exactly what you would expect. Then we have the action which is terrible. It goes for fighting that is practically slapstick instead of actual fighting. That is something I hate about a lot of kung fu/karate movies. So many of them just go for laughs from kiddies instead of actual honor for the fighting. It insults it, and if I was a karate teacher I would spit on pieces of trash like this everyday. In my opinion martial arts should stay in the more adult categories. The only true exception I have seen for these largely kid friendly martial arts movies is \"The Karate Kid\" that's it. I can't wait for a day when another film like that comes around and shows kids what the art of combat is about instead of constant shots to the balls. Until then we get this. Also another thing terrible about the fighting that is unbearable is how they have weapons with knives, but they never use them. I know it's for kids, but if there is a terrorist in front of you and you have a knife that guy is getting stabbed. Have stabbing or lose the knives in my opinion. Also the fighting suffers from those clich\u00e9 noises that are made when you make a punch. It gets really annoying quickly. Now we move on to the plot. It really all seems like an excuse to have Hulk Hogan. They might as well call it \"Hulk and 3 Ninjas\". He was what sold the film in the first place, but I am going to try and explain the plot. The ninjas go to an amusement park, and it gets taken over by terrorists. The only hope is the 3 ninjas, a smart girl with glasses, and Hulk Hogan......(3 hours of laughing later) Yeah that is one of the lamest excuses for a plot I have ever seen. Then we have dialogue which just like the fighting suffers from way to much childish humor. The jokes are very repetitive. The movie just isn't funny. I'm not going to give this film a 0 star rating. It's bad, but at least it isn't \"Pocket Ninjas\". Just saying the title of that movie makes me shiver.1/2 of a star out of 4",

I noticed all the elements present in a bad movie. Then, Mega Mountain was aired on HBO, years later since the last time, and saw it for whatever reason you could think of that included weed. Stupid jokes, stupid plot, stupid acting, stupid kids making stupid moves to stupid bad guys. That's all there is to it. Just like the previous ones, but this time they step it up a notch, by adding the incredible martial arts moves of that kung fu legend, Hulk Hogan. There were really memorable moments, like the one where a bunch of people puke after riding a ride turned nightmare (actually, they were puking over being extras for this movie). The movie's plot was probably stolen from a rejected script from Beverly Hills Cop 3, and later rewrote to achieve that disgusting kiddy tone. This is an insult to any audience, including babies.

Tum's birthday party is on the same day as the final appearance of his favorite TV hero, Dave Dragon, played by the Hulkster (brother!) Well, he got lucky. There also happen to be terrorists who want to, get this, take over the amusement park. See? That's just plain silly. So, since the 3 Ninjas are there, they break out their ninja skills and save the day with the Davester.I remember this being my favorite 3 Ninjas movie. I totally regret making this decision, and I don't even know why it used to be my favorite. It feels like they tried to get everything wrong here, but with that, it makes the movie fun to watch.

Rocky looks about the same age, Colt looks around the same age and looks like he lost touch with reality with that hair style (please ditch that) and the worst of them all was Tum-Tum. it's not the actor's fault because he tries hard, but when i see the first movie and then the last, Tum-Tum looks younger and more fit. Tum-Tum is supposed to be big, not slim. Another major issue with this movie is the plot. the plot of villains hi-jacking an amusement park isn't a bad idea. the bad idea though is that a lot of the things they do aren't really reality based. there's no way on Earth that a bad woman would be able to hack a roller coaster ride and turn it upside down like it occurred in the movie in that time. they should've made it more believable. also when the bad guys finally reveal themselves, it shows that some people (i guess) didn't hear that the park was hi-jacked as there are people still riding rides.and finally another issue is Hulk Hogan. He's just not a good actor and in this movie, he's just kinda there to provide a few fight scenes until the over acting Loni Anderson knocks him out or captures him. then at the end, the kids give credit to Hulk for saving the day when the best thing he did was hit a torpedo that the kids created. this movie wasn't awful though because Jim Varney at least was having fun and i DID enjoy the female characters they made. Rocky's girlfriend was fine as she was there to look pretty and depend on Rocky while the boys' new neighbor Amanda did her part well as the Velma of the group by being smart with computers. if the movie actually did better with picking actors who were older, then this movie would've been better. the biggest issues couldn't give it a better grade than 4. if you enjoy a good laugh, then watch this movie because Hulk will crack you up...i still don't understand how Jim Varney can't tell that Hulk Hogan is following him.",

I'm sure the intrepid masses of casual movie-goers teeming with anticipation for the latest 3 Ninjas spectacle felt betrayed on a deep and personal level akin to having a father register you for the navy. While this movie may not be the best in its class and may suffer from numerous flaws (rancid acting, unrealistic plot, pathetic villains, stanky clich\u00e9s, annoying ninja kid grunts, Hulk Hogan's dialogue, Hulk Hogan's wardrobe, Hulk Hogan) it still maintains one splendid aspect which I find delightful no matter how many times a week I sit down and pop this VHS in: its soundtrack.Yes, Howard Bucket may be one of the most under-recognized composers of synthesized film soundtracks. I bought this soundtrack on cassette in 2001 and have never felt more satisfied spending a dollar twenty five. Bucket shows a diverse range of emotions, from the go-lucky tune of \"Ninjas and a Female Geek\" to the dark and menacing track \"Varney's Villainy\". Who could refuse the heroic and uplifting tone of \"Dragon's Theme\"? A personal favorite of mine is \"Hogan Gets Captured Again\". The whimsical and bouncy nature of \"Bad Guys Get the Money\" forms a stark contrast to the dramatic almost nerve-biting \"Realistic Battle on Top of a Roller Coaster Track\", a technique that bands like Radiohead and Smash Mouth began to employ many years after. And who can forget the pen-ultimate track \"Tum Tum Eats the Flesh of the Fallen\"? Yes, this soundtrack is truly as epic as the film it was made for, but of a much higher quality! You see kids, soundtracks don't require a gigantic team of cameramen, directors, producers, writers, engineers, actors, more writers, actors' parents, and technical consultants. Soundtracks require only one lonely thirty three year old in a studio with a synthesizer. And a lot of heart.",

            "content": "I don't know if I can add to what others have said about this movie's crappy-ness. They really cut corners on this one: For example, in the first movie, the kids seem to be pretty good at this karate stuff. You have to kind of suspend your disbelief when the youngest attacks anyone, because you can just see him getting picked up by the scruff of the neck and hung up to dry until the fight is over. But it's a kids' film so that's not really a spoiler. And there is a lot of \"Home Alone\"-type stealth-fighting on the kids' side to help even things out. At the time, I saw the original actors from \"3 Ninjas\" on the \"Tonight Show\" and they seemed to really know karate, and were pretty charming for kid actors.By contrast, in this last abomination, you can see in the fight scenes that there is no contact, and frequently there is cheap, obvious, camera speeding up to make it look like a real fight, not choreography. The littlest one, who is even younger than he was in any of the other movies, (there are all new actors for the kids in this movie, a big mistake, and what's up with the mullet/ponytail on Colt? Even knowing karate he's going to get his ass kicked with that haircut! I'm gay but that look's too faggy for me. I mean, really! Butch it up a little, will ya?) In a good kids' movie there is something for the adults, too. But this movie doesn't really have much for the kids. Bad acting by Hulk Hogan and the kids, bad, bad, bad writing and directing, the earlier mentioned fake fight scenes (maybe these kids could take on an adult who didn't know karate, but for them to beat an adult NINJA, just because they have been trained by a clich\u00e9-spouting grandfather, and have an FBI agent father? I don't think so. And amusement park rides aren't designed so they can be stopped upside-down and remotely release the passengers, which is the so-called terrorists plan. It's called safety engineering, meaning, there is no situation where you would WANT to be able to do that, so you don't design your system to BE ABLE TO DO THAT! Of course, then you don't have a movie, if you can't do that. Of course, you would have to GET CLEVERER WRITERS! There's a few good lines from Loni Anderson and Jim Varney, although they both come across as somewhat incompetent. Can't have real, know-your-stuff terrorists around to scare the kiddies, now, can we? Guess not.As it happened, this movie came to North Carolina Cable TV around the same time I saw my first episode of the Middleman TV series, which happened to be the one about aliens hiding on earth disguised as people addicted to plastic surgery. When I first saw Loni Anderson, with her artificially plumped lips, probable-cheek-implants, probable-face-lift, probable-Botox, probable-etc., I first thought she had the same makeup as the aliens did in the Middleman episode. Then I realized that this was how she really looked. Scary. Probably too scary for a kids' movie. I know it was for me and I'm near 50.Summary: For a good karate movie, see the first \"3 Ninjas\" movie, or possibly the next two. Skip this bomb. Also the \"Karate Kid\" is good, esp. the first one (see a pattern here?) Someone tried to squeeze the last dime out of the \"3 Ninjas\" franchise; hopefully it is completely dead now. You know how these things can come back to life in Hollywood... (cue scary music...)",

            "content": "This movie has no entertainment value, not even to make fun of because it sucks so much in every aspect. The movie starts out strong by introducing us to a very stereotypical racist Asian grandpa, who is Asian for no reason other than he has to know ninja stuff, and is even more confusing because neither his kids nor his grandkids are at all Asian like him. Also Hulk Hogan is in this movie for no reason.This movie was genuine pain to sit through all the actors are terrible and there is a really s wordy love story that shouldn't exist in the first place. The climax of the movie lasts for like 3/4th's of its runtime and consists entirely of terrible fight choreography. The entire cast is super racist stereotypes like a guy with a Jamaican hat who fakes a thick accent terribly. Also the kids for some reason yell AYAH every time they throw a punch or kick which got annoying really fast and by the end of the movie I was genuinely mad. There is only one good scene in which one of the kids yells into a pipe and the bad guy who is standing at the other end flies backwards because of the wind and lands on an exposed metal pole which gets shoved up his a word violently.There is no plot at all stuff just happens for no reason and makes no sense like when the bad guys drop their machine guns so they can fight an unarmed Hulk Hogan and 3 five year olds with swords which they have for some reason. Also there is one scene where the bad woman starts a 4 minute timer on a bomb but it doesn't go off for well over 17 minutes.This movie really sucks and was actual work to sit through. Seriously f word this movie I hate this movie so much. On the bright side it's not the worst movie with a title starting with a 3. I am only giving this movie a 2 because it wasn't outwardly sexist or racist. After watching Pink, Airplane Mode, and 3 Idiotas, I have lost the ability to give movies lower than a 2.2/10\n-Rajesh P.",

The main thing that I did not like about this movie was that 3 different actors play the 3 ninjas. I think that the writers and the rest of the crew felt that the original actors were to old for the parts which I felt was ridiculous, why couldn't they have the original actors go to an amusement park as teenagers and young adults I don't see anything wrong with that, everybody goes to an amusement park, and if they are going to use 3 different actors why couldn't they find kids that resembled the original actors none of these kids even came close to looking like the original actors. I don't think that the director and the rest of the crew took the time to audition kids I think that those 3 kids were probably selected through a raffle or something. The only thing that they got right was the grandfather and the parents. If you have seen the first 3 movies then you might as well see this one but let me warn you you might be disappointed. This is the only 3 Ninjas movie that I don't own I just look at it whenever it comes on TV.",

            "content": "Let me just say that a nice introduction is not needed in this piece of leftover meatloaf that needed to be produced by a Fishcer Price karate team.3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain had a plan in it's motive to be produced. It wanted to show compassion. It wanted to show teamwork, brotherly love and it wanted to show Hulk Hogan's acting abilities. It all failed in that.Three brothers who happened to be in an amusement park will save the day because the amusement park is taken over by terrorists! There are also subplots of Hulk Hogan's character being a has-been (so is he) and the eldest ninja who'll get the heart of this ten-year-old girl. Lame! Colt is played by this kid who will become the future Canadian band Moffats-parody lead singer. Tum-tum is a little Hilary Swank stuck in a Baby Gap model's body. Rocky is this over-the-top, meant to be \"cool\" punk who can't kiss at fourteen.The supporting kids are just as weird. The computer girl had not a cinch of fear since there was a four-minute bomb inches away from her face. The \"roller coaster-Come save me!\" girl was the miscast of the entire debacle. Can she even stand still? Why is it such a good idea for terrorists to take over an amusement park? Why cast a has-been wrestler who can't even say his name right? Why are Jamaican men such good computer junkies? Why cast a toddler (who yelps like a strangling cat) into saying those damn \"Ay-Ya's\" over two dozen times? I liked these ninja movies. The first ones? Great. I was like three when that came to video. But this? This is the limit of underdeveloped. It looked like it was directed by a damn pro-kids pedophile! I would just say that the hype, the story, the climax and the stupendous fight scenes (where the kids close their little eye-dy widey's to kick the bad goons) take the cake as making this pure garbage.Don't waste your time, I did.",

The really annoying part was the little brat Tum-Tum, and his annoying war cry. looking back on the film now and taking into account that its a kids movie, I still find it so funny that a bunch of grown men can get their buts kicked by a bunch of kids.

In what can be seen as art mimicking life in a sick form of jurisdiction.The only weak point here is the basic plan of the terrorists. For a group of highly trained mercs, lead by Lothar Zogg no less, it was lacking in forethought.

Even my favorite Tum-Tum couldn't even save the film.The action - As a child might like it. If you have watched the other ones it was still somewhat reasonable and funny to watch the three boys beat up henchmen.Overall - I don't know if they were trying to go for the staple of oh look they took on three goons in 2 of the movies they must want it again just no don't ever do that. Do i think its watchable maybe if you're having a few with the friends or baked because I found myself skipping forward 5 seconds every 5 minutes. I'm 25 the other 3 movies still made me feel something by the end. This one was just disastrously bad and not in a good way.
