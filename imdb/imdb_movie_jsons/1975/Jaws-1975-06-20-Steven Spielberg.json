            "review_title": "So Much More Than Just A \"Shark Movie\"",
            "content": "Reputationally-speaking, \"Jaws\" will forever be known for two things: director Steven Spielberg's unique \"shark-eye view\" camera work and building of suspense, and composer John Williams' two note \"attack\" motif that became as iconic as any piece of music ever created. Perhaps those two aspects alone would have been enough to make \"Jaws\" an iconic film--who knows. But the fact is, this 1975 effort is about so much more than just suspense/horror. It is one of the most well-rounded, complete movies ever made.For a very basic overview, \"Jaws\" tells the story of the coastal town of Amity, which suddenly and inexplicably becomes the hunting grounds for a rogue Great White shark. Sheriff Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close down the beaches until further notice, but is opposed every step of the way by city official Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who worries about the potential loss of tourist business. When the attacks continue, however, Brody enlists the help of shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled boatsman Quint (Robert Shaw) to help hunt down the giant predator.As stated, the general premise and music here are well-known. But what always strikes me with each \"Jaws\" re-watch is how much it is a human drama as opposed to a horror piece driven by a villain (the shark, in this case).The first half of \"Jaws\" takes place almost entirely \"on land\", if you will, and focuses more on the politics of fear and commerce than anything supernatural or scary. If there are ever any doubts as to whether that material holds up, they can easily be put to rest after viewing the film through a pandemic context. Substitute \"global contagious disease\" for \"mindless, unstoppable shark\" and it's as relevant today as ever.The second half leans more towards \"adventure sea chase\", and is buoyed by ocean scenes that, despite being filmed 45+ years ago now, do not seen old or outdated in the least. Masterful cinematography almost always holds up, and Spielberg's behind-the-camera decisions certainly do here as well. Even then though, in the midst of a brutal and thrilling chase, Spielberg stops the action for a touching scene in which the three seaman bond over song and shared experiences.In order to fully exhibit such depth of character, great acting is required--and given here in spades. \"Jaws\" features a collection of unique characters that are always a joy to revisit. Scheider as the \"why-won't- anyone-listen-to-me!\" sheriff lets viewers relate to the story in a much more personal aspect, while Dreyfuss' Hooper is insightful, hilarious, and provides some of the best dialogue of the whole show. Of course, Shaw as Quint is singularly iconic, juxtaposing jocularity and complexity perfectly within his single character.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give \"Jaws\" is that every time I see it, I can't help but be swept away in all its winning aspects. Whether it be the drama, emotion, music, thrills, adventure, visuals, acting, or just overall heart of the piece, there is not a single scene wasted or underutilized. I have absolutely no doubt that it will remain just as visceral of an experience going forward as it was for those sitting in the theaters in 1975.",

I jumped, I held my breath; this was one of the experiences that made me fall in love with movies. This was probably the first film where I completely forgot everything around me. I was there, in that boat, in that gloomy cabin, with those people - everything seemed so real (and alas, the sea never looked the same again). When I watch it these days I still marvel: the atmosphere and the performances in this film are simply magical. Spielberg without the schmalz.

And, the film was seen as groundbreaking and amazing. When seen today, it's still a great film to watch even with it's very dated technology.

            "content": "A man eating shark is terrorising the holiday island of Amity. Police chief Martin Brody, shark hunter Quint and marine biologist Matt Hooper set sail in the hope of killing the great white monster.Jaws is responsible for many things, it's responsible for propelling director Steven Spielberg's career into the stratosphere, it was responsible for a downturn in the package holiday trade, and it was responsible for shaping the summer blockbuster release practise's. There are many other things which one doesn't need to bore you with, it's just true to say that Jaws is firmly ensconced in movie history, if one hasn't seen it then one surely knows about it, it is, even today, part of popular culture.But is it any good? Is it worthy of a long standing reputation as one of the greatest monster movies of all time? Hell yes it is, one or two easily overlooked flaws aside, it busted the box office {world wide} and tapped into a primal fear that resides in the majority of mankind, the unseen that resides in the sea.Jaws sets out its marker right from the start with a truly shocking and attention grabbing opening sequence, from then on in Spielberg {learning from Hitchcock for sure} tweaks the tension to have the audience living on their nerves, even as character building {by way of Brody's family arc} sedates the pace, we just know that it's all relative to an extension of fear and terror that is around the next corner. After the first victims remains are found Brody glances out at the ocean, Spielberg perfectly framing the shot to say so much that we are about to be witness to. Jolts and shocks pop up from time to time to help build the unease whilst Spielberg makes the audience wait before we even see what it is that so coldly and efficiently destroys man, and then the claustrophobic switch as our brave protagonists are out at sea on Quint's boat, unaware that the giant menace is now hunting them, eyes as black as death itself.So many great scenes linger for all time in the memory, the entrance of Quint is a hum dinger, a mournful widow reducing Brody to a stunned realism, the Indianappolis monologue, the bigger boat! Just some of the reasons why I personally love cinema so much. The score from John Williams is as effective as any for the genre and Robert Hoyt's sound team's work furthers the dread unfolding. The cast are superb and uniformly excellent, casting aside technical problems {and genuine resentment at times} to portray this story with verve and genuine depth of feeling. Yet Roy Scheider {Brody}, Robert Shaw {Quint} and Richard Dreyfuss {Hooper} were from from original choices, Charlton Heston was wanted for the role of Brody, Sterling Hayden and Lee Marvin were both mooted for Quint, and John Voight was Spielberg's preferred choice for Hooper, whilst Jaws author {and co screen writer here} Peter Benchley was heading for the top by asking for Newman, Redford and McQueen!! Imagine that!Still it all turned out well in the end because Jaws stands the test of time as one of the best films of its type to have ever been made. No amount of complaining about continuity and a rough looking mechanical shark will ever dim its appeal, even as I revisited it recently for the hundredth time I still got tingles all over my body, file it along side King Kong in the pantheon of Monster Masterpieces, 10/10 always, now go enjoy your dip in the ocean.",

            "content": "I re-watched this film recently and was blown away by the absolute suspense it invoked in me. My daughter (whom is 17) and I were both stunned at the quality and realism of a film made in 1975!! Our TV is 55 inches which showed the movie off to it's full potential and it certainly did not disappoint.That iconic moment of the young lady going skinny dipping in the dark with her male friend is utterly haunting. You know the horror of what's going to happen, the buoy dinging in the background gives you the chills. Steven Spielberg captures pure terror in that scene.Jaws completely absorbs you, as the trio of shark hunters venture off to try to snare the great white you begin to feel part of their adventure. You fear for them, get excited with them and dread what will happen next. When that fishing line starts spinning your heart starts pumping. This is pure class.The dynamics of Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw's relationship(s) work brilliantly. The differences in their characters persona's is such that they rub each other up the wrong way, disrespect one another and wind each other up but in the end they are there for each other and develop a bond that I think surprises them all.As things begin to unravel your heart goes out to the trio and trepidation is the only way forward. They have the fight of their life on their hands, their bravery is boundless. You feel in awe of them. An absolute legend of a movie which I am grateful to have been able to watch and enjoy.",

            "content": "Jaws is a movie the I grew up with, it's like the first real horror film I ever watched. What a great one to start with, right? This movie not only scarred me out of the water, I was afraid to go to the bathroom! I thought Jaws was going to pop up out of the toilet and bite my butt! :D I know it was silly, but that was how much Jaws effected me. I know also that it has not lost it's effect to this day. I'm questioning, because it seems like all the terrific horror films came out of the 70's.Jaws is based on the best seller book by Peter Benchley. Steven Spielberg, before he was STEVEN Spielberg turned this horrifying book and made it into a reason to hate sharks. He brilliantly took what could have been a cheesy movie and turned it into a classic that will never be forgotten. To this day, I still need a friend to hold onto, it's that score! Duh na... duh na.... dun dun dun dun.... Oh, my gosh, that music just scares the heck out of me! On such a low budget, Jaws not only turned into one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it turned into one of the greatest movies, period.Jaws starts off with one of the most terrifying scenes in horror movie cinema, a young pretty girl goes into the water and is brutally attacked and killed by an unknown creature in the water. The next day Chief Brody investigates suspecting a shark attack, and urges the mayor, Larry Vaughn, to shut down the beach, but afraid of a panic and less tourists, Larry ignores the chief's suggestions and keeps the beach open leading to another attack on a young boy. Brody calls in Matt Hooper, a marine scientist to see if they can find the shark. But when another attack ensues and almost kills Brody's young son, Michael, he, Matt, and a cocky man, Quint go out to find Jaws themselves.This turns into several of the greatest cinematic scenes of all time, like the \"Indianapolis\" speech brilliantly given by Quint, how he describes seeing his first shark was just so intense and you couldn't turn away from the screen. Then, one thing that is interesting about this movie, you do not see the shark until Brody is just chucking blood to attract the shark over his shoulder and Jaws appears roaring out of the water! \"We're gonna need a bigger boat!\" he replies to Quint. And then the scene where Jaws jumps onto the boat and Quint is trapped sliding into Jaw's, well, jaws! That's the scene that nightmares are made out of! Jaws is one of my favorite films of all time. It's one of those films that should never be missed, because it is so important. To many, including myself, the shark looks fake, but it's your imagination that gets with you. Spielberg embraced that and you could tell there was just something special about him. Jaws will scare you out of the water just like The Exorcist scared you to the church! 10/10",

            "review_title": "One of the Greatest Films Ever Made",
            "content": "Jaws (1975) **** (out of 4) Steven Spielberg's classic about a man-eating Great White shark stalking the beaches of Amity and the three men who go out to try and kill it. Seriously, is there anyone who doesn't know the plot to this masterpiece? Considering all the production trouble on this thing it would be amazing to get a half-way decent film yet for some reason, perhaps the movie Gods were shining down, we ended up with one of the greatest films ever made. This is without question one of the greatest films to deal with tension as Spielberg masterfully handles all the material. The movie is like an amazing roller coaster as we get one scare after another until the end when we just get our senses attacked from all around. Millions of people have discussed the greatness of this film so it's hard to pick one thing but I'd say the greatest achievement of the film is the simple adventure it gives us.Even though we get some very intense scenes the screenplay is smart enough to give us other things to go with. We got some nice black humor in the witty dialogue but we also get a good buddy picture with Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss delivering memorable characters. The three of them together are so different yet all three are like people I'm sure each viewer has met so it's easy to connect with them and it makes the film all the more fun when we go on this adventure.The film, of course, benefits from the brilliant John Williams score, which is perhaps the most memorable in film history. Bruce, the name given to the shark, caused most of the problems during filming but you wouldn't know that by just watching the picture. The look of the shark is incredible and Spielberg certainly made the right decision of keeping it hidden and just revealing bits and pieces as the movie went along. The first glimpse in the pond is hauntingly shocking and each sighting just grows more and more tension. The director also knows how to build suspense without us seeing the shark as we're constantly viewing objects floating (the dock, the barrels) to imply that the creature is there.What's even more amazing is that this film scared people so badly that they refused to go into the water yet the most suspenseful scene is probably the now legendary speech by Shaw about his time on the USS Indianapolis. It goes without saying but the three leads are all terrific in their roles and I really can't think of too many movies that have as many memorable characters as the ones here. We also get strong supporting work from Murray Hamilton as the Mayor and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife.For me this ranks as one of the greatest adventures ever captured on film because everyone involved makes it feel so real. When the men get on the boat to go after the shark you feel as if you're really there. When the camera is underwater given a POV shot of the shark, you feel as if you're in the water. The final death scene in the movie also just happens to be one of the most terrifying ever captured on film and it might even be the most brutal. The movie is a true masterpiece of suspense and I think it would be fair that nothing has come close to this in the past 35 years. Like PSYCHO, we've had a lot of rips of imitations but nothing has come close to the same power and it's doubtful anything ever will.",

            "review_title": "JAWS = Timeless Cinema",
            "content": "It's true, few movies tell a story better and in a more compelling way than JAWS - the original summer blockbuster, which was a world-wide smash-hit or \"phenomenon\" upon it's initial release in May of 1975. Forty-one years later it still stands as one of the best movies of all time and having seen it well over 100 times in the past 30 years, I can firmly attest to it's extreme longevity and at this point it would seem JAWS' ability to entertain me, myself and the masses is indefatigable. In other words: JAWS IS ETERNAL. An ageless, universally beloved masterpiece and due to the films great originality, it has always been easy for me to admire it.The films great cast of Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfus, Robert Shaw, Lorraine Grey and Murray Hamilton really pull together here and throughout the film they play off each other beautifully, the cast exudes a type of \"naturalistic chemistry\" that's rarely attained in movies. That's one of the key reasons why JAWS is such a cohesive and enduring movie and if you haven't noticed over the years, all of the scenes in this movie gel perfectly, with not a single scene being wasted or without purpose. Deftly directed by a 27 year-old Steven Spielberg throughout the course of mid 1974 to early 1975, the production was a troubled one (primarily due to malfunctioning mechanical sharks) and the budget ballooned to several times it's original estimate, but as the film resoundingly shows they succeeded in creating a gripping masterpiece of cinema - that's often mimicked in one way or another, but has certainly never been bettered.Set in the fictitious locale of Amity Island (as most know, in actuality it was filmed in and around Martha's Vineyard Massachusetts) JAWS tells the story of a once-pleasant sea-side community, that suddenly finds itself being terrorized, by a huge Great White shark \"That's a 20-footer... 25, 3-tons of em'\" that's gone -rogue- and has staked a claim off the beaches of Amity Island. Naturally this causes confusion and commotion among the town folk, bounties are set, amateur shark-hunters recklessly take to the water and throughout the bloody-tension-filled affair, the towns various entities of local government are constantly clashing with each other; in other words lots of friction and stubborn, thick-headed resistance bubble up and the tension is at times so thick, you can cut it with a knife. Basically what it is, is enough people have to be eaten by the shark, before the mayor and his circle of cronies finally pull their heads out of the sand and come to the same obvious conclusion - that Martin Brody, the sharp-witted and instinctual sheriff had already concluded. So add governmental haranguing as yet another element weaved into this intricate, yet cohesive story.The film is bi-sected into two distinctly different acts, with the first half taking place mostly on the dry ground of Amity Island, with a few boating and swimming excursions, but still largely land-based. However, in the second half, we find ourselves adrift at sea aboard Quint's boat, for the remainder of the movie - which most would agree is the more exciting part. The role of the shark-hunter \"Quint\" is BRILLIANTLY played by the late-great Robert Shaw and is, by far, the films most-memorable and most-colorful character. Rarely is a film character so vividly well put together and as memorable as the cantankerous Quint, with his voice being the key reason; plus he has some mighty colorful \"fisherman's tales\" to tell, as you will find out. You can thank the numerous other \"bigger names\" that, for varying reasons, turned down that role of which there were several, with Charlton Heston and Robert Mitchum being just a couple of them. The action and excitement are all cranked up several notches in the latter half of the film, with much tension between the three ship mates, Brody, Matt Hooper (a marine biologist) and the ever-salty Quint. This iconic film concludes with what's literally \"Smile you son-of-a!\" an explosive finale! That which has long stood as one of cinema's most memorable, if not improbable, endings.The Music: As Steven Spielberg has said, the music of John Williams is half the movie and it easily ranks as one of the most memorable and effective film scores of all-time. A powerful and ingenious orchestral score, dripping with gloomy atmosphere and with much in the way of toothy serrated menace and of course JAWS has what's probably the best-known movie theme ever written. Williams' award-winning music for JAWS not only took his career to the next level, but in a very big way helped resuscitate a dying art-form; that of course being large-scale orchestral film scores, which had been in steady decline since the mid to late 1960's. Williams' score for Star Wars just two years later would yet further benefit that cause to even greater effect.On The Oscar Front: JAWS took home three Oscar's (for, best sound recording, best score and best film editing) and damn well should of had another or two, Best Picture being one of them.Ultimately JAWS stands as a grand and regal film classic - that only an idiot (or a heretic) would not like.......and yes, because of this movie and it's infinitely lesser sequels, I shudder at the mere thought of being in the ocean.**Update**: The wreck site of Quint's ship the U.S.S. Indianapolis was discovered on August 19th 2017, by a deep-sea search team lead by Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen 72 years after her infamous sinking. Her watery grave rests some 18,000 feet below the surface of the Philippine Sea.Thanks Paul, it's been a long time coming.",

            "content": "On the fictional New England resort island of Amity tourism is the main industry and each summer the beaches are backed with people hoping to swim in its beautiful waters\u0085 the last thing the authorities want is news that a shark has killed somebody. When I girl disappears at sea it is first assumed she just drowned but when her body is found the Island's new Police Chief, Martin Brody, wants to close the beaches but the mayor is determined to keep them open and pressures the local doctor to certify that she was killed by a boat\u0085 a second death, just off a crowded beach, causes a major panic and the mother of the victim offers a three thousand dollar reward to whoever catches the shark. This attracts everybody with a boat but doesn't impress local fisherman Quint, who demands $10,000, or shark expert Matt Hooper, who Brody invited to the island. After further deaths Brody, Quint and Hooper set of in Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt down the great white shark that has been terrorising the island. Once they find the shark it becomes clear that catching it will not be easy.This iconic film has certainly stood the test of time and is as gripping as ever. The story is relatively simple without any real twists and that is one of its strengths. It is very much a film of two halves; the first land based as Brody tries to get the town authorities to take the shark seriously and the second out at sea as Brody, Quint and Hooper hunt down the shark. These three, brilliantly played by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss respectively, are great characters and the scenes between then on the boat are a delight; sometimes tense, sometimes funny and, when Quint tells the story of what happened when the USS Indianapolis was sunk positively chilling. The shark effects are pretty impressive, only in the final scenes does in took a bit rubbery; of course it helps that we aren't shown too much of the shark early on. The music, by John Williams, is great\u0085 not just the famous 'shark theme' but also the other music. There are plenty of scary moments throughout the film; some at least as frightening as horror films largely because of its familiar setting and the fact that even though shark attacks are rare we all know that they do occasionally happen. Overall this is a great film that can be enjoyed by most people\u0085 if you don't mind a few scares. It is a must see for anybody who enjoys classic movies.",

It's the Michael Jordan of cinema: there will never be another 'Jaws,' simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, 'Jaws' centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark. Our hero is Martin Brody, a New York cop who took the job as Chief of the Amity PD to get his family out of the city and then finds himself in the midst of an unprecedented crisis none of his prior experience has prepared him for. The remains of young Christine Watkins are found on the beach, the apparent victim of a shark attack(Chrissie Watkins' death scene at the opening of the movie is one of the most legendary in the history of film). Chief Brody wants to close the beaches, but is refused permission by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) and the Amity selectmen, all of whom fear that news of a shark attack off of Amity will threaten the summer tourist trade, on which the town depends for its very survival. The Mayor and his lackies persuade Chief Brody that such incidents are always isolated, and, inexperienced in such matters, he grudgingly agrees to keep quiet.Consequently, the shark kills again (and again), and Chief Brody eventually finds himself dealing both with his own moral guilt for agreeing to hush up the first shark attack and with an enormous human and social catastrophe which appears to be his sole responsibility. Help comes first in the form of Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, in the role that propelled him to stardom), an icthyologist and oceanographer dispatched to Amity to lend his expertise. Together, Hooper and Brody struggle in vain against both the shark and Mayor Vaughan, who is certain that keeping the beaches open for the sake of the town's economy (and his own real-estate business) is worth the gamble.Finally, Brody and Hooper charter an expedition with the enigmatic, vaguely malevolent Quint (Robert Shaw), Amity's most feared and respected shark hunter, to find and kill the shark and save the town from financial disaster. What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud. Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot. Hooper, the scientist, is awestruck at having encountered the Bigfoot of the sea; Quint, the crafty fisherman with a serious chip on his shoulder against sharks, realizes he has met the ultimate test of his skills; Brody, who swims poorly and is afraid of water, must overcome abject fear and disorientation just to maintain his composure. Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti-heroes the movies have ever seen. He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis--where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds--is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film. 'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of story and character. That said, the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark, by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the cold and corrosive north Atlantic seawater. To compensate for the absence of the non-functional fake shark, Spielberg used shots from the shark's point of view and John Williams' famous two-note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes. Fortunately the crew was ultimately able to get Bruce into operational status in time to film the big showdown, and some of the scenes are filled in with live-shark footage filmed by Australian underwater video pioneers Ron and Valerie Taylor. Consequently, the audience's fear is magnified by the fact that, for the majority of the film, they cannot see the shark, creating suspense towards the climax of the confrontation between man and beast on Quint's fishing boat.'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable (if the shark looks a little fake, remember that, at the time 'Jaws' was released, 'Space Invaders' was on the cutting edge of computer graphics design and there was no such thing as 'Shark Week on the Discovery Channel'). Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis). Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster.",

Spielberg magically turns the silly story into a tense exciting thriller with brilliant dialogue and classic scene's. Mark my words, \"Jaws\" is a movie that will never be considered outdated.Everything in the movie works so well! The acting, the dialogue, the tension, the typical Spielberg humor, the music, everything! It's hard to name just one thing why this movie is such a masterpiece. It is the mix of everything combined that makes the movie work. Probably my favorite thing about the movie would be the dialogue, they are very raw and performed well by the perfect cast. Another thing of course would be the music and I'm not just talking about the main theme but about the entire musical score in general.The cast is great but they are mainly great together.

            "content": "I know what some of you may think, the shark looks fake, sure it does, but put yourself into the shoes of a movie-goer in the summer of 1975.Jaws is one of the greatest films ever made, not because of it's technical achievement at the time being, but because how Steven Spielberg, frankly took a far-fetched idea and made it scary. Jaws has a simple story of a twenty-five foot great white shark terrorizing civilians of Amity Island. Eventually, the town's chief of police(Roy Scheider), a marine biologist(Richard Dreyfuss), and a fisherman(Robert Shaw) are tasked to taking down the shark. The film was known for have technical difficulties with the animatronic shark, but that was a blessing in disguise. Because of this, Spielberg manages to create tension and fear among the audience because you don't see the shark at all. Leaving your imagination to do all the work. The opening scene is downright terrifying hearing the woman screaming in agony, being dragged around by a shark we cannot see. Also the use of barrels was a stroke of genus by Spielberg and his team as it implied that the shark was near or present. What really makes this film work are the three leads. They share an impeccable chemistry between each other. Brody is a paranoid police chief, effectively portrayed by the great Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss is hilarious as the wisecracking marine biologist Matt Hooper, who frequently butt heads with the rough and tough fisherman Quint, brilliantly portrayed by Robert Shaw. The three leads make these character believable and so the audience can go on a real journey with them. I cannot see this film without Steven Spielberg. In the end he put all this together, with no script, no crew, technical malfunctions, and scrutiny. How Spielberg managed to pull this movie off under massive pressure is beyond me. It's a testament on how great he is. Give credit to the writers Peter Benchley, Carl Gottlieb, and uncredited writer Howard Sackler for providing the film's story and sharp dialog. Who can also forget the incredible score by John Williams. Outstanding. Along with Star Wars, Jaws was pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, and the start of the blockbuster trend. 10/10",

The silhouette of a woman is seen in full flight toward the sea... Her dress, bra, and panties fly toward her drunk admirer who can't make a fist to catch them... In a delicate splash, Chrissie goes swimming in the cold ocean, drawing herself into deeper water... When a wave of pressure lifts her up and eases her down, her face begins to show a certain fear... Her eyes go to the beach where her friend, too drunk to stand, is struggling with his shoe...Chrissie turns and starts for shore... But her expression freezes... Something terrible is hurting her underneath... She struggles with all her forces, but she is soon submerged in a horrifying scene... Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) reacts quickly to the news of shark attack, and emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails, paint and brushes to close every beach on the island... But as Amity is a beautiful summer resort with clean air, clear water, and beautiful white sand beaches... Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) tries with his town officials to convince the insecure police chief to file the incident as a 'boating accident.' Brody reluctantly agrees, but later regrets his decision after few more fatal incidents... The shark has claimed Amity Island as his territory...Quint (Robert Shaw), an eccentric old shark killer, offers to kill the menacing Great White Shark for ten thousand dollars... Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), an arrogant young oceanographer, proves that the giant shark that killed Christine Watkins is still on the loose... 'They caught a shark. Not the shark,' he determines... and predicts future outbursts of attack activity in the area...Brody, Quint and Hooper become allied in a life-and-death hunt... They go after the monstrous creature with rifles and poison pistols... They try to tire him, slowing him down with coiled ropes and barrels... They fight him with everything, harpoons, poles, gaffs and compressed air tanks...Shaw is absolutely convincing as the colorful master fisherman whose obsession for destroying sharks was triggered by an actual incident in World War II... Scheider is quiet likable as the dedicated family man who doesn't even like the water, swimming or boating... His line to Quint ('You're going to need a bigger boat.\") suggests a specific cause...Dreyfuss manages to humanize the picture while stealing it... Spielberg alarms us with unexpected twists, and heart-stopping scenes wonderfully engaging... His grasp for sustaining the feeling of terror comes not only from what we see, but from what we're afraid we're going to see... He uses an imposing classical score to prepare the audience for something really scary that is about to show up...

When I asked my parents if there really was a Jaws and they reassured me there wasn't, I still thought they were lying ( and they were, he does exist, I'm sure of it ).  To this day, almost 20 years later, I am still frightened to go swimming.  I have been to the Caribbean twice in my life.  Once to the Bahamas with my high school graduating class and once to Acapulco for March Break.  Neither time did my classmates or friends venture into the water because of me.  \" Did yo know that most shark attacks happen in three feet of water of less? \" I asked them.  Needless to say the hotel pool was well utilized on both trips.Jaws is perfect on every level of film making.  It has incredibly well developed characters, so well that we feel their fears and their bravado when we are supposed to.  The direction is some of the best I have ever seen.  We are but marionettes in Spielberg's fingers.  When he wants us to feel, he pulls our strings and masterfully we feel scared or horrified or even amused.  A perfect example of this is the killing of the Kinter kid, the second death of the movie.The scene starts off shortly after Chrissie Watkins is killed.  There are people playing on the beach and in the water.  Brody ( the police chief ) is sitting tentatively watching things intently.  He hears screams from a young girl.  But of course they are playful screams.  Then we see a man playing fetch the stick with his dog.  Finally we meet Alex Kinter.  He goes out on his raft into the water.  Then we see the shots from under water.  It's as if something is approaching.  We're really not sure if we are being teased here or not.  But then we see a stick floating in the water and the man calling out for his dog.  But he is not there.  Then we see more kids splashing and then we cut to a shot approaching the Kinter boy on his raft from under water.  And the music.  And then...... well, we all know what happens.  Now that is a director masterfully manipulating us.Jaws stands up to and surpasses any film these days that is considered brilliant and it surpasses anything that came before it.  This film should have cleaned up at the Oscars.  After all, what film is remembered more? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ( a very good film ) or Jaws?  The answer is quite clear.",

            "content": "Twenty-five years after it was first released, Spielberg's timeless classic still hasn't aged a day and retains that chilling suspense and tension which first propelled it into the limelight in the first place. A masterpiece in fear and terror, this is an expertly-crafted film (everything about it is just right: the pacing, the story, the acting, the cinematography) packed with believable, realistic characters who you know and care about, and plenty of nail-biting moments and scares. It also boasts an incredible last fifty minutes, which is basically a cat and mouse game between Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw and the Great White itself.At first, the film introduces us to the main characters, showing them investigating and sometimes floundering about, unsure of what action to take. The scenes of victims getting pulled under the waves are occasionally gruesome and quite terrifying, especially for a non-swimmer such as myself. As the attacks grow more frequent there are lots of those scenes of people panicking which PIRANHA spoofed so mercilessly. All this is in line with the classic ominous music which quite rightly won an Oscar and gives the film that extra suspense. Having watched this film as a child, I can verify that there is one cheap shock which scared the heck out of me when I was younger. It involves Dreyfess investigating an abandoned ship. As he examines the hull underwater, all of a sudden a white head pops out of a hole, one of the eyes eaten away by fish. This alone helped me to have loads of nightmares and, seen today, it's still pretty disturbing.The final hour ups the film a notch into classic status. Essentially it becomes a three-hander, and Spielberg piles on the tense atmosphere. A lot of the film plays on our fear of the unknown, giving us brief glimpses of the shark but nothing more. I'm not surprised that this film put people off swimming in the ocean. Thankfully when the shark does make itself seen at the end, the giant model used is pretty good (for the time) and pretty menacing. Only one shot, of it rearing up against the boat, looks false. Other scenes of it gliding just under the water's surface are terrific.The acting from the three main cast members is excellent, all three men are as good as each other in a different way. A hairy Richard Dreyfess is the likable, slightly clumsy marine biologist, while Roy Scheider is the tough police chief who you wouldn't like to mess with. We don't really learn a lot about his character except that he's honest, fair, and above all else a family man. And that's enough for us, to know that he's a decent character who will inevitably win out against the menace at the end. However, I would say that the superb mannered turn from Robert Shaw as the ship's captain is the highlight of the film. Shaw instils his character with a kind of gruff charm that makes it impossible not to like him.In the final half an hour, the isolated ship starts taking in water and slowly sinks, while the shark plays with the humans on board and the waters keep getting redder and redder with blood. The action-packed finale is truly nail-biting and, I would say, one of the best endings in a film ever. All of this and more helps JAWS to remain the final word in underwater horror. Suffice to say, a handful of lesser imitations followed, author/screenwriter Peter Benchley spent the rest of his life rewriting the same kind of tale and the three sequels got progressively worse.",

And suspense does build, not because you are not aware that it is the shark killing people, but because unlike many of the films that came along in this genre, it is not in you face. It is a subtle threat and you can sympathize with the people that are being hunted. The cinematography here is phenomenal, as is the acting. This is one of Richard Dreyfus's best roles.

            "content": "There is no doubt about the fact that \"Jaws\" is a classic. And it is also an influential movie that helped open up for many other movies in its wake.The story in \"Jaws\" is one that I think everyone is familiar with, even if you haven't seen the movie before. Because it is just one of those movies that everyone knows. But briefly summarized, it is the story of a massive white shark turning up in the waters of a popular beach resort and wreaks havoc on the swimmers. Sheriff Brody teams up with eccentric captain Quint and marine biologist Matt Hooper to rid the waters of the deadly shark.While this movie was released back in 1975, the year I was born as well, it still holds its ground today. Sure, some of the effects are outdated by today's standards, but other effects still prove effective and great. What makes the movie still stand its ground is not the effects, of course, it is the solid storyline and the amazing performances by the cast.\"Jaws\" have some really impressive and very memorable performances by Roy Scheider (playing Brody), Robert Shaw (playing Quint) and Richard Dreyfuss (playing Matt Hooper). Furthermore, there are also some good supporting appearances from Lorraine Gary (playing Ellen Brody) and Murray Hamilton (playing Mayor Larry Vaughn).It is the intense storyline of the movie that makes the movie watchable over and over again, and I don't have count of how many times I have actually watched \"Jaws\" throughout the years. And this is also what makes it a classic, because the movie is timeless.Furthermore, the movie also has an impressive soundtrack. And everyone knows the theme music to \"Jaws\", even people who might not have watched the movie.\"Jaws\" is definitely a movie that has withstood the test of time, and it is a movie that future generations will enjoy as well, just as us who grew up watching this movie (and its sequels).",

It is a testament to Spielberg's directing abilities that this film still creates deep seated phobias in those that watch it!Essentially a remake of Duel except with a shark replacing the truck this is a lesson in suspense for directors.  With special effects now the audience tend to see everything in glorious colour - not much is left to the imagination.  With Jaws we only see the fin, movements under water or the impact of the attack - the shark remains hidden until the end.  This is the best option as it is very rubbery looking, but it also heightens the tension as the unknown moves under water to attack us.Roy Scheider is excellent as Chief Brody with great support from Dreyfuss and Shaw.  The chemistry between the Dreyfuss and Scheider is perfect and Shaw is as tetchy as he needs to be.  The dialogue is spot on in many scenes and has become part of the common knowledge of the world - being spoofed in films included Lethal Weapon 3, Chasing Amy to name two.Later remade as Jurassic Park (!) this is a classic piece of tension. Ignore the rubber shark effects towards the end and sit back and marvel at what a master director can do with a simple story and basic effects.",

            "content": "\"Violent, nasty, crude. There was nothing in the picture (Jaws) that was personal to me. It was a calculated movie. I made each cut with glee, knowing the effect that it would have on the audience. I don't ever want to be involved in another picture like that.\" \u2013 Steven SpielbergBeginning with point of view shots of a \"killer\" stalking a group of naked teens, \"Jaws\" is part of a group of slasher flicks released in the 1970s and late 60s (\"Black Christmas\", \"Targets\", \"Blood Feast\", \"Psycho\", \"Birds\", \"Halloween\", \"Peeping Tom\", \"Chainsaw Massacrew\", copious zombie flicks, \"Scream Bloody Murder\", \"Silent Night, Bloody Night\" etc).Like many of these films, \"Jaws\" is at times a cruel, dehumanising film, focusing entirely on relentless audience manipulation. Take, for example, the difference between Pal's \"War of the Worlds\" and Spielberg's 2005 remake. The difference between the two films is that Spielberg identifies with the aliens, just as he identifies with the shark which terrorises tourists in \"Jaws\". Spielberg is the shark/alien/camera trying to scare the wits out of us. Nothing else engages his interests.Many filmmakers operate in an imaginative space somewhere between artist (giving formal expression to his/her ideas and feelings) and entertainer. Spielberg, however, is entertainer incarnate. Yet he is a curiously joyless, sadistic entertainer, always holding in severe check emotions of his own that he doesn't trust. This results in the saccharin and sentimental quality of his films. Films that rely on bogus feelings rather than searching out and expressing genuine emotions.Unsurprisingly, two of Spielberg's great loves are John Ford and Alfred Hitchcock. Spielberg is like a hybrid of the two, the reactionary tendencies of Ford merged with the gleeful sadism of Hitch, with a little Capra hypocritically thrown in as penance. In one scene in \"Jaws\", music from Ford's \"The Quiet Man\" is played, whilst elsewhere Spielberg hits us with Hitchcock's \"Vertigo Zoom\". The film's all-male hunt against an unseen enemy further recalls Ford's \"The Lost Patrol\", whilst its elaborate last act recalls \"Lifeboat\". And of course \"Jaws\" is a virtual remake of \"Creature from the black Lagoon\", from which it takes its famous \"duh duh duh\" musical score, as well as numerous scenes, shot for shot. But most of all, \"Jaws\" beats the path of \"The Godfather\", a film that pioneered, in Hollywood, the pornographic technique of manipulating the audience into a state of delighted anticipation of each subsequent but oh-so-artful act of violence.Prior to \"The Godfather\", Hollywood films generated, or at least tried to generate, concern for their vulnerable characters. With \"Jaws\", though, Spielberg appeals instead to the basest elements in our nature; in his hands, we cannot wait for the shark to claim another victim. Indeed, beginning with \"Jaws\", Spielberg made cold-hearted audience manipulation, in various guises, his signature track. Since then, the whole way in which popular entertainment operates has coarsened, the social and political consequences of which have been enormous. Of course Spielberg was simply part of an emerging trend. The true model for the cold-blooded cinema that \"Jaws\" exemplifies can be found in another time and place. The Third Reich created the approach; in its propagandistic works, audiences were encouraged to savour each new incidence of derision and abuse that befell Jewish characters.Thematically \"Jaws\" is light (the shark's effects on local trade are quickly dismissed in favour of mechanical thrills). Where the film excels, where it breaks away from the 50's monster and 70's slasher genre, is in its masterful final act. Here, the haunted house goes out to sea in search of the slasher, our adventurers picked off \"Halloween\" style (with the genre's obligatory false-deaths) before a Moby Dick modelled showdown.It is here where the film's characters - police chief Brody, goofy marine biologist Hooper and Quint (Robert Shaw), an Ahab-like fisherman who is obsessed with slaying the beast \u2013 develop. The last of these, Quint, is given a long histrionic speech, written by John Milius, in which he reminisces about a WW2 experience that plunged him into shark-infested waters (the passage links the film to pulpy movies of the 1950s, where atomic energy upsets Nature). Spielberg's inability to keep a reign on his older actors (Shaw was frequently drunk) and the input of Milius' pen (the rest of the film was written by Benchley, Gottlieb and Spielberg) created a mutiny of sorts, the result being the most well-drawn characters in Spielberg's filmography.Ultimately, though, \"Jaws\" is a middle class, cosy version of \"Moby Dick\". The monster cathartically dies (Melville's whale survives), Quint is killed, and post-War virtues survive, Brody doggy-paddling back to his wife and family. Like \"Deliverance\" we are offered versions of threatened manhood, only here, Quint, a self-reliant, working-class, antiquated, thoroughly sexist, ruthless, raunchy and mad figure, is seen to be the anachronism. Quint is too powerful, too independent of traditional social ties, too prone to excess, too much a symbol of bourgeois independence, as dangerous to the social fabric of Amity's comfortable \"liberalism\" as the shark itself, and so he is cast aside.In Spielbergland, paternal authority must always be restored, but not by Quint. Hopper and Brody on the other hand, are the mirror images of Quint. They are symbols of technology, genteel, inherited wealth, whilst the shark ultimately becomes another Spielbergian guarantor of domesticity. Be it dinosaurs, aliens, terrorists, Nazis, sharks, trucks, Germans, slave-traders or pirates, Spielberg's \"monsters\" are all symbols of paternal/national duty. Slay the beast for country and family, and all will be well. Family values, patriarchy, a kind of middle-class submissiveness, must always be restored. And this is the offencive thing about all of Spielberg's films: the absolute insistence on taking on the responsibilities of fatherhood, and thus restoration of a 1950s nuclear family, as an unquestionable and totally redemptive gesture. 8.9/10 - Worth multiple viewings.",

            "content": "My Rating: **** out of ****. Steven Spielberg is one of the best American directors working today. He has made many films that have been hailed as classics. Yet before the Dinosaurs, Holocaust, Peter Pan, UFO's, and Indy there was the Shark. Jaws represents one of the masterpieces on Spielbergs resume. It is also probably the \"Quintessential Spielberg Film.\" Jaws was very popular when released, it was the gighest grossing film of 1975. It spawned three sequels, which were all inferior. In fact, no film about Sharks or any killer fish has been able to come close to the level of Jaws. The genius in Jaws is its ability to build suspense. The Shark is never really shown till near the end of the film. When ever the Shark is approaching its victims, we get the Sharks point of view, instead of seeing the Shark. These POV shots combined with John Williams very effective score, make the scenes when the Shark is about to devour his victims much more effective. Evry actor does a nice job with their performances. Roy Scheider brings Martin to life. Martin is not a showy character but Scheider is able to make us like him. Richard Dreyfuss exhibits energy in his performance as Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw is very effective as Quint, that Indiannapolis speech is still very chilling to me. Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton also give solid support. People always talk about how fake the Shark looks. I think its passable but today it would definitely be done by CGI. However, the Shark is not seen that much in the film so its not that big of a deal. I would like to say Jaws is Spielbergs best film, Schindlers List closely follows. But I would like to see Close Encouners and the Indiana Jones films again. I did not like Close Encounters the first time, and I like the Indiana Jones films but they never stood out to me. If these films dont surpass Jaws, then it is definitely Spielberg's best film.",

            "content": "The first summer blockbuster, the big breakthrough for Spielberg, and the shoot that ended up tripling its schedule! Jaws is a monster of a film that changed not only the moviemaking world but also the beach-goer's confidence. It is as though we are born with the knowledge of this movie. As a very young child I genuinely believed the Jaws 'Dun...Dun' always played before a real life shark attack was about to take place, I hadn't even seen the film! Something said constantly about this movie is that the terror comes from not showing the shark but from simply suggesting it. Where and when is the shark going to pop up next? This was an idea that Spielberg developed mostly due to the issues with the repeatedly breaking mechanical shark but taken also from the master of suspense himself, Hitchcock. \"There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it\".An important aspect of Jaws is that it shows the audience reasons to care for the characters rather than telling them to care. \"Give me a kiss\", \"why?\", \"cause I need it\". Chief Brody's (Roy Scheider) vulnerable side is very evident and so he is a man we can have sympathy for, we care about his family and so we care about him.The film is also very aware of what it is doing to its audiences. Brody is transfixed looking at a picture-book about sharks; he can't believe what he's seeing. Though he jumps out of his skin when his wife (Lorraine Gary) comes up behind him. We saw this coming so it was not a shock for us but it is a joke on the film itself. It is almost a cliche today but It's one of those friendly nods to the audience letting us know our director is conscious of what we're going through together.The hunt to get the shark doesn't actually start until over midway through the film. The film doesn't simply delay the hunt of the shark, it builds towards it. No one would argue that the first half of the film is slow or uneventful. A testament to the writer's brilliance of structure and timing, knowing when to unleash the beast.This is Spielberg's first film where he establishes his trademark of guiding our eye throughout each scene without drawing attention to the craft. He captures multiple angles in one take to help keep a flow to the story and an intrigue in what the characters are saying to each other. Never allowing a moment to become boring. You feel like you are in the scene with the characters. The second that you notice the way he moves the camera or blocks the scene is the moment you fall out of the movie and become a viewer. We are just as helpless as Chief Brody as we watch Alex Kintner be torn apart from afar, a point of view from Brody's powerless position.Finally, it is Brody who kills the shark, not Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) nor Quint (Robert Shaw). It is the protagonist who we have watched struggle for almost 2 hours with a beach full of people, a thoughtless mayor, and a 25-foot great white shark, 3 tons of him! It is a satisfying end. Brody kills the shark by himself while the mast of the boat sinks into the ocean like a clock hand ticking to its conclusion. Soon there will be nothing left on the surface as though the shark has consumed the film itself, but one perfect shot put a stop to that.Overall, a masterful classic that still lives up to this day. Even most of the mechanical shark shots still remain stunning and sometimes horrific. The film stays away from fantasy and sticks itself in reality which is why so many become afraid of the sea after this experience. I would have loved to discuss the making-of process more but for any Jaws fans or anyone who is interested then I would suggest you read The Jaws Log, written by one of the screenwriters for Jaws, Carl Gottlieb.",

            "content": "*The* original, classic man vs. nature thriller that ushered in the era of the \"summer blockbuster\", \"Jaws\" remains vivid, believable, and highly effective, more than 40 years after it was first released. Everything about it is memorable, from its set pieces to its shocks to its cast to its music to a young Steven Spielbergs' masterful direction, and these elements can thrill even the viewer who's seen them before. Any summer season simply wouldn't be complete without a viewing of it. The story is straightforward and compelling; the screenplay (final credit is given to author Peter Benchley and screenwriter / actor Carl Gottlieb, who plays newspaperman Meadows) trims the melodramatic fat from the Benchley novel and goes right for the thrills, which come frequently.The story deals with a resort island community, named Amity, that finds its livelihood - and its citizens & visitors - threatened by a rogue great white shark, which just refuses to go away and insists on staying where the eating is good. Eventually, an expedition is launched to find and destroy the beast.Roy Scheider is perfect as the Everyman hero, police chief Martin Brody, who tries to do the right thing and protect the people even when local authorities, mainly represented by stupidly stubborn mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), stress to him the importance of a financially successful summer season. Richard Dreyfuss is fun as the rich kid shark expert who tries to educate Vaughn and others on the facts of the great white. And Robert Shaw, in a scenery chewing performance, is brilliant as salty fisherman Quint, who has a generous array of the most quotable lines, including a speech regarding the men of the USS Indianapolis. Fine support is provided by Hamilton, Lorraine Gary as the loving and supportive wife, and Jeffrey Kramer as the deputy.On location shooting in Martha's Vineyard supplies plenty of wonderful flavour, and who can ever forget *that* music by John Williams, the composer / conductor who's given us some of the best, most instantly recognizable movie themes of all time?The stories of the making of the movie are now the stuff of legend, with the inability to get mechanical shark \"Bruce\" to function properly the ultimate happy accident, forcing the filmmakers to use subjective camera work and a very simple cue from Williams to indicate the sharks' presence. Among the iconic sequences are those of the first victim (Susan Backlinie) meeting her doom, the misguided attempt by two fishermen to catch the shark, Brody and Hoopers' night time search for the fish and an unpleasant surprise that drops into frame, the entire second half which is seagoing adventure at its finest, and the aforementioned USS Indianapolis speech.An enduring part of the popular culture if ever there was one, \"Jaws\" is one of those movie milestones that any fan of the cinema ought to see at least once. It was extremely influential in its time, spawning a bunch of similar \"nature strikes back\" thrillers, and to this day it would be hard to swim in the ocean or just *think* of the ocean and not have \"Jaws\" on the brain.10 out of 10.",

I Never watched anymore of it until 1-3 years later. I was highly hesitant because to a young child, a skinny dippers suffering to the wrath of the giant unknown mouth was the most horrifying sequence in film history at the time...and it still is now! Once I finally got the courage to view the film, I was still in for a lot of surprises. The cinematography is superb in its ruthless attempt to bring the audience to the depths of a powerful ocean, and to the eyes of the dark, wretched creature the inhabits it. The story of the killer shark attacking the unfortunate island in the world is more than scary. It could have been any place in the world, and it had to be Amitty Island. The shark could have easily lost it's way in the swaying currents of the ocean, but as the opposite inhabitants of the beach get angry, this big mother is here to stay! The technique is wild, absolutely wild, and John Williams score earned more than an Oscar for it! Creepy piano notes enter this films titles, and the blue depths of the uncharted territory beneath the sea let us all know that no sense, however small, was to be spared. The first victim, alone will haunt those who view it for the rest of their days, and the rest of the story is more like a battle. This strange battle is often more focused on understanding the other side. What Brody, Quint, and Hooper must do is plunge into the depths themselves, and seek out the unruly monster of the sea. The common theme in this terrific classic is survival, and why not? Survival is a natural instinct to all animal alike. The shark must survive, as it makes so clear by snagging unsuspecting swimmers, but also the people, they to have to survive, but the island is not big enough for both man and fish together. Always a joy to experience over and over again, this film is the ultimate scare show to end them all! Sometimes, a lot of us fans can not seem to get enough of this instant classic!",

We are also introduced to two young kids who are on the beach partying. They decide to go for a little swim. That is when we are really shown what this terrible monster in the water can do. Susan Backlinie really does an amazing job in this opening scene. It is from here that Sheriff Brody (Roy Scheider in a fabulous role) is wanting to close the beach due to the death of the girl. Especially after Hooper (amazingly done by Richard Dreyfuss) an oceanographer states that it was a shark that killed her. Unfortunately, there is a great bit of resistance from the slimeball mayor (Murray Hamilton in a role that I will always remember him for). Until the deaths keep racking up. In steps Quint (wonderfully portrayed by Robert Shaw) a local shark hunter who offers his services for $10,000. So, the trio of Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw take Quint's boat to find and kill the shark.Now, the things that really makes this film work first off is the acting is beyond great. To me Scheider doesn't seem to really get enough credit due to the performances of both Dreyfuss and Shaw. All three of them were spectacular and really give the film more than enough fuel to make it to the final frame. My favourite scene in the whole picture is when the three of them are sitting around the table on Quint's boat after downing a few drinks. Both Dreyfuss and Shaw share stories about scars on their bodies until they come to the story about Quint during WWII being involved with a certain onslaught of sharks while he was in the water after his ship the USS Indianapolis was sunk. I find Quint's monologue scarier than anything else in the whole movie. Secondly as I mentioned earlier, the score is top notch and will forever be in your head. Thirdly, Steven Spielberg's ability to unweave the story on screen while not having you stare at a shark for half the movie wowing at it. No, he is setting up the scenes and driving home a fear that many of us would have if faced with the same life-altering challenges some of the characters face.Written for the screen by Carl Gottlieb (who has a role as Meadows in the film) and novelist Peter Benchley. I have read the novel and while it was okay and passable, in comparison to the film though it was teetering into a forgettable novel. Other than the shark that is. They took everything good from the novel and placed it into the film. They left a lot of the stuff I didn't really care for in the book completely out. Also starring Lorraine Gary who puts in a great performance as Brody's wife Ellen.If you haven't seen this movie, you have to watch it. A must-see for any fan of film in general. .",

            "content": "Jaws is a movie you can see one hundred times and it never gets old or fails to entertain in the way it had its first time. In fact, you love it more and more with each view. There is movie magic in this film that is almost divine. It almost feels like an artist throwing everything up against the wall and miraculously the material forms itself into some kind of vintage masterpiece. Where the movie really sets itself apart from the rest is in the final third, where it breaks all horror conventions by somehow formulating an iconic interaction of the three contrasting characters, all likable: Hooper, Quint, and Brody. The scenes the three of these have together are some kind of an ideal in filmmaking- they're raw, improvised, and each actor completely takes control of their characters in a way that makes the contrast feel even more real. It makes for great scenes, effective drama, and every moviegoer's favorite- memorable, quotable lines and dialogue. Shaw not receiving at least a nomination might be one of the top three biggest snubs in Academy Award history. His two iconic monologues, especially the Indianapolis, are among the most memorable in movie history. In fact, he not only should have been nominated, but he probably should have won. A classic movie, more rare than ever before in recent decades, is one you can watch over and over and never get bored or tired of it. It entertains constantly and finds a special place in your heart. It contains some sort of magic, perhaps with Jaws it is originality or just that raw, risk-taking filmmaking that just sticks, and you just can't seem to change the channel whenever it's on. It withstands the test of time and dozens of views. That is a rarity.",

            "content": "\"Jaws\" is a movie for the ages. It's an example of what happens when the right people come together for the right reasons, for the right movie.Firstly, author Peter Benchley co-wrote the screenplay (the screenplay itself is adapted from his own novel of the same name) that became one of the new, classic scary-stories of our time: a huge great white shark is terrorizing the residents of a small New England beach community. Amity Police Chief Brody (the recently departed Roy Scheider), marine expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and grizzled shark hunter Quint (the late Robert Shaw) are the heroic three who volunteer to have a climatic showdown with this man-eating menace appropriate described as mother nature's ultimate killing machine.I should make it clear that for years I was never one of this movie's biggest fans. So I just kind of avoided it - the theme just didn't appeal to me, since I've never been afraid to go swimming at the beach. But guess what? \"Jaws\" is the classic adventure-horror of our times, and I am now amongst one of its many, many fans. A lot of things are classic about this movie - it's pointless to even describe them here.Also, I'm sure there are a number of scientific inaccuracies about the true nature of sharks (the recently departed shark hunter who inspired \"Quint\" always said he felt sorry for the shark in this movie) and whether or not they are truly something to fear - but, you know what? - it's Hollywood, they always win. And I'm also sure that the liberties with sharks were liberties well-taken for the sake of dramatic potential: This movie did its job in scaring the living daylights out of a lot of people.Most importantly, other than serving up great scares, suspense and adventure, \"Jaws\" is responsible for starting the career of Hollywood director Steven Spielberg. \"Jaws\" was his claim to fame; it's also the movie credited for starting the summer blockbuster phenomenon (this currently ranks pretty high amongst one of the highest-grossing movies of all time), and spawning three sequels and countless imitators. Spielberg would go on to do great things in his career, long after \"Jaws,\" and he still continues to do great things to do this day because of this movie. It's probably one of my favorite movies of his and one of my favorite movies of all time.\"Jaws\" is a movie not likely to ever go away any time soon. That is part of its appeal: its ability to remain an important piece of cinema and a pop culture phenomenon that continues to genuinely frighten us even 33 years after its release. And that is also the mark of a truly great film. It's a powerful example of what film-making can really do when the right people are involved in the right movie, for the right reasons.10/10",

No1 whowver saw this film growing up ever looked at water the same again and will have had nightmares no shark films even come close to this original, reading other comments now that the mechanical shark looked fake I honestly dont remember it doing I always remember it looking very real to me, certainly better than all the CGI cr@p 1s we get now",

Jaws itself is really terrifying, but even more so was the truly haunting score from John Williams. If you think the shower scene motif, played very high on the violins from Psycho is scary, and it is, I am still traumatised from watching that scene, or in the wolf's french horn theme in Prokoviev's Peter and the Wolf, the great white shark theme played by the basses in this film is even scarier, it never fails to give me goosebumps. Technically this film can't be faulted either. Overall, a must see, and is most likely to have you biting your nails. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The movie is first entertaining from beginning to end and it is well-done. I love Roy Scheider in his role as the water phobic police chief, Lorraine Gary as his wife, Murray Hamilton who I always mistake for Hal Holbrook as the Mayor of Amity, Robert Shaw as the shark hunter, and Richard Dreyfuss as the shark expert. Anyway, there are great moments in the film like when Chief Brody catches his young son imitating him at the dining room table and asks him for kiss and Mrs. Brody watching with a cup in hand.

            "content": "There's something terrifying about open water that has etched itself upon the human psyche . Undoubtedll this is because our natural survival instincts tell us to keep away from it . We can't see , hear or smell what's under the waves and we can't breathe in water either and anything that can has got one over on us . Why do you think there's been so many legends about sea monsters ? And the success of JAWS is entirely down to the way that it exploits mans fear of the sea The great thing about this movie is how focused it is , Spielberg's cut out all the crap from the book like the politics of the town , and the sexual subplots and made the ending truly climatic . Compare this film version to Peter Benchley's BEAST which is basically the same story where a greedy capitalist is in denial , an obsessive boatman tries to catch the monster etc the only real difference is that BEAST features a giant squid as the monster . You would probably be correct in arguing that JAWS is the only time when a film adaptation actually improves over the source novel Sadly at the age of 28 the then unknown Steven Sielberg seems to have reached his creative peak . True EMPIRE OF THE SUN , SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN may contain more artistic achievements but JAWS is certainly a more consistent movie that's difficult to fault . The only time there's any disappointment is when the eponymous shark appears in the last segment of the movie . It's obviously a giant animontronic model of some kind and since Spielberg has spent so much time using very effective suspense like the soundtrack and the shark's POV for much of the running time the on screen revelation is unfortunately going to be a disappointment But let's not talk about minor disappointment and just admire what the director has given us here . We know that someone is going to get chewed up on the crowded beach so Spielberg teases us . A fat woman walks past the screen and the audience snigger \" I bet she'd make a good meal for the shark \" so everyone in the audience puts money on Mrs Obesity being eaten , especially when she's surrounded by cute kids because cute kids never get eaten in movies . ooopppps I spoke too soon . Perhaps the reason it is a good film is because Spielberg has ignored convention , certainly we don't get drowned in sentiment or family life , unlike say THE TERMINAL or ET . Non existent are the other Spielberg faults like overlong shot duration , here everything is shot in a very snappy manner and the movie is quite rightly regarded as a classic fright fest",

At the time it was the biggest box office hit in the world and for its budget, it was quite an achievement. It still isn't without problems. There isn't much character development and the movie relies heavily on its shark attacks to keep the movie moving forward. But there isn't much arguing the movie's overall significance in the history of cinema.The first few scenes are quite a thrill even with it being almost 40 years later. Once you see the blood cover the water it instantly sends chills down your body. It takes a while for Richard Dreyfuss to get to the screen, who is by far the best part of the movie. But I would still say that the 3 men who are chosen to kill the shark aren't that interesting. But in terms of the look of the shark, I was stunned at how real it appears to be. There are some movies made now that have worse effects than this. It also amazed me at how dumb the people in this movie can be. The people on the beach are ALL aware of the recent shark attacks but yet they still feel they need to swim in the ocean. It reminds me of the citizens of New York during the Spider-Man movies. People in the world aren't that dumb.I was also taken back by the idea to break their only communication to the world on the boat. I still don't know why they destroyed it with a random baseball bat? Why is that on a boat? Nevertheless the movie did a lot for cinema and cemented its impact on special effects used.+big impact on cinema today+Richard Dreyfuss-dumb citizens and unrealistic choices7.5/10",

I just viewed the film once again in it's entirety, one of the few times I've done so since it's original release. It holds up amazingly well, and retains all the thrill and horror that it did during the summer you were afraid to go into the water.Although he appeared on screen earlier, Robert Shaw's fingernails on the chalk board at the town meeting was the perfect way of introducing Amity's potential savior. What he might not have known about rogue shark mentality and territorial behavior is provided by Richard Dreyfuss' character, derided by Captain Quint as a mere college boy, but with enough sea smarts to know that this could be the big one. Boy, was it! I forgot about the dead sailor in the hull of the boat discovered by Hooper (Dreyfuss). It's still one of those unexpected 'oh s---' moments in movies that works even after the gimmick has been played out countless times since. What's remarkable about the film is it's ability to convey unspeakable horror in a way that doesn't get in your face. The opening scene is a perfect example, but how about when that patrolman's leg gets lopped off in the water and slowly floats down to the sea floor - the stuff nightmares are made of.Filmed in the vicinity of Martha's Vineyard in the fictional town of Amity, the picture also explores the crass commercialism of summer tourism winning out over safety concerns. Murray Hamilton's Mayor Vaughn is a master of the spin machine that successfully lures the crowds to the beach on the Fourth of July, right before the fireworks break loose. The beach reporter on the scene is none other than Peter Benchley, who wrote the novel and screenplay.When I saw this movie when it first came out, I recall doing an 'aw c'mon' when Brody shoots the cylinder in the shark's mouth sending it to fish heaven. But you know what, it might have been luck, but it certainly wasn't for lack of trying. It took Brody six shots before connecting with the big bang; just in time too since he was going down with the ship. Did anyone else besides me forget about Hooper in all the excitement until he surfaced to hook up with Brody after the fish fry?It's amazing how certain movies have a way of weaving their way into your subconscious. More than thirty years later, \"Jaws\" still heralds that two beat 'da-dum' every time I go to the shore or take a walk on the beach. I can't even think about telegrams without recalling that goofy 'Saturday Night Live' skit with the candy gram shark knocking from behind the door. Such is the power of film.

After more attacks, he, a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss), and the owner of a boat (Robert Shaw) set out to destroy the shark. The shark is not even really seen for over an hour into the film, making the concept of a shark rather than the shark the source of the horror, a sense of brilliance not found in most horror movies. Also, the film revolves more around the characters and the decisions they must make to deal with the situation, which really brings about a more interesting aspect of the film. Audiences don't want a film to dwell on the horrifying objects that can't communicate; they want to expand on characters and people. That's what makes this such a great film. It's intense, a bit scary, and has little bits of humor throughout that make it fun to watch. The ending proves to be a bit too intense for me, so I don't feel it's absolutely perfect, but very close.**** out of ****",

It was also the recipient of an Academy Award Nomination for Best Picture and a winner of Oscars for film editing (Verna Fields) and music score (John Williams).  One of the reasons the film received no acting nods is that everyone involved is so good, how could one single out just one or two? (I personally feel Robert Shaw should have gotten a Best Actor nomination, however). Roy Scheider is wonderful as New York cop Martin Brody, who has relocated to a small coastal island town, only to have his bad case of \"aquaphobia\" put to the ultimate test. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as a shark expert and provides some truly funny comic bits along the way. Lorraine Gary (who director Steven Spielberg says was the first person to be cast for the film) does an excellent job of being the concerned wife and mother. Finally, there's Murray Hamilton, who gives one of the best performances of his career as Mayor Vaughn, who seems to be more concerned about the economy of the town than the safety of the residents. In a way, Vaughn is really the film's villain. Solid cast indeed. The screenplay (by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb) is tight and well-written, as is Spielberg's direction. Whether it was the mechanical shark's failure to operate correctly or Spielberg's decision to simply see less of the shark until the end of the film, the \"less is more\" idea works perfectly, particularly in the opening scene, which is chilling to this day.One thing I do want to add: if you choose to watch this film at home, do yourself a favor and rent or buy the WIDESCREEN version. The full-screen pan and scan version is a travesty that ruins the great camerawork that Spielberg and cameraman Bill Butler made. I always recommend the widescreen version but it is especially important for JAWS.No offense to fans of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, but this is the film that should have taken home the Oscar gold.

The new DVD doesn't have the some of the features from the previous 2000 edition. But this new edition should keep fans of \"Jaws\" happy. One of Spielberg's best films. This is also one of the best popcorn movies ever made. Panavision. (*****/*****).",

I've probably seen this film close to 100 times and I still can't help but get glued to the screen when it's on. Every character, every line, every shot, EVERYTHING here is just perfect.The other day I was listening to the JRE episode with Rob Zombie as a guest, and when he and Joe briefly touched on this film, Rob commented about how it was hard to believe that some of the legendary lines were \"just lines in a script at one time.\" He's so right. This film is practically an entity of its own.It's a film with no blemishes of age, and I doubt any will develop in the coming decades. Absolutely timeless. Literally every movie fan has a story that goes along with the first time they saw Jaws. For me, it was at my uncle's house who always had a huge film library, only rivaled by the size of his television. I was around 8 years old and by the time the credits rolled I felt like my entire world had been turned upside down. I knew I was experiencing a pivotal moment in life in regards to the development of my taste as far as storytelling was concerned.Lightning in a bottle to the nth degree.",

            "content": "What were my parents thinking when, in 1975, they took me to see Jaws at the tender age of 7? Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel (about a man-eating shark feeding on the inhabitants of a small island) had me squirming in terror for nearly two hours when I first saw it. Even now, 32 years later, this film still has the ability to horrify, nauseate and generally upset me; testament, surely, to the brilliance of its director and the talent of its amazing cast. But it's still definitely not suitable fare for a 7 year old!Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody, who has moved with his family from the crime ridden streets of New york to Amity, an idyllic New England island. But when a spate of shark attacks threatens to ruin the island's 4th of July weekend, Brody, along with salty sea-dog Quint (Robert Shaw), and shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), sets out to catch the fish responsible.Opening with a terrifying scene in which a woman taking a midnight swim ends up as fish food thanks to the toothy terror lurking in the deep, Spielberg creates an atmosphere of fear from the word go. After a second attack, in which a child is chomped in full view of the sun-worshippers on the beach (possibly the film's most shocking moment), it becomes clear that anyone is fair game for the Great White prowling the waters of Amity, and the tension becomes almost unbearable.Spielberg's impeccable storytelling and incredible visual style, coupled with amazing performances from practically all involved, plus a fantastic score from John Williams, result in a film that is as close to perfection as humanly possible. Packed full of jump scares, great characterization, nerve wracking suspense, and exciting action, this one really does have it all.Jaws was the film that kick-started the summer blockbuster phenomenon and made Spielberg a household name; more importantly, it was the first movie to completely scare the crap out of me. Thank you Mr. Spielberg.",

            "content": "I wasn't alive when this film first was released. I wasn't there to witness the hysteria that followed in its wake. By the time, I was born it was already well-established in Western culture (and had spawned three atrocious sequels). Only films like Star Wars can match this movie for sheer cultural impact. Even today, over thirty years after it's original release, when people think of sharks, they think of Jaws.Perhaps much of this owes to its realistic fright factor. Jaws reached people in a way very few films have because it seemed oh-so-plausible and, more importantly, it made people wonder 'Could that happen to me?'.But let's look past the social impact of Jaws and at the film itself as a piece of entertainment/art.I sat down and watched Jaws the other day. I didn't mean to. Somebody else was watching it, I came in and decided to sit down and watch a few minutes. I stayed for the rest of the film, loving every minute. That quality- that watchability (if that is a word)- is one of the things that make Jaws great and helps it to stand out even from its illustrious brethren in the IMDb top 250.Some films, like Jaws, are fantastic. However, not all fantastic films are instantly and consistently watchable like Jaws. For example, Shawshank Redemption is a top movie but its not the sort of film you can sit down and watch at any time. Jaws is a top movie and you can sit down, watch it from start to finish and enjoy yourself no matter how many times you've seen it before.What specifically makes Jaws good then? First off, the story- a small island community heavily reliant on the tourist trade finds itself menaced by a man-eating shark. Simple but effective.The main character, Sheriff Brody (superbly played by Roy Schneider), is tasked with managing this crisis. However, he is continually hindered in his efforts by the Mayor (and other locals) who are adamant the rising body count should be no impediment to the summer trade that is their lifeblood.Eventually, Brody calls in marine biologist Matt Hooper (another great performance, this time by Richard Dreyfuss) who helps him convince the Mayor (with the help of the growing number of dead) that there is a real danger to the island in the form of a great white shark. In a bid to end Jaws' reign of terror, they hire grizzled shark hunter/fisherman Quint- a brilliant character brilliantly portrayed by, in my opinion, the standout star of this film, Robert Shaw- and together, the three go off to hunt for the eponymous villain.This triad of superb characters played by sublime actors is key to Jaws' triumph as a movie. The second half of the movie is simply these three men in a boat but with their chemistry (admittedly aided by a very strong script and good direction) who needs breathtaking scenery, romance, mind-blowing special effects (though I have no qualms with what is essentially a prop, I know people think the shark looks crap) and the like? I think the proof of the pudding- and perhaps one of my favourite scenes in all of cinematic history- is the scene where the three heroes are comparing scars. I have two reasons for saying this.One, it shows the growing bond of respect between the two seamen in Quint and Hooper who, despite their differing methods and upbringings, find common ground and good laughs in the wounds they have suffered in their travels. At the same time, poor old landlubber and mild mannered Brody only has his appendix scar to reflect on- which is masterfully shown in a subtle piece of acting/directing.Two, I think that Quint's 'Indiannapolis' speech is the best I have ever seen. Robert Shaw's impeccable delivery (plus the reaction of his allies)and the script itself help make this moment my favourite in the entire film. It's worth buying the DVD for this scene alone- believe me.I've eaten up a lot of words with my worship of the characters and that particular scene but don't go thinking that's all there is to this film. There are other great elements- there's plenty of action, adventure and thrills and spills. The only thing that's missing is a needlessly tacked on romance- yay! As for themes and messages, Jaws has plenty of them too. You have man's struggle against nature, the value of money over life, Quint's Ahab-esquire obsession with gaining revenge for his fallen comrades and even the 'ever present in every Spielberg film' sub-story involving fatherhood.As you may have guessed, I can't rate this film highly enough. If you've never seen it, you are missing out. Pure gold- 10/10.",

            "content": "This is the movie that started it all. I'm not talking about the Hollywood blockbuster, or the insane madness that sent thousands of misunderstood Great Whites to their deaths, I'm talking about the beginning of my interest in movies. This is the movie that did it. I couldn't tell you how old I was when I first saw it, but I do remember this is the movie I made my parents rent time and time again when we went to the video store. This is the movie that drove my parents and some of my friends nuts while I watched it day after day after day when my mom gave it to me for Christmas. This is the movie that made me want to turn a real interest in the movies from just a hobby and into a career. For that, I owe Spielberg, Benchley, Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss, Williams, Fields and everyone else a sincere and heart-felt thank you. I own this movie on every format in which it is available. I love it that much. I've probably seen it between 200 and 300 times. I guess you can say it is an obsession. A sick obsession. The plot, the pacing, the editing, the score, the acting, and, oh yes, the shark. Who cares that is fake? By the time we finally get to see it, do we care? Truly, a more suspenseful movie was never made. Several come close, but none quite reaches the primal level the JAWS does. No other film so effectively taps into our fear of the unknown, and then gives it a riveting score to boot. No other movie grips us so strongly with heart stopping suspense that we find ourselves nearly falling off our seats. And no other movie leaves us feeling so spent and wasted after a viewing. And the reason for all the fear, suspense and emotional withdrawal is not top-notch special effects. It was the mid-70's. You can barely apply top -notch to anything of that era. The reason the movie does all that to us is that it is a great story. It is filled with real people, who have real jobs, and who have real fears. And who must now confront a real shark. Can you think of anything more terrifying that getting on a rickety, leaky boat to kill a 25-foot shark when you already have a paralyzing fear of the water? I can't. And Martin Brody sure can't. And so, no matter what ranking JAWS may get on AFI's list of the 100 greatest movies, or TV Guides list of the top 50 movies, or any list for that matter, JAWS will always come in number one on mine. Steven, Peter, Roy, Robert, Richard, John, and Verna -- thank you. Not for just giving me a sense of direction in my life, not for just making me want to be a screenwriter, but also for making a movie that still thrills me as much now when I watch it as when it did when I saw it for the very first time.",

Everyone knows that the shark didn't work all the time. Everyone knows that Dreyfuss and Shaw didn't get along. The list goes on...

We get excited in a very geeky way over things we love like Hooper. We all have moments of bravado like Quint and we're happy to know that he gets scared too. Most of all- we love sharks. We can't help it. This movie is brilliant. There is not a single thing that you could do to it that would make it better.

Spielberg proved out of the gate that he knows where all of your strings are and that he can pluck any single one at will. What makes this film so incredible isn't the shark at all. It's the people. They are real three dimensional characters who share our fears and feelings. A simple example being when one mother walks up, slaps the police chief and sobs, \"My boy is dead. I wanted you to know that.\" Recommendation: I would also recommend Spielberg's made for T.V. movie Duel.",

            "content": "According to his own recollection, novelist Peter Benchley stated he considered his story involving a huge shark attacking beach swimmers several years before the movie. When the book came out, Steven Spielberg first thought it would make for a good scary movie. That was before he became aware of all the technical problems involved. At one point he hated the project and anything having to do with it. To his credit, he finished the difficult film and it became a true Classic in it's own right. The actual story is based on the 1916 account of New Jersey beach goers being attacked and devoured by a real life shark. It is no surprise, when you see the film \"Jaws\" be prepared for some unexpected shock scenes. There are several which if you're seeing it in the dark room, at night or alone, you'll find yourself seeking company, comfort or a large weapon. To my way of thinking, it is the actors who imbue the film with such artistic reality, they cause audiences to re-consider going swimming in the ocean. Spielberg did an excellent job in finding Roy Scheider to play, land loving Police Chief Martin Brody. Robert Shaw is superb as Quint and his ' USS Indianapolis story' makes for mental horror. Youthful newcomer Richard Dreyfuss is excellent as Matt Hooper, the 'professional' shark expert. Murray Hamilton plays the fiscally stubborn Mayor Larry Vaughn. Together the cast add their personal signature to this incredible film and place it on the shelves of the finest movies ever made. ****",

No film, no sequel, comes anywhere close\nto this story. Frankly, it has it all.ACTING:\nWhat a perfect blending of the three lead actors.

I'm citing Shaw because I've seen him in so many\nfilms, and this demonstrates some stretch for him.

On one hand his work is often soaked in cliche and is as \"white\" as can be.On the other, he's so technically gifted and ... and ... consistently so, which is the hallmark of a great director.Writers: Clearly, this was a \"one hit and quit\" (420 reference) for both writers.

Jaws is about a shark, a man eating shark, a very simple topic, but it is perfectly executed. The shark itself is not shown until the very end (Spielberg intelligently uses the Hitchcock suspense technique there) and John Williams' brilliant score delivers all the scares.

Likewise, Richard Dreyfuss won a BAFTA award for his performance as the oceanographer named \"Matt Hooper\". And there were other awards and nominations as well. In all it was quite impressive. Now, as far as the movie is concerned, this is definitely one that I can recommend to all but the very young and faint-hearted. Although there isn't much gore, graphic language or nudity it still has enough drama and suspense to keep a person's interest throughout most of the movie. Personally, while I thought the special effects were more than adequate for that specific time period, I still would have preferred a bit more gore to make it seem even more realistic. Additionally, I thought some of the film got a bit bogged down by the dialogue-especially while the three main characters, \"Sheriff Brody\" (Roy Schieder), \"Captain Quint\" (Robert Shaw) and the aforementioned \"Matt Hooper\" were at sea waiting for the shark to appear. Even so this was a very good movie and as proof of that one need only look at the number of sequels, clones and similar movies which have been spawned (no pun intended) due to it.

            "content": "Being one of the most well known movies of all time, Jaws has had a profound influence on popular culture, filmmaking, and even how people regard sharks. A legacy this movie left behind that is not always considered positive is how it portrays sharks, specifically great whites, as unstoppable killing machines who live only to eat people. It's true that the great white specifically is the type of shark that is responsible for more attacks on humans than any other, but it is still an incredibly rare occurrence. Jaws was also the first movie to rake in over 100 million dollars, and demonstrated to everyone in the business how much money films could make when they were done right. Star Wars came two years later and would surpass its financial success though. Despite this, the movie remains one of the most iconic in history, and this has a lot to do with its presentation. The movie starts on a beach and shows how one day, a young woman is brutally killed and gutted by some mysterious killer while in the ocean. Some experts determine from an autopsy that a shark is responsible for the attack and get Brody (a police officer) to close the beach, but Larry Vaughn (the mayor) is convinced this decision cannot stand because income will grind to a halt. The decision to close the beach is temporarily undone until the shark strikes a second time, this time killing a young boy. Meanwhile, the people at the beach are growing more paranoid and want whatever is terrorizing the sea to be dealt with. A fisherman named Quint offers his services to mayor Vaughn and promises to kill the shark. Later, a tiger shark is killed which helps convince the public the danger has ended, but an oceanographer named Hooper doesn't believe the attacks were carried out by such a small animal. Shortly after, it is the fourth of july, and tourists are everywhere on the beach. The shark attacks yet again, ending the life of another person. Brody now decides enough is enough and sets out with Hooper and Quint on the latter's fishing boat to track the animal down once and for all. During this final confrontation with the nightmare of a shark, it displays almost human-like intelligence and makes a mockery of the men's attempts to kill it. That night, the shark smashes its bulk into the side of the boat, shutting its electricity. Quint goes borderline insane and prevents Brody calling for help from the coast guard, saying how he and he alone must kill the animal. The boat's engine then explodes after the shark floods its compartment, leaving the boat dead in the water. The boat slowly starts to capsize, and with time running out fast, Hooper attempts to stab the shark with a spear loaded with poison, but drops it in the ocean. The shark then eats Quint, which means Brody is the only survivor left. He climbs the ship's mast which is the only part of it still mostly above the water, and using a rifle, manages to shoot a tank of compressed air lodged in the animal's mouth. The huge explosion literally blows the shark's face off, and Hooper (who managed to survive the fight) reunites with Brody. Jaws is a film with quite a simple premise, but time and time again, simple movies are shown to be the best. The reason why the movie is still disturbing so many years later is because even though you're aware the shark is the main antagonist, getting a glimpse of it is rare. It hardly appears on screen, but you feel its presence as more and more people start getting mauled. Another interesting parallel this movie has is shared with the book Moby Dick, since Quint is pretty similar in character to Captain Ahab. Both are grizzled veterans of the high seas who are obsessed with killing a large beast, and both are eventually killed by their respective adversaries. Alongside The Exorcist, this is probably the only movie I can think of that remains disturbing even decades after you watch it. I'm sure many people no longer go in the water because of Jaws. The menacing music by John Williams also helps this movie's reputation greatly. It's not everyday where you see a movie so creepy that it stays with you years later. Overall, Jaws is a time proven, well written, and genuinely creepy movie that shows how sharks are one of the few animals in the ocean that are afraid of nothing. Not even humans.",

Of course unlike many modern day blockbusters, Jaws had something more than just action and suspense; it was chock full of likable, three-dimensional characters, and it had this magical touch that could simply be explained if one only looks to the film's director, Steven Spielberg.The premise of Jaws is one that if you were simply told about as opposed to seeing it, you would probably laugh your head off. I mean how could you make a film about a gigantic great white shark preying on the inhabitants of a beachside town a serious and engaging movie? Well Mr. Spielberg knew how. First he made the smart decision to make all of the characters in the film three-dimensional, then he cast terrific actors to pull off the magnificent roles. Robert Shaw truly shines as Quint, but Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are no slouches either. Of course where Spielberg's true mastery comes through was in his decision to not show the shark until the movie was almost over. Yeah you'd see a fin here and a tail there, but the full shark was never exposed until the end. This made the film feel more tense and threatening, because lets face it, the mechanical shark looks pretty fake. Still, applying the classic Hitchcockian principal of the viewer is more afraid of what they don't see, Spielberg was able to craft a film that still stands tall as one of the best films of all-time.When one gets off the amusement park ride which is the film Jaws, you feel as if you just went on one of the most thrilling rides of your life. For this reason alone Jaws is one of my favorite films.I give Jaws a perfect 10 out of 10!",

It features one of the greatest and most iconic pieces of theme music in movie history, it features tremendous performances from the cast and perhaps the scariest thing about it is that it isn't really a \"horror\" movie as you would normally define \"horror.\" There's no \"monster\" in this - just a large great white shark that has developed a real taste for human flesh and takes up residence off an East Coach beach on the fictional community of Amity Island to feed. There's no wasting of time on this. The movie grabs you by the collar in just the first couple of minutes with the truly frightening first attack - made even more frightening by the fact that (although you know what it is) you never see the attacker. A young girl is just grabbed by something and disappears screaming in a pool of blood. It was a brilliant and very effective opening that ensured that the viewer would never lose interest, and indeed the shock of that opening means you don't take your eyes off the screen for even a moment.The first part of the movie deals with the efforts of the local sheriff (Brody, played by Roy Scheider) to convince the town to shut the beach after that first attack. He's convinced (and the local ME confirmed) that it was a shark attack. But the town is about to host thousands of tourists for the July 4 holiday. Under pressure from the mayor and town Council, the ME changes his report to a boating accident, and Brody isn't allowed to shut the beach, because it would cost the town too much money. A marine biologist (Hooper, played by Richard Dreyfuss) is brought in and confirms that this was a shark attack by a huge shark, but still the town won't listen, and disaster occurs. Finally, the mayor - stunned by the carnage that ensued - agrees to pay Quint, a local fisherman played by Robert Shaw, a bounty of $10000 to hunt and kill the shark, assisted by Brody and Hooper.It's marvellously put together. Maybe the only thing I could have done without were some of the male-bonding scenes between Quint, Brody and Hooper on board the Orca as they sing songs and compare wounds. But that's nowhere near enough to detract from the overall power of the movie, and it's in that scene that Quint shares his story as part of the crew of the USS Indianapolis, an American ship sunk by the Japanese in the closing days of World War II, with many of the crew being taken by sharks while they waited to be rescued. I had never heard that story before, checked it out after watching the movie and discovered it to be very true. The climax of the hunt as the trio is finally able to locate the great white is a tremendous fight. There are really very few moments in this that give you much of an opportunity to catch your breath. It may well be the best movie of its type ever made, and one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre. (10/10)",

The acting and character development is one of my favorites and I really enjoy the scientists character. There is something about him that is extremely like-able. My favorite part about the actual shark itself is that the robot couldn't sustain in the water and ended up breaking down. So they used the barrels to try and show where the shark is. It actually adds this element of mystery and horror that's extremely affective. The behind the scenes footage is also very entertaining to see.",

The success of this film can be attributed to the chemistry among the three stars: Scheider as the police chief, Shaw as the shark hunter, and Dreyfuss as a marine scientist. Shaw, who met with an untimely death three years later, is particularly memorable as the cantankerous Quint. Of course they are just supporting actors to the real star: Bruce the shark. Spielberg does a masterful job of generating suspense and terror. Williams adds to the tension with the throbbing theme music that is quite effective if unoriginal (he lifted it from Dvorak's Ninth Symphony).",

            "content": "Jaws is the type of movie that in this day and age we almost take for granted. I couldn't tell you what age I was when I first seen it, the film's iconic status ensures everyone knows what Jaws is about, everyone knows that John Williams score and everyone knows that they're going to need a bigger boat.The film's plot has been retread to the point that even if you haven't seen Jaws, chances are you've seen a film with a plot derived from it. Former New York City cop Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) has relocated his family to the idealic seaside resort of Amity Island despite his disdain for all things watery. Everything is going smoothly until locals start disappearing around the beach, which leads Brody to the conclusion a killer shark is picking off the Islanders.Despite Brody's protestations, Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) refuses to close the beach with the 4th of July looming, with disastrous results. Left shaken, Brody turns to marine biologist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) and the 3 set out to sea on a mission to catch the biggest fish of all.Based upon the novel by Peter Benchley, director Steven Spielberg rather widely discards a lot of the novel's unnecessary side-plots, involving affairs and the mafia, and presents us with a stripped back plot that allows its characters to breath. Indeed it could be said that half of the movie is just the set piece of the shark-hunt, played out with only the 3 hunters for company, but this would be doing it a disservice. As we get to see the 3 characters play off one another in the claustrophobic confines of Quint's Orca fishing boat, they receive more depth and humanity than the combined casts of the numerous rip-offs the movie spawned put together. It can't be overstated how much this adds to the suspense watching these 3 very human characters struggle against a seemingly unstoppable, yet oh-so-real monster.Indeed suspense is the name of the game here, infamously caused by the mechanical shark used being unreliable and forcing Spielberg to think outside of the box, in the process delivering more heart-in-mouth moments in the one summer blockbuster than in an entire series of slasher movies. My DVD is rated 12, and there are a few gory scenes, but Jaws is an absolute masterclass in using what you don't see to scare you. Due to the aforementioned issues the mechanical shark presented, for most of the film it remains mostly offscreen, presenting us with a few especially horrific glimpses of sharks in books Brody flicks through to let our imaginations run wild.The film's cast are a massive part of its success, led by the particularly impressive front 3. I had a friend who studied the film in Media Studies whose teacher told him Scheider was cast \"because he looks like a shark\" which I'm not sure about, but it's a quote that always amused me. Regardless of his lack thereof, to the film's antagonist, Scheider puts in a fine performance as our main point of relation, the Everyman hopelessly out of his depth, both figuratively and literally. Legend has it Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw didn't get on too well on set, and the tension spills over wonderfully into the 2 characters constantly at one another's throats. The supporting cast, including Hamilton and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wide also play their part in setting things up marvellously.The cast play their part, and this was Steven Spielberg in top form in the directors chair, but despite this the show might almost be stolen by John Williams' score, simple yet effective, it probably plays the biggest part of all in building the suspense the movie thrives off. I'd say it's possibly tied with Psycho for the most recognisable movie score ever, for a reason.The much maligned mechanical shark 'Bruce' makes fleeting appearances, and while it hasn't aged perfectly, it's still convincing, and the physical presence of it makes for a much more compelling die than CGI could ever accomplish.Jaws is one of those rare movies that I'd genuinely class as flawless. Everything adds up into the complete viewing package. If anything, the only detractions the film suffers stem from its overly influential status meaning that almost every situation may seem somewhat familiar to even those who've never seen the movie before because so many films have wholesale ripped it off over the years.The film would go on to become the first Summer Blockbuster and highest grossing film of its time, back in an age when that actually meant something. Spielberg would go on to spend the next 20 years or so delivering mostly great movies before going somewhat off he rails and playing it safe. Out of the leading cast only Dreyfuss would really go on to bigger and better things with Shaw passing away shortly afterwards and Scheider wasting far too much of his career in the Ocean in Seawuest DSV. Bruce would go on to 3 sequels of varying degrees of quality before taking up permanent residence at Universal Studios.",

            "content": "Well, I've really never seen Jaws before and there's actually no reason for that. Somehow I just always pushed Jaws aside and pushed it up further and further, but now the time has come, I have seen the film and am just thrilled.But what else can you expect from Steven Spielberg? He simply has an incredible range and has so many different genres in his filmography around action, adventure, war film, comedy, children's film, sci-fi, most recently musical and with Jaws he has proven that he is also great in the horror/thriller genre. This man simply knows how to tell stories, build up characters, build tension and captivate the viewer to the screen and he proves that anew in every film.Well, that what makes the film so special and stands out from other shark films is of course the tension, the incredible tension that mounts more and more until it comes to the climax. The special thing about the tension in Jaws is that a huge mystery is being built around the white shark. At first you see a few killings of the beast and of course only expect a normal shark attack. But without seeing the shark, as a spectator you learn more and more details about the shark that all indicate that this is not a normal shark.It is particularly important that the shark is never really shown at first, because then the mystery is expanded much further. As a spectator, you wonder what this beast must be and then when you finally see the shark, it is much bigger than expected.Of course, this would only be half as impressive if the shark had been computer-animated, because then you could certainly no longer take the film seriously today. But luckily they decided against it and Bruce still looks fantastic today. Oh yes, Steven Spielberg called the shark Bruce, perhaps after his lawyer, who hast the same name. But in any case, the beast in the film looks really impressive and that's why it was certainly worth building the shark instead of animating it. Although the shark has sunk on the first attempt to put it in the water, because it has never been checked its water suitability.But be that as it may, the film offers such incredible tension that is getting worse and more acute and also a realistic-looking shark. But another special aspect is, of course, the horror factor. Because it is not without reason that the film is one of the only five horror films that has received an Academy Award. Well, I thought at first that the film would not be scary and would rather go in the direction of a thriller. That's true, but the horror aspect was still captured magnificently. There were even two moments when I really shrugged and that doesn't happen often with horror movies. Probably it's just because Jaws simply offers a fantastic and immersive experience, so that you are so deep in the story that you sympathize with the characters at all times and are therefore frightened.Well, speaking of characters, because these were also written really brilliantly and also fantastically embodied by the actors. Roy Scheider plays the protagonist and he is completely convincing in his role. He plays a police chief of a smaller island town and he is the only one who actually has his heart in the right place and is not interested in profit. In addition, he also has a personal interest in killing the shark, as he feels guilty not to have done anything earlier to close the beach. The fact that he is also afraid of the water simply makes him a great character in the film.Richard Dreyfuss actually plays the second leading role and is also fantastic in his role. His character is a kind of shark or fish expert, who once again brings a slightly different perspective into the film.And then of course there is Robert Shaw in the role of Quint. Even if he actually plays an asshole in the film, he still plays it really convincingly and with great joy. But his character is at least as important as the other two, as he brings another new perspective into the film. As a result, there are three characters that are all very different, but still pursue a common goal.The characters are particularly important in the film because they conveyed the feelings of the whole event. When they see the shark for the first time and are completely amazed by this size and at the same time afraid, this is really important, because this is the same effect as in Jurassic Park. If the characters react only half-heartedly and as if it were nothing special, then of course we feel the same. But fortunately, the actors convey the feelings of their characters really great, so that we as viewers naturally sympathize much more.Of course, the soundtrack should also be mentioned, because once again John Williams is responsible for how it actually befits Steven Spielberg films. His theme of the film is at least as iconic as the film itself and anyone who hears this theme will probably immediately associate it with the film.Well, it is probably not without reason that the film when it was released, could record the greatest revenue ever, until Star Wars replaced it. Because Jaws is simply an immersive, exciting, thrilling and unforgettable experience that perfectly combines the thriller and horror genre and just delivers a damn great experience.",

When a girl gets eaten by a shark, Brody wants to close the beaches. Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) has a different opinion. When a little boy is killed by the shark next, Brody closes down the beaches. There's a private bounty of $3000. Local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) offers to do it for $10k. Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) from the Oceanographic Institute answers Brody's call for help. The bounty brings many yahoos and they catch a tiger shark.

When the shark attacks again, mayor Vaughn relents and agrees to hire Quint. Quint isn't impressed with Hooper, but he's forced to take both Hooper and Brody on board.There are so many great things about this movie. It holds up even compared to more modern movies.

With the July 4th festivities about to start the seaside town of Amity, who's economy depends on tourist summer dollars, the news that a killer and man eating shark is on the loose off it's waters is the last thing that the town fathers and its Mayor Vaughn, Murray Hamilton, want the public to know about! It's when against his better judgment due to the pressure put on him by Mayor Vaughn Amity Police Chief Brody,Roy Scheider, kept the beaches opened that the killer shark strikes again gulping down another victim in front of hundreds of terrified beach goers including Chief Brody. With panic engulfing Amity and after a false report of having harpooned and killed the shark he strikes again this time in shallow waters off Amity Island. This on July 4th taking down another victim and thus closing the beaches indefinitely until the shark, the real killer shark not a cheap imitation,is finally put out of commission!With Mayor Vaughn and the town fathers finally coming to their senses their forced to hire the famed shark hunter Captain Quint, Robert Shaw, at $10,000.00 plus expenses to track down and kill the man eating shark before he adds more victims to his already impressive body count. There's also the young wise cracking Oceanographer Hooper, Richard Dreyfuss, who goes along for the ride together with chief Brody on Quint's shark hunting boat the Orca. It's Hooper's know it all attitude about marine life and sea fearing that starts to get under Quint's skin and almost leads the two to go at each other instead of at the killer shark. It's only later on that Hooper gains a new found respect for Quint when he finds out that his obsession with sharks and wanting to kill them was the result of an incident back in WWII where he almost ended up together with most of his 700 fellow US Navy sailors, on the torpedoed USS Indianapolis, being eaten by one of them.With the three, Quint Brody & Hooper, shark hunters out at sea is when the killer shark, efficiently called Bruce, comes out in the open with his razor sharp and serrated teeth, as much as three rows of them,flashing. From then on it's a battle between man and beast on the open seas with the killer shark making the best of the situation. It's his turf or waters that he's battling in and he knows every drop of it. That's until Brody now on his own with nothing to lose, but his life, overcomes his fear of the high seas and together with a high powered rifle and full oxygen tank finally turns the tables on the surging like a train locomotive Bruce the Shark. With Brody leaving about just enough of him,all 25 feet and three ton's worth, to fully pack an 8 to 12 once sardine can! P.S \"Jaws\" released in the early summer of 1975 became the biggest money making hit in motion picture history in only just six weeks after it's initial release! Surpressing and almost doubling the profits of the previous money earing champ \"The Godfather\" without as much as breaking a sweat in doing it. Not at first thought to become the mega monster hit, with all the troubles and delays in filming it, that it turned out to be \"Jaws\" astounded the movie critics as well as it's own cast & crew members who before it's release had them feeling that it was going to be the \"Bomb\" of the century, and end up destroying their careers, who tried to distance and disown themselves from the film. Check out the author of the novel \"Jaws\" that the film was based on Peter Benchley as a TV reporter on the Amity beach just before the killer shark springs or swims into action.",

But when I sawed the actual Jaws for the first time, I was literally Blown Away by the sheer Terror of that thing. The amount of Blood that was Spewed out and the amount of Damage that was Caused. But another thing that I really like about this movie is one of the most memorable quote \"Your Gonna need a bigger boat\" which was said by Chief Martin Brody: You're gonna need a bigger boat! But one thing that I hated about the jaws franchise is that this sits as one of the most classic films of all time, which is Obvious because it's has remarkable music and is made by Steven Speilberg since he also produced Jurassic Park. Since this is a class, all of its Sequel are god awful. Jaws 2 isn't bad, but Jaws 3 and 4 are literally Trash.

The film starts with a girl swimming in the sea and being dragged under water by an underwater creature. Roy Scheider plays Police Chief Brody who is determined to investigate this incidence and find this creature. A man named Quint (Robert Shaw) is a shark catcher and believes that after a boy is killed in the same way on the beach that there is a shark on the lose, he is determined to catch it. Finally Hooper (BAFTA nominated Richard Dreyfuss) is a shark expert and believes he would be helpful with identifying the type of shark it is. Then, the mayhem begins as they head out to sea and try to capture the shark. Spielberg has done an excellent job of making tense and terrifying moments, seeing the shark and guy with an eye missing are examples. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Screenplay, Best Sound Track and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Drama.

Of course, we wouldn't be inundated with these dime-a-dozen special effects laden popcorn flicks if JAWS and STAR WARS weren't so entertaining in the first place. JAWS had struck such a nerve in the summer of 1975 that people were terrified of going in the water, in the same sense as they were jittery about stepping into the shower after that famous scene in PSYCHO. It didn't matter whether that body of water was an ocean or a landlocked lake, the fear was vividly implanted into everyone's subconscious.Peter Benchley's best seller was optioned by Richard Zanuck and David Brown, who immediately, and correctly, sensed its box office potential. Making a deal with Universal, they considered a few directors before giving the job to an eager young man who just finished helming THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS for them: a fellow by the name of Steven Spielberg.Although important as the shark was to the story, the three main characters would have to be well cast. For the salty Captain Quint, Spielberg and the producers had their hopes on Sterling Hayden, an actor who was also an expert sailor. However, tax battles with the Internal Revenue Service prevented his return stateside. Robert Shaw was approached next, but he hated the book, describing it with colorful language I can't use here. He changed his mind when his wife urged him to reconsider. Allegedly, Charlton Heston wanted to play Chief Martin Brody, but Universal wanted someone less expensive, so Roy Scheider was brought in. And finally, Richard Dreyfuss was given the part of Matt Hooper largely on the basis of his work on AMERICAN GRAFFITI.JAWS was a nightmare to film on the sea, and the majority of the headaches surrounded the mechanical shark, nicknamed Bruce after Spielberg's attorney -well, you know the old joke about sharks never attacking lawyers out of professional courtesy. Actually, there were three Bruces, and at various times all malfunctioned due to the salt water. The weather was also an everpresent nuisance, as was friction between Shaw and Dreyfuss -mostly caused by the former-\nplus numerous rewrites.For anyone unfamiliar with the plot of JAWS (as if!!), the island resort of Amity is menaced by the presence of a great white shark. A week prior to Independence Day, the remains of a young woman are found on the beach. After the cause of death is attributed to a shark attack, the new police chief Martin Brody immediately attempts to close the beaches, but is rebuffed by the chamber of commerce. As the mayor explains, Amity is a summer town that depends on summer dollars.",

            "content": "This is probably one of the greatest thriller movies of all times, where a gigantic great white shark begins a spree of terror in the town of Amityville, threatening its beach-loving residents, and leading police chief Brody, marine scientist Hooper and gruff fisherman Quint seeking to destroy it before it keeps going to fish for humans. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss all gave memorable performances in their respectable roles, out to catch and destroy the man-eating shark. The special effects were great, especially the performance of the shark - realistic and downright scary. Seeing people being drag beneath the waters by the shark as the water turn blood red is one creepy experience you'll never forget. John Williams' haunting music score is one of his most popular and signature musical works, an icon in the movie soundtracks. Just those few musical bars will forever make audience realize that this is \"Jaws.\" Steven Spielberg gave one of his finest directions, making this an exciting and intriguing movie to watch.During the scenes near or under the water, there is an eerie feeling, making you wonder whether the shark will come up bite you or is lurking near you. The shark's entrance by sticking one of its fins above the water is probably one of the most signature character appearances of all time. One funny scene is when Chief Brody tells his kids to get out of the boat, but his wife assures him that nothing is going to happen. Then, she glances at this book where it shows pictures of shark attacks. Then, she tells the kids to \"get out of the water, now!\" Overall, a perfect horror movie for a Friday night.Grade B+",

            "content": "Based on Peter Benchley's best-selling novel, Director Steven Spielberg's 1975 shark saga set the standard for the New Hollywood popcorn blockbuster while frightening millions of moviegoers out of the water. Jaws was a mega blockbuster at the time, becoming the highest grossing film at that point and changed the way Hollywood release and marketed movie. Both the film and the novel was inspired by the historic event of the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916. The movie starts out with the infamous scene of a moonlight skinner dipper getting drag under the ocean. In the morning, the town of Amity Island finds out that she was attacked by a shark attack. Police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) orders Amity's beaches closed, but is overruled by mayor Larry Vaughan (Murray Hamilton), fearing it would hurt the summer tourism on which the town's economy is heavily dependent on. When the deaths continue to pile up, Brody brings in ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) to kill the killer Great White Shark once and for all. Quint is larger than life and even cartoonish because the story needs this character. Quint is the ring leader for the great \"Boys\" adventure which is the turn this movie takes in the last third act of the movie and the best part. Quint, Brody, and Hooper. They laugh, they argue, they are tested, they bond, and it work. Robert Shaw does a great job in the role, and the whole USS Indianapolis speech was amazing. His overt bravado and Machismo was greatly needed to play counterpoint to Hooper's nebbishes. He is the story's Captain Ahab. It was one of the things they change from the novel. Another is cutting most of Benchley's many subplots, like Hooper having an affair with Brody's wife, which is great in my opinion. In my opinion, Richard Dreyfuss was the weakest of the three main characters. It was so unlike the character from the book. Still, Hooper should had the same ending as the novel. It was disappointing. I do like Roy Scheider as Brody. I love Roy Scheider's ad-lib of the line \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\". I just wish his fear of the open water was explain. It was generalized and non-specific to fit the expected fears of most of the audience. Brody is the everyman character so he must be most generalized, least brave throughout, least in control throughout. He does not become \"heroic\" until he is finally all alone and must do whatever he can to kill the beast, which he does the vicarious triumph of the audience through him. The film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. Due to that, Spielberg rarely show the shark, until the third act. The shark instead is shown by camera point of view of the creature looming in the ocean or close shots of its fin. John Williams's orchestral theme, the creepiest since Herrmann's Psycho also plays a part. Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the animal's presence, employing an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances. The music gives it a pulsing heartbeat. It ramps up the tension from point to point and brings the film to higher and higher plateaus. Due to the lack of shark presence, so critics might say, this is the greatest B movie ever. I disagree. It's not a B movie. It's a movie that follows the same structure as B movies. B movies are not necessarily bad. They're cheap and they put the premise before character and plot development. The two things that separate Jaws from B movies are the deep characters and the insane budget. The writers cared so much for who the characters were that it could not be a B movie. I just recently saw the movie again and I am amazed how well it holds up. Spielberg was a master at showing his skill and awareness to story, setting and character. Then the art! There is a shot of Brody looking out the boat window while reflected in the glass is the yellow barrel being dragged out to sea by the monster shark. Brilliant! It is sublime in illustrating the magic and exhilaration of this great \"Boys\" adventure! The reason why Jaws works as a good horror movie is because who can deny it? Great White Sharks have killed people in the past, and aren't creatures of morality. Great white sharks are apex predators. Their physiology and whole lives even are centered around killing. Nature can be scary and brutal; why not show it as it really is? Great White Sharks, although they are indeed misunderstood creatures who don't outrightly kill people for pleasure or even sport like humans do. They have been known to kill people under the perception that they have mistaken swimmers as wounded prey. Hence their attraction to loud noise and splashing. They are indeed a force of nature, but as humanity has learned time and time again, nature is a dangerous thing, and great white sharks are some of the most deadly the ocean has to offer. Some people got offended because it portray sharks in a bad light and help cause some species of sharks to be nearly extinct due to hunting. New studies have shown that the danger great white sharks pose to humans is greatly exaggerated and I agree, they are dangerous, but it's rare to have shark attacks. What isn't exaggerated is how popular the movie got after the released. Its spawn horrible sequels, and a few Universal Studios rides. In the end, Jaws is a pretty good horror movie. Filled with terror and adventure, Jaws continues to make new generations of fans afraid to go swimming. Let Jaws take a bite out of you!",

            "content": "I've always had a theory of why Jaws is such a frightening film for so many people. It is because we are challenging the shark which maybe the most perfect killing and eating machine in nature in his own habitat. We are land creatures, we cannot breath in water, we can only hold our breath going under for a limited time. Even with scuba apparatus we are no match for the shark in the place where he lives and breathes. So when one of them gets real close to our land habitat and starts killing off swimmers we frighten easily because any one of us could be his victim if we dare venture in the water.It's this terror that Peter Benchley's novel and Steven Spielberg's film exploits to the max. Jaws is almost like two films put together about the same subject. In the first part when the first shark victim shows up, Roy Scheider as constable of the small island town of Amity Island on the New England coast, he wants to close the beach. But the city fathers led by Murray Hamilton say no way. This is the summer tourist season which the town lives and dies by. Of course a couple of good lawsuits would truly cripple the town, but that fact never seems to enter anyone's thinking. Spielberg truly shows the greed of humankind here. Of course when more shark death occur, then the professionals have to take over.Those professionals are Scheider, oceanographer Richard Dreyfuss and fisherman Robert Shaw who has a boat they can use for shark hunting. He's got first hand experience with sharks, he spent some time in the water as a sailor in the Pacific War with sharks picking off his mates one by one. They each bring a different skill to the hunt.These three are not the most compatible shipmates ever brought together for a common purpose. In fact the conflicts between all three leads drive the film in the last half. When the big great white shark comes calling though it's a tough battle to put him down. Jaws won three Oscars in technical categories, music scoring, sound, and film editing in addition to being nominated for Best Picture in 1975. But it's as much the actors as well as the technical virtuosity of Jaws that make it the great film it is.Centuries from now Jaws will be scaring the pants off people because we're still afraid of what lives in the water.",

Don't expect an alien-esque horror film. Jaws demands more patience to be enjoyable because, first and foremost, it is a fishing film.That brings me to another misconception about the film, the beginning is slow, really slow, and pointless. Fortunately, Spielberg's skillful directing was there to insufflate some energy into that otherwise bothersome first act.If you haven't already seen Jaws, I do say go for it. It remains a classic of Hollywood cinema, but keep in mind that what you are about to see is not an action film nor a horror film.",

            "content": "Going down in history as the first summer Blockbuster, Steven Spielberg made a name for himself with this visceral, fear-inducing creature-feature that had even land-locked audience afraid to go into the water for years to come! As the first film to achieve $100 million in theatrical rentals, it not only set many box-office records, but it went on to earn three Academy Awards!On the quiet shores of the quaint, seaside community of Amity Island, newly appointed Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Schneider) discovers the remains of woman's body on the beach. When she's determined to be the victim of a shark attack, Sheriff Brody wants to close the beach, however Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) as well as some affluential local businessmen will not allow it, pointing out that the summer is their busiest tourist season and where they take in most of their annual income. Brody defers to their judgment, and that weekend, a young boy is killed by the man-eating shark. The dead boy's mother places a bounty on the shark, which attracts amateur hunters and fishermen from all over hoping to claim that reward money. When a local fisherman by the name of Quint (Robert Shaw) offers to hunt down the predator for a handsome fee, eventually the mayor agrees. Sheriff Brody joins him, as well as Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), a Marine Biologist from the Oceanographic Institute.Based on the novel by Peter Benchley published in 1974 who helped develop the screenplay in conjunction with Carl Gottlieb, it hits all the right marks, playing on the masses already existent, albeit largely unfounded, fear of these fascinating carnivores. The incorporation of Hooper was important to provide some measure of scientific basis for their analysis instead of perpetuating misinformation. Director Steven Spielberg may be a household name now, but when he was just starting out, it wasn't easy convincing studios to back such an ambitious project. Undertaking over half of a production filming in water is difficult enough, but add in portraying a believable Great White Shark, and it wouldn't have been out of the question for studio execs to scoff at the very notion-especially considering Spielberg only had a few films and TV episodes under his belt at the time. However, through the seamless dual use of real footage of Great Whites and production designer Joe Alves animatronic creation, he was able to achieve a remarkable feat immortalized on film.With principal photography and filming taking place in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, Spielberg succeeds in boasting Amity as a real oceanside town. As most of the sequences were shot with handheld cameras, the audience truly feels as if they are on the Orca with the crew, adding to the tension. Spielberg's creative inclusion of what would be coined the \"shark-eye-view\" camera truly reaffirmed the anxiety-inducing fear that kept audiences on the edge of their seats. Pacing is a tad slow for some of the scenes on the boat as Brody, Hooper, and Quint attempt to track the man-eater. There are also a few narrative oversights, such as why on earth no one went looking for the Orca after they did not return, or why they didn't encounter any other shark hunters, but taken as a whole, the film is a tremendous success in its unwavering ability to elicit fear and anxiety, even when the majority of tumultuous events transpire in broad daylight.Ominous and tension building to the extreme, it isn't any wonder John Williams score secured an Oscar. While this was only their second time working together, it is clear that Spielberg and Williams have a certain kinship and comradery that allows them to share the same vision for the projects they work on. Williams' theme for Jaws will be remembered for all-time, and then the composer still went on to possibly outdo himself scoring the iconic theme to Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993).Sheriff Brody is a well-meaning man, out to protect his community, though clearly caught between a rock and a hard place. His fear of water adds a relatable quality to his character. In present-day America, a whopping 64% of the population is afraid of deep open water (oceans). Hooper provides just enough of a scientific basis to ground the events and offer some interesting ways to try to defeat the animal. Despite his role as the somewhat experienced, greedy shark-hunter, Quint seems a bit too eccentric to offer anything other than animosity and tension with Hooper in a confined space, proffering his fate as a relative eventuality. These three offer vastly differing perspectives on and attitudes about the shark that make for an intriguing dynamic.Roy Schneider succeeds in bringing a humble but capable quality to the Sheriff, allowing the audience to relate to his vulnerability and desire to protect the townsfolk. Initially, Spielberg was considering Charlton Heston to play Sheriff Brody, however after completing Earthquake (1974) and in light of the fact that he was being considered to play the hero in Airplane 1975 (1974), Spielberg reasoned that if he were to play the Sheriff, the film would feel decidedly more predictable with the shark having little to no chance against him. Richard Dreyfuss not only plays well as the inquisitive scientist interested in the study of the creature, but portrays a wounded quality that provides a connection. Shaw unfortunately is very much like his character-drunk, crude, and unreasonable throughout the majority of the time, though one could argue that plays well for his character onscreen.Spielberg astutely blends the actual Great White Shark footage shot by noted underwater photographers Ron and Valerie Taylor taken off the southern coast of Australia with his animatronic Bruce with balances the intensity of the close-ups with the required suspension of disbelief as audiences observe the fluid movement from the live footage. Three mechanical \"Bruces\" (as they were dubbed) were made, each having a specialized function. And if you were wondering why the Tiger Shark hung by its tail looked so real, that is because it was in fact a real shark killed in Florida. Since there wasn't a big enough one in Martha's Vineyard, they had it shipped to the set and prepared for filming, however by that time, it was in an advanced state of decomposition, with the actors stating the smell was appalling, eliciting some some very real reactions.It is of little wonder that this iconic film would go down in history as the first summer \"blockbuster\", with over 67 million people in the US going to see the film when it was initially released in 1975. It took in more than its $7 million budget opening weekend alone, and became the highest grossing film of all time to date.FINAL VERDICT: Definitely worth watching with the lights down and the volume up.8.5 out of 10.0 - Rewatch Value: 4~AleXa~ An original IMDB user for over 20 years.

            "content": "Much of this comment will, I realize, be meandering, spotty, and anecdotal, but what with more than 500 reviews of this movie already on file, how much can be lost by a bit of negative entropy? I think we can skip the story except to say fish eats man, man finally kills fish. The fish was called Bruce, or was it Moby Bruce. Roy Scheider is the chief of police of a resort fishing village on an island. He's the local authority so often found in monster movies. Murray Hamilton is the superior who doesn't trust or believe Scheider. Richard Dreyfus is the requisite scientist -- often but not always a toothsome babe. In this case the expert can be a man because Scheider is already happily married, with children, as the first half of the movie establishes. Robert Shaw is Quint, an anomaly, the rough, tough shark fisherman who has contempt for ordinary people. Usually that's part of the police chief's role.The movie was a HUGE popular and commercial success, and for good reason. The visuals and special effects are perfectly realized, the music nail-bitingly suspense inducing, and the characters are not cardboard cutouts as they so often are in routine action thrillers.Take Scheider's sheriff. He has a family and he loves them but the bond is projected in everyday ways. A cheaper script would have him telling his kids, just as he's about to leave on a suicide mission, how much he loves them and if he doesn't come back -- well, just remember to do what your mother tells you and don't forget to brush your teeth regularly and visit a dentist twice a year and stay away from women with barbed-wire tattoos. Scheider does none of that, and if he ever even kisses his wife, I managed to miss it this time around.Furthermore, unlike so many action/science fiction/horror protagonists, Scheider is flawed. Not seriously, but still -- afraid of being on the water? So phobic that he must consume a couple of bottles of wine and get drunk in order to board a boat? It's played mostly for comic effect, but Scheider isn't given any excuse for his fears either. He didn't watch his Dad drown or get waterboarded as a prisoner or anything like that.The most interesting character, though, is Shaw's Quint, the crack shark hunter. We're talking major league Hemingwayism here. Shaw wears a fishing cap just like Papa's, he's vulgar, he dislikes college kids, he drinks home-made \"hootch\", he's been through a war -- a man's man in every respect. And when it comes to Bruce, he is wrong at every turn. He makes all the mistakes in the book out of an excess of self confidence, smashing the boat's radio, deliberately burning out an engine bearing, and paying for it as a Hemingway hero would. Gulp. There has rarely been a more interesting case study of overreaching.Sharks as a group aren't evil in themselves. As Dreyfus explains, all they do is eat and make little sharks, only one or two incremental evolutionary units below humans in those respects. Hordes of three-foot blue sharks used to come up in our chum stream off Sandy Hook and I used to reach into the water from our outboard, grab one by the tail, and flip it flapping and spinning overhead. They're like pussy cats. It's only when they get bigger that they get spookier. I was on a fishing boat anchored about fifty feet of Olosega Island in Samoa and a couple of guys dived overboard and swam ashore in the most casual way. I happened to look down over the other side and there, barely moving through the electric blue water, was a dusky monster I estimated at about eight feet. I was tickled pink I wasn't swimming along joking and laughing with the others. In this instance, Bruce gets his just deserts. He's got an explosive CO2 container lodged in his cheek. The enormous blast fills the air with tiny chondroblasts.The director and composer haven't misjudged their audience often in this movie but they get carried away in one noticeable scene. Now get this. Bruce has eaten several people and has just revealed himself as more of a whale than a shark, and he's performed incredible feats of strength, enough even to impress Quint, who has seen everything. Now Bruce has a couple of highly buoyant plastic barrels attached to him and he's plowing through the water paying no attention to the drag. Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfus are pursuing him in the fishing boat, its engine full out, barely able to keep up with this man-eating beast. And the musical score suddenly switches from its well-know THUM THUM -- THUM THUM -- to light-hearted happy music, as if we were watching two youngsters having an exciting but tame adventure, an exhilarating horse race through the woods. I wonder if anyone else felt the music was a little discordant. I'm happy though that Shaw, for all his faults, used the word \"hootch\" in this movie. It means \"illegal liquor\" and it comes from the language of the Tlingit Indians who live along the mountainous northwest coast of Alaska and Canada, a cheerful, industrious group. Not enough Tlingit words have been borrowed into English. \"Cayuse\" is the only other one I can think of.",

And the special effects? Genius. The mechanical shark (which famously seized up constantly during filming, forcing Spielberg to work around the issue and only hint at the shark in most scenes) does look a little fake when its face is fully and clearly out of the water, but everywhere else, it looks totally real, even for a movie this old! Practically everything in this movie is well-done, from the amazing cinematography, to the amazing score by musical genius and Spielberg regular John Williams (who sadly is now on the verge of retirement), especially the famous Jaws theme (Da-DUN. Daa-DUN.).And even with a 124-minute runtime, absolutely no scenes drag out too long, nor go by too fast, and there's just the perfect amount of humor and excitement to keep me entertained all the way through. And most of the dialogue really amused me, too!All in all, Jaws is certainly the classic that all cinephiles say it is. Spielberg was certainly at his finest with this movie.

It's a script that thrives on character development and interaction, and shows that a three-act structure is not really a cut-and-dry thing.Actually what is so lovely about the film is how it's really a two-fer, a kind of prototype of what one might see Tarantino do later on with some of his films - From Dusk till Dawn, Django Unchained - where it's really two movies: first is the quasi-horror-mystery as to what this shark is, which shark (\"THIS IS NOT A BOAT ACCIDENT!\") and how the politicians - namely the Mayor (who has great hair btw), a spineless weasel who kinda, almost, sorta gets a sympathetic moment in the hospital (\"My kids were on that beach too\") if it wasn't so pathetic - screw things up. Spielberg, by proxy of a shark machine that didn't work so great, went for what would later become a (over-used?) staple of horror films, especially serial killer flicks, where *we* become the killer in a sense, floating around, looking for victims, and then BAM.The other movie is an adventure movie where the character hinted at in the first half - Surly Mr. Quint (and really, thanks to Robert Shaw, isn't it one of the two or three most 'something' characters in modern cinema? a \"Working-Class Hero\" with a lot of layers and demons and a lack of AA sponsorship) - takes center stage as our other heroes, Brody and Hooper, are almost at his mercy, and yet help him and collaborate on this hunt.And what makes the film is that both films work unto themselves, and yet are all of a piece. In an odd way even though sharks ARE very important to the story - where else would we get the Indianapolis story without em - they could be hunting anything really. I don't mean to marginalize the location, the Orca boat, the sea-bound sense of what has to be done physically on the ship (\"Know how to tie a sheep shank?\" \"You didn't say how short you wanted it.\" God this movie is quotable), but if they were out like, I don't know, hunting a mountain lion or a big bear, it would still be the same great characters and the same stakes of life-or-death as well as life-or-death for anyone else.I can't really think of a better man vs nature film, can you? Certainly not any without Murray Hamilton. or John Williams, who made such a score that you could put it on (like other classical Spielberg tracks) a classic-baroque music station on the radio and it'd fit completely in. Matter of fact, it's surprising the shark's theme- 'dun-un (repeat)' doesn't just come out of the shark's mouth!PS: the Shark was named \"Bruce\" after Spielberg's lawyer. Guess when you need to take a BITE out of a contract, make sure your teeth are shot-glass sized, eh?",

This is part of popular culture, with countless references to it and parodies of it in the almost 35 years that has passed. I suppose I will still describe the plot: A small island community finds itself terrorized by a shark. A really, really big one. The storytelling is good, and this never loses your attention. It's interesting to note that the limitations of the mechanical effect led to this being as excellent as it is. Not being able to show the animal all the time, Spielberg opted for build-up and character development, thus creating a marvelous suspenseful atmosphere as well as getting the audience properly invested in these characters. This is immensely exciting and intense, and you don't know exactly when something is going to happen. The acting is great, every single performance(with the possible exception of some of the kids, but that's nothing new). FX are better than you might expect, and the careful and precise editing and cinematography succeed in making them entirely convincing. The score is solid. This comes with an featurette that is almost two(in total, all of the stuff amounts to maybe three) hours long and worth watching, an interview with Spielberg, deleted scenes, Shark Facts, a minute and a half of unfunny outtakes and some galleries. There is frequent moderate to strong language, a little bloody violence and disturbing content. I recommend this to any fan of horror films and/or thrillers. 10/10",

            "content": "Peter Benchley wrote a thriller about an almost supernaturally cunning great white shark which haunted the beaches of a holiday resort. It was an enjoyable book, but not exceptional. But it was definitely cinematic enough for Universal to acquire the film rights, although it was sufficiently low priority that they allocated a director who had only previously directed one cinema feature (albeit a moderate amount of TV).OK, so the director was Steven Spielberg, and everyone has to start somewhere, right? Together with screenwriter Carl Gottlieb (whose contribution shouldn't be overlooked), the soapy aspects of the novel were discarded and the story streamlined to concentrate on the shark and its effects on the community it was stalking. The movie brilliantly intertwines shark action with the interplay between the 3 primary characters, Police Chief Brodie (Roy Scheider), shark specialist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and professional fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw). All three performances are top notch.But the film also contains a huge number of \"moments\" - the first shocking attack, the jetty, the beach attack, the nocturnal underwater search (and its brilliantly choreographed shock moment - I recall seeing daylight between bums and seats in the packed cinema when the movie first came out), the fingernail screech... the list goes on and on. Jaws demonstrated that Spielberg's gift lay in orchestrating audience reactions, something he is arguably as good at as Hitchcock was.And let us not forget the impact of one of John William's most effective scores.Bruce, the mechanical shark, isn't always convincing, but that matters little. Even now, all these years later, Jaws still has the power to thrill, shock, and - above all - entertain.Update:\nI have just watched the big-screen 3D update, so let's tackle the 3D first. It's fine. It doesn't enhance the film particularly, but it's effective and there are some great 3D moments.Having watched the film numerous times, there were no surprises or shocks, but I renewed my respect for Spielberg's directorial skills this early in his career. I did come away with one puzzlement, though - do the people of Amity really go that far out for beach swimming? Deep enough for a 25' Great White to cruise about a couple of metres or more below their dangling legs?",

            "content": "\"Jaws\" a film that I've viewed many times over the years is one of my favorites, it's clearly one of the 70's best and probably one of cinemas all time best films ever made. As well before the days of special effects, CGI, and 3-D Spielberg did his best making this film with scenes of a mechanical shark. And the film is suspense filled as most scenes don't show the shark directly attacking the victims, yet it's often the things that are hidden and underneath that are the most terrifying like an underwater great white. And most memorable is the pulsating original theme score from the film, you've heard it many times as it just carries the suspense and drama of the film along so well.Based on Peter Benchley's novel(I must say a must read)\"Jaws\" is set in a New England northeastern island resort town of Amity. And all of a sudden unexpected bodies float ashore and deaths are reported. And the worst fears of the ocean have come to service a great white shark is responsible. So enter the town's sheriff stressed out Chief Brody(wonderfully played by Roy Scheider)and upon his assumptions and investigations he's meet with resistance and protest from the town mayor Mr. yes man and the politically corrupt Mayor Vaughn(well done by Murray Hamilton)as it's better to lie about shark attacks to the citizens for fear of losing money as people will not want to vacation in Amity if reports of shark attacks are true. Brody does the best to cope with it with support from wife Ellen(Lorraine Gary).Still matters need to be taken further so enter two problem solver helpers one in the form of Sam Quint(Robert Shaw)a weathered and crazy odd ball shark hunter who's methods are unorthodox and then to complete the twosome it's young hotshot educated marine scientist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss). And along the way this film turns into a suspenseful adventure of shark hunting that's helped by the wonderful and pulsating score it just keeps you on the edge of your seat, as in the end your happy to be served a big great white lunch with the death of Jaws! Overall a film classic one of the 70's better pictures and one of cinemas better suspense thrillers. Well remembered for it's strong and pulsating score which moved the drama and suspense of the film along so well. And the way the scenes were shot Spielberg made many of them hidden and suspenseful by doing them underwater proving what you can't see is most often the most dangerous just like the opening sequence of Chrissy's death. And the way that Steven shot the film even though tough and difficult by filming water scenes and moving the camera a lot on boat was well done and his working of the mechanical shark takes a big bite out of today's special effects and CGI and 3-D works. Really probably Steven Spielberg's best. \"Jaws\" is a very memorable cinema classic, one of the all time best films.",

            "content": "The terror. The music. The actors. The dialogue.THE SHARK! Those elements sparked a newfound interest in the nature vs. man genre back in 1975 when \"Jaws\" was first released.It follows the story of a man named Brody (Roy Scheider), the sherriff in a pleasant little town named Amity, which is seated right by the ocean. Nothing ever happens in Amity. It is the same little routine every day for Brody. Wake up, go to work, come home, go to bed, wake up, go to work, etc... But all that changes in one moment of disbelief.But after some vicious incidents occur in the water outside his town and home, Brody investigates and finds that the killings were no boating accidents, but shark attacks. After calling in marine biologist Matt Harper (Richard Dreyfuss) and hiring a mysterious man named Quint (Robert Shaw), Brody takes to the seas to hunt for the Great White Shark...and defeat it.Steven Spielberg got his big break directing this film. It brought him to fame and he since went on to create many more popular movies, including \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and such. But it is his direction that makes this film's tension work so well. Granted, the reason the shark was never shown was because the fake shark robots wouldn't work, but even if they had shown the shark in the beginning, Spielberg still does good here.John Williams' score is quite possibly one of the best film scores ever performed, ranking right up there with \"Psycho\" and Alan Silvestri's \"Back to the Future\" theme. It is moving, frightening, and all around completely emotional. The thing that is most impressive about the score is that it revolves around a few keys on a piano being hit over and over and over again.Roy Scheider quite possibly gives his best performance ever in this film. He has dropped out of the limelight lately, not being in any films as of recent; but everyone will remember his performance as Brody in this film. Always.Richard Dreyfuss is also at the top of his game here. I think it is interesting to note that like Scheider, Dreyfuss has not been in many films recently. Maybe it's post-\"Jaws\" effect. I'm not sure. But I know that the only time I've seen a performance as good as his in this film was a little comedy with Bill Murray called \"What About Bob,\" which is an excellent comedy.I read the novel \"Jaws\" by Peter Benchley, and it is one of the few novels where the movie is better. Benchley lost my interest halfway through the book when he stopped talking about the shark at all. He introduces it in the beginning, and uses it a little at the end, but most of the story is all about character development and has nothing to do whatsoever with a great white.That is what is so nice about the film. It keeps character development going while keeping interest in - and not letting the audience forget about - the shark out in the water.All in all, \"Jaws\" is one of the best films ever made. It easily combines horror, comedy, thriller, mystery, comedy and drama into one little bundle called a film. It's a masterfully crafted thriller that never stops delivering.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",

            "content": "The best way to start my review of \"Jaws\" is to just get right to it and say that this film is one of the greatest movies ever made. I love this movie, and that is that. Located somewhere in the northeast, the fictional town of Amity is run by a bureaucratic city council that has tunnel vision with nothing but the bottom line of dollars and cents in mind. The deputy is lost in his mind and the sheriff is one Martin Brody, a man who hates the water but lives on an island. \"It's only an island if you look at it from a boat\" Brody says. Amity also has a shark problem. A 25 ft long Great White shark has just staked a claim off the coastal waters of the island, and the shark has decided to feed on hapless beach goers.Sheriff Brody wants to shut the beaches down until the matter can be resolved with the proper shark experts, but the mayor and city council fear that shutting the beaches down will impact the vital summer tourist economy of Amity. It doesn't matter how many people get devoured by the shark, the people in charge don't want to lose their summer dollars. The beaches must remain open and Brody is in a constant volleying act between the suits that run Amity and the shark itself. This film is what I consider to be one of the first \"modern\" movies. It was made in 1975 and it simply feels much more modern then anything that came before it. Filled with one liners, this is an action movie that predates the current action flick genre. The plot is fantastic and the acting is excellent. But not only did this film have a well oiled story that was tightly directed, and an esteemed cast of actors, but the film had such a profound impact on pop culture that will be timeless. Jaws is loaded with quotable fun lines that resonates and stays with you: \"You yell barracuda and everyone says 'hunh, what'?. You yell SHARK, and we got a panic on our hands on the 4th of July\".\"We're gonna need a bigger boat\".\"That's one bad hat Harry\".\"I don't think you're going to understand this problem until it swims up and bites you in the ASS!\" The line I quoted for my summary heading is probably my favorite, just because it adds insight into the mentality of the sleaze bag mayor of Amity. Mayor Vaughn is out to protect the financial interests of his town and he views the brash young oceanographer Matt Hooper as someone who has arrived in Amity with nothing but his own rich boy interests working for him . Hooper couldn't possibly be here to do anything but lobby himself for a possible National Graphic cover could he? The notion that Hooper would want to help Brody protect the people of Amity doesn't even seem to cross Vaugh's mind. No Hooper must be here to be a glory hound and nothing else. Such is the mindset of the bureaucrats that run Amity. The mechanical shark in Jaws (nickamed \"Bruce\") reportedly would not work very well for director Steven Spielberg, subsequently Spielberg resorted to point of view shots to achieve the terror he desired. This was an inspired piece of genius, far better then actually seeing the shark. The shark later is represented by an assortment of different floating objects, from dock piers, yellow keg barrels, and of course it's own dorsal tail fin. We don't always see the animal, but we are convinced it is there. When we finally do see the shark towards the end of the picture, it doesn't matter that it looks fake as hell, it's real within the context of the movie and that's all that matters. Probably the aspect of this film is bringing together three different characters to take part in the journey of man vs. nature. Brody is the level headed family man, Hooper is the intellectual college grad, and Quint is the gruff old seamen with his own vendetta against sharks. Perhaps the single best moment of the movie is near the end when the shark has 3 barrels attached to him but still won't drown, the engine of the ship is burnt out and Quint calmly comes out and throws a couple of life preservers to Brody and Hooper. Quint however does not put HIS life preserver on (because of his own creepy tale with sharks). Quint knows very well what sharks can do to a man and this moment all 3 men realize the ship is sinking and they are running out of options. Just a fantastically shot and brilliantly acted moment. I was born on July 3rd of the year this film was released, and every 4th of July it has become a habit of mine to watch this film. Watch this film, and don't hold the mechanical shark against it, I promise you won't regret it.",

There's one main reason why this works, and that's because it's one of the very few films that uses a well-known and believable human fear for its thrills. The idea of a huge shark or sea creature attacking us when we're completely vulnerable is a scary notion, and this here plays this up to perfection taking us right there with the victims when the shark's about to attack. This gives a chilling sense of fear of the sea and also helps to give the moments where the shark is there but unseen a reason to believe it is. The several beach attacks are the best examples of this, which are some of the better scenes in the film featuring the shark attacking the swimmers on the beach or the second attack in the adjacent pond where the realism of having a giant creature invading recreational waters and prey on defenseless humans is a truly scary feeling. These are mostly helped with the most innovative technique where we're right up there in the face of danger with the camera- work, and it causes most of the film's biggest scares from the up- close-and-intimate work during the attacks to the sweeping vistas out at sea. The film's high-point is the ending fight against the shark which takes place entirely out to sea which is a series of innovative, interesting and logical events to destroy the creature, and everything in here is a joy to behold. From the cage assault to the barrel sequences to the beginning stages of hunting it down, every scene here scores wonderfully and it's got everything needed to enjoy the sequence. The lulls are eminently watchable, there's tons of fast-paced action and every step is also logically done which is perhaps the greatest plus as they're totally believable. It's a long, drawn-out affair, making sure that time is taken with it so as to make sure that the shark comes off as a strong, imposing threat to the group, which it is, and that every resource imaginable must be thrown at it to bring it down. The last big plus is its great score, which is simple, catchy and really manages to drive up the tension, making the scares work wonders. All these make this a simply wonderful film. There are only a few relatively minor problems associated with this one. The main one is that the shark doesn't look that good. When the shark is on-screen long enough to get a good look at it, it's biologically different since the snout is way too pointed compared to a real shark and the creature's upper lips don't retract when biting. The last big problem is that this so easily features implausible scenes simply for scares. The attack on the cage is a sterling example, as even though it's a great-looking, action-packed scene, sharks don't exhibit that kind of behavior which is what gives it away. These are the only real flaws in this one.Rated PG: Graphic Violence, Language, Brief Full Nudity and children in danger.",

            "content": "We've all heard people say \"Oh the book is far better than the film\", and in most cases this is true. However, there are always exceptions to the rule. 'Misery' by Stephen King is a great book but a superb movie, 'The Godfather' by Mario Puzo is a brilliant novel, but the movie adaptation is far superior, and is even considered by many, to be one of the finest movies ever made. There are a few other movies that have been far better and more compelling than the book too, including 'Jaws' by Peter Benchley. Some novels are so absorbing that they are hard to put down once you get into them, 'Jaws' however, isn't. It is a good book, but I believe it's one of those novels you could read on a long-haul flight, or while lazing by the pool on holiday. The story is quite slow moving, the characters are not very likable in anyway, and there are sub-plots that are so ridiculous that it's hard to stop yourself skipping bits just to get to the 'exciting' parts involving the shark. The movie, on the other hand, was exciting, well structured, omitted the ludicrous sub-plots, made the three main protagonists far more interesting, and of course the score was magnificent (instantly elevating the films suspense level, which obviously couldn't be achieved in print). The film, directed by Stephen Spielberg, was released in 1975 and has now become considered as the 'father' of the 'classic' summer-blockbuster movie, achieving awards and honours and frequently being classed as one of the greatest movies of all time. It also genuinely terrified people so much, that it kept some beach goers out of the water for a couple of years after it's release. 'Jaws' is set on the small island of Amity and opens with a young girl, Chrissie Watkins, being killed while taking a night-time swim, and following the coroner's report that it was a shark attack, local police Chief Martin Brody insists the beaches be closed until the animal is destroyed. Unfortunately the Mayor of the town, insisting that the death was a one off incident and the shark has probably moved on, refuses to agree to Brody's demand as Amity is a popular tourist spot, and with the town filling up with summer visitors and 4th of July holidaymakers, the closure of the beaches will cause financial ruin to the town. However, during the 4th of July weekend another killing takes place, this time of a young local boy, causing mass panic. After being blamed for not taking more severe action following the death of Chrissie Watkins, Chief Brody along with marine biologist Matt Hooper and local shark hunter Quint, set out to kill the shark. There are great and suspenseful moments scattered throughout the movie, and the score by John Williams adds to that. The two-note 'shark's theme' is used so well as the implication of an on-coming threat, that we don't even see the shark properly until about 1 hour 20 minutes into a 2 hour film, but we know it's there. The 'theme' has become so familiar now, it is widely used to imply the unwanted arrival of anything sinister. Roy Scheider's performance as Chief Brody gives the character far more vulnerability and humour than the Chief Brody of the book. Matt Hooper is played brilliantly by Richard Dreyfuss and, in probably one of his finest screen performances, Robert Shaw is gruff sea captain and shark hunter Quint. There are a few genuinely stand-out scenes in the film. Of course everyone remembers the 'chumming' scene when we first get to see the shark, and the reaction and horror on Brody's face as he backs into the cabin on the boat and tells Quint \"You're gonna need a bigger boat\" (which was apparently not in the script and ad-libbed by Scheider on the spot).There are notable differences between the book and the film. The two main sub-plots of the book as I said, are thankfully excluded from the movie. In the novel, the reasoning behind the Mayor's insistence to keep the beaches open isn't anything to do with keeping the summer tourists flocking in to keep the town's businesses going but that he has dealings with the Mafia and is afraid of the land values going down if the town is ruined, yes it's as daft as that. All the characters in the book are instantly unlikable. Hooper is an arrogant snob and the other sub-plot in the book, involved an affair between Hooper and Brody's wife Ellen, which would not only last for page after page, but would go into so much detail it was almost nauseating rather than stimulating. In the film Brody, Hooper and even the gruff Quint are actually quite likable. When reading the novel you actually find yourself on the shark's side.OK, if I had any negative points about the film it would be that by today's special effects standards, the close ups of the shark are visibly very fake (there are though underwater long-shots of a real Great White Shark), but given the decade this film was made, it is easy to over-look that part given the quality of the rest of the film. The movie is easily one of my personal favourites and, in my opinion, is a must for any DVD collection.",

All the shark killings in the first hour of Steven Spielberg's \"Jaws\" have the same mentality of the slasher movies that became vogue sometime in the late '70s. But this is what sold tickets--and made Peter Benchley's source novel a huge bestseller--yet the carnage isn't so much scary as it is depressing, and Spielberg displays no remorse for the victims (he's too anxious to show severed limbs). Police chief Roy Scheider, scientist Richard Dreyfuss and bounty hunter Robert Shaw sail out to capture the shark, and the machismo and male-camaraderie turn the film into something headier: a character study with art-film flourishes (and indeed, some of those shots from the fishing vessel are beautifully done). It's a gripping, compelling film without being a lot of fun. Dreyfuss' brainy nerd gets laughs, though his nonchalant sarcasm is overplayed (and his final act re-emergence is a crowd-pleasing though dunderheaded move); Scheider is a terrific Everyman who isn't afraid to sink into the background; and Shaw is dead-on in his bloodthirsty portrayal of a hunter obsessed. **1/2 from ****",

Roy Shieder plays a sheriff of the town and Richard Dreyfuss plays a marine biologist of sorts.  There is great tension throughout the movie and some good comedy here and there as well. The shark attack scenes are pretty good too, especially the one when you see the shark go for the one guy after the kids boat is tipped over.  The first part of the movie is the town, and the second is the boat scenes and them tracking the shark.

            "review_title": "A cultural phenomenon of the best kind",
            "content": "The 1970s was a transitional period for Hollywood and American society. Failure to win Vietnam and the shame of Watergate prompted a reassessment of America. The moral certainties of old Hollywood were now irrelevant. In late 60's a new group of directors emerged to fill the vacuum. Their influences were other films. They were the movie brats. And the only one of them to achieve sustained unbroken success was Steven Spielberg. He is the most commercially successful filmmaker of all time, with an unerring instinct for the modern mainstream. He has converted his filmmaking powers to unprecedented corporate power in Hollywood. But while his commercial success is indisputable he has suffered much criticism; chiefly that his films are childish in their viewpoint. He positions himself in the cosy Middle-American ideological mainstream and presented issues in morally simplistic terms. His movies were full of sentimentality, moral certainties and special effects wizardry. He made Schindler's List partly with a view to address the accusation that he was not a serious filmmaker. But to be perfectly honest, whether you agree with this viewpoint or not the fact remains that Steven Spielberg directed Jaws. And that will be something that no one can ever take away from him. Jaws remains one of the most iconic, timeless, suspenseful and brilliant films ever made.It was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon on release. Not only in that it terrified a generation of people from going anywhere near the ocean but it had a profound and lasting effect on the movie industry. It was the biggest money maker of all time on release and it instigated a Hollywood production strategy that has been geared towards summer blockbusters ever since. It ushered in the era where marketing campaigns often cost more than the movie itself; while it was also the first film to be released via saturation booking, forever changing exhibition strategy. For better or for worse, Jaws changed the way the industry did business.But it would be enormously unfair to blame Jaws for the blockbuster phenomena. It was just by chance that this movie about a killer shark was the monumental success it was. In many ways this was a sister film to Spielberg's earlier movie Duel. Where that movie pitted an everyman against a malevolent truck driver, Jaws adopted the same basic idea but made the villain a great white shark. Jaws is essentially a horror movie because the creature in this film does not behave in the way any shark would. Here, the shark is given a malevolent evil intelligence that makes it behave in an almost supernatural way. It operates along the same lines as a maniac from a stalk and slash horror film. Moreover, the killing of the sexually liberated girl at the beginning of the film is very much in line with the conservative ethos of the slasher films that would follow in its wake. The price of immorality is evidently death in the universe of Jaws too.Spielberg manipulates the audience brilliantly by keeping the shark off the screen for a long time. Instead John Williams extraordinarily effective music is used to signify the presence of the monster. There are a series of scenes of incredible suspense where the fear of the unknown are played to the maximum, such as the opening killing and the attack on the two night fishermen. When the shark does finally appear it is nowhere near as rubbish looking as many claim. Despite being clearly fake you always believe in it. This is the power of Jaws.Spielberg's preoccupation with suburbia is very evident here. Amity is a small community put under siege by an alien enemy. This deadly foreign presence threatens this suburban idyll. Does Amity = America? Who can say for sure but there is no question about the parallels to Watergate in the town mayor's repeated attempt to cover up the scandal for his own self-interest. Political corruption was everywhere in 70's American movies, and here is no exception.Masculinity and class is represented in three types here. There is the abrasive and working class Quint, the intellectual and wealthy Hooper and the even-handed and middle class Brody. Despite their antagonistic relationship Quint and Hooper have much more in common with each other than with Brody. They share expertise despite the class divide. But seeing as this is the world according to Spielberg, narrative logic dictates that Brody - the man of the suburbs - will provide the sane middle ground that will ultimately prevail. His motivation is born of concern for the community, he is a family man with self-doubt; he does what he does out of a sense of duty not for selfish reasons. The everyman triumphs against evil.Jaws does crystallise the world view of Steven Spielberg. But where in some of his other films this perspective is coated with a saccharine feel, it is simply not the case here. Jaws is a thrilling film, with three dimensional characters. It terrified a generation of cinema-goers in the 70's and remains one of the genuinely great blockbusters. It never gets old.",

This sequence shows up in the second half, where most of the film's tension is. And the cinematography in this second half is quite good.But overall \"Jaws\" is a silly, made-for-kids adventure that is not remotely plausible. The shark keeps coming back to the crew's boat, as if the shark is out for revenge. Referring to the shark, Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), the third of three crew members, says: \"he's chasing us; I don't believe it.\" No, I don't believe it either. Natural predators are not capable of revenge.Of course, to advance the plot and keep the audience engaged, the unlikable and stupid three-man crew does all the wrong things. On-board chaos results. But the film's shallow (pardon the pun) premise and plot sells the popcorn, no \"deep\" themes needed.The story setup is way too long. Lots of talky dialogue, crowds of beached whales (or rather sunbathers), a parade, and a greedy mayor who is more of a villain than the shark render a boring first half. Director Spielberg could have used the shark to chop off most of the script's first half.\"Jaws\" is a big budget Hollywood production with some tension out on the open waters. And it has some good underwater footage. But a too simplistic premise, precious little subtext, vapid setup, and unlikable, overwrought characters sink the film into the dregs, the production appeal veering sharply toward viewers pacified by frothy, Disney-ish cheese.",

But he did achieve success by deriving all of his imagery from even lesser sources and convincing audiences they were seeing something new. The lower the overhead cost, the greater the net profit, and this is where he first raked it in.There's nothing complex here. He simply uses the eye of \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\", and gives Amity and its birdbrain inhabitants the mechanics and IQ of so many 50s monster flicks. This is relatively good compared to the rest of his catalog, because the narrative is held together by someone else - here, the writer - who simply usurps the \"Moby Dick\" story...right down to the \"Farewell and adieu...\"...Shaw's Quint as Ahab. The absurdity works because of the Williams score which is straight out of the \"Psycho\" playbook; also the rubber shark (\"Bruce\") was uncooperative half of the time; it surely saved this by forcing Spielberg to show less of the creature. He had to tighten the tension in other ways. Although this is cheap and simple, that's what makes it ideal for commercial consumption. Just don't call it art - that began and pretty much ended with \"Duel\".",

            "content": "The beach resort town of Amity Island has a spate of shark attacks and police chief Brody battles with civic authorities and local businesses over how to deal with the situation.Jaws is a classic film of the late twentieth century that (along with Star Wars) pretty much invented the modern blockbuster by combining a simple story with clearly defined characters, high production values and lots of entertaining spectacle.The story is a simple as it gets. A great big unseen leviathan is striking fear into heart of a community and a group of heroes go on a mission to save everyone. It contains a number of interesting underlying themes such as the threat of capitalism, mistrust of authorities, class conflict and the manifestation of fear. These are all shown during the interactions between various characters.There are a number of classic scenes such as the infamous opening attack sequence, the numerous beach scenes, the wreck dive and pretty much the entirety of the final seafaring chapter. My personal favourite is when Brody, Quint and Hooper bond over a few drinks aboard the Orca and Robert Shaw delivers one epically good monologue.The shark scenes are ingeniously put together. Most of the terror is unseen and translated through John Williams' famous theme and the reaction of people. When we do see the shark it does look fake but the movie is so well edited that I easily suspended my disbelief.All performances are top drawer. Roy Schneider is terminally stressed but electric as Brody. Lorraine Gary is naturalistic as Ellen Brody and the two have great husband and wife chemistry. Richard Dreyfuss is full of cocky, youthful exuberance as Hooper. Robert Shaw is perfect as the cynical, working class, sea-dog Quint. Murray Hamilton is an edgy, frustrating antagonist as Mayor Larry Vaughn.Jaws is a product of its time and a clear downside to the movie was its impact on people's perception of sharks. That coupled with an unfortunate rise in the amount of sharks hunted following its release is a sad indictment of the human race. This for me somewhat tinged the legacy of a near masterpiece from Spielberg.That being said it is a movie I never tire of watching and is as effective today as it has ever been. For me it's one of the few movie adaptations of a novel that is superior to its source material.",

Even its rating has been lowered for today's youth.To be honest the special effects which seemed so terrifying now look quite comical (The ending, when the shark flops on to the boat and chomps Robert shaw, looks kind of like a giant grey rubber dildo).

But when Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw) are on the \"Orca\", the shark pops up without warning; this prompts Brody to suggest getting a larger boat. There was also a good contrast between the two sailors and Brody: both Quint and Hooper had scars from being attacked by sharks, while hydrophobic Brody had no scars. Of course, the real star is the shark. He is one bad mother, but he made Steven Spielberg what the latter is today, so it all balances out.Do you feel like going swimming now?",

A mainstream Horror movie about sharks was an idea that was begging for a release, but only someone as great as Spielberg could produce it in such a flawless way.The best thing about \"Jaws\" is the direction in my opinion. The camera does the job for the killer shark. I mean, you don't need to see it in order to be scared. That's the best thing about \"Jaws\". The terror that is created is thanks to Spielberg's direction.But also the plot is excellent. A simple, common idea was taken to a new level of creativity. The f/x are great, amazing. This is the real shark to fear of. Also, what can be said about the classical score? It's simply amazing and it's a part of cinema history. The score plays an important part in the movie's creepy atmosphere. Also, the acting is top notch and lead by high profile actors. You can't get a better cast, director, and musical producer than in \"Jaws\".There isn't too much to spoil. In fact, if you haven't seen the movie please watch it not only if you like the idea. \"Jaws\" is a great movie in all aspects. Forget about it's Horror label. The movie stands alone and that's why it's been respected for many generations. In these days \"JAWS\" is overrated but believe me, believe the hype towards it. The concept is thrlled and clich\u00e8d but it's effective. The ocean hasn't been the same since this movie. A movie that has scared, and impressed many generations. I have to admit that when I was a child, I had nightmares before going to the beach on vacations. I was terrified by this movie when I was on a boat or swimming. So my advice is, don't show this movie to your kids! ;)",

Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw give the performances of their careers. Let's not forget the underrated Murray Hamilton as the Mayor. He brings sympathy to a part that most would have played as a straight-up mustache-twirling heavy. Despite all the variations and ripoffs through the years, Jaws hasn't been matched. That's because it's not just a movie about a killer shark. It's a movie about people. All of the imitators seem to forget that and just try to make a movie about a shark or bear or fill-in-the-blank-animal killing as many people as possible in gruesome ways.

I would know it would be a fact that sharks would be one of the most feared killer animals we would ever have. I would thought alligators would be the top one. Steven Spielberg has made a success with this movie, it was not only filled with depth, but also intrigue, wonder, and of course horror. It seems that the great white has given a bad rep for its ferocity, but it's our own fear that really does that. In order to give the respects of the shark it to understand them like snakes, the non-poisonous ones, this idea wouldn't get so twisted. However, there has been shark attacks in the past, and this movie is just another scare factor just to keep us out of the water.

            "content": "I was probably too young for Jaws the first time I saw it. I was only 9 years old, and I guess my parents had forgotten the surprising amount of blood and terror it contains when they got it from the video/dvd rental place to watch. Though to be fair, they would have been 9 or 10 upon its initial release, and may have had fond memories of watching it as a child too.It's not horrifically inappropriate for maybe older children, but it probably wouldn't be able to get away with a PG rating these days. Anyway, I don't think it traumatised me too much. I have stronger memories of genuinely liking the film as a child rather than being made scared of ever swimming at the beach because of it. And as I've revisited it every so often as I got older- once in my late teens, and now recently as a 25 year old- it's still not truly scary to me, just very, very tense. And I think that's more than enough.Spielberg knows how to do suspense like few others; I think it's one of his greatest strengths as a director. With Jaws and Jurassic Park, he proved himself just as capable of great suspense sequences as the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock (yep, I said it, and I genuinely believe it too). Jaws may be even more impressive than Jurassic Park because it was done with a smaller budget, and also done earlier in Spielberg's career, when his lack of experience you'd think would make the quality of the film suffer.However, that's not the case. Jaws was brilliantly made for its time and remains almost flawless on the technical front 45 years later. There was one instance of noticeably distracting ADR, as well as a really awkward scene transition late in the film that I noticed as minor flaws. Also: some people do criticise the shark effects. Honestly, I think they look good. Even when they start to show the shark a whole lot more during the film's climax, I do sincerely buy it. It's not perfect, and I'm sure if I focused all my attention on the shark to look for imperfections, I could find some. But I think it was handled well, and the much publicised limitations of the shark leading to it simply being shown less is a fantastic example of how creative individuals can turn one of their weaknesses or disadvantages into one of their strengths.There are things that everyone praises about Jaws: the music, the pacing, the typically clean and efficient directing from Spielberg, the acting, and the engaging, memorable main characters. I'll gladly raise my hand and say that I'm also of the opinion that all those things are great, but when it comes to somewhat less praised aspects of the movie, I'd like to add just how much I love the simplicity of it all. Almost every scene concerns the shark, and preventing (or failing to prevent) it from doing more damage to the town's population. It's so direct, and so straightforward, and the fact we get as much characterisation for some of these characters as we do- when the main thing on all their minds is the shark- is impressive. Once the climax is over, there could well be a lengthy, frustratingly drawn out epilogue, and you almost expect it, but nope: the film comes to a swift and immensely satisfying end, not lasting a second longer than it needs to. It's borderline jarringly abrupt, perhaps, but I love it. Jaws is a movie that knows exactly what it wants to do and how to do it, and it doesn't waste a single second of your time doing so.The mild technical problems here and there are the only nitpicks keeping this back from an absolutely perfect score. Jaws is a masterpiece of blockbuster entertainment that has aged surprisingly well, and another absolute classic from Spielberg. Whoever you are, whatever you usually watch, no matter what genres you do or don't generally like: if you haven't yet watched Jaws in all its glory, try to amend that as soon as possible. It's a monster movie with a monstrously good reputation for so many reasons, after all.",

            "content": "Blockbuster is a bit of a dirty word in \"serious\" film commentary. It gets associated with base commercialism, the motion picture as mere product, simple fare with no long-term appeal. But such an assessment does a disservice to the savvy filmmakers who make the hits, as well as the movie-going public who make the box office figures. You can fake art house sophistication, but you can't fake popular approval.Jaws was adapted by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb from Benchley's best-selling novel. In many ways it follows the book closely, but there are some key differences. In the novel the mayor was being pressured by the mafia, and bizarrely enough there was a subplot in which Hooper has an affair with Brody's wife. With these aspects gone we have a story stripped of anything that may introduce a different tone - anything that might have been the focus of another story in its own right. The plot and dialogue are succinct and direct, especially in the earlier scenes. This is not a picture that wastes time getting itself going.And a lot of the racy pacing is down to director Steven Spielberg. Like John Ford before him, Spielberg has great economy of expression, often working two ideas into a single shot. In Roy Scheider's first scene, we get Scheider on the phone in the foreground while his wife tends to their son's injured hand in the background. The details of the phone call aren't important, we just need to know that it happened, and thus Spielberg can afford to balance it with something that demonstrates the significance of our hero's family life. The tenderness Scheider feels towards his two boys is the closest this picture comes to having a subplot, and it is something largely brought out by Spielberg. For example, scenes like the one in which the younger son imitates Scheider's every move were improvised at the director's behest.But more than conciseness, Jaws has dynamism and punch. Like another ace director of the previous generation, Victor Fleming, Spielberg encourages performances that really move. Take a scene like Richard Dreyfuss's inspection of the first victim. Rather than a professional study, the scene is staged like a heated argument, the actors waving their arms and snapping out their lines. Almost always there is movement \u2013 characters walk as they talk, or stand before a busy crowd. The few moments of stillness \u2013 Scheider with his family, the stirring Indianapolis speech \u2013 are those of subtle significance, and their calmness helps them stand out.Of course Spielberg didn't operate in a vacuum. The invigorating style of Jaws is aided immensely by the tight editing of Verna Fields. Fields uses techniques of the art film \u2013 jump cuts, rapid edits \u2013 but with the difference that her use of them is purely functional, never attention-grabbing or stylistic, and as such she disguises her cuts to make them blend in like finest mise-en-scene. Take the beach scene where Scheider scans the seascape, fearful of another shark attack. Most of the cuts take place as an extra walks across the screen, softening them so that we barely realise the angles are changing.And it all works of course. Take this kind of professionalism, and you can make an exciting, box-office busting thriller about a shark, a dinosaur, a killer truck or whatever. This is why, when all those rip-off shark flicks began to appear (and I don't just mean the Jaws sequels \u2013 the more recent Shark Attack franchise makes the Jaws offshoots look like masterpieces) they were invariably awful. They took the premise, killer-sharks-versus-humans, thinking that alone could make a hit. These are the true lowest-common-denominator cash-in trash. If a movie gets audiences flocking in to see it in phenomenal numbers, it surely must be a high-quality piece of entertainment.",

While the sequels may have got increasingly stupid and poor, the original was always one of those great classics that you really feel like you grew up with and had a special place for, and that was and still is so well deserved to this day, because it holds up so tremendously well. It was the first movie ever to cross the hundred million dollar mark and its hand in creating the summer blockbuster pretty much means that its influence on contemporary cinema cannot be overstated. Something that's so great about the movie's appeal and the craftsmanship put into it is its continued ability to thrill and terrify audiences despite having few overt appearances of the Great White shark, which also work amazingly well because the result is actually much scarier than if the mechanical shark had worked well enough for it to be shown throughout the whole movie. Young Spielberg knew just how to use that shark sparingly but effectively, using the iconic score, shadows, camera angles, and mostly just the acting chops of a fine cast to raise the tension and menace of the lurking aquatic predator to nightmarish levels. The keen focus on the characters and their story and interactions heightens the shark as a deadly force of nature. The infamous opening scene remains incredibly chilling, not least because of the disturbing performance of the beautiful young naked lady but also because it's a case of what we're not seeing being more shocking than what we do. One of the most deeply gripping and suspenseful moments in the film comes not from action, but from dialogue. RIP Robert Shaw, you sir gave one of the all-time great horror movie monologues! Thrilling, scary, atmospheric and cinematic, it inspired many animal attack movie imitators at the time but none of them really ever held a candle to it, and while there may have been one of two good examples over the years, the only truly great killer shark movie and great/granddaddy of them all remains Jaws, it's the best one of all time. For all the trouble they had making it, it was certainly all worth it, for the end result was always an amazing film. Gotta love it, good old Jaws... X",

For a long time, I've been wanting to watch the full movie and now that I have, I can tell you one thing. This movie hasn't aged that well.When you look at other timeless classics such as Star Wars, Spielberg's Indiana Jones, Alien, E.T and so on, they certainly have aged very well and still are certainly watchable and can either be feared or called \"epic\" Unfortunately, the same cannot go for Jaws, at least in my belief.As I was watching this movie, I was so impressed with the first half of the movie, the build up where a few people get killed and they attempt to close all beaches that I couldn't wait for the final part of the movie. The first half contained everything a movie needs; great buildup to a movie. Remember, the Empire Strikes Back. We watched 90 minutes of build up before the Luke vs Vader duel. Remember Helm's Deep from Lord of the Rings? We had a lot of build up to the final battle. Same went for Return of the King; the first half of the movie was all build up to the epic conclusion. The problem with Jaws for me is that the first half gets me so excited to see how everything will conclude that once it did, it was thoroughly disappointing.What I meant with \"It hasn't aged well\" is that by now, the shark really looks pretty bad and unrealistic. However, we can appreciate all the trouble Spielberg went to get the shark to come onto the big screen back in '75. Also, the acting is good and the story is good but another little issue is that John Williams' soundtrack to the movie doesn't add much tone anymore.Maybe I over hyped the movie but the ending seemed so sudden. When Hooper finally goes underwater to see the shark, there was only 10 minutes of the movie left. Also, back then, this movie may have been an absolute masterpiece and true horror but now, the story of a shark killing people is kind of stupid. That isn't to necessarily say I found it stupid. I didn't. But its another example of why this movie hasn't aged all that well. Whilst Hooper and Brody are good characters, Quint isn't necessarily the same.Jaws may be regarded as a cult classic but whilst this movie is great in its first half the final half of the movie to me is a massive let down and extremely slow. Disappointing movie unfortunately for me.",

The plot of course revolves around the humongous shark that is terrorizing the small coastal town of Amity. The characters that the film focuses on is Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss. They are the men that ultimately end up going up against this beast of the water. There are certain things I liked about this one. One of those things is the casting, I thought the actors did a good job with the material.The writing is also well done, the dialogue is important, because most of it is about the shark and determining what's to be done about it. But if I'm being honest, my favorite part of the film is the atmospheric aspect of it all. The atmosphere plays a big role in the effectiveness. The atmosphere and the music are probably the two most memorable and important parts of Jaws. The opening sequence combines those two things perfectly! The film is fun, exciting, and overall well made. I'll admit that I don't love it to the extent that most probably do. It's not on my favorites list, but it's still good. 8/10 for Jaws.",

            "content": "The film \"Jaws\" actually consists of two story's.The second story is the story of the hunt. This story builds on \"Moby Dick\" (1956, John Huston). In effect the character of Quint in Jaws resembles to a great extent that of Captain Ahab in Moby Dick. The attraction of the second story is the interaction between the totally different old sailor Quint (Robert Shaw), Brody (Roy Scheider) as the local sheriff who is afraid of water and the scientific Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss). Spielberg takes his time to introduce these characters to us. The best scene in the second story is the one in which the three of them sit slightly drunk in the cabin of the boat, bragging about their scars and the heroic stories behind them. This scene is also a well timed interlude between all the actions scenes in the second story.The first story is the story of Amity Island, and how the local tourist industry does not want to face the facts about the shark. For the mayor of the city the interests of the local economy far outweight the risks for the tourists. After the first casualty he succeeds in convincing the sheriff to not shutt down the beach and only after the second casualty action is taken. The best scene of this story is between the first and the second casualty. The sheriff knows the danger, the beach guests do not. The sheriff tries to be as alert as possible, the beach guests are whining about details.In this scene at the beach Spielberg shows his mastery as a storyteller. He uses striking swimwear to draw our attention to specifc beach guests. He uses a cameratechnique of zooming out / tracking forward when the inevitable accident finally strikes. I only know this cameratechnique from \"Vertigo\" (1958, Alfred Hitchcock), in this film to illustrate the fear of height of Scottie.\"Jaws\" was the breakthrough-film of Spielberg. It was also the breakthrough of the summer blockbuster (summer was up till then considered a lukewarm filming season). During the production stage of Jaws the mechanical shark was not functioning well. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Spielberg decided in a lot of scenes not to show the shark directly but either indirectly or not at all. That suggestion is often more effective than images is known since \"Cat people\" (1942, Jacques Tourneur), \"Jaws\" reconfirmes this \"film law\" ones again.In the end \"Jaws\" is in my opinion the film of Sheriff Brody. In story 1 he succumbs under the pressure and does not take the necessary actions. For this he is reproached by the mother of the second casualty. In story 2 he overcomes his fear for water and is ultimately the one who eliminates the shark.",

            "content": "Is this the ultimate popcorn thriller or what? It's maybe the greatest Hitchcock film Hitchcock didn't direct, mixing elements of \"Psycho\" and \"The Birds\" and even a little \"Vertigo\" when the camera closes on Sheriff Brodie as the Kitner boy explodes in a smorgasbord of red foam and flailing limbs.It's not Hitchcock who directed this film, but some other guy who has gone on to do some other stuff. It's probably true that other stuff has sometimes been deeper (\"Close Encounters\"), more exciting (\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"), more gripping (\"Saving Private Ryan\"), or more fluid in mixing humor and horror (the first \"Jurassic Park\"). But \"Jaws\" was the most perfect movie Steven Spielberg ever made, as perfect and efficient an entertainment vehicle as Bruce was an eating machine.When this movie first came out, I wanted nothing to do with it. I was all of nine, and liked swimming on the beach. I saw the effect this movie had on kids who didn't want to swim out with me at the beach anymore. It wasn't until many years later that I saw the movie, and I was blown away. Not so much by the nasty shark attacks, though there are some shocking moments in this movie. I was shocked rather by the excellent acting, the absorbing plot, the whole story, even the spectacle of life in New England in the 1970s with all the bad bathing suits, ridiculous hair, and beach music like \"You're Having My Baby\" and \"I Honestly Love You.\" Oh, yeah, okay, those shark attacks are pretty special, too.There's some very good things in this movie, some great things, and then there's Robert Shaw, who's beyond everything. He manages to be both the dramatic heavy and comic relief, the glue behind the male bonding that centers the final third of the film. If Shaw wasn't so good, the whole finale would seem illogical (Why did he smash that radio? Why is he gunning that motor when the boat is clearly failing?) As his WWII story makes clear, he's wrestling with major league survivor's guilt, not to mention a desire to go mano-a-mano with the monster of his nightmares. He almost wills himself into the shark's maw with nothing but a machete in his hands.What a master of detail Spielberg is. He's like John Ford, so bored in on the humanity of every character, big and small, as epic in his scope, protean in his range, and even faster with his pacing. Every time I watch this movie, and I do so a lot, usually in the summer, I pick up on something else I really like. Maybe it's the vignettes of small-town coastal life, the anatomy lesson of a rickety vessel in distress, Mrs. Brodie's subtle goading of her husband, or Polly the slope-shouldered old lady and Brodie's receptionist who thinks a community crisis is when the nine-year-olds are \"karating\" the picket fences. John Williams' score is rousing and brilliant, not just during the shark attacks but the moments in between when he references sea chanties and the like. Killer cinematography, too. Did waters ever look so blue, or skies so brightly azure, as they do during the voyage of the Orca? Murray Hamilton's mayor is a wonderful minor character, right up to the moment he suddenly realizes the waters around him are too deep and bloody to negotiate any more. (\"My children were in that water, too.\")But it always comes back to Shaw and Quint. Great lines, great moments, great shots, quiet ones of him standing in the pulpit with his rifle, noisy ones of him laughing with Hooper and Brodie, even goofy ones of him using the chalkboard at Town Hall to make a point. Even Richard Dreyfus's nasal, cutsey whining becomes effective counterpoint when set against the barnacly bluster of Capt. Quint. Shame Shaw didn't survive the decade; he and Peter Sellers were the two most missed actors in the 1980s.This is as much a movie for the summer as \"It's A Wonderful Life\" is for Christmas. Even if you live in Nebraska, do yourself a favor one evening, pretend the cornfields outside are the raging Atlantic, and pop \"Jaws\" into your video machine. Forget Moby Dick. There's no better fish story on the planet.",

            "review_title": "Greatest nature-gone-wild film of all-time!",
            "content": "Steven Spielberg's classic film about a giant shark terrorizing a small New England resort community is masterful entertainment and also (along with \"Star Wars\") ushered in the age of the blockbuster film, essentially ending major studio support of smaller edgier films of the 1960s and 70s. I recently listened to an interview with Roger Corman, the prolific low budget exploration filmmaker, who noted that after he saw \"Jaws\" he said to himself that he's in trouble because the majors figured out what he'd know for years, in terms of what audiences wanted to see, and did it much better. An argument could pretty easily be made that this is the greatest nature-gone- wild movie ever made. \"Jaws\" truly is a great film, but when most of it's competition was the the likes of \"Frogs\" (about a deadly hoards of frogs) or \"Them\" (about giant radioactive ants) or \"Night of the Lepus\" (about giant killer rabbits), it shouldn't be much of a surprise \"Jaws\" wins out (okay, Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" is a pretty excellent nature-gone-wild film, but \"Jaws\" is still better). But back to \"Jaws,\" this is the film that put Spielberg on the map. Up to this point he'd mostly done television and had one film under his belt, the fine \"Sugarland Express,\" but \"Jaws\" is a popcorn movie of the first order. Roy Scheider is the Chief of Police for the sleepy beach community of Amity Island when he's confronted with a likely shark attack at the outset of tourist season. Murray Hamilton is great in a supporting role as the mayor who won't let Chief Brody shut down the beaches, that is until a horrific attack in front of legions of beachgoers. At that point Brody is authorized to enlist the help of young shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and crusty shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw). Brody, Hooper, and Quint are a wonderful trio of contrasts aboard Quint's ship as they hunt the giant great white shark. One early exchange between Hooper and Quint quickly sums up their relationship:Quint: You have city hands, Mr. Hooper. You been countin' money all your life. Hooper: All right, all right. Hey, I don't need this... I don't need this working-class-hero crap.And you have Brody, who lives on an island but doesn't ever go in the water, playing the level headed one of the trio who wants to be anywhere but on a boat. The character dynamics between the three are terrific fun to watch and lead to many memorable scenes and quips (\"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" or \"Cage goes in the water, you go in the water. Shark's in the water.\" or \"Slow ahead. I can go slow ahead. Come on down here and chum some of this sh-t.\" or \"I'm not going to waste my time arguing with a man who's lining up to be a hot lunch.\" and then there's the USS Indianapolis speech. Quint's tale (and character motivation) is a perfect marriage of acting, writing, and direction and is likely my favorite scene of the film. Robert Shaw is absolutely riveting as he tells his tale of his WWII naval vessel going down after being hit by Japanese submarine torpedoes and the men having to survive for days in the water as sharks preyed upon them. \"I'll never put on a life jacket again.\" There's been much discussion as to who wrote this scene, but according to Spielberg it was first written by playwright Howard Sackler, who wrote about three quarters of a page, and was then expanded by the great John Milius to about ten pages of dialogue, and lastly Shaw himself pared down Milius' work to what appears in the film. This has to be one of the all-time greatest moments committed to film. But the suspense Spielberg builds towards the end as the ship is slowing sinking while the three men struggle to figure out how to kill the shark and/or how to survive. The way the camera bobs up and down with the waves and how the camera gets lower and lower into the water as the boat slowly sinks is extremely effective in immersing the audience in the situation, especially if you've seen this film in a darkened theater on the big screen, where you nearly feel Brody's sea sickness, not to mention his terror as the shark gets closer and closer. But as fun this film is as a roller-coaster thrill ride, you also can't forget the quieter moments, such as the dinner table scene where Brody and his son silently mimic each other, which audiences would later realize is a moment of pure Spielberg. Or the smaller comic moments early in the film with Broday taking reports of kids from the karate class \"karate chopping\" the fences, perfectly establishing Chief Brody's usual police activities. Even these small moments all serve a purpose and there is not a wasted moment. Additional, no one could review this film without acknowledging the contribution of John Williams' iconic score. After watching the film I listen to Williams' score and found his heavy use of strings and even some of the themes very similar to Bernard Herrmann's score for \"Psycho.\" Overall, this film is an American film classic and is a must see for all audiences.",

And holy cow, do we care about these guys, and root for them tooth and nail 'til the very last reel. Even Shaw's obnoxious Quint, haunted by those desperate hours waiting for death or recovery from the Indianapolis, we come to admire and it truly hurts that one of these guys never makes it to the end zone.And Spielberg was right. Jaws would have been half the movie without THAT score.

I queued around the block, and didn't get in the first two times. Third time was the charm, and such was the impact of those two and a bit hours, that I would see Jaws a further 6 times that Summer at the theatre.

The movie would soon find more success on home video as being the first major movie to come out on laserdisc, and on TV airings where there was additional footage while being edited for tv. Three sequels as well as numerous video games and merchandise soon followed, as well as a memorable soundtrack that has been made fun of numerous times. This was Spielberg's first big hit, and the term blockbuster was coined as this movie came out in June of 1975 backed by a major tv ad campaign that didn't show the shark in real footage except at the very end with the poster and the film's rating, which could be pg-13 if it were remade today.",

Wunderkind Spielberg's story is all the scarier for hardly ever showing the Great White that is most of the characters' nemesis Spielberg was still in his twenties when he signed up to direct the shark movie that would transform his career - and Hollywood itself. The production was notoriously chaotic yet, with the help of a major marketing campaign, Jaws became the biggest box office success ever, until the release of Star Wars the next year. The cast is top-notch. Scheider is police chief Brody, a hydrophobe taking up his new posting on Amity Island off America's East Coast. His buddies in battling the killer fish are rich-kid ichthyologist Hooper (Dreyfuss) and maverick fisherman Quint (Shaw). The film has political undertones - it is marked by a post-Watergate distrust of authority - but also owes a debt in its theme of self and mutual reliance to those twin classic 50s westerns of contrasting political colours: High Noon and Rio Bravo.\nJohn William's great and justly revered score is instantly evocative of the film and its power to terrify, and there are several stand-out shock moments and wonderfully sustained suspense scenes.

            "content": "Jaws is a happy accident. For what must have been a hellish production, Spielberg's first box office megahit came together in spite of itself. Here was a movie that by all accounts should have been a disaster. It was based on a clunky, overwritten pulp novel; the plot was thin; it was being directed by a young film director best known for a TV movie; It starred a broken mechanical shark that had so much downtime that it only appears on the screen for ten minutes.Jaws did best by what it did least. Spielberg became a master in allowing our emotions and our imaginations to meet the movie halfway, and that inspiration was born out of the fact that for much of the movie we never see the shark. If we did, we'd grow tired of seeing it and the urgency of the story wouldn't be so strong. Much of what we see of the shark comes from other points of view. The opening scene, featuring a shark attack of a young woman, never shows the shark but it exists in our brains. And yet, we aren't on the shore, we're in the water with this girl as if we're swimming a few feet away. That's the power of this movie. Later, when Alex Kintner is killed, we see blood, we see the raft, and we see the attack out on the horizon behind the other swimmers. Was that a tail? Was that the shark? Was it the kid? What's happening? This movie works best on our expectations.One of my favorite shots takes place in the middle of the film, during the fourth of July holiday when the local sheriff has tried to warn the county officials that opening the beaches for the holiday is likely to be a disaster. It is. A man in a boat is killed while the sheriff's son is injured. The boy is unconscious and is dragged ashore by some other swimmers. The way the moment is shot, the camera follows and for just a split second we aren't sure if the kid still has feet or if they've been bitten off.Those kinds of visual tricks create moments that intrigue us. If we saw the attacks, if we were present, the movie would lose us. Those are the tricks that kept the audience coming back over and over.There is a lot of downtime in Jaws away from the shark. How many shark attacks can we handle in two hours? That time is filled with the human characters that fit the situation like a glove. We meet Brody (Roy Scheider) a city boy, a new sheriff in Martha's Vinyard whose come up from New York and hates the water. We meet an Ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), a wealthy know-it-all who knows sharks inside and out both from his passion and from books. We meet the town's mayor whose understandable denial of the situation is born on the fact that the town needs revenue from the tourists. There's Brody's wife, every bit her husband's equal, a woman who cares about her husband and children but is more than just a token wife. I treasure the moment when they're alone and she casually flirts with her husband: \"Wanna get drunk and fool around?\" Even the smaller roles seem to have meat on them. This is one of those great movies, like The Godfather, in which the supporting players and the extras seem to have been cast because of their memorable faces. They don't seem like actors, they seem like real people who just wandered in front of the camera.And then there's Quint, played in a magnificent performance by the late Robert Shaw as a latter-day Captain Ahab, whose beef with the shark is decades old and laid out in an intricate story so mesmerizing that we hang on his every word. He escaped a shark attack years ago, but many of his Navy buddies did not. Now, he wants a shark this shark and he's ready to wreck his own boat to get it. We see him with fire in his eyes, running his boat to the extreme and even smashing the radio to keep Brody from called in \"a bigger boat.\" He's really what drives the movie's third act, running on a pulverizing blind obsession that eventually consumes him.Without human interaction Jaws would fall on its face. This could have been just a monster movie whose only destination might have been late night television. Shark attack stories are hard to tell. How many shark movies have been a success before or after Jaws? Even the sequels decline sharply in quality after this (none involved Spielberg). Jaws 2 was entertaining but basically unnecessary. Jaws 3D was a silly excuse for 3D, and Jaws: The Revenge? . . . . ick! To experience the film now, four decades later, is to understand how movies have changed, and what changes Jaws created. Along with Star Wars two years later, it would forever turn the industry on its head. After the new breed of young directors took over Hollywood in the late 60s, the movies were a times of dark subject matter and filmmaking on a personal level. This was the era of personal filmmaking from which emerged talents like Francis Ford Coppola, Robert Altman, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen and of course, Spielberg himself. Jaws and Star Wars put that era to bed.Spielberg's filmography is a tapestry of some of the greatest works of popular American culture from the last quarter of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st. The enduring legacy of Jaws was created, as I said, as the result of a very happy accident that came in the shape of a killer shark.",

Especially Robert Shaw's monologue concerning his experience on the USS Indianapolis. That being said, Richard Dreyfuss, at that time still a relative newcomer also, in my opinion, helps to create an atmosphere one finds hard to disbelieve isn't real-life. It is one of those scenes which you can watch time and again and never get bored. Absolute perfection.I truly hope that a production company never tries to remake this classic, as they'd fail miserably. No one could replace Robert Shaw or Roy Scheider, and Richard Dreyfuss would logically refuse taking any part in it.Jaws is a masterpiece of suspense, character acting, script writing and direction. For those who've never seen it, make sure it's on your bucket list. And even if you've seen it, make sure you watch a 1080p or higher resolution version to make it just the more magical.",

And from the opening scene to the moment where the credits start rolling, we're totally glued to his character and even feel the tension and stress he feels. It starts to rise up and flow down slowly when the story takes a turn towards dealing with the predator. This is true 70s nostalgia.With a spectacular theme music and effective moments of chilling terror, this may also be some of masterful director Stephen Spielberg's work.

Shot in 1974, the production of the film dragged Spielberg through a journey of tribulations involving his newly inventive special effects that no filmmaker in Hollywood used before. Most notably was the 24-foot mechanic shark that failed to work throughout which resulted in minimal showings of the shark on screen. Ironically, it made for better suspense and better thrills (and plenty of gore) to leave audiences at the edge-of-their-seats. The film follows Roy Schneider as Sheriff Martin Brody who moves his family to the beautiful Amity Island, home of a highly tourized beach that soon becomes a place of nightmares when a hungry Great White Shark makes his way near shore and eats one of the tourists alive. With Mayor Larry Vaughn (played by Murray Hamilton) refusing to close down the beach to ensure the economic standing, Brody sets out along with marine biologist Matt Hooper (played by Richard Dreyfuss) and charismatic fisherman Quint (played by Robert Shaw) on cross-sea adventure to exterminate the hungry creature.This creature feature isn't quite what I consider Steven Spielberg's magnum opus, but there is no arguing that this film is a cinematic ark. In the decade following the age of Alfred Hitchcock a.k.a. Master of Suspense, Spielberg surprised audiences with some of the most effective thrills that left many viewers squirming in their seats and concerning about hypothetical occurrences falling victim to shark attack. Though whether these thrills happen to blow Alfred Hitchcock out of the water is debatable, they really struck at the heart and still manage to stay frightening even up to this day. Spielberg accomplishes this feat by not (unintentionally) showing the shark for the majority of the movie, but instead using cutthroat cinematography to show the shark's perspective under the water and reducing the shark's on screen presence to brief pop-up appearances before the final twenty minutes. Much of the heart-stopping suspense is accomplished not just by the nifty camera work, but John Williams' iconic score that remains highly influential to this day; playing in many other movies and spoofs on television shows. Though the atmosphere stays mostly eerie, the film provides a few moments of levity and a pinch of humor every now and then, most notably a scene with the three main leads engaging in a light-hearted conversation on the boat while taking a break from their shark hunt. Along with the sheer suspenseful tone is some charismatic performances by Roy Schneider and Richard Dreyfuss. But the major draw in the acting department is Robert Shaw who delivers a lively portrayal of an old fisherman who uses his World War II experience as his expertise for the characters' death-defying mission. The actors fuels plenty of charisma and humanity in his role with cutthroat dialogue. By the end, he easily takes the stand as the most likable character of them all. Jaws is triumphant cinematic masterpiece uprooted by the hands of Steven Spielberg, and with great suspense and influential cinematic tropes that still remain highly spoken of today. This is easily one of Spielberg's best works, and one that could be nearly impossible for any shark feature to measure up to. Though many films have tried desperately in the past, none have prevailed.",

Police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close the beaches but the mayor (Murray Hamilton) is dead set against it. Then the attacks continue and Brody, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) go after it.I remember seeing this in a theatre back when I was 13. It was a HUGE hit when it came out. It came out in the summer and the PG rating (with a severe warning saying the shark attacks might be too brutal for younger viewers) had kids pushing to see it. Back then this was pretty gruesome stuff. The attack scenes are bloody and there's a scene where you see a man get eaten...and it's not pretty. Back then this scared me silly. It doesn't scare me that much now but it's still a great thriller.Director Steven Spielberg shot it in beautiful Martha's Vineyard (right here in MA) and perfectly caught the feel of a summer community. Also the film is always moving with overlapping dialogue and the editing zipping the film along (it deserved the editing Oscar it won). Also the acting is great--Scheider is perfectly cast as Brody; Dreyfuss hit it big with his performance here and Shaw is just great in one of his last performances before (sadly) alcoholism killed him. There's also strong support from Lorraine Gary (as Brody's wife) and Hamilton as the mayor. A rare case when a lousy book (by Peter Benchley) became a great movie. And there's John Williams Oscar-winning now classic score in here.It's incredible how Spielberg got such a great movie--everything went wrong! The weather never agreed with them and they had hellish problems with the mechanical shark (which kept malfunctioning). And Shaw's drinking held up production also.Basically this is a top thriller which still holds up almost 30 years later.A must-see!",

Now who's laughing? They just don't make 'em like this anymore. Matter of fact, even this film's director, Mr. Household-Name himself, Steven Spielberg, don't make 'em like this anymore. JAWS put Spielberg into the A-Plus List. He has been trying to capture the natural ease and gutshock power of JAWS ever since.Amity Island - a great place to get eaten. A white pointer shark is terrorizing beach vacationers and Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) must battle the tourist-minded Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) to keep the beaches closed. Death in the water and death upon land (for the tourist trade) forces the town to employ a grizzled seadog, Quint (Robert Shaw), a funky marine biologist, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and aquaphobic Brody to hunt the Great White down.I still cannot explain why Method acting in the 70s was so much better overall than it is in the late 2000s. Look at Brody interacting with his kids (the same interaction is captured by Spielberg in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, 1977); look at the extras, not behaving like they're one step closer to a SAG card, but behaving like hick islanders without a camera filming them; look at the snide asides between the excitable Dreyfuss, the intolerant Shaw, and the frustrated Schieder, inhabiting their characters like scales on fish.Movie deviates from Peter Benchley's book of the same name. In the book, Hooper has an affair with Brody's wife, the Brodys' class issues with the upper-class island community are prevalent, Mayor Vaughn is in deep with the Mob, and Quint dies when a rope lashed to his leg drags him under with the shark (Benchley trying for an Ahab moment?).TV writer Carl Gottlieb was brought in to tighten Benchley's screenplay (of which many drafts were rejected, according to IMDb), restructuring the longwinded book into the compelling movie we love and fear.In 1975, JAWS was not only the highest grossing film of all time (until STAR WARS would wrench that title from its fins in 1977), the head-game impact it made on the world depleted beach trade in the mid-70s; people stopped swimming for fear of sharks; untold shark television specials and documentaries were greenlighted, not to mention Peter Benchley's average novel going \"superbestseller\" (was that before or after JAWS went supernova?).All on accounta Bruce - the nickname given to Spielberg's temperamental mechanical shark and the unworldliness of his dead, dead eyes and razorkill jaws.",

            "content": "This is the mother of all shark movies. Still standing the test of time since it was made, Jaws is a solid gold classic. I have had this on video and DVD many times now, but every time i see it on TV I always end up watching it. It is a film that has universal appeal (no pun intended). By now everyone should know the story a killer Great White Shark is chowing down on the small town inhabitants of the peaceful Amity and the Police Chief Martin Brody must find a way to stop it. Right from those terrifying (Spielberg found the tune silly when John Williams played it for him, later it would become the theme that would strike fear into film-goers hearts and still do to this day) opening scenes with THAT music immediately instills the fear into you. To tell the truth i have never been swimming in any sea since i saw this movie, purely because like its depicted in this film, you don't know whats under you. This is a gem of a film as it still has the power that it had many years ago and still terrifies the new generation. Spielberg did a wonderful job capturing the magic of Benchley's novel. A lot of people slag off the ending even benchley didn't like the way that Spielberg scripted the shark dying. I say think about this without that scene Scheider would never have had the opportunity to say that great line \"smile you son of a.....\" If you haven't seen Jaws then where the hell have you been, you have missed a great film. The shark breaking down during the film was great because then Spielberg gave us the POV of the shark as it's about to attack. If he had of had the shark to begin with it probably would have never worked, thank god he didn't. There's something about the view of the shark that more scary than seeing the shark. Maybe it's cause you know it's going to kill someone, or it could be the fact that Spielberg makes the audience think that for brief moments WE are the shark. The film should have got an Oscar for not only Editing (which it did) but for Roy Scheider for best actor, Richard Dreyfuss as Supporting Actor and Spielberg as best Director because it deserves it. When you do finally see Jaws, you do jump and if the shark had been seen earlier, i believe that, the scene on the boat would have lost it's shock value. All in all Jaws boasts some great performances from all the key players and yes even to \"Bruce\". This is also the only Jaws film where the shark was believable and not rubber looking like the sequels. I'm not so sure that it would still work if a CGI was integrated into the film or if they do a remake, the power is behind the eyes and thats exactly where i should stay.\"I think you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bite you on the ass\"",

            "content": "This movie has come under a fair amount of criticism for a number of reasons as of late, primarily for its less than accurate portrayal of shark behavior, and some subsequent harm done as a result of that.OK, it's 2017 now, most of us know that this isn't the way sharks behave. We know the odds of being attacked by a shark are less than being struck by lighting, and we know this is because sharks simply don't attack people all that often. And we also know that as a species we pose a far greater threat to sharks than they could ever pose to us.With that said, let's talk about \"Jaws\". I seriously doubt anybody involved in the film had any intention at all of portraying sharks in a manner that would motivate an uneducated mass of people to inflict harm on these creatures. Many involved, including Benchley himself, have expressed regret and remorse at the negative light sharks are portrayed in and subsequent damage done to them as a result of the film. Their motivation for making this film was to take a popular novel of the time and make it into a movie that would hopefully impact the audience and be a box office success. And oh boy, did they succeed in that. I would challenge anybody to name a movie that had a more profound impact on moviegoers of the time than \"Jaws\". It frightened a whole generation of people out of the water. I myself was 6 when it came out, and, with the PG rating, my dad thought it would be OK to take me to a drive-in to see it. It literally traumatized me, I was terrified to go into the water for a long time after that. But it also started my lifelong fascination with sharks, and it's the one film that I credit most for the beginning of my love for movies.Negative critics of this film often take it out of context, inject their own personal feelings into it and project the backlash of peoples' reaction and actions as a result of it back onto the film itself. I submit that by doing that, they are no longer reviewing the film in and of itself.What \"Jaws\" is, in and of itself, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. It shows exactly how talented Spielberg is as a filmmaker, overcoming so many setbacks and problems to create one of the greatest movies ever made. Enter the rubber shark...The rubber shark is undoubtedly one of the films most glaringly bad technical issues. But again, in 1975, this is as good a prop as they could come up with. Most people don't realize that the majority of the rubber shark footage either ended up on the cutting room floor or was never shot in the first place. The prop plagued production of the movie during its entire filming, often failing to work, or creating scenes so bad they were abandoned. This is where Spielberg's talent as a filmmaker shines, he had to come up with other ways to complete the scenes. A brilliant mix of theme music and creative camera work were used instead to imply the presence of the shark, with a stunningly successful effect. By Spielberg's own admission, having to redo scenes like this where the shark wouldn't function made \"Jaws\" a far better movie than it otherwise would have been had the rubber fish worked as planned.What \"Jaws\" lacks in accuracy and special effects strength, it more than makes up for in mood, setting, casting, character development, acting ability, screenplay and cinematography, all of which fall solidly into the excellent category. These elements are perfectly blended, and create some of the most memorable movie scenes ever filmed (Robert Shaw's drunken account of being on the USS Indianapolis is a wonderful example).Take \"Jaws\" for what it was...it wasn't a statement of the menacing danger sharks pose to us...It was a chilling, thrilling roller-coaster of a movie intended to delight and frighten audiences. It started the phenomenon of the summer blockbuster and impacted moviegoers in a truly profound manner that so few movies ever manage to do. A benchmark film in cinematic history and one of the greatest movies ever made.",

            "content": "Jaws is one of cinema's most influential movies of all time. This film did wonders for the movie industry. It brought about the advent of the summer movie season, it paved the future for blockbusters, it skyrocketed the career of a genius director in the form of Steven Spielberg, and of course this happens to be a damn good thriller. It is one of my favorite all-time movies and despite seeing this film multiple times, I always find watching the movie to be a wondrous experience. Steven Spielberg is considered by many to be one of best movie directors of all-time, and I wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. Time after time, he creates movies that exhibit joy, happiness, and the most of all-magic. Even his lesser films have a hint of magic to them. Each and every single thing the guy makes is pure art. 1975's Jaws is just the beginning of his storied career. Now the production of the movie was often troubled, but the result was incredible. Spielberg often recalls that he thought he would never make a movie again because of his not-so-secret production issues. The film was over-budget, the screenplay was being written simultaneously with filming, the cast and crew were becoming tired and worn out, the mechanical shark they were using kept on breaking, and Spielberg was just a director whose lack of experience and his heavy ego made things even more complicated. But luckily, Spielberg persevered in creating a very fun, terror-inducing movie.So obviously we know the film is about sharks. But lets take a closer look at the plot. After a fatal attack by a shark off the coast of popular summer resort Amity Island, police chief Marcus Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close down the resort. But the mayor of the town, Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) doesn't want to close down the resort because it will hurt business. But after another attack, Vaughn decides to rethink things. With the help of a scientist from the Oceanographic institute Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a seasoned World War Two sailor Quint (Robert Shaw), Brody goes after the huge great white shark that has been terrorizing the denizens of Amity Island.The film has a wonderful cast-typical of a Spielberg film. They all bring their A games in the movie especially the three leads. Roy Scheider does a good job as Police Chief Brody who unsuccessfully alerts everyone of the danger lurking in the water. I liked Richard Dreyfuss's portrayal of Hooper. Hooper has intense knowledge about sharks and I liked that performance very much. I also have to give it to Robert Shaw for his wonderful performance. He created his own monologue about how he and his crew was stranded in shark-infested waters during the war and he was one of the few survivors. That monologue was very well-done because it gave me a good case of the creeps. Murray Hamilton as Mayor Vaughn was solid, but it's essentially Hamilton playing a role he always does.I liked the transformation this movie witnessed. Based off the wildly popular novel by Peter Benchley, this film was originally conceived as a straight-up horror picture reminiscent of a Ray Harryhausen picture. But as luck would have it with the mechanical shark not working well, this movie turned into something Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of. They would show very little of the shark-maybe a dorsal fin here or there. By keeping the shark under the table for most of the film, the audience is shocked when the big reveal occurs. The final half hour when the crew is out in the waters hunting and fighting the shark, that was a very fun and intense time. But I loved the set-up. We see these attacks but we don't see the shark. We know the shark is there thanks to the fantastic underwater cinematography by Bill Butler and of course the insanely popular score by John Williams. One of the best scores of all time. That opening sequence for the first attack is a scene that was well-done and it immediately set the tone of the movie. This movie is terrifying at times and it might make you not go into the water for months. Beware if you want to show this to any young children. Don't let the PG rating fool you because there is lots of carnage and scary moments.Overall, Jaws is an influential movie that spawned three sequels and a special place in everyone's heart. I found it to be a very entertaining and fun shark thriller that never gets old. The shark itself may be questionable at times, but considering what happened during shooting, I'm very happy the way the shark turned out to be. I thought the screenplay would be a weak spot, but it was actually well-written and rather straightforward. The acting was fantastic, and the direction was fluid despite the production issues. Spielberg began his esteemed career here with the record-breaking box office and the popularity that still persists today. I loved the terror and the tension the film inspires mainly due to the Hitchcock inspiration and the menacing, terror-provoking score by John Williams. As soon as you hear the first notes from the tuba, you will immediately connect it with Jaws. This movie is a straightforward, old-fashioned thriller and if you are one of those rare souls who haven't seen this picture, please do.My Grade: A",

            "content": "\"Jaws\" is a tense, intelligent and compelling adventure that still counts as Steven Spielberg's second best film, after his downright brilliant debut \"Duel\". Nonetheless, apart from the terrific idea to introduce a \"creature of nature\" as an invincible nemesis, this movie lacks a few essential aspects to be labeled masterpiece, in my humble opinion. That, of course, doesn't mean that it isn't a must-see film! \"Jaws\" is an exhilarating movie-experience and also an excellent reminder that Spielberg used to make gripping films for adult audiences, rather than dull and childish epics with an overuse of sentiment. The clever screenplay (mostly written by Peter Benchley) neatly divides this film into two parts. The first part is really splendid, with the quiet island community of Amity slowly growing aware of the fact that they've got a serious water-problem on their hands. The first (and severely mutilated) bodies of shark-attack victims begin to wash ashore but the obnoxious mayor initially refuses to acknowledge the problem out of fear tourists will stay away during the summer-opening weekend. This first half is very suspenseful (the opening on the tunes of John Williams' world-famous score!!), the camera-work is exquisite and there's some nice hillbilly-humor in the script. The second half has three specialists going out to sea in order to hunt down and kill the great white shark. Police chief Brody (Scheider), independent sea-hunter Quint (Shaw) and oceanographer Hooper (Dreyfuss) play cat and mouse on open water with an impressive monster they yet don't properly know the enormous proportions of (hence the classic quote \"You're gonna need a bigger boat\" when Brody first beholds the shark). Personally, I think this second part is a bit overlong and overall not as involving as the first. However, the character-drawing of our 3 heroes is brilliant and Shaw's \"Indianapolis\"-monologue is still very chilling (it took three additional scriptwriters to perfection this legendary speech). The film's climax is very bloody and therefore a rewarding ending.I guess the main reason why I love this movie is because of the trend it started. Steven Spielberg and his film single-handedly launched an endless series of ripoffs and outrageous creature-features that nearly turn every animal on this planet into ravenous monsters. I make a hobby out of tracking down the films that were obviously inspired by this milestone. The sea-monster movies remain the coolest, for sure. There are a lot of worthwhile rip-off's to be found; like \"Orca \u0096 Killer Whale\", \"Pirahna\" or \"Alligator\" but even more stinkers like \"Tentacles\", \"Tintorera - Tiger Shark\" or \"Killer Fish\".",

            "content": "A 25-foot Great White shark is doing what he knows best \u0096 swimming around and eating when he gets hungry. In this case, his diet consists mostly of the people off the coast of Amityville, and Martin Brody (Scheider) the newly hired police chief has to not only protect the townspeople but also find the shark and kill it. Unfortunately, he has a few strikes against him right out of the box; the Mayor of Amityville is so mercenary he pretty much has to have a body dropped in his lap before he will acquiesce to closing the beach, he hires a crusty old curmudgeon of a shark hunter (Quint, played by Robert Shaw) who, while being good at what he does, has a beef with everyone who comes in contact with him (particularly oceanographer Matt Hooper, played by Richard Dreyfuss), and finally, Brody suffers from a little thing called hydrophobia.The story is simple, yet the film is so well put together that it has held up as a horror classic for the last thirty years. Spielberg, at the time with only a few films and television shows under his directing belt, created a masterpiece with the film \"Jaws\", a film that is so good; its flaws become almost trivial when making an overall assessment of the film. Several great things occurred due to serendipity with \"Jaws\". Probably the best known was the trouble the crew had with the mechanical shark that led to underexposure of the monster; subsequently leading to a greater scare with the shard did appear. Spielberg, even with these formative films, knew how to create suspense and tension. The image of the three men on a rickety boat in the middle of the ocean where a man-eating shark who is looking for a 5th victim awaits is pretty scary. And that is one of the less obvious moments \u0096 never mind the shark bringing down a young boy, a dog, a young woman and man. (Unusually, the goriest actually being the death of the child.) Throw in a now iconic soundtrack and we have ourselves an instant classic.Formally reviewing \"Jaws\" is pretty pointless when the movie is not only thirty years out of the can, but has been analyzed to pieces, but a mention has to be made about its lasting effect on pop culture. I know of at least one person who still will not go in the water as a direct result of this film, and while it is fair to expect that I was completely terrified of this film when I was 7 or 8, I'll admit that the movie poster still scares the hell out of me. I think the greatest thing that I found with \"Jaws\" is that a film that I remembered being so terrifying as a kid actually turned into a film that was terrifying for a completely different reasons when viewed as an adult. With this viewing I found \"Jaws\" to be more spine-chillingly suspenseful than anything; I really felt a sense of hopelessness for the plight of these men, and was scared on their behalf \u0096 more of an adult kind of terror than anything that simply goes \"Boo!\" \"Jaws\" isn't perfect \u0096 it actually has a pretty convenient ending that made me go, \"Wait \u0096 but- how will they\u0085.huh?\" But like I said earlier, it's things like this that make you realize that the rest of the film was good enough to forgive this transgression. I have always had a conflicted relationship with Steven Spielberg films; on the one hand, and as a self-labeled life long film student, I know how commercial his films are. But on the other hand, I can't deny that he makes damn good films. Maybe I should just lighten up about it and just enjoy, which I did while watching \"Jaws\" again, many years after seeing it for the first time. 8/10 --Shelly",

Jaws is an adaptation of Peter Benchely's 1974 novel \"Jaws.\" Still to this day people are scared of what is swimming below because of this classic film. Jaws is a movie about an unstable great white shark that is eating everything and everyone in its path. The film is based around a small island community called \"Amity,\" and shot on location at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The main star of the movie Chief Brady (Roy Scheider) is tasked with stopping this eating machine with the help of Marie Biologist and Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss). Along with fighting the shark Chief Brady has to fight the town board to close the beaches, which are the small towns only source of income. Chief Brody tries desperately to convince the towns people to listen to him because with the beaches open there is a virtual buffet served up for this 25- foot beast. To help corral the killer Chief Brody enlists roughneck shark hunt Quint (Robert Shaw), who hates sharks more than anyone. These three heroes go where no one else wants to go, the water, to kill this behemoth knowing they no match for the creature. The truly amazing part of this movie is the score it is simple, but terrifying. Who knew that just two cords could have the effect it did on this film and people still to this day. The Jaws theme song is instantly recognizable. I remember as a younger man that every time I was at the public pool or lake that at least one other child would have his hands above his head like a shark fin and move through the water singing, dun da dun da dun da. This movie was mainly shot with hand-held cameras is rough seas. The views of the ocean and the authenticity of the shark are breathtaking. This is a keep you at the edge of your seat kind of film. There is no wonder this movie was the highest grossing film of all time until Star Wars in 1977. Jaws received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and won three Oscars for best sound, best film editing, and best music- original dramatic score. If you haven't seen this movie get out there and watch it. You will appreciate seeing the shark that started it all.",

            "content": "Everything from the filmmaking, to the storytelling, and the MUSIC is fantastic. Despite all the problems that occurred while making it, Jaws is not only a genuinely well written and well made film. But, it is a masterpiece when it comes to film itself and every aspect of film. I honestly find it difficult to find anything really wrong with this movie or anything I dislike.Yes, Jaws is about a man eating shark, but there is so much more within this film. There are real characters and you get to see those characters and like them. So yes it's an iconic monster flick, but it's also much more than that. Chief Brody, Hooper, and Quint are honestly some of my favorite characters in film and Jaws itself is also one of my favorite villains.My favorite scene in the movie is the scene where Brody, Quint and Hooper are all sitting at the round table telling stories, drinking, and singing songs. \"Show me the way to go home, I'm tired and I wanna go to bed.\" I love it.John Williams composes one of his best scores for this film. Every time I hear it, it reminds me of Universal Studios. But, it's an iconic score and the main theme is one of the most menacing themes for a villain in movie history. Without that score this movie would have been a completely different experience and the film would have had a much different impact. John Williams is the real star of this movie.Overall, Jaws is a cinematic masterpiece. Steven Spielberg combines fantastic storytelling, good characters, beautiful cinematography, superb filmmaking, and an iconic score to create arguably one of his greatest and most iconic films of all time. Among being an iconic blockbuster monster movie flick. Jaws also combines the genres of comedy, action, drama, suspense, and horror all into one. *chefs kiss*One of the most iconic movie posters of all time.The first summer blockbuster before Star Wars, it also caused the world to go into shark hunting panic mode \ud83d\ude2c. And ngl I think about Jaws literally everytime I go in the ocean. Even when I'm in the deep end of the pool sometimes.",

            "content": "I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and was impressed. I had not read the novel but in 1974 Peter Benchley's book Jaws spent most of the year on the best seller list and the film's producers approached the young Steven Spielberg to direct. He was known for the big made for movie hit Duel and had recent success with his first theatrical released film Sugarland Express so he was given the monumental challenge to adapt for the screen a runaway best selling thriller for a summer release. Summer releases were usually relegated to Drive-In movies back in 1975 but because of the film's subject they took a chance on coinciding with the swimming and summer tourist season for maximum effect. The chance of a summer release of a major theatrical release and the use of a relatively unknown director was a big hit. Major summer releases became the norm and Spielberg became a legend. Spielberg would of course go on to direct such major films as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and it's two big Indiana Jones sequels, ET, The Color Purple, the Empire of the Sun, Jurasick Park, Shindlers List and Saving Private Ryan among his big hits. He stumbled with a few misses too but the Spielberg name on any film draws interest and anticipation. Peter Benchley wrote the screenplay of his own novel along with Carl Gotlieb and some contribution from Spielberg. The monologue of the story of the Indianpolis tragedy was drafted by playwright Howard Sackler and screenwriter/director John Milius. One of filmdom's most memorable and effective music scores by John Williams received an Academy Award, one of three the film won including Best Sound and Best Film Editing. It was also nominated for Best Picture but lost to One flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It also was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, winning one and got seven BAFTA nominations, winning one. Cinematographer Bill Butler had been a second unit photographer on The godfather, Deliverance and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and had been the cinematographer of The Conversation. He only filmed a handful of successful films after Jaws including Biloxi Blues, Stripes and Grease and it's odd that his career nosedived and he was involved with a ton of real bad movies. It's also odd that with the success of Jaw Spielberg never used him again in any of his films. Rexford Metz was the underwater cinematographer. It's basically a simple story of a giant Great White shark who has developed a taste for humans and had began prowling the sea shore of a resort town. It's possesses almost supernatural strength and cunning and the town's police chief wants to stop it but the town's mayor doesn't want tourists to know they have a shark problem. The cop enlists the aid of a young oceanographer, fresh out of college and a WWII Navy veteran who has become a seafaring bounty hunter. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfus and Murray Hamilton star. It's a well done suspenseful drama, well written with shock, horror and a little comedy too. I would give it a 10.",

            "content": "'Jaws' is considered the pioneer of the Summer blockbusters. After all, its impact and success made it a much copied movie, by giving birth to 3 sequels and different movies inspired on it (such as 'Deep Blue Sea'). But 'Jaws' is definitely THE Summer blockbuster (and also the one to own).Steven Spielberg was in the beginning of his career when he made this movie. Although he made other movies before, this was his first hit. Its success surprised even Spielberg himself. The movie is based on a 1974 book (same title) by Peter Benchley. I read the book and there are many differences...Filming of the movie took much longer than planned. It was supposed to take about 2 months, but ended up taking more than 5 months (also due to reliability issues with the mechanical sharks).'Jaws' is considered a classic in its genre. Indeed it is a great movie but also shocking. It is intense and combines strong suspense and horror. The shark is immense and intimidating. It is clearly over-sized, but that also makes the movie more terrifying. It looks a bit rubbery at times, but I don't think it looks as artificial as many do. Nicely filmed, the movie takes place in a fictional Summer resort town (Amity Island). The place looks very appealing, the sandy beach is big, beautiful and very inviting. And that's where the brutal shark's attacks occur. It's heaven and hell at the same time.The movie's got some of the most horrifying deaths ever in a movie. While not the scariest movie of its kind, it surely is scary when it is. In fact, I often read and heard that when the movie came out in 1975, never before had the cinemas been so full and the beaches so empty. It wasn't just because of the movie's euphoria, but also because of the shark's attacks seen in it (maybe more than the sharks's attacks in real life). Today the movie continues to marvel and shock audiences.And the soundtrack by the genial John Williams is strong and powerful, very appropriate for the movie. It gives the sensation of being spooky and carried with suspense, the feeling that something terrible is about to happen.Roy Scheider portrays the town's police chief Martin Brody. Richard Dreyfuss stars as the marine biologist Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw plays the rude fisherman and shark hunter Quint. Murray Hamilton is Larry Vaughn, the selfish Mayor of Amity Island. Ever since the beginning, Brody wants to close the beaches to protect beachgoers from the shark's attacks, but is overruled by the Mayor, who refuses to close the beaches because of his greed for money and also refuses to listen to or believe anybody. His selfishness costs lives, as we see in the film - including a child's life.The first half of the movie focus more on the attacks and also lets us know Amity Island and appreciate its scenario. The second half focus on the attempt to hunt the great beast.The movie's poster is great, even more so in the DVD cover.",

            "content": "With the dawn of the movie blockbuster, Hollywood unintentionally achieved two goals: with THE EXORCIST, they scared a legion of moviegoers back into church, literally. And with JAWS, they scared them out of the water, in some cases, permanently. The simple, pleasurable act that virtually defines summertime - going swimming at the beach - would never be the same again. And also, the audience love affair with a new, young, talented director by the name of Spielberg spanned into a marriage that lasted for both better and worse, over the course of damn near forty years! Whether you think of it as an adventure film with horror movie overtones, or a horror film that offers one hell of an adventurous ride as a bonus, there has never been anything quite like it. Based on the late Peter Benchley's runaway best seller, the plot is quite simple. Following a lead very similar to the one that Hitchcock had previously set with THE BIRDS, a unusually large Great White shark shows up in the calm, blue waters just off the coast of Amity Island, (played superbly by Martha's Vineyard), and begins to snack on the unwary and unwise tourists and townies who decide to engage in nautical activities at the wrong time. The town's police chief (Roy Scheider), a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a grizzled shark hunter (Robert Shaw) decide to deal with it the best way they know how. Needless to say, the three men's lives are changed forever by the encounter.JAWS has long been an indelible entry into the lexicon of pop culture slang and references. There are times even now when someone can hum the ominous notes of John Williams' familiar theme, and watch their best friends' faces turn ashen as they mutter \"That's not funny.\" For those who keep score of such things, many will remember this as the first American-made film to ever gross over one hundred million dollars domestically. I will always remember it with great fondness as the first film that caused people in darkened theaters across the nation to drop their buckets of popcorn, and maybe check their shorts as well, myself included.For those rare viewers who have never seen this classic before in life, you have my envy and my sympathy. Envy, because there is nothing else in the world like seeing JAWS for the very first time. And sympathy, because no matter how great your HDTV and your home sound system is, there will never again be an experience like seeing it for the first time on the BIG screen. This is one of those rare ones that deserves four out of four stars, for great reasons.",

Its based on the novel by Peter Benchley.It stars Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Murray Hamilton, Lorraine Gray, etc.Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is the new police chief of Amity, an island resort town somewhere in New England. He has a wife named Ellen, and two sons named Michael and Sean. On a Summer morning, Brody is called to the beach, where the mangled body of Summer vacationer Chrissie Watkins (Susan Backlinie) has washed ashore. The medical examiner tells Brody that it could have been a shark that killed Watkins. Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who is desperate to not lose the money that will be brought in by 4th of July tourists, wants Brody to say Watkins's death was caused by a motorboat propeller instead of a shark, because the thought of a shark in Amity's waters would drive tourists away from Amity. It looks like Vaughn is a mayor who puts money ahead of people's lives. Shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) believes Watkins was killed by a shark. Hooper is proved right a few days later, when Alex Kintner is killed by the shark that killed Watkins. Looking for the quickest solution, Vaughn tells all of the local fishermen to let him know if they see the shark. A shark hunter named Quint (Robert Shaw) offers to find the shark and kill it, but Vaughn thinks Quint's price of $10,000 is too high. When a tiger shark is killed and hauled in by a couple of boaters, Vaughn hastily says that the shark crisis is over, but Hooper says the shark that's been killing people a huge great white shark is still in Amity's waters, but Vaughn leaves the beaches opened because all he cares about is the 4th of July tourist money. On the 4th of July, Vaughn encourages people to swim at the beach, and Hooper is proved right again when the shark kills a man, biting the man's leg off. Michael, who was in the water at the time of the attack, is taken to the hospital, where he's treated for shock after watching the shark kill the guy. Brody asks Vaughn to hire Quint to find the shark. Because his own kids were at that beach too, Vaughn agrees to hire Quint to find the shark. Quint, Hooper, and Brody are sent out to sea in Quint's boat, the Orca, ready to do whatever it takes to find the shark.Nothing beats the original Jaws with the sequels that came out.John Williams musical score was fantastic, he also did the music for Star Wars, ET, Jurassic Park, etc.Overall, this movie is just another movie you should see.Jaws gets 10 stars.",

And with the humorous Quint added to the mix you have a colorful cast to go hunting for sharks and telling sea stories.My only criticism is that when Quint enters the picture Brody gets increasingly sidelined and isn't doing much until the very end which was a good ending though.

It creates the tension, raises the stakes, and whenever it is played has the audience on the edge of there seat2. All the cast is wonderfully portrayed. The standout is roy scheider to me.3. The charecters are all well written, the decisions made make sense for how they have acted earlier and also the movie can be very funny at times. Another thing i loved about them was the chemistry they had together on the boat.4. Spielberg directs this movie perfectly. The beginning of the movie says it all how it gets you hooked from the jump and the film never slows down m. Something i noticed that i loved in this movie was the pacing. It moves very fast but also lets scenes of death marinate to where you feel the presence of how deadly this shark was. Spielberg also does a fantastic job woth the ending seating up stakes making it feel almost impossible to kill the shark but just as you thought the shark won. Brody takes him down5. The film is very beautifully shot, the best scenes to me where on the beach.6. Speaking of best scenes the beginning scene with Brody on the beach is a masterclass film making. Setting up tension, how tense brody was, the music, the acting all perfect.7. What truly made this movie so special though was the fact that for the beginning of the movie you dont see the shark or the kills. It plays off the music and direction for you to know how deadly this beast is and the gruesomeness of the kills.8. The shark is such a fantastic villain that barely gets any screen time but is always a presence whenever you see the water.9. Hooper and quint are also amazing side characters that do everything they should. They add humor move the plot forward and also quint adds emotion to the movie with his boat speech.Negatives:1. One problem i had was when Brodys son was in the water i fell like it doesn't explain well how he got out alive. It shows that a man right next to him is eaten yet he somehow passes out and stays alive?! Especially have a problem with this scene because of how the shark is portrayed as something that eats anything he gets close too.2. Just a small thing is a think quint can be very hard to understand what he is saying which is sad because after reading his lines there so good!Overall:The film is simply a masterpiece. Going into the movie i had my doubts and wasn't to exited. Coming out i now understand all the praise.Writing/plot/charecters 10/10\nActing 10/10\nDesign/cinematography 10/10\nMusic 10/10\nDirecting 9.5/10\nEffects/action 10/1059.5/6099%",

JAWS is often blamed (wrongly, I think) for starting this obsession Hollywood has with blockbuster hits.  I say \"wrongly blamed\", because, besides grossing a quarter of a billion dollars at the box office (the first film to do so), JAWS is really a very great movie.The story itself is familiar: a New England coastal resort town terrorized by a Great White shark, a mayor unwilling to put his town's economy at risk so that the shark can be killed, etcetera, etcetera.  The problems they had with the mechanical shark are even more familiar.  But the fact remains that JAWS works, because Steven Spielberg has never been the kind to let go of a vision he is in the process of making into his own--and this was no exception.  Instead of making it into a visceral monster movie, Spielberg took to not showing the shark for the first two-thirds of the movie (although the fact that he had very little choice had more than a little to do with it), thus mandating an Alfred Hitchcock approach to things.  He is helped by the excellent performances of Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss, as well as John Williams' classic score.  The score, Verna Fields' editing, and the production sound team of John Carter and Robert Hoyt won Oscars for their work.And of course one must thank Spielberg for having delivered a truly terrifying and dramatic piece of cinema, and not just an ARMAGEDDON-style sound-and-fury event.  JAWS, even after a quarter century-plus of being sequalized, parodied, and ripped off, is still a Hollywood masterpiece.",

She feels something bite her, drag her in all directions, then she disappears underwater. Her boyfriend reports her missing and her body is found by local police the next morning all chewed up and spit out along the shore. The Amity police chief is Martin Brody (played by Roy Scheider in his greatest film role). When he and his deputy find the body, they immediately quarantine the beach and post signs to stay away, but the Mayor (played effectively by Murray Hamilton) will have none of that since local businesses will lose lots of money during the tourist season if the beaches are closed. The beaches stay open and a young boy is killed by the shark on the first day of tourist season.It appears as if some of the local fisherman have caught 'the shark' when a oceanographic expert on sharks named Matt Hooper (played by Richard Dreyfuss in a totally winning and expert performance) shows up in Amity to assist Chief Brody in finding and catching the real shark. Hooper immediately does an autopsy of the girl eaten in the opening scene and verifies that a 'great white shark' did this. One of the many memorable great lines of this film come shooting out of his mouth 'This was not a boating accident!' The day Hooper arrives, while all the fisherman are patting themselves on the back and everyone is celebrating the shark 'capture', something unexpected happens. The mother of the boy that was killed, dressed in all black funeral garb, walks up to Chief Brody and slaps him for not closing the beaches even though he knew a man-eating shark was out there (of course we know this isn't all his fault). This one scene has always stuck out with me from the film. It is very realistic and shows how people can really take their grief and anger out on the wrong person, but this moment served as a kind of closure for the woman and as a wake-up call for Brody. From this moment on, Brody takes everything that Hooper says seriously and wants to be sure that the real shark is still not out there.Hooper does indeed verify to Brody that the shark is still out there by cutting open the captured shark and verifying no signs of human consumption. But the stubborn mayor still keeps the beaches open not believing them. As expected, the shark attacks again, this time almost killing Brody's son. NOW the Mayor has to pay attention. A town meeting is held and Brody and the Mayor tell them they need to hire professional shark hunters. Then another great moment occurs. An annoying, screeching sound is heard. It's a man scraping a blackboard with his fingernails to get everyone's attention. That man is Quint (played by Robert Shaw in a role that he should forever be remembered for). Quint is a local fisherman who is extremely knowledgeable about the sea and sharks (we'll find out why later) says he'll catch the shark for the right price. Eventually they agree and Brody, Hooper, and Quint (reluctantly) join forces to go after the great white.The adventure begins. The 3 men go after the great white in Quint's boat. An uneasy alliance forms amongst the 3 men, as they each argue with each other and get on each other's nerves early on. Quint is old school and thinks all of Hooper's technical equipment is hogwash, while Hooper thinks Quint is too rigid and primitive. Brody is like a 3rd wheel as he's not a seamen at all and he hates the water! At a totally unexpected moment, THE SHARK appears, then Brody in a frozen state slowly walks back towards Quint and says 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' (maybe the best line in film history). This is followed by one of my all time favorite film sequences as the 3 men scramble to do what each of them do best to kill the shark. They fail at first, but slowly bond during the trip. One night, while drunk, Quint and Hooper compare sea scars, then Quint tells the story of how he got this one scar while he was a sailor on the USS Indianapolis which got bombed and sank while he and his fellow survivors were stuck in shark-infested waters waiting for rescue. This dialogue is famous for being completely scripted by Robert Shaw himself and he delivers it perfectly.Needless to say, they get one final chance to catch the shark and in this long sequence that climaxes the film, the tension builds from moment to moment as they try everything to catch the shark and as the shark goes all out in trying to eat up the men and the boat itself. A great movie.This, for me, is Steven Spielberg's best directorial effort. I love his later work too, but JAWS is a perfect film. Not a weak moment in it. I love the Hitchcockian elements of building tension and suspense, the Kubrickian elements of overlapping dialogue and long scenes that are totally enthralling and not boring, the great background music, and quotable, memorable dialogue. Ironic that this perfect film inspired all the fake, unrealistic, over-the-top, unsuspenseful summer crap they make nowadays. JAWS should never be mistaken as one of these films.It was nominated for Best Picture in 1975 (should have won) and won the 3 other Oscars it was nominated for (Editing, Sound, and of course Score). Spielberg was robbed by not even getting a Best Director nom.",

The first terrifying attack is awesome in its ferocity, thanks to the screaming torments of the young woman trying to get away from the thing below the surface. After that, the film builds slowly but gathers suspense with each scene, especially each beach scene. The mayor's refusal to shut down the beach is simply an act of greed (it's the height of the tourist season), but once the attacks begin to multiply it's up to Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw to do something about catching the great white shark.All three carry the second half of the film aboard a boat that has Schneider delivering the unforgettable line: \"We should have had a bigger boat!\" after he spots the shark for the first time. The plot gets a fair share of thrills once it becomes clear that killing the shark is not going to be an easy matter.Adding greatly to the suspense is a wonderful John Williams score and great cinematography. Incredible that Stephen Spielberg was only 29 when he directed this little masterpiece of man against beast.Well worth watching--and guaranteed to hold your interest throughout the final hour especially. One can sense the influence of MOBY DICK on the screenplay, especially with Quint's obsession to kill the shark.",

            "review_title": "An absolute masterpiece; a summer blockbuster that is also somewhat groundbreaking",
            "content": "Often considered to be the ultimate summer blockbuster, Jaws (1975) goes even further than that; standing as a truly radical and exciting piece of film-making, rich in character, action, energy and technique; and filled with some truly iconic moments that have endured throughout the subsequent thirty-five years and still retain the power and ability to shock and excite the audience in more than equal measures. For me, it's an example of almost perfect film-making, setting the template for many of Spielberg's greatest films in terms of structure, presentation and impact; with that opening sequence grabbing our attention with a swift combination of alluring sexuality giving way to full-blown horror and dread; further whetting our appetite just enough to make us persevere with the eventual scenes of dialog and exposition that immediately follow. Here, Spielberg is also able to suggest the kind of danger lurking ahead, creating a sense of suspense for the audience that will pay off in the final third of the film, where we find non-stop action, drama and pure character dynamics.Much has already been written about the sharp vibrancy of the story and the slow build up to the eventual revelation of the event that triggers the narrative and sends us headlong into that four-way battle of wits that dominates the film's final act; with the screenwriters taking an obvious leaf from Hitchcock - and in particular, The Birds (1963) - with that idea of a small, seemingly idyllic island community being terrorised by an ecological, naturalistic horror that is never fully explained (and remains all the more terrifying for it). It remains that perfect combination of script, direction, casting and hook; in this case the frightening and iconic score of John Williams, which benefits from a two-note simplicity in keeping with the rest of the film, and the basic idea of an unseen, unstoppable evil, waiting in the most innocuous place of all... the sea! Spielberg's confident approach to a cinema of this scale, even at such an early point in his career, is already apparent; with the problems behind the scenes actually being used to the benefit of the film, turning something that could have been a fairly obvious maritime disaster movie with a fake rubber shark and producing a film that was slightly more enigmatic, character driven and open to interpretation.For example, you can clearly read metaphorical interpretations into the portrayal of the shark and how it affects this community; bringing out the quiet desperation of the islanders and the corruption of its town officials who just want to keep the money rolling in, regardless of the cost; are of which are fairly prevalent when we think of the film in the 70's context, post-Watergate/post-Vietnam. However, the film isn't limited to political subtext, with the action, characters and deft handling of narrative momentum all adding to the overall great viewing experience; with the director's truly heroic command of framing, shot structure and tight use of editing to make the most out of the film's few genuinely affecting shock scenes. It's also more violent than the PG rating would suggest, with Spielberg once again getting away with the kind of brutality that would have condemned a less popular filmmaker; something that we can also see in the violence of Saving Private Ryan (1999) and the more recent Munich (2005).It's odd to consider now that Spielberg was, despite his success, always thought of as a lesser talent compared to the likes of Coppola, Scorsese and Bogdanovich; his style and influences too populist to appeal to serious cineasts and his films apparently too lightweight to be compared to the similarly great likes of The Last Picture Show (1971), The Conversation (1974) and Taxi Driver (1976). With this in mind, it's surprising to see that Spielberg is now the most interesting, exciting and edgy director of his generation; still as populist and business-minded as ever, but taking great risks with films like the emotionally complicated A.I. (2001), the low-key and minimalist (of the not entirely successful) The Terminal (2004) and the vitriolic and oddly reflective Munich; as mentioned above. Obviously, he is a great filmmaker - as those particular films and many more will attest - however, for me, Jaws is something of his masterpiece; made all the more impressive for the fact that it was produced at the very beginning of his career and was only his third feature-length film as director.",

            "content": "About four minutes into Jaws and one can quickly understand why it was the first summer blockbuster. Directed by Steven Spielberg in 1975, Jaws sets the tone of anticipatory horror that it maintains throughout the whole film immediately from the opening shots. Starring Roy Scheider; in a brilliantly subtle commanding performance, along with Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss, Jaws tells the tale of a quiet beach town that gets the shock of their lives when they discover their calm waters have been overtaken by a man- eating shark intent to kill. The second entry on AFI's 100 Years 100 Thrills list, it is no wonder audiences around the globe still site Jaws as the reason they are reluctant to enter the water at the beach.Amity Island's brand new Sheriff, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is trepidatious of the water anyway and seems like he'd be happier to return to his family's home in New York. Shortly after his arrival, there is evidence of a shark attack, as a girl turns up dead on the shore after a night of partying. For a town that solely depends on the revenue from its beaches for survival, Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) scoffs at the initial recommendation from Sheriff Brody to close the beach. Unable to surmount the incredible resistance, Brody relinquishes his better judgment in favor of keeping the beaches open, as few people knew about the incident with the girl anyway. To Brody's regret, a boy is attacked and killed by a shark the next weekend. The boy's mother causes an influx of fisherman flooding Amity Island after she offers a $3000 reward for the capture and killing of the shark that killed her son. Among those that flood the Island are Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), from the Oceanographic Institute who specializes in hunting Great White sharks. Still reluctant to close the beach, Mayor Vaughn instructs Brody to assemble a team and go to any means necessary to make the beach safe. A local fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw) agrees to hunt the shark, vowing to be able to kill it and bring peace to Amity Island. The three men, arm themselves into a boat that they soon realize is too small, and immerse themselves into the habitat of the creature. Steven Spielberg is at his best in this film. No stone is left unturned in the creation of the world of Amity Island. Each aspect of filmmaking, among them: the camera work, the writing, and the acting are nothing short of fantastic. Most of the success of this film must be paid to the famously haunting score composed by John Williams. As good as the story and as visually striking as Jaws was, had it not been for Williams' score, I doubt that people would be talking about it as much as they still do, 40 years after its release. Character development is phenomenal in Jaws, as well. Each main character has a completely fleshed out (see what I did there) story which is often lacking in films. Spielberg's camera work in this film, especially his exquisite use of foreground, middle ground, and background illustrates why he has the status as a director that he does. Filled with incredible shots, such as the scene in which the audience sees Brody typing \"shark attack\" on the death report of the first victim are a tribute to Spielberg's prowess in the director's chair. With a cast of likable characters, an infectiously adventurous plot, and a thrilling unpredictable protagonist, it is easy to see why Jaws still lives in the recesses of our minds 40 years after its release. Still noted for being the first summer blockbuster, the reputation of Jaws has not been lost despite its 1975 release date. Surprisingly, notwithstanding the advancements in special effects since the mid- 70's; Jaws has not dated very much at all, still creating a scare for today's audiences. Jaws does the amazing feat, indicative of a highly skilled director, of scarcely showing the beast of the film, yet instilling fear in the audience. Thankfully, there is not much of summer left for me to ponder the chances of my being attacked by a shark; yeah, Jaws is that good, even in 2016.",

The first half or three-fourth of the film is about planning how to go about capturing the shark. The last part is all in the sea. It's an amazing film because the way it traverses from scene to scene. The film involves a lot of character build up and a basis for the shark to be killed. It also keeps minimalistic in sound and gets loud only when needed.The sound design and the music by John Williams is a study in itself. The editing is precise and keeps the movie gripping. To be fair, there are hardly any dull moments in the film, even though the end is known. The journey is so interesting that the destination feels like a by-product of the journey.Steven Spielberg grew in stature with this film. I am told by my uncle who saw the film in theater 1970's when it got released that it was indeed a phenomenon and one of his friends does not enter into the water even today that is 40 years after seeing the film he is still afraid of sharks. Though funny, it is indeed true and confirmed by the person itself.It's impactful and must be revered for the change it brought about in mindset and understanding of the sea the nature of sharks.Acting is stupendous and though I don't know any of the cast, they played their roles superbly and are heroic in their own ways.A 4/5 for one the great films ever made, though it lost it's aura a bit as technology got updated, it must be seen for the content.",

When Sheriff Martin Brody discovers the remains of a shark attack victim, his first inclination is to close the beaches to swimmers. This doesn't sit well with the Mayor and several of the local businessmen. Brody backs down to his regret as that weekend a young boy is killed by the predator. The boy's mother puts out a bounty on the shark and Amity is soon swamped with amateur hunters and fisherman hoping to cash in on the reward. A local fisherman with much experience hunting sharks, Quint, offers to hunt down the creature for a hefty fee. Soon Quint, Brody and Matt Hooper from the Oceanographic Institute are at sea hunting the Great White shark....This is the film we have to thank for blockbusters like ID4, Jurassic Park, and Robin Hood: POT. It's also responsible in some way for Batman and Robin, Battlefield Earth. It's basically the movie that started the summer blockbuster, and it's so easy to see why. Spielberg has crafted easily his most entertaining movie, with real shocks, laughs and some of the most emotional scenes in a big movie like this.From the USS Indianapolis speech, to the opening scene, to the scene with Brody and his son, to the brilliant use of the camera in that scene, to the immortal lines 'gonna need a bigger boat' and 'smile you sonofa .....' there is something here that everyone loves.And seeing it on the big screen just shows how terrifying the film really is compared to DVD. In some instances the film can be seen as an insight into consumerism, and the fact that traditional celebrations are vanishing. The shark could be a metaphor for the changes in economy, taking away part of the July 4th celebrations of Amity, encouraging regulars to go elsewhere in future, scuppering local business.But it's still a fun movie, with the film being infinitely better once it's the three men on the boat, being stalked by Bruce.An excellent film by all accounts, wonderful performances, and the film that you always think about when you go for a swim.",

A story that's so simple but so effective at the same time.Whilst watching the film you realise that Jaws wasn't just great because of the shark but it was great because of its characters. The characters of Brody, Quint and Hooper all played by the late Roy Scheider, the late Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss are so memorable. Their chemistry is perfect due to their conflicting personalities but in the end they work together as a team which is what makes this film feel so satisfying.Despite the many problems Spielberg encountered during the production of Jaws, he perservered and created something really magical and groundbreaking. It is impressive the amount of work he put into this film considering this was his second feature film. And how can I forget about the revolutionary score by John Williams.

            "content": "There's been a lot of debate about whether or not Jaws is a horror movie. Personally, I think it fits perfectly in the thriller category exclusively, but Spielberg captures exactly what horror is supposed to be in this film by creating a perfect marriage of seen an unseen, known and unknown by expertly withholding the shark for a large portion of the runtime. He creates horror out of long, well-shot scenes of people in peril that consistently increase in tension the longer you watch it instead of providing cheap-thrill jumpscares.This movie doesn't rely heavily on gore, either. In fact, there's only one truly graphic death in this film and it sets into motion the absolutely thrilling final moments of the film. The fact that a film about this deadly shark can be so effectively executed without a dependence on gore and overexposure of the shark is absolutely astounding. Perhaps one of the greatest things about Spielberg is that he only takes on a film project if he feels he has something unique to offer to the material, as was the case here.The acting is superb, without a single character or moment that took me out of the film. The pacing is second to none; this film, even before it hits its climactic scenes, is an interesting movie that keeps the viewer invested throughout. The shots are absolutely gorgeous (enhanced with the high definition restoration) and the script is fantastic.The fact of the matter is that whenever you put on a Steven Spielberg movie, no matter what it is, you know you're in for a ride because he's a genius filmmaker and this movie is no exception.",

In all honesty, I used to watch Jaws 1 through Revenge regularly on TV in my childhood (I remember staying up really late for USA Network marathons and being scared out of my wits \u0096 thank God for commercials!), and I wouldn't have been able to tell you that the original Jaws was the definitive, and only worthy Jaws movie at the time. Seriously, Jaws 3D was just as thrilling (and I didn't even know it was supposed to be in 3D!), and I vividly recall, having seen the first three of them several times, how excited I was when Jaws: The Revenge first appeared on TV (I was probably around 10). I wonder if I would have been happier had I remained just as ignorant. Hmm\u0085 Anyhow, I'm not, and, damn it, I can tell you that Steven Spielberg's Jaws is one of the single most amazing feats of film-making ever. It's just astounding how ingrained some of these images are in my head. And just how chilling the film remains after 30+ years. There is one moment that I wish I had forgotten, just so that I could experience it again for the first time: when Roy Scheider is shoveling chum into the water, facing the camera, and the shark jumps out of the water to catch some. This is the first time in the film that the monster appears without his trademark John Williams score (arguably the most well known score in the history of movies), and it's just a jump-out-of-your-skin moment. But, of course, I was expecting it to come, so I didn't exactly jump out of my skin. However, one moment I did forget made me do that: when Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, giving the film's best performance) is pulling the shark teeth out of the hull of the boat and that corpse pops out. Cheap scare, definitely, but, man, was I ever wound up just for the fact that he chose to check that boat out in the water! There's a little to complain about, mostly the completely ridiculous behavior of the animal. It begins to act completely unnaturally, seeking revenge, when, no matter how large it may be, any animal's going to flee that kind of onslaught. I doubt a shark is even this smart, but that creature, at best, would assume that the boat itself was the danger, and since the boat is much bigger than it, it would swim the hell away. At least it's not like Jaws: The Revenge, where the shark, the offspring of the original shark from Jaws, swims to (what would be uninhabitable) Caribbean waters to take its revenge on Roy Scheider's son! This was definitely one of the best theatrical experiences I've ever had. A ball and a half!",

It's this restraint that allows 'Jaws (1975)' to hold up as well as it does, with the stellar score combining with brief glimpses of the beast to tick us over until a woman is whisked beneath the waves or an unsuspecting swimmer's blood bubbles to the surface and by the time the animatronic actually pops up in full, we fully believe it because we're immersed into the world and invested in the characters that occupy it. It's a roller-coaster ride that fills you with every emotion on the spectrum, one that's impeccably crafted despite all its behind-the-scenes chaos, and the fact it can take its time to include a harrowing war story but still end on the explosive, frankly quite silly, note it does is actually rather commendable since it does all of it so utterly successfully. 8/10",

No film had ever made such an impact in the Summer Season until this movie hit the Silver Screen.The \"hidden menace\" is a great device to build a story around, because it is lurking just below the conscious and literal surface, and you must be ever vigilant to not be victimized.Benchleys Best Seller is about a rogue Great White Shark who infects the waters of Amity Island with dire consequences. In the mix is Sheriff Brody(Roy Scheider), whose disdain of the water is well documented. Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), denial is his strong suit, until the shark almost bites him in the ass. Sam Quint(Robert Shaw) as the crusty independent ex-navy sailor, whose life is on a crash course with destiny.Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) as the academic marine biologist whose style is 180 degrees of Quint.After a few swimmers are killed by the shark, the town of Amity hires Quint to find and kill him. Brody and Hooper go along for this sea adventure, and it gets intense. So there you have it , Great Director,Actors Script, Music, Score and Story. They all combine for a compelling time, and you will find yourself watching this darn film, over and over.Trivia: watching Richard Dreyfuss bite his lip when asked by Bob Costas if he was ever afraid of the shark, CLASSIC!By the way, there were different sharks used for the many scenes including half of a shark, left and right, even a shark on a dolly.Most of them suffered from mechanical failures.Trivia: The shooting stars overhead of Brody ,and later the boat are REAL. Usually the sign of Good Fortune. Different prints run 124 to 130 minutes.Trivia:Filmed in early spring, so look for allot of long sleeves.Gets a 10 out of 10 for just a Great Time !",

(This is an extended version of the review I wrote on February 2007)Did Steven Spielberg with his unforgettable classic JAWS invent the term \"blockbuster\"? Perhaps not entirely, but here's to be sure: The redefined it. Packed theaters and satisfied audiences proved that JAWS was the ultimate blockbuster. There first of its kind (and by the looks of it, it sure isn't the last).During the heyday of the horror genre during the 70's, there seems to be only one that were above the others. One, were even today, it's still can be remembered by beach-goers who saw it in the theaters during its release. Yes, you've heard it before. \"Duh-duh-duh-duh....\". Upon hearing that theme, you now what your in for.Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss give excellent performances in this classic. Director Steven Spielberg, very young at this time, did his best in directing. And the script is well written, it was like it was straight out of Peter Benchley's novel, which it was based on.This movie is a terrific scare machine for its day, lots of memorable bits and even scary until now if you keep it up your head a lot. Way, way better than the films which tried to duplicate it (not to mention a nice try first sequel, a campy 2nd sequel and a totally awful closure). Is JAWS still the blockbuster to beat? Well, if you judge a blockbuster by gripping suspense, sustaining thrills and a generally unseen shark, then it is. Rating: ***** out of 5.",

It's probably a good thing that the shark didn't work half the time, since in certain parts it doesn't look that convincing. Apart from that, what makes Jaws so much fun to watch over and over again is the amount of time that Spielberg invests with his three main characters. One of the best sequences is the second attack.  Brody slowly starts moving toward the pond, but his panic increases and he explodes into a full run. Pushing this along is John Williams' score that will forever be implanted in your mind.  The film reaches a palm sweating climax as the three shark hunters pursue, and get pursued by the shark.  Great movie that spawned three inferior sequels.",

The shark itself is a big reason for the movie's success. It is rarely ever shown; instead, Spielberg relied on suspense and point-of-view angles to build up the creature's final appearance in the climax - and when it is shown, it looks fantastic. It is practical effects in all its glory, and you can really tell the team put a lot of effort into building it.The characters are of course fantastic as well. Roy Scheider, Richard DreyFuss and Robert Shaw are amazing as the three leads and all complement each other with their different personalities and back-and-forth banter.This movie was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, which was well deserved, as it is truly a masterpiece and a testament to Steven Spielberg's talent!",

Yes, the whole background story on the movie came out years ago, their mechanical shark kept sinking, etc, but as for the final product: (let me repeat) everything worked. Score, acting, dialogue, suspense, realism, plot development, urgency, you name it. I have read the book, and of course there were changes \u2013 anyone yet comment on the missing love affair between Brody's wife and Hooper? \u2013 but, all novels change from page to screen. What Spielberg did was amazing. He didn't create a horror movie. Nor a shark movie. It was a movie concerning a small town 100% reliant on tourism and if anything goes against that, whether economy, weather, bad publicity or in this case, shark attacks, the town could go under. I never labeled this movie as a horror or monster movie. To me, it was an adventure and a suspense movie reliant on one man, an outsider, to battle something that will destroy both the local economy but also the islanders themselves. You get rich history and depth from the Mayor, Ellen Brody, Hooper, (especially) Quint and of course, Chief Brody. Heck, the whole town's inhabitants are rich in character. Honestly, skip the sequels. As a kid, I loved Jaws 2, but as an adult, watching all 4 (so far) films, only the original Jaws was worth watching.",

            "content": "*** \"It's all psychological. You yell barracuda, everybody says, \"Huh? What?\" You yell shark, we've got a panic on our hands.\" These words come from the mouth of Mr. Vaughn, Amityville's irresponsible mayor played by Murray Hamilton. Maybe he's right to a certain extent: \"It's all psychological\" but the tremendous talent of Steven Spielberg, a precocious 28-year old director, was to translate our primal fears into this terrifying experience that challenges all our perceptions.*** \"Jaws\", #56 in the American Film Institute's (AFI) Top 100 Films ***A position even more impressive when you realize that \"Jaws\" was doomed from the beginning. The movie had a monster-type villain, not really realistic, a B-movie plot premise, some colorful characters that confine to caricature, all the ingredients to be in the best case, a spectacular but unsubstantial success in the same vein than \"Towering Inferno\" or \"Poseidon Adventure\". But \"Jaws\" hid all these flaws thanks to a very masterful editing and combined the talents of many professionals at the top of their game for an effective result, and I still wonder why Spielberg didn't get an Oscar nomination for this is the true measure of his real talent. Anyways, in 1975, \"Jaws\" became the most successful film ever, with an indisputable classic feeling, and one film can't reach such an iconic status, only thanks to a successful marketing campaign. If it worked, it's because it succeeded on the basic premises of a horror and thriller film, to scare and to thrill the hell out of you. *** Jaws\", #2 in AFI's Top 100 Thrills ***I didn't say \"A terrifying experience that challenges all our perceptions\" for the sake of it. The film plunges you in the hostile ocean's depths inhabited by a mysterious and threatening presence. Spielberg emphasizes the notion of 'presence' playing with our instinctive paranoia, basically what scares us the most is 'what we don't know but feel', or 'what we know and can't see'. The cinematography depicts the vastness of the ocean in an oddly claustrophobic way, suggesting that what we see is from the bottom, from the shark's perspective. Since our empathy is fixed on the people swimming, there's a disturbing feeling of an approaching danger when the camera slowly zooms on the victim. And when the first contact happens \u0085 well, I wasn't born at that time, I had the luck to hide under a table when I was 10, but I can imagine the effect of these bloody outbursts, high-pitched screams or disturbing gurgles in the movie theaters. I can see people jumping out of their seats, their hearts guided by the film's iconic score.**** \"Jaws\", #6 in AFI's Top 25 Scores ***Each death is memorable in its own way, and as we get more familiar with the shark, the level of graphicness gets more and more gruesome. The dosage between the 'seen' and 'unseen', is so skillfully handled that the parts without the shark are sometimes more terrifying because we know the surprise is to come. As Spielberg said, half of the film's success is due to John William's score. Basically, they are only two simple notes repeated over and over again, with dramatic variations, adapted to the situation but these notes form a music that efficiently conducts the anguish in our blood till our hearts, like whispering, \"he comes \u2013 he comes \u2013 he comes\" or \"danger \u2013 danger \u2013danger\". Like \"Psycho\"'s screeching violins, the Oscar winning score conveys the perfect feeling of an approaching, and yes, imminent danger: the shark coming straight, from the bottom, the mouth open-wide to welcome you.**** The Shark, #17 in AFI's Top Villains ***Spielberg broke every rule regarding the deaths. My mention of two disaster films earlier isn't fortuitous since one of the genre's most stupid yet respected codes is to spare the beautiful scared girl, the kid (generally annoying), and the pet animal. Well, in \"Jaws\", they are the first three victims, like the hell with conventions. The shark in an animal killer, who doesn't select his victims on a demographical basis, and this is the scariest aspect of the film, no one can be spared, the simplicity of the film presents the shark as a villain, while it's just an animal who eats for its survival. But when a shark kills such innocent creatures, how can you perceive it differently? The horrific poster alone embodies this traumatic vision of an animal ferocious and big enough to erase you from the face of the sea in one bite.*** \"You're gonna need a bigger boat\", #35 in AFI's Top 100 Quotes ***The sentence describes a particularly insurmountable situation or an unbeatable enemy. But is the boat too big or the humans too small? It's the eternal fight between Men and Nature, Nature that affirms its God-like strength and human their right to colonize every space in the world, even the ocean. And the three characters, the first top billed actors embody the three different faces of this eternal fight. The Chief of Police Martin Brody (Roy Sheider) is responsible of the security, Matt Hopper (Richard Dreyfuss) is the oceanographer, who respects nature and dedicated his passionated life to sharks and Quint is the colorful and scene-stealing veteran sea captain (Robert Shaw) the man who learned from nature the way the animals should be treated. The protector, the observer, the fighter, each one feels involved with that fight, until they unite their forces for an exhilarating adventure: to kill the shark.*** I mentioned many times \"Jaws\"'s recognition by the American Film Institute, but what works so well is that the film is extremely well-acted, involves endearing characters, inspiring our sympathy. It's indeed about survival instinct, and a reminder that sometimes courage is about dominating one fear. This is the noblest purpose of horror films, and \"Jaws\" succeeds more than any other",

So when a great white shark invades the beaches of his city, he is left with no choice but to take desperate measures: the shark must be captured and destroyed at all costs. Let the adventure begin.What can you say that hasn't already been said about a film that is not only one of the top horror films of all time, but also one of the top films of any genre (even in the top 100)? There really isn't very much, but I just have to sing my praises for this film anyway.\"Jaws\" comes to us from director Steven Spielberg, whom I've had my issues with. I've often found him to be a weak director, not a risk taker and obsessed with little boys. His films can be categorized into two columns: those about aliens, and those about Jews. \"E.T.\", \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"Jurassic Park\" are alien movies. So is \"Jaws\" -- an alien creature invades a peaceful small town. A town where the chief has two young boys (although this is played down).I actually watched \"Jaws\" for the first time rather late in life, but was already a fan before I ever saw it. I am and have been a huge fan of Kevin Smith since 1995 when I saw \"Mallrats\" opening day. Smith has used \"Jaws\" references in almost all his films, putting the injury discussion scene into \"Chasing Amy\" and naming many of his characters after Jaws characters. \"Mallrats\" gave us Brody, Bruce, Quint... and later we'd have Hooper. (Bruce is the name of the shark.) And we have a young Richard Dreyfuss. How does that not make a movie by itself? Robert Shaw is great and Roy Scheider was fine, but Dreyfuss really steals the show. And a score from the legendary John Williams? Never a bad idea. Especially now in hindsight, thirty-two years later. Even if you haven't seen \"Jaws\", you know the theme song.Oh, that Richard Dreyfuss. The scene where he is slamming coffee to compete with Shaw's beer, and crushes the cup... awesome. Best cup/can crushing scene ever, even more so than \"Lone Wolf McQuade\". And who can deny this film is very quotable (\"head, tail, the whole damn thing\" and \"you're gonna need a bigger boat\" come to mind). That makes a film iconic, when quotes from it show up in popular culture.How do you end a review about the greatest shark movie ever? A movie that vastly eclipses \"Shark Attack 3: Megalodon\" and \"Hammerhead\"? You simply can't do it enough justice. This film is everything a movie should be, and it has a shark. What more do you want?",

I reviewed Jaws the revenge because of its awfulness. I just needed to vent my anger. I reviewed The Shallows because I believed it could have been a worthy sequel to the original Spielberg classic. Just insert famous John Williams score and off you go you've doubled your box office receipts. \nHowever it's about time I reviewed the best. The original. The daddy of all shark movies.\nFrom the opening sounds of the ocean and its contents as the universal logo appears at the start of this masterpiece, an eerie ambiance is created. Spielberg manages to build tension right here at the very beginning even before we have seen anything. Jaws is a special movie. One that paved the way for all blockbusters that followed. This film is over 40 years old now and despite the special effects at the end of the movie looking dated it still stands up today. However the dated SFX take nothing away from what is one of the best thrillers of all time. The very fact that we don't see the shark until the finale proves just how well Spielberg managed to grip his audience. \nThe opening sequence where we witness the demise of young Chrissie Watkins is truly terrifying. Apparently her screams were for real. The pain caused by being attached to cables and being dragged back and forth through the water by a gang of stuntmen to create the desired effect took its toll on the young actress. Talk to anyone who loves this film and they will all tell you about certain scenes that still work to this very day. Scenes that are embedded into their consciousness.\nFor me agood example is when the head of Ben Gardner drops out of the bottom of the boat. \nI must've seen Jaws over thirty times and every time I watch that scene I still end up clinging to the ceiling as it makes me jump out of my seat. The story is a simple one. A giant Great white shark has taken up residence around the island of Amity. By doing so it begins to terrorise and eat the tourists. Not good for business as Amity relies on these visitors for its summer dollars. So It's up to chief Brody played by Roy Scheider to make the beaches safe again. This is no easy task as the towns mayor doesn't want the beaches closed. \nScheider is sublime as the reluctant hero.\nA man forced to face his own fears in order to save the day.\nBrody teams up with shark expert Hooper played by Richard Dreyfus and they set off on a quest to try and catch the monsterous fish. \nDreyfus's character compliments Schneider's.\nThey bounce off each other. One man afraid of the ocean, the other man in love with it.\nTo accomplish this they require the help of shark hunter Quint played by the excellent Robert Shaw. Three very different characters huddled together on one small boat. \nQuint hates the ocean. Or at least what dwells within it. So here we have three very different view points from three very different people.\nJaws is as much of a character driven piece as it is a movie about a giant shark. \nPerhaps the greatest scene in the entire movie is when all three are in the boat sharing their stories. There's no shark, just an excellent piece of acting.\nRobert Shaw's haunting yet mesmerising telling of the time he spent on the USS Indianapolis.\nThis is a Jaws prequel in itself. Why they haven't done this is beyond me. There's an idea! \nMaybe I should write it and make my millions. It could be called 'Quint Begins!' After all it worked for Batman. \nInstead the audience has been subjected to three crappy sequels. OK I'll admit it, Jaws 2 is watchable. \nThe original Jaws is in my book is one of the best movies ever made. A film that is easy to watch over and over again. The sound, music, editing and cinematography are great and it is obvious to see how and why this became the original blockbuster. An event movie with substance. Based on the novel by Peter Benchley. Jaws the movie is much more streamlined compared to the novel. The film sets out to be a focused thriller and doesn't detract too much with overblown character subplots. Spielberg still manages to flesh out the movies characters and gives the audience a reason to care for what will happen to them. The movies finale differs also from the novel. In true Hollywood fashion the shark goes out with a bang compared to the books much more subtle ending. \nSecondary characters are also well portrayed giving the movie an entirely polished cast. By the end the of the film I was reluctant to say goodbye to the characters. This is probably why Jaws 2 is watchable. That movie itself is poor in comparison to the original but it's nice to see some old friends once again.\nIf we look at Jaws today we must be fair and cast aside the rather primitive special effects.\nSpielberg would not have created the great movie he did if Bruce the shark worked or if he had the access to state of the art CGI.\nWhat we don't see is much more terrifying that what is made visible.\nThat uneasy feeling you get when you swim out into the ocean whilst on holiday. \nWhat horrors lurk just beneath the surface? \nIt is the horrors that lurk in our imagination that really frighten us.\n \nJaws is a movie close to my heart. Childhood memories of hiding behind the sofa. Acting out the movie in the playground with friends. The toy game and all other merchandise that followed. A true blockbuster. The original blockbuster. The one that paved the way.",

            "content": "Widely regarded by critics & viewers alike as one of the greatest, scariest & most influential films of all time, Jaws is Steven Spielberg's breakthrough feature that didn't only catapulted his career to great heights but also ended up establishing the modern Hollywood business model by becoming the first blockbuster in cinema history.Set in a fictional Amity Island, the story concerns a town sheriff, a marine scientist & a local fisherman who team up to hunt down a gigantic great white shark which has been terrorizing their small island community but once they set out to sea, they only end up discovering themselves as the ones who are being hunted by the great white.Produced on low budget, the masterful creativity of director Steven Spielberg is at full display here as he didn't only film it with great emphasis on plot & development but brilliantly amplified the tension as well by not explicitly showing us the shark for the majority of its runtime while not denying its presence either and when he did show it, it made many jump off their seats.Also supporting great direction is this film's tense screenplay, honest performances from its entire cast, great use of camera, superb editing and finally, the biggest contributor in turning Jaws into an absolutely bone-chilling experience, John Williams' tense score which elevated the horror to new heights & made the film twice as effective.Nearly 40 years have passed since this fright classic hit the screen & yet, even after countless imitations, it retains its ability to frighten the viewers with the same fervour as it did in the 1970s. A haunting masterpiece that made an entire generation afraid of ever stepping into the ocean again, Jaws has very effectively managed to stand the test of time & will hopefully continue to do so for many more decades.Immortal for its contribution to the genres of horror & suspense and a watershed moment for cinema itself, this unforgettable chiller remains one of Steven Spielberg's finest achievements in the film industry and without a shadow of a doubt comes highly recommended.",

I can't really put my finger on why, but I'll try to figure it out.Music-this movie has an amazing score by John Williams. The 2 note motif is memorable enough, but the best cues for me are Blown to Bits and End Title, the latter especially. The theme has a seafaring quality to it, culminating in the two lead characters swimming back to shore to safety.It's a buddy movie-Richard Dreyfus, Robert Shaw, and Roy Schneider are incredible in this. They are each unique and their characters are extremely well developed. They play off each other well and their interactions are realistic without getting boring. It culminates in the scene where Shaw talks about the Indianapolis.Suspense-the film creates tension from the first scene, increasing in intensity as the film moves forward. The genius of the film is that it doesn't reveal the shark until the second half. It is a fortunate twist of fate that the mechanical shark didn't work.Story-I never read the novel this is based on, but the story is very interesting. The plot moves forward and there isn't a lag in it. Each scene is important and draws the viewer in.That special Spielberg magic--there is something that cannot be duplicated, and it is those Spielberg touches that really make this film come alive. The scene between Scheider and his son. The scene with the shooting star. The final scene with Scheider and Dreyfus, as they swim back to shore. The \"we need a bigger boat\" scene. Etc etc etc.",

The main characters are unforgettable, especially Chief Brody, Matt Hooper, and Quint and most of the top notch dialogue is terrific. Naturally, the most memorable lines revolve around Quint's legendary story about how they \"delivered the bomb\" considering how many of the men were killed by sharks. Anyway, the real star of Jaws is Bruce the shark, and how Spielberg keeps it hidden from us before we see the actual beast. This is better than any silly CGI knock off could be considering this is from the summer of 1975. This is one of movies, like Goodfellas, that I make sure to catch at least a few times per year, no matter the season. It never bores me, thanks to perfect and flawless film-making and legendary performances, scenes, and atmosphere throughout.",

It frightened so many people off from swimming, no one I knew would go out to the deep water anymore after seeing it. It left such a psychic residue. It scares you by making you hyper-sensitive to a situation you took for granted before. Some people I know would still freak out if I even mention this subject as we enter the water.

            "content": "The 1975 blockbuster film 'Jaws' heralded the auspicious start of the directing career of Steven Spielberg, one of the greatest American directors of all time. He has redefined movies again and again and this is ostensibly where it all started. Based on the novel by Peter Benchley, who also wrote the initial screenplay, 'Jaws' stars Roy Scheider as Chief Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper and Robert Shaw as Quint. This is the film that first defined the summer blockbuster and set a standard that the studios would continue to use for the next 40 years which tied in marketing as well as a massive release strategy. The film also features one of the most iconic musical themes of all time created by John Williams to represent impending shark disaster, and which took on even more meaning to represent the shark's presence when the props continuously failed. The film became the highest grossing movie off all time, but would only hold that achievement for two years until the release of 'Star Wars'.The story here is very simple and straightforward yet contains a surprising amount of nuance and subtlety encased in its shark attack plot. Chief Brody is a new sheriff about to begin his first summer in charge of a New England resort community on Amity Island. People start dying and it becomes apparent that a large great white shark has staked a claim off Amity Island. The film exists in two distinct halves. The first is introduction and figuring out the shark exists and poses a legitimate threat. Brody is trying to take action, but receives push back from community leaders who fear losing summer tourist dollars. The second half, once the threat has accurately been determined, involves Chief Brody commissioning shark hunter Quint to catch and kill this monster shark. Brody and the young oceanographer Hooper also go along on this quest. The rest of the picture is entirely focused on these disparate men as they interact and attempt to hunt and kill the creature on Quint's trawler Orca. Brody just wants to see the job done. Hooper represents the modern day scientific school of thought whereas Quint is about as old school working class as it gets. He is crass, belligerent and angry and draws direct parallels to Captain Ahab. He is one of my favorite characters in film. The overall all plot is so simple, but filmed and acted so incredibly well, and of course there are the classic lines throughout the film... \"That's some bad hat Harry,\" and \"We're gonna need a bigger boat.\" Quint dies horribly as the shark destroys the Orca, but the chief settles the score with one well placed bullet. \"Smile you son of a...\" BOOM!This is essentially a perfect movie. The acting, plot and script are all first rate. Quint is channeled like a force of nature more than an actor tackling a role. The score is beyond iconic. Famously the shark was supposed to be much more visible, but due to malfunctions and a troubled shoot Spielberg had to improvise and the limited views you get of the shark make it that much more ominous and scary and meaningful when they do occur. The relatively sedate USS Indianapolis scene among the three men on the boat is one of my favorite written scenes in any movie especially for one based entirely on dialogue. I absolutely love this movie. No single aspect here dominates and everything merges together to form something that is elevated beyond the sum of its parts. It is just a movie about a shark attack, but feels like so much more when you're watching it, and I, for one, adore it. Easily one of my top ten favorite films of all time. I think this Spielberg guy has a future in Hollywood.Eric's Grade: A.",

When a rouge shark stakes his territory off the shore of Amity Island, the community responds first with disbelief then shock as the shark repeatedly takes victims.3 men venture out to catch the shark. Salty sea dog and shark hunter Quint has his own reasons, which I won't reveal here, but are not so dissimilar to that of Captain Ahab in Moby Dick. Hooper, a marine scientist has always been fascinated by sharks. Police Chief Brody who is scared of the water who must protect his community and his own family.Each person is an interesting character, and that is what makes the movie special. Mostly importantly it has the shark, a genuine monster that regularly causes the deaths of people in modern countries. If you have ever even paddled in the ocean you have visited the home of monsters.This movie is fabulous adaption of Peter Benchley's very famous book. The formula created in this movie for the battle between these men and the beast has been copied endlessly in monster movies since, but never so well.It genuinely reawakened humans fears of sharks (but shark fear was written about in Jule's Verne's 20,000 Leagues under the sea) and stopped people going to the beach. However, Peter Benchley has since spent much of his life campaigning against his own book for the preservation of sharks. In truth sharks don't often eat people, the usually take a bite, think \"yuk\" and spit them out again.It is a movie that should be on everyone's must see list and worth returning to if you are feeling jaded by some of the current monster fests.",

            "content": "I first saw Jaws in 1975 and found it one of the most thrilling movies I'd ever seen. It became one of the most parodied movies of the 1900's because of the use of a huge mechanical shark that was more funny than terrifying. I can honestly say, however, that the movie still is great entertainment. I think it panders to our innate fear of what is unseen and lurks under the surface of the water. In fact, the glimpses of the fin and the outline of the creature under the water were more effective than the closeups of that huge, fake mouth. In the movie, the small resort town in Maine is the victim of the ocean monster which pops up in its major tourist attraction, its ocean playground. Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfus were just starting to make their mark and both excelled in Jaws. Director Stephen Spielberg went on to create many more great productions. Robert Shaw's performance as shark hunter Quint is memorable as the character who has a love-hate relationship with killer sharks. The movie is about a small resort town terrorized by the 25 foot shark at the start of the summer tourist season. The sudden crisis pits police officer Brody, played by Scheider, against the town mayor (played by Murray Hamilton) and the local merchants. The first attack takes place unexpectedly in the dead of night. The police chief is unable to get authorization to shut down the beach and the death toll mounts. The audience is gripped with tension every time the camera zooms in on the swimmers. In his quest to hunt and kill the shark, Scheider is aided by the erratic and foolhardy Quint (Shaw) and Hooper (Dreyfus), a trained shark expert who is often at odds with Quint. The incredible size of the shark stuns both Hooper and Quint but the challenge raises their resolve to fight and the two men become comrades in their fight against the beast. Scheider marshals the talents of Quint and Hooper and draws on his own substantial reserve of courage. What follows is a classic man vs. beast struggle. At one point we get some comic relief on the boat as Quint and Hooper compare battle scars, while drowning their fears in alcohol. Quint also tells a harrowing tale where sailors perish during the war in shark infested waters waiting for help. Note: Robert Shaw, who played the shark hunter, died only three years after the release of this move at age 51. He was a writer and an alumni of the British theatre scene, who also played in movies alongside Sean Connery and Richard Burton. Shaw lived a full life and as well as his career as an actor, he was married three times and had ten children.",

However there are good popcorn movies and bad popcorn movies.(Indeed there are popcorn movies that fall in to the middle.)I was in the playground when this movie came out and the school morons thought this was fantastic - \"did you see that naked woman being bitten in half - wasn't that great. All that blood in the water - fantastic!\" They said, wide-eyed with wonder. (In most movies rated PG women are not bitten in half, so congratulations to Steven S for getting a horror movie stunt shown to kids. And he repeated the trick in Jurassic Park!)I am sorry that special effects were anything other than special in the 1970's. Yes the shark looks as dead as a dodo, but sharks do look a bit like that anyway. I have been to one of the few places where you can view sharks close to in safety and they do look a bit dead-in-the-eye. They like to come very close just to see you!At the risk of starting a \"I'm right - you're wrong\" debate, let us look at what this is: A cheap thrill ride. Psycho and The Shinning were also cheap thrill rides, so let us not knock it for that, but it is worthless as any kind of document about sharks. A few rouge and hungry sharks kill humans, but they really don't like us much. Of all the food in the sea we are among their least favourite!(Does Steven S ever think how much misinformation he has given the world with this film?)The opening shots are, as our school moron said before, skillful and shocking. John Williams is a genius and produces more fright with a chamber orchestra than Spielberg does with a film camera! A master craftsman at work. Sadly the script is flabby and indeed it is just an exercise in filling time before the next cheap thrill or even cheap thrill that never happens. When this film moves it moves well - but Schneider's paranoia is one note and pointless. We know he is right and the town-folk masses are wrong. A better script would have made him doubt himself.We have read about how difficult life filming \"on the boat\" was. The steady cam - not available at the time - was designed to overcome these problems. It looks like they quit early, they could (and should) have extended the climax having kept us waiting for it for so long. Films like The Perfect Storm show that you can keep a scene going longer than they realized in the 1970's.What I learned from Jaws is that films can get away with the murder if they open and finish well. What people who own the video or DVD do in the scenes that involve Schneider's troubled domestic life I don't know - probably hit fast forward I guess.Most blockbusters are actually poor movies: Spiderman, Superman and Batman got a lot of hype and word-of-mouth - but future generations will see them as the flimsy flashy trash that they really are. What is the legacy of Jaws - spreading a load of c**p about the nature of sharks and making teenyboppers - who have even seen a real horror movie - scream?Yes - there are plus points. Lots of pros at work both behind and in front of the camera and a great score - but all these people working their hardest cannot disguise that all they are working with a third rate pulp novel from a third rate novelist.",

With remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels, franchises, and cinematic universes taking over our local cinemas each mid-year, it's easy to forget that this whole business started with the troubled production of Jaws. Spielberg's coming-out party stands-out 40 years later as a timeless piece of pure capital-F Filmmaking that surpasses most, if not all, that it influenced. With spectacular characters and thrilling scares, it still makes audiences pause before getting in the water. The modern-day leviathan tale of a tourist town dependent on out-of-towners for their economy (sound familiar, Panama City?) terrorized by a giant shark on July 4th is celebrating its 40th year of keeping audiences dry. The zeitgeist moments are wonderful (jumping mechanical sharks, \"you're gonna need a bigger boat\"), but those thrills are matched by the timelessly human characters and dialogue. Spielberg grounds the excitement in enough reality to keep us engaged, specifically in the three men at the center. Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw have incomparable chemistry, playing some of the most endearing individuals in movie history. Sure, the mechanics of the shark itself are somewhat antiquated but that's to be expected. I can only imagine what we will think of the effects in Jurassic World in 2055.

It's a perfect lesson in fear, suspense and some jump scares (and a little bit in small town politics and tourism), great soundtrack by John Williams, great camera work and cut, great actors and a great early movie from Steven Spielberg.The movie still works. It's one of the best horror movies that doesn't get boring at all, even after decades and multiple viewings in all these years, I like to watch it.Highly recommended.If you haven't seen it yet: A must-see!",

Fourth, there's just no reason to keep going. The only flaw that I can think of is that the shark looks kinda fake in one or two scenes but you know what? I'll take Bruce (the shark's nickname, named after Spielberg's lawyer) over anything that would be produced these days, i.e. a badly fitting, CGI monstrosity.

I just want to talk about one particular scene in the movie that, for me, lifted it above ordinary thriller material and put me in awe of what an actor can do.That's the scene when Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw are on the boat \"Orca,\" and they're all sitting around a table in the galley and they're slightly drunk. They start comparing scars, and Dreyfuss or Scheider, can't remember which, notices the tattoo that Shaw has. The one with the name \"USS Indianapolis\".When Shaw describes what happened to the men on the Indianapolis, what it was like, in that one scene, he makes the character of Sam Quint real, and completely understandable. Shaw makes the whole movie live and breath and crystalize in that one scene.I didn't get to see many movies when I was growing up, and when I went away to college I didn't have time or money to go to the movies. I didn't actually get to see Jaws when it first came out. But when I had time to see movies and could actually watch them on the VCR, this scene in \"Jaws\" was the first that actually left me in awe of what an actor could do, if he was good enough. If the material was good enough.After the movie was over, I couldn't wait to hunt up information on the USS Indianapolis and the events Shaw described. This wasn't as easy back then, around 1980, as it is now: there was no internet, so if you wanted to research something, you had to go to the library and try to find a book or magazine or archival newspaper stories. Well, I found a book about the Indianapolis and I was fascinated.I was awe-struck at the power Robert Shaw had to evoke the tragedy of the Indianapolis in that one scene. For me, that one scene made the whole movie. Shaw made me understand the character he played, and got through to make me feel the primal fear a shark can evoke.That's a powerful talent. And Shaw certainly was a powerful talent; I loved him in \"The Sting\" and in \"A Man for All Seasons.\" But I think I saw him truly at his best in those magical moments of that one scene in \"Jaws,\" when through his talent he broke through the gloss of fanciful entertainment and got right to the heart of terror, and in so doing lifted a summer suspense thriller above the ordinary into the extraordinary. I am thankful for Shaw and his art.",

            "content": "Few can argue that \"Jaws\" was the best shark/sea adventure movie ever made. A plot and character-driven work of art, so many scenes are memorable that it's hard to know where to begin -- the famous \"Indianapolis\" scene, where Robert Shaw blows us away with his acting; Hooper's confrontation in the shark cage; Quint's mad run for shore, with the shark chasing the boat; and of course the finale where (surprise!) it's Chief Brody who scores the triumph over the shark.Some may complain about the mechanical shark, with which there were endless problems during filming.  Before you do so, try to imagine it being done with computer graphics.  I'd rather see a few obviously fake-looking scenes (and really, there were VERY few of these) than see that shark in (un)glorious CGI.  So many movies these days take the cheap way out with computer graphics... it takes great artistry to make computer-generated images look seamless and real.  Many filmmakers don't seem to realize that, or they just don't care, and so we get obviously digital-looking junk.Spielberg has finally relented and is releasing Jaws on DVD this summer! Look for many glorious extras -- I'm positive a brand new \"making of\" is already completed, or is in the works.  Now those who were too young to see it at the theater when it came out (I was 11, and lucky enough to see it on the big screen) will get to see it in much of its original, restored glory. If you don't have a big-screen TV or home theater system, watch it on a computer DVD-player (preferably with surround-sound speakers) for a simulated big-screen experience.Rating: 10/10",

The problem is, if they filmed it as written, it would have been confusing, the characters unlikable (seriously, you'd have been cheering for the Shark!) and the subplots weren't even logical. Thankfully, they scrapped almost all of it in Carl Gottlieb's rewrite.Then you have the factor of Spielberg himself, then a young, cutting edge director. (As opposed to today, where he's such a mega-producer, no one dares tell him he's making garbage like \"IJ4: Crystal Skull\".).Finally, you had the actors, perfectly cast for these parts, taking them and making them their own.",

Cinematic portrayals of islands off Cape Cod as Martha's Vinyard is another.

            "content": "\u00a8What we are dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution. All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks, and that's all.\u00a8 Jaws marked a before and after in American Cinema; it became the first true Blockbuster movie and it has since influenced films for 35 years. Before Jaws came out, there weren't any summer movies (perhaps many critics regret this since summer movies aren't necessarily recognized for its artistic value), but this movie set the standard for what a summer movie should look like. Jaws also launched the career of Steven Spielberg as a director since he was largely unknown by the general public. So you may ask yourself what made this film such a success. There are a great amount of factors that I consider helped turn Peter Benchley's bestselling novel into such a terrific thriller. First of all John Williams's score is breathtaking. The suspense he created with a few notes that accompanied the shark's point of view with the camera where masterful. There was no need to see the terrible shark; the music alone built the fear in us. Sometimes we fear more what is unseen than what is actually seen, and in the case of the shark it was much scarier not knowing where it was going to come out from in the water. The shark tales and pictures we see of people who have been attacked by sharks throughout the beginning of the movie are sufficient enough. Spielberg has already inserted fear in our minds before we even have a chance to see the actual beast. This technique was one of the reasons the movie was so successful. Everyone remembers the speech about the sinking of the USS Indianapolis as one of the highlights of the film and that is because it worked just like a scary tale in the middle of a campfire in the woods works, because it takes the atmosphere and the context and plays with our imagination inserting fear into our minds.Jaw takes place in a fictitious island resort named Amity Island. Summer is approaching and the town is getting ready to receive thousands of tourists coming to its beautiful beaches, but a local teenager has just appeared washed up in the shore attacked by some sort of animal, probably a shark. Local Police Chief, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), is investigating the incident. According to the forensic report the cause of death was a shark attack. Brody thinks it is best to close down the beaches until the shark can be killed, but Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) stops him and says this will have a huge economical impact on the town. It is too soon to scare off the tourists and he gets the forensic doctor to change his report on the cause of death, so Brody reluctantly has to follow the Mayor's orders. The next day another incident takes place, although this time it occurs in plain sight, and a local boy is killed by a shark. Brody closes the beach and the boy's mother offers a reward to whoever catches the shark. Sam Quint (Robert Shaw) is the local shark hunter who knows they are dealing with a very big shark and tells the Mayor that if he wants the shark hunted then he will have to get paid a lot more than the reward the woman is offering. Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) is an Oceanographer who comes to the Island to help Chief Brody with the case. Together Hooper, Brody, and Quint set sail on the Orca to try to hunt the shark that has everyone panicking. They will soon find out that they are gonna need a bigger boat.Jaws is considered by many as one of the greatest thrillers ever made. It is no surprise that after this movie came out very few people wanted to get into the water. The shark was in everyone's nightmares. Jaws actually took home three Oscars, one for the musical score, another for the Sound effects, and a third for best editing under Verna Fields who took a lot of the credit for the success of the movie during that time. Spielberg was overlooked as a director, but he later proved in his other movies he was one of the reasons the film was so successful. He was a visionary in his field and was able to create one of the best thrillers without great visual effects. The secret was building the suspense through the unseen and showing the shark as little as possible. By the end of the film we were so immersed in it that we even believed the improbable ending and didn't even feel cheated by that final climax scene. Spielberg combined suspense and thrills with comedy and action to perfection. Each character played an important part in the film and Brody, Hooper, and Quint became popular characters in movie history. This may have been one of Spielberg's first films, but it still ranks among his best work because it managed to terrify audiences for ages to come.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "I cannot think of anything I would change about this movie. The acting is first rate. Shaw, Dreyfuss, and Scheider are all exceptional, one of the best matching in any film. The screenplay is well written, following Peter Benchley's book fairly closely, but dropping a needless romantic subplot, instead focusing more on the shark itself. A funny scene with the three men sharing a laugh on the boat one night while comparing scars perfectly segues into Shaw's chilling monologue about the USS Indianapolis, in another of the film's best scenes. The film next shows us the book's climax, about a half an hour before the real ending of the film- it very successfully tricks the audience into thinking the end is near, but then pulls the rug out from under our feet, and adds another act of (exceptional) new material. It leaves the audience members who had read the book prior to seeing the film wondering \"That's how they killed the shark in the book, now what? Now what are they going to do to kill it?\" The screenplay follows the book's story closely, but adds enough quality material to keep it unpredictable, and keep the audience guessing how it could end. The shark effects are well done, and we don't see the shark very often, leaving our imaginations to run wild with ideas about it. But when we first see the shark full on, as it jumps out of the water as Scheider is throwing chum overboard for it, and his startled, yet deliberately calm reaction is priceless. A good jump scare, as well as being intentionally funny, which is not an easy combination to pull off. One of the best scenes ever filmed. I had the pleasure of watching this in a cinema in 2012, and I, and the rest of the audience, laughed and applauded this scene.A victim's leg slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean always stands out in my mind as well.A thin story, basically an update of a 1950s monster movie, made into a classic film, with more suspense than it has any right to have, this is one of the finest ever made, one which I never grow tired of watching.",

You have a ocean full of perfectly edible creatures. Yet the SUPER shark only munches on people from one particular beach in New England. Yeah,un-huh, sure.But guess what, it works. Spielberg wisely builds up the suspense. We know the shark is out there and hungry. Yet we have to use our imagination on just how scary the shark is. So the tension and suspence builds and builds as the movie progresses. The New England setting works effectively. The extras all look and act like normal people. Giving the movie a sense of believability that say a Flordia beach setting would lack. The acting is wonderful. Shaw,Scneider and Dreyfuss throw themselves completely into their roles. Even if the characters are rather one dimensional. You can almost feel their fear at the climax. John Williams music is tight, but effective. Usually when Williams scores a movie he practically has music for every scene. (Which most of the time is a good thing) But keeping it to a minimum it's builds the suspence.

Jaws came out in 1975 and is now considered one of the greatest films of all time with it being the ninth highest grossing film of all time and there is a few reasons why it's a amazing film. I won't rehash the plot because you already know what it's about for God's sake; a man eating shark attacking Martha's Vineyard but the film is so good for many things. 1. The direction, the direction in this film is brillaintly done and probably some of the best ever in cinema to me, 2. It's too creepy too watch, for me, Jaws is too creepy to watch, it always has me turning away at the underwater scenes and 3. It has the scariest and most creepiest score ever, that shark theme will always stay with me like, forever. Jaws is a classic and one of my favourite horror films that if you have not, obviously, please watch it!",

This is one of those movies you cannot go without seeing at least once in your life, or even once a year. No matter how many times you watch it, it always has you on the edge of your seat. I remember being scared of going in the water for a week or 2 every time I watched this in the summer. It still give me chills every now and then. One reason could be that it was based off the book \"Close to Shore\" which was about a real series of shark attacks on the South Jersey Shore...which is where I live! This movie had a huge impact on me for the reason that the town of Amity is much like where I live and could very well be attacked by a shark. Well...aside from the solid story, we have an excellent cast. Roy Sheider plays the unforgettable, smart, paranoid Chief Martin Brody, who serves as a very good protagonist here. Robert Shaw plays a very grizzly, creepy Quint; who besides the shark, seems to be the Antagonist here. Richard Dreyfuss plays a very know-it-all, smart Hooper. The other actors were all great as well, not one can be replaced it seems. This movie deserves its place on the top 250. 10/10 Seems like a good score.",

            "content": "If there was ever a candidate for 'the perfect movie', then I believe this would be it. The third item from my 8 titles that have earned a perfect scoring. It offers something more 'mainstream' than The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly in regards to content, characters, themes. The storytelling is simply excellent, with the character introspection and development of the three main guys... it is perfect. Each has their motivations, their past, their goals all exposed during this creeping doom scenery when the shark stalks the coast of Amity Island.On the surface level where most people would watch this, you get a very well constructed 'monster movie', which of course has now been copied a thousand times over. In Jaws, this tale is perfectly paced and filmed.Deeper than that are the social commentaries, business vs. perception of danger vs. actual danger. A little on the nose but it works in this movie also as a plot mechanism for the first act, as they needed to escalate the danger to a sufficient level for the mayor to hire the shark hunter and the police captain to go after the mankiller shark.The acts afterwards follow the hunt to escalate the danger assessment of the shark, and then final assault in the open ocean. Each act is clever and takes the story into slightly different territory, and the three main characters have a certain area of expertise and ownership of each act. This is both perfectly executed and offers very interesting character development and interactions.Then even beyond that is the psychology of the three characters, Each motivated by different things, with different history and fears. The twist with the shark hunter throws a nod to great classics such as Moby Dick. This movie offers beautiful cinematography, interesting dialogue and characters, a little of town life, family life. And a glimpse into the PTSD mind of a former seaman. The three characters when together have mini clashes and rub each other up a little, with it leading to one of the best 'calm before the storm' moments in movies with the three of them comparing scars. Old tales over a drink and a campfire style sing along on the boat in the middle of the night.I love the filming style of the shark itself, the way Spielberg held back on the full shots of the animal until necessary. The fear is real for me. I saw a shark in a massive tank in a water park in Portugal once. The great white, to me, is absolutely terrifying to look at. In this movie it also seems to hold a metaphysical meaning as well, I can't quite put my finger on it but it is there. The shark is literally 'fear', and the movie is about conquering it. Each character handles the shark differently, and the way the ending plays out in a satisfying way. The acting also is excellent. Playful but serious, in a way that feeds into the fear and terror topic of this film.It's a 10/10 for me, along with the other masterpieces of cinema out there.",

            "content": "It's a miracle that it's been 25 years since this film has been released.  I unfortunate didn't get to see this in the theater (I was born a year later), but countless viewings on video, cable, television, laserdisc, and now DVD has made this my second favorite film of all time.  What's rather ironic, is that Steven Spielberg consider this film his \"nightmare\" not because it scares him, but because it was a nightmare to make. With \"Bruce\" (the mechanical shark) keep breaking down, Spielberg went over budget and schedule to complete this film. He might call it a nightmare, I call it a blessing in disguise. Because of not showing the beast until over a hour into the film, it's a Hitchock element that even Alfred himself would be proud of. And the characters, the timid and aquaphobic Amity police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider).  The scary, experienced, and strong-headed fishman Quint (Robert Shaw).  The excited, knowledgeable, and brave marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss).  The community concerned as well as economic minded town mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton).  And also the loving, worried, and tender wife and mother, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary).The story is very complex, from a problem that Mayor Vaughn will continue to ignore, until it swims right up and bites him in the.... well, you know.  The police cheif from New York City, who moves to a more quiet and relaxed community, only to find that he has more problems in Aminity than he does in the big city, not to mention being afraid of the water, and living on a island.  When it's only a island when you're on the water.  The scruffy fisherman that is the town terror, who torments everyone from a child playing the clarinet to the entire town in a meeting.  Plus not to mention the gigantic 25 foot and 3 ton great white beast that snacks on anything that swims. Because of this movie, it has influenced me a lot in life. First, it has open my mind with movies, not to make exciting movies, but also excellent movies.  Second, it has helped me gather research on Steven Speilberg, which I find this to be his best film, above E.T. and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (although those films are also classics!)  Third, to confront my fears, I am like Chief Brody and am terrified of the water, and seeing that bloody shark doesn't help me.  But by watching this film, it encourages to stand up against my fears and face them.  And finally, it is just as exciting to watch the first time just as much as it is to watch it the one millionth time. This is the movie that introduced the world to Steven Speilberg, not E.T., not SCHINDLER'S LIST, and not JURASSIC PARK, it was JAWS.  Because of JAWS, the entire planet has seen this director evolve from doing films that are from the imagination of a child to doing serious films with important meaning.  Countless people label this film the first \"summer blockbuster\" I label it the classic films for the new generation.  From STAR WARS to PERFECT STORM, JAWS was the first film to have big special effects, big budget, exciting action scenes, and a excellent story.  This film will forever be a timeless classic.  ***** (one of the best movies of all time!)",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg's \"Jaws\" was a revolutionary motion picture for its time. Before its release, the notion of a 'summer blockbuster' simply didn't exist. Then, this movie came along and became an unstoppable pop culture phenomenon, grossing a then-record $123 million dollars at the box office amidst a wave of critical praise.The story is a fairly simple one. In the sleepy island community of Amity, the normally placid waters are disturbed by an unwelcome visitor in the form of a deadly great white shark. The police chief immediately senses the danger but the town's mayor is reluctant to close the beaches just as tourist season is kicking into gear. When matters escalate the police chief takes it upon himself to recruit a grizzled fisherman to hunt down the dangerous predator.Since the producers wanted to make the shark the star of the picture they didn't go out of their way to cast any big names in leading roles. Instead, they went for talented actors best known for supporting or ensemble roles. To that end, they decided on Roy Scheider as police chief Brody, Robert Shaw as grizzled fisherman Quint and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. All three gave memorable performances, especially Robert Shaw, whose 'U.S.S. Indianapolis' speech is one of the movie's high points. Apart from these three, the acting is ably handled but fairly undistinguished except for Murray Hamilton as the fast-talking mayor.Spielberg's direction is superbly handled, yet he was unaccountably snubbed by Oscar voters. His handling of the film's suspense is so assured that I found the hairs standing up on the back of my neck when watching scenes that were already deeply embedded in my memory. The fact that the mechanical shark didn't work very well was actually serendipitous since it meant that Spielberg had to employ a 'less is more' approach that left more to the viewer's imagination. Another absolutely essential part of the film's allure is the iconic theme music. John Williams' score ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable degree.Ultimately, the movie brings together fine actors and a compelling script, guided by a master director just beginning to come into his own. The effects may not be absolutely perfect but given all of the difficulties faced, that's no surprise. Minor imperfections aside, \"Jaws\" is undeniably a top notch thriller that could very well make you afraid to go into the water.",

            "content": "JAWS may well be the ultimate horror movie. Made in 1975, it's hard to imagine that it's leanness hasn't influenced the the serial killer/slasher trend of the 1980s, with Jason, Michael and Freddy and their knifes/axes just reincarnations of the Killer Shark's teeth. Man exists of 90% water and some anthropologists have theorized that our original habitat was the beach, with it's easy pickings of seafood, fish and birds. Perhaps a Jungian terror of what lurks just beneath the ocean's surface has seeped into our very genes after lethal encounters with sharks, jellyfish, portuegese warships, poisonous snakes and tidal waves.Water is of course also the spiritual element, represented by the color blue. Whatever the reason, in the year of the Vietnamese Communist takeover of Vietnam, this lean, ruthless, low budget (for Spielberg) gem of a movie was made. Based on a book by Peter Benchley, this movie is at once a metaphor for the power of nature and man's powerlessness in the face of it, and in a strange way a Western, with mad shark hunter Quint as the gunslinger, Chief Brody as the Sheriff, and Mayor Vaughn and the store keepers as the weasly townspeople. Due tribute is also payed to the men of the USS Indianapolis, who delivered the Atom Bomb, and who's return journey was, to say the least, beset with tragedy.When it first came out, it scared me out of going near the local ditch, let alone the beach and later, I had to think twice to even go near the water line. Great use of suspense, great use of music to enhance the expectation and terror, this is a showcase of what a talented director can do with our most existential fears. The movie itself is part monster movie, part guys on a mission movie, part revenge movie and as such is very engaging. Even a quarter of a century after it was made, it hasn't really dated and can be viewed again and again. One of the best movies of all time and possibly the greatest horror movie of all time. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "I can't think of a movie that I 've seen more times than Jaws. It has every element that I love in a movie. Sure by todays fx standards it may seem dated to some, but it is a masterpiece of suspense and adventure. Steven Spielberg has been lauded for his other movies, he has made more serious movies of late, but I think this is one of his best movies. It is now known to most movie fans that the making of this movie was a nightmare. Steven Spielberg found a way to create a great film out of what in someone else's hands would have been a B popcorn film. True, at it's core it is a B movie, a great white shark terrorizes a New England Island town, three men go out to sea and battle the shark etc... What is great about this movie is its characters. Roy Scheider is great a Chief Brody, a Sheriff of the town who happens to be afraid of going into the ocean. He is not a hot shot know it all cop, he is an average Joe, doing his job to protect the town. Richard Dreyfuss is great as Hooper, a rich kid marine biologist who befriends Brody in his struggle to convince the town that they have a shark problem. And yes there is Quint, played by Robert Shaw, probably one of the most memorable movie characters ever. He is a salty sailor with a particular loathing of sharks. The movie takes its time to develop its premise, it doesn't rush to the battle with man and shark. The other great thing is that it is never pretentious, Spielberg could have filled the movie with metaphors of man against nature and the deep meaning of it, but he doesn't bother with it, it's an adventure film in the end. Most movie goers have seen this film, and I've seen a countless times, I always enjoy the movie. Jaws is credited by some to be the first bona fide summer blockbuster, it may have been , but it is better than most summer movies that come out these days. Summer movies nowadays are more concerned about CGI effects than storytelling, Jaws may have been made in 1975, but it holds up as one of the great adventures of all time. It lets us get to know and care about the characters before it thrusts them into the adventure, that makes the movie more entertaining. Great performances ,Great Director, Great script, Great Music, GREAT FILM!!!My love for cinema began with this!!!Grade: A+",

Spielburgh uses very little of the shark to create a fear, or tension in the viewers mind. We don't see much of the shark, but the fear of it is heart pounding. I couldn't believe it. A few years ago, I was flipping through the tv channels and came across JAWS being shown for it millionth time. I decided to give it a chance considering I had never watched it before then. Luckily, I came across the part of Cheif Brody (Roy Scheider) chumming, and complaining about doing it. Then, out of nowhere the sharks head comes out of the water to collect some of the chum. My heart stopped for a few seconds, and I turned white. I was absolutly terrified. I feel the blood tingling in my arms as I watched the scene unravel. Absolutly terrifying! Not only that, the story of the USS Idianapolis by Quint (Robert Shaw) is enthralling. The performances by every actor in this film are supperb. The is a classic, and far supperior to DEEP BLUE SEA, or any of the other JAWS films. JAWS 2 is a good sequel, but ultimately, not as good as JAWS. Although, I would recommed seeing JAWS 2, because it is a good film, and it is scary. However, I didn't see JAWS 3, and I bought JAWS: The Revenge on dvd because it was dirt cheap. Just forget about JAWS: THE REVENGE; it's terrible. Most of all, just stick with the first two films. They are great. But JAWS itself is easily one of the best movies ever made!",

The police chief played by Roy Scheider, is determined to find out how to eliminate the shark after it's eaten one of the citizens of the town. Later in the film, a marine scientist, played by Richard Dreyfuss explains that the first victim in the movie, in the beginning of the film says that it wasn't no boating accident, it was a shark. Then, the Fourth of July comes up and the people of Amity are having a good time until the shark shows up. After the panic on the fourth of July, an grizzled fisherman, played Robert Shaw, plans to hunt the shark down and kill it. So, Dreyfuss, Scheider and Shaw team up to eliminate the shark. Director Steven Spielberg's has a great sort of suspense shots. Thought the shark is not seen the entire time, that is great because it is how Alfred Hitchcock directs suspense. It is what he calls playing with the audience like a piano. Jaws is one of the best films of 1975 and it's also one of my Top 10 best movies I seen. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 4 stars.",

Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss play the three men who set out to catch the shark, and they all give stellar performances. However, Shaw stands out the most.

The ultimate enemy is the one you cannot see and cannot predict. This movie also lets you inside the sharks pysche, for lack of a better term, when oceanographer Dreyfuss gives his speech on the shark being \"the perfect engine\". A nonhuman villian is described in terms that we can understand and completely fear.There is a lot of small town hokeyness to this film. Robert Shaw is a little over the top (but great) and there is the perfunctory subplot of the mayor who doesn't want the beach closed in peak season. But is all works in the context of this groundbreaking, edgy film, which at the time, was the #1 grossing film of all time.I give the strongest recommendation to this film as a great piece of horror, but also as a view of the work of a young Speilberg. Required viewing for all movie fans - one of the best films ever made. **** out of ****.",

            "content": "Jaws is the original summer blockbuster, setting the standard by which all others are measured. It's The Godfather of shark pictures: there will be never be another Jaws simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.Set in Amity Island in the summer time, Chief Martin Brody (played by Roy Scheider) discovers the remains of a shark attack, suggests Mayor Larry Vaughn (played by Murray Lamilton) to close the beaches, but he refuses and wants anyone to have fun. To help find the shark, Brody hires Matt Hooper (played by Richard Dreyfuss) to study the creature and hopefully destroy it. But then a 25 feet, 3 ton great white shark devours more and more swimmers. The two characters then hired a big game fish hunter, Captain James Quint (played by Robert Shaw) to set sail and to go after the shark in order to kill the beast.Jaws is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of the story and character.The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark, by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the corrosive North American seawater. But unfortunately the shark quit working and sank in the sea.Jaws succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque and spectacular without being unbelievable. Roy Scheider's Chief Brody is a quintessential every man, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Richard Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie. Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark.Overall this film made people afraid of sharks and would prevent them to go to the beach. If you haven't seen this movie, pop it in and you'll either be scared or thrilled or even both to see the shark of legend. You're gonna need a bigger boat!A solid 10/10.",

If you ask me - This Spielberg \"Creature Feature\" has got to be one of the most over-rated and undeservedly praised horror movies of all time.And what made Jaws even more difficult to enjoy was that the principal characters were all impossible to like. I mean - As an example - Can you imagine a mayor (who was well-aware of the shark attacks) actually pressuring citizens to get back into the water regardless of the great risk that this posed to their very lives? All-in-all - I'd say that Jaws came very close to being a total dud, in my books. And, besides the laughable, old-school shark effects, I thought that Quint's inevitable demise was one of the worst staged moments of ultra-violence that I've seen in a mighty long time.In conclusion - Spielberg, as a director (then & now), is certainly far from being the genius film-maker that so many of his devoted fans make him out to be.",

Scary and tense throughout the entire movie, this is how a true horror movie should be. The movie builds up its villain perfectly without throwing all of its cards on the table too early, which then makes the reveal so much more harrowing and intense. Spielberg takes a great, if not potentially real, storyline and spins it in a way that makes his characters shine just as much as the shark itself. The characters are strong & memorable, and add excitement to each scene as we watch them bond together while hunting the maneater. Jaws is so effective that it actually has sparked real life fear in the hearts of millions who are now overly cautious about going into the open water. You know when a movie has the ability to strike actual fear into people's lives, that the movie itself is something special, Jaws is no different. Jaws is one of the greatest movies of all time, from its fantastic acting to a terrifying theme song, this is a movie for the ages!A Must See!",

What do you do?Get the hell out of the water, most likely.\"Jaws\" is one of those \"simple\" horror movies. Not simple on a technical level, the production had notorious difficulties with that. Not simple on anyone part of itself, but rather simple at what it probes: the fear of being attacked by something bigger, stronger that wants to kill you. That manages to cover both psychological (hopelessness) and visceral (mutilation) aspects of human fear. The result of this KISSing (Keeping It Simple/Scary) is pretty darn effective. The famous music has become synonymous with fear and has been used a multitude of times (including 3 increasingly bad sequels) and the word \"Jaws\" made quite a career in the English language as a result. Maybe in a thousand years, when archaeologists discover a copy of a \"Jaws\" DVD they'll determine that \"jaws\" was our word for that big fish, when in fact we call it a \"shark.\"Take the opening scene. It is very simple in premise: a girl goes swimming and is first nipped by something, then thrashed around before being finally pulled underwater leaving the sound a buoy. We see no shark, no fin, no jaws (<-- get it?) or anything for that matter. If we saw the sharks or it's jaws (I'll stop with the puns, promise) then it would be clear that the film would be trying to show us that shark and how vicious it is. When, in fact, the scene shows what I had described earlier: the fear of being attack by something bigger and stronger. What it is doesn't really matter. What does matter is that the scene taps right into that fear and carries it through the movie. Progressively we see more and more of the sharks... fins, the mouth (I told you that I wouldn't say 'jaws') and finally the entire shape of the thing, but it is only when the men hunting it see it too.Overall, this is one of not very many truly effective scary movies, because it doesn't just strive for shock, but also for a much needed element of being down to Earth. And it succeeds. --- 9/10Rated PG for terror/violence and gore. Ages 13+",

I'm just a bit older than he is! \"Jaws\" is a fine movie, but I can't see why it has received so many votes of '9' and '10'. It is the 4th of July celebration coming up on Amity Island ( fictional beach community was actually Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts) and someone thinks they may have seen a shark. Local businessmen don't want to scare away the vacation crowd and all their money, so attempt to underplay it. But the shark is real, and the threesome of Roy Scheider (Police Chief, Martin Brody), the boat captain, Quint, played by Robert Shaw, and a young Richard Dreyfuss who plays Matt Hooper, a shark expert sent to help out band together to neutralize the beast. The most that this movie can claim, in retrospect, is that it will make you think a couple more times before you go swimming in an ocean. It is the movie that gave Spielberg his jump-start, as well as composer John Williams.SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW, you may want to quit reading. The movie starts with an overnight beach party, and two teens head for the water for a swim as the sun is poised for rising. The girl goes in, the boy is too drunk and falls asleep, the next day they find her mangled body washed up. It isn't clear why the hungry shark didn't just eat all of her. In a day or two, when lots of people are swimming, a young boy on a raft gets eaten. The first half of the movie establishes the risk, with the struggle between those who want to shut down the beach and protect the people, and those who don't want to lose business. The second half is the hunt, the three men in the fishing boat, to harpoon and kill a very persistent and strong Great White shark. The old captain gets eaten, but the Scheider and Dreyfuss characters survive. The old shark is finally done in by an air tank in his mouth, and a gun shot breaks off the valve, exploding the shark.",

It's when only three men stand against the shark: the new day of science and more evolved man represented by Hooper; Quint's warrior man of the past, unafraid of ever needing to fit into polite society and unashamed of itself; and the common everyman, eternally between the two worlds in Brody. Only Brody can truly succeed \u2014 Hooper will be forever changed by the experience, showing that his way can only take him so far. And Quint's the last of a dying breed who must simply die; when his survival is questioned, all Brody can do is say, \"Quint? No.\" He can't survive. He is the sacrifice which enables the return to the surface of Hooper and Brody's one on a million shot that blows the shark to heaven.In that moment, when the boat that surrounds them and gives them shelter is but splinters against the true terror of nature; when even the boat itself betrays Quint and delivers him into death; when Brody must confront his fear of the water as he tries to climb above it, out of its way, only to sink deeper. In that moment, I sat with my mouth open, awed that a movie over forty years old has the power to make me forget the bombs and rockets blazing outside. In this moment, only the battle between man and beast mattered.Any film that can do that \u2014 whether or not it destroyed the early 70s artistic Hollywood or invented the modern day blockbuster \u2014 is one to be celebrated.Read more at bandsaboutmovies.com/2017/07/06/jaws-1975",

            "content": "The first half of Jaws is a perfect example of building suspense the right way. There's wasn't much music, blood and gore was at a minimal, the shark was barely seen, and there was never a certainty of safety. With the tension built up, the 4th of July sequence was the perfect turning point of the film and segwayed to the trio's grand adventure at sea in the 2nd half.When Brody, Quint, and Hooper set off to to hunt the shark, the real movie begins. This half of the film was so good. Much tension was built as the shark teased the guys, while also teasing the audience as to when the shark will meet its end. Right before the climax, there was a calm before the storm where the trio had a nice bonding moment together that was very heartfelt. Then the final battle came and went in a glorious fashion, leaving the audience satisfied as the credits rolled.Thanks to the Star Wars Prequels, a great debate of CGI vs Practical has become a common argument amongst film buffs. The Shark from Jaws is a great point for the argument for Practical Effects, as the shark looked amazing. Some close ups made it look fake, but for the most part, the realism they were able to capture in appearance and movement was revolutionary. I don't know how realistic the shark's death was, but I honestly feel so satisfied seeing the shark defeated in an epic explosion of blood. A classic moment in film history, if you ask me.The legacy of this film is undeniable. Not just with movie special effects. Jaws helped spark decades of Shark research and knowledge. Shark week is an annual event and scientists are still learning more year after year about these ocean predators. And of course John Williams presented us with yet another iconic theme. Cultured peoples pretending to be a shark while swimming in a pool most likely paddle creepily along humming the theme to indicate their temporary shark persona.",

            "content": "Like 'Jurassic Park,' 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' and 'Star Wars', 'Jaws' was clearly the movie of the moment when it came out in the summer of '75, and it began a string of blockbusters by Steven Spielberg that pretty much continues to present day. All the familiar elements and themes that people love (and hate) about Spielberg are present, though some are more muted and underplayed than they would be in later films by the director. Perhaps he didn't feel he had as free a hand to indulge himself as he would later. As everyone on the planet has seen 'Jaws,' there's no point in recounting the plot. So instead, just a few observations. Roy Scheider died recently, and as almost inevitably happens, we tend to look at his performance a little differently now, with a touch of nostalgia and melancholy. He really was good in this, the Everyman we could all relate to. A decent guy in over his head, scared, not terribly intelligent but not stupid either, with the added ironic trait of being afraid of the water, and someone who ultimately becomes somewhat heroic, though not intentionally. He reacts the way we hope we would in a crisis where we're frightened out of our wits, but from somewhere inside ourselves we find the courage or fortitude or blind luck to do the right thing and save the day. Richard Dreyfuss has a star-making role as the shark expert Hooper. His character and performance are what date the movie more than anything; he has '70's yuppie written all over him and is the prototypical Spielberg male lead. Hooper embodies all the things that Spielberg seems to find so appealing: he is clever, funny, childish, emotive, silly, put-upon, but, like Scheider's Chief Brody, more resourceful than he gives himself credit for. Hooper is the man-child that inhabits so many of the director's movies (Dreyfuss would go on to star in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'), and that most of the audience roots for and finds very entertaining. And Robert Shaw has the plum role, the scene-stealing turn as Quint, who is part Captain Ahab and part Popeye. In one of his best scenes, where the boat is being prepared for the shark hunt, Shaw keeps up a steady stream of seafaring prattle, almost gibberish, that is very funny and perfectly in character. Later, when he recounts his harrowing experience as a crewmember of the USS Indianapolis in World War II, and the desperate fear of floating helplessly in shark-infested waters waiting to be rescued, you can't take your eyes off him. (Spielberg says Shaw came up with much of the dialogue in this scene.) Quint has a kind of modified respect for Brody, but none for Hooper, whom he gives unholy hell all through the movie. 'Jaws' is one of those films that takes you back to wherever you were the first time you saw it. And for a couple of hours, it's 1975 all over again, right down to the leisure suits.",

He is now a favorite and hollywood legend now and has directed some of my other favorite films like JURASSIC PARK and AMISTAD. JAWS is about a shark that has been killing off people at a small town called Amity. Roy Scheidner plays the sheriff, Richard Dreyfuss plays the biologist, Lorriane Gary plays the sheriff's wife, Murray Hamilton plays the mayor, and Robert Shaw plays the salt greedy sailor. Susan Backlinie plays the first victim and her scene is now memorabile. My favorite part is were Roy Scheidner blows up the shark and says- Smile You Son Of A Bitch!Lee Fierro plays Mrs. Kintner then in JAWS THE REVENGE she plays her role again as a cameo. JAWS is my type of movie I stil enjoy the music from John Williams and Spielberg's direction changed movie business forever. Followed by JAWS 2, JAWS 3-D and JAWS THE REVENGE. [ I always here rumors about a JAWS 5?! ]and was also made with rip-offs- GRIZZLY, DAY OF THE ANIMALS, ORCA, ALLIGATOR, CROCODILE, DEEP BLUE SEA and MAKO. Rated PG.",

The first terrifying attack is awesome in its ferocity, thanks to the screaming torments of the young woman trying to get away from the thing below the surface. After that, the film builds slowly but gathers suspense with each scene, especially each beach scene. The mayor's refusal to shut down the beach is simply an act of greed (it's the height of the tourist season), but once the attacks begin to multiply it's up to Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw to do something about catching the great white shark.All three carry the second half of the film aboard a boat that has Schneider delivering the unforgettable line: \"We should have had a bigger boat!\" after he spots the shark for the first time. The plot gets a fair share of thrills once it becomes clear that killing the shark is not going to be an easy matter.Adding greatly to the suspense is a wonderful John Williams score and great cinematography. Incredible that Stephen Spielberg was only 29 when he directed this little masterpiece of man against beast.Well worth watching--and guaranteed to hold your interest throughout the final hour especially. One can sense the influence of MOBY DICK on the screenplay, especially with Quint's obsession to kill the shark.",

            "content": "What Happens When You Give A Young Steven Spielberg A First Class Composer, Great Actors And A Third Class Mechanical Shark?, of course a masterpiece.Steven Spielberg is by far my Favorite director and one of the Most Innovative that has ever existed, Jaws shows that despite having everything against you, hard work receives what it deserves and it is clear in the 3 Oscars that I won and its 8,1 which counts (so far) on IMDb.If you pay attention, what matters here is the dialogue and the Characters, not the \"Ultra Realistic\" Special Effects that current movies use, here with Cheap Special Effects it teaches us that you don't need such High Technology to do something Creepy and of course Memorable.Brody's performance as well as the Biologist and the Fisherman is Magnificent, an impeccable performance that leaves you chills due to their well-acted Reactions, the Secondaries also act very well and make the movie interesting.The same thing happens to this movie as to Halloween (1978) by John Carpenter since both have a simple plot but a simple plot both forged their subgenre, Halloween the Slasher and Jaws the Subgenre of Sharks!.John Williams' Musical Score is Masterful and First Level, I think that without John Williams the Movie wouldn't be so chilling, who the hell doesn't like John Williams' music? Oh yes, the Ignorant.The Special Effects are not the best in the World but despite how Cheap they are they look Too realistic and Impressive in my View, Such as the Scenes where the Shark kills people which look too real in my Opinion.And don't think I'm forgetting the Mythical scene where the 3 Men in the middle of the Night tell a Story, well, actually the Fisherman Tells it, and in that Story he talks about how he survived a Boat Flood (or something like that) when I fought in World War II, just... SCARY!The Violence and the Blood are Too Realistic and Disturbing in my Opinion, Especially the scene where a Boy is Attacked by the Shark and you see his Foot fall to the Bottom of the Sea, it seems that Spielberg wanted to create something too \"Realistic\" with the little what i had.And the last point that we will talk about is about the Incredible Legacy that this Movie left, its Box Office Success, Criticism and its 3 Oscars made it start a Saga of 3 other Movies that are Misery compared to this one but we will not talk about Jaws 2, 3 and 4 in this Review, this movie forged a Subgenre where the Villains are Sharks and someone is going to face them due to the threat they Involve, with such a simple concept great movies were born and also Garbage, without a doubt, one of the best Spielberg Movies and also one of my Favorite Movies! Easily enters my top 10 best movies.For everything I've said, this Spielberg masterpiece gets a deserved 10!.",

            "content": "Every shark movie after this (except for Deep Blue Sea) is a felony.Wow! Talk about captivating, Spielberg was at the top of his game here with this movie that cost $9 million dollars and made over $470 million dollars. It was also responsible for introducing the idea of summer block buster releases as the movie was shown in over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign.The movie is based on a novel of the same name by Peter Benchley, but Spielberg focused on the main theme \"the shark\" removing all the other subplots. Shot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, the film had a troubled production, mostly due to the mechanical shark's malfunctions, it also overran its budget and ran past its schedule, and some of these reasons are why some believe Spielberg opted out of being involved in Jaws 2.The movie plot was thus: During the summer break some teens were having a night party on fictional Atlantic resort Amity Island. One of the girls went skinny dipping while her friends continue to party on the beach. While waiting for a boy to come join her she got pulled under by something that leaves only you the view with the idea that death came.When pieces of her body washed ashore, the Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) feared that it was a shark attack and wanted to close the beach for the town's safety, but Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) disagreed.His point being, the town's people survived mainly on tourist trade and the July 4th holiday was also approaching so he refused to close the beach.He soon changed his mind after a boy and a man also died due to shark attack. He then decided to hire Quint (Robert Shaw), the only local fisherman willing to take on a Great White.The movie score is something that will stick with you and it resembled that used by classic thriller director Alfred Hitchcock. To overcome some of the difficulties encountered Spielberg mostly used an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances.Jaws have had three sequels, none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley.Jaws also won three Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound. It was also nominated for Best Picture but lost it to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (which starred Jack Nicolson).www.lagsreviews.com",

Give me \"Jaws\" and \"Raiders\" over \"Schindler's List\" or \"Saving Private Ryan\" any day.Acting in movies like this gets overlooked, but I think \"Jaws\" would not be the classic we remember it as today without the marvelous trio of actors who play the men on the hunt of that pesky great white: Roy Scheider, as police chief Brody, whose sense of duty and obligation outweighs his morbid fear of water and the unknown; Richard Dreyfuss, as a cocky scientist mesmerized by the beauty and the majesty of the creature they're hunting; and Robert Shaw, in an off-his-rocker performance as Quint, loony shark hunter, the Captain Ahab of Amity. These three together deliver one of the best depictions of male bonding ever put on screen.Peter Benchley greatly improved his own book for the screen. The book is full of boring subplots and lengthy passages told from the shark's point of view. The screenplay, on the other hand, is streamlined and crisp, not pushing the story beyond its modest bounds, and reducing it to a basic man against nature -- or man against his own worst fears -- tall tale. It's like \"Deliverance\" lite.And that John Williams score.....oh, that score......Grade: A",

A great white shark has attacked and killed a few locals at a small community of Amity, and the Sheriff sets out along with a biologist and a skilled fisherman to kill the creature. After a grand start with films such as Sugarland Express, director Steven Spielberg put his name on the map while tapping in on one of humanity's greatest animal fears. Roy Scheider is superb as Sheriff Brody who investigates the killings before having to force the resort to be shut down. He is afraid of water and that will be tested when he faces his finned rival to the finish. Robert Shaw plays the skilled yet over confident fisherman who demands a reward for the catch but his boast will be put to the test during a struggle for survival. Richard Dreyfuss steals scenes as a biologist who faces danger in a cage lowered into the water. Lorraine Gary plays Brody's supportive wife whose son suffers from shock. Murray Hamilton plays the stubborn Mayor who waits until tragedy before closing the area. The shark isn't seen until the second half but once it emerges we hear the famous line that visualizes how big the threat really is, \"We're going to need a bigger boat.\" Score: 10 / 10",

Spielberg's brilliantly edited and scored film unfolds in three classically conceived acts. The film carefully balances suspense and humour, provides the police chief with a believable home life, creates credible characters in Brody (Roy Scheider) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and something controversially legendary in Quint (Robert Shaw). Several things give the film an extra dimension. First, the picture came out in the immediate aftermath of the Watergate scandal, the biggest cover-up and public deception in American political history, and playing the craven Mayor of Amity is Murray Hamilton, an actor associated with devious authority figures, most famously Mr. Robinson in The Graduate (1967). The second is the teaming of a uniformed policeman and a bearded hippie as the principled opponents of a dishonest community. The third factor, the one that gives true depth to Jaws, is the revelation that Quint was a survivor of the Indianapolis, the American warship torpedoed in July 1945 after delivering the A-bomb to be dropped on Hiroshima. As he eloquently recalls, nearly 800 sailors out of a crew of 1100 perished while clinging to wreckage, most killed by sharks. The thriller is many things: a high point in the 1970s group-jeopardy cycle; a Hitchcockian horror picture for the carriage trade; the massive box-office hit that established the reputation of Spielberg; and the film that created a new fashion for releasing films nationally with several thousand prints.",

I always found that an error in the movie.....but anyway.The movie score by John Williams is a music classic which is iconic to the great white shark.\nThis in my view is one of Spielberg's masterpieces and I've yet to see a movie of this kind come anywhere near this film in any shape or form.

He would become the hero of the film and the sequel.And the real star of the film was the shark who was named \"bruce\" after Steven Spielbergs lawyer.

Also, John William's fantastic score helped set the suspense, and it helped raise the tension. Bill Butler's astounding cinematography, Robert Mattey's incredible shark effects, Verna Fields' groundbreaking film editing, Ron and Valerie Taylor's astonishing shark footage, and the excellent use of sound helped create the world of \"Jaws\", and it brings a lot of art and hard work to the picture. \"Jaws\" is a spectacle of thrill and horror, and it never makes you back into the water.

In 1975, the summer blockbuster was born, for better or as many now believe, or for worse.  Whatever your feelings are on that subject doesn't matter.  Jaws is still one heckuva ride.In 1971 Spielberg directed a movie of the week for ABC entitled Duel.  It was the story of one man confronting a relentless enemy.  In that film, the enemy was a huge tractor trailer rig.  We never saw the drive of the truck, all we saw was his relentless, single minded goal to pummel and kill Dennis Weaver as the everyman.  It was one of the best of the Movie of the week films, but little did anyone know that it would eventually lead Spielberg to Jaws, which would put his name on the map permanently.  Just as the truck in Duel was of a single minded purpose, so is the shark in Bruce.  As Richard Dreyfuss puts it, the only thing a shark does is swim, eat, and make baby sharks.  In Jaws, it mostly swims and eat, with tourists and citizens of Amity being it's main course.  The original idea was to use a mechanical shark in the filming of Jaws.  The fact that the never before tested shark didn't work as planned turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to Spielberg in jaws.  It forced him to rely more on his capabilities as a storyteller and director by shooting much of the film from the perspective of the shark.  Yet, Spielberg is so astute at using this device, and aided by the editing of Verna Fields, after seeing the film, you'll swear you saw the shark more than you actually did.  If any person besides Spielberg deserved an Oscar for Jaws it was Verna Fields who went on to score a win in the category.  There is no explanation for the lack of so much as a directorial nomination for Spielberg.  Bill Butler's cinematography deserves special mention as well, especially when the action switches from Amity Island to the Orca and the open sea.  As for John Williams score it is the stuff legends are made of. The thought of Jaws without William's simple shark theme is unfathomable.As for the cast, they too are perfect in roles now ingrained in our memory. Though they have made other fine and notable films, one cannot think of Scheider, Dreyfuss, Shaw, Hamilton or Laraine Gary without thinking of this film.  Maybe it was luck that brought this cast together, or like just about anything else associated with Jaws, the casting was perhaps one of those things that was just meant to be.  Dreyfuss's Hooper provides the perfect foil for Shaw's Quint.  Quint is hard edge and sea worn, Hooper is a product of luxury and class.  Scheider's Chief Brody is like the dependable anchor, who keeps everyone in their place.  I was really happy to see Murray Hamilton as the Mayor.  He is perfect for the role, as evidenced by a conversation he has with Hooper and Brodie as they try to convince him the shark is still a threat.  We know his arguments and defense of his position are foolish, but as Mayor Vaughn Hamilton gives the lines almost a comedic edge.   If you have ever had the privilege of seeing Jaws in a movie theater, I can't think of too many films that had as terrifying and an attention grabbing opening as Jaws.  Because of these first few minutes as the shark suddenly attacks Chrissie without warning, Spielberg grabs hold of his audience and never lets them loose for the entire running time of the film. The fact that the last forty five minutes or so of the film take place aboard Quint's small boat the Orca, yet never loses it momentum during the entire sequence is again a testimony to Spielberg's directorial brilliance.If ever there has been a perfect suspense/action/horror film made it has to be Jaws.  It is a film that has been etched in my memory since the first time I saw it at two thirty in the morning in a cinema in downtown Cincinnati.  We had bought tickets at five in the afternoon to get into that two thirty a.m. showing.  I was thinking at the time it had better be one heck of a film if I was to be able to stay awake into the wee hours of the morning.  I needn't have worried about that.  For causing me one night's good sleep, and for being all around excellent you get my grade.  It's an A+.  Was there any doubt in your mind?",

It's about a man-eating shark that terrorizes a town of Amity Beach and three people must trap and kill the shark:a police chief, a marine biologist, and a boat captain. For most of the movie, Jaws is intense and keeps you on your seat anticipating what is going to happen next. The action scenes featuring the shark are wonderful to watch even though there is a little gore. However, there are a couple scenes that are boring. These scenes occur basically towards the middle of the movie. The music in this film definitely rockstarted John William's career. The shark melody is mesmerizing. The acting, directing, and cinematography are all top-rate. I would advise parents not to show this to your children until they are at least 9. I rate this movie 9/10.",

The presentation of the shark isn't always realistic, but then in 1975, we didn't have shark week to saturate us with the real thing.The principal trio, despite their apparent off-camera 'issues', have a likable rapport (albeit sometimes strained, consistent with the narrative), and though I'd favour Shaw's performance for its hero and villain dichotomy, Scheider and Dreyfuss still perform well above their weight in experience at the time.Music, dialogue, suspense, timing and photography - it's the complete package in my opinion that totally immerses you in fear. I'm not sure how it translates to the younger audiences of today, used to a more explicit depiction, but it's a lesson in the \"less is more\" tactic when showing the protagonist, for itself the eponymous squalis is not absurdly proportioned like the more recent \"Megalodon\" movies, and still convincing enough to keep me on terra firma indefinitely.",

            "content": "Synopsis: On the shores of a quaint northeast town, a gigantic man-eating shark is causing police chief, Martin Brody, some major issues. The mayor is breathing down his neck not to close the beaches because of upcoming summer profits on the 4th of July weekend. Thus, a team made up of the police chief, an oceanographer, and a deep sea fisherman is set to go after the ferocious great white shark. Review: When the film Jaws came out, the film became a massive hit and was highly praised by audiences and critics alike. Nowadays, it almost seems that Jaws is becoming under-appreciated and not taken a granted for. There's a lot to like about Jaws but it makes sense to start out at the beginning, when the lovely skinny dipping bombshell, happens to be the first victim to the ruthless sea beast. The panic in her eyes felt real and this kill immediately hooks the viewer into the movie. The music in this scene, by John Williams isn't necessarily catchy or explosive, but it's perfect for the underwater shark perspective, when approaching the swimmers. The film is steered, no pun intended, but the three high-profile actors, Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. Schneider was fantastic, seemingly a normal everyday person, while on the other hand, Robert Shaw played an eccentric, beloved shark hunter sensationally. In the latter half of the film, when only these three characters are shown throughout, are easily the best parts of Jaws. Shaw gives great line, after great line and the special effects for the shark improve in each underwater scene. It's only when the shark is seen above water to be a little fake. Each Spielberg film I see of his is different than the rest, since I feel he has no agenda and no style to filmmaking. He's an unique director that put together a marvelous, transcendent film, Jaws.",

Each has their own distinct and contrasting personality and are so endearing to the audience that you don't notice that the film barely shows the shark.

            "content": "Jaws tells the story of New York cop Martin Brody, who has moved to a small summer tourist island to become the chief of police. His job is relatively easy until a large Great White Shark begins using the beach for a buffet on the 4th of July weekend. Brody joins forces with an oceanographer and a crazed sea captain with a vendetta against sharks to kill the creature once and for all. With its great acting, superb direction and intelligent dialogue, Jaws is truly one of the best summer blockbusters ever made.Peter Benchley's chilling novel was an instant best seller, so it was only a matter of time before someone attempted to make it a movie. Thank God it was Steven Spielberg. At the time this film was made, Spielberg was still relatively unknown except for a few TV projects including the cat and mouse thriller Duel. Steven Spielberg brought his genius directing style and mixed it with the words of Benchley's great novel to make the first ever summer blockbuster. What I like most about this film is that it's not really a horror, and it's not really an action. There's actually a story to it. The intelligent dialogue makes the movie interesting to watch because of its blend of humour, fear, and desperation. Of course, there are two other main things that add to the effect of this movie. The first is the chilling score by John Williams. You don't even have to see the movie to know where it's from. The second is the fact that you don't really see the shark until the end. The tension just keeps building.Obviously, a lot of the success has to be credited to the great actors involved in this movie. Roy Scheider is great as Martin Brody who is determined to kill the shark yet has a great fear of the water. Robert Shaw is beyond perfect as Quint, the Ahab-like captain who will stop at nothing to destroy the shark, even if it means his death and the death of those around him. Richard Dreyfuss is always good to me, but especially so here. His constant bickering with Quint makes for some awesome comic relief.Overall, Jaws is one of the most entertaining films out there. It takes itself seriously yet it's still a popcorn flick. I recommend this movie to everyone.9/10",

            "content": "Not quite. But when I think of \"Jaws\", I think of a film that I can watch over and over again and never grow tired of it. Definitely one of my favourite films.Since seeing \"Jaws\" many years ago, I became fascinated with sharks. I saw it around 1981 at the age of 10. I read every book I could get my hands on at my public school library. What I found in the process, is that not only is the ocean filled with a variety of sharks, but lots of other equally deadly creatures. I think that is what freaked me out beyond the film. I have always been afraid of the ocean since. I attribute that to Steven Spielberg.Sometimes when I watch this film, during one of the calmer moments, like Brody and his son at the dinner table, I'm struck by the beauty of the film, in its aesthetics, later I'll be drawn in by the pace, story and suspense of a truly masterful film.I never did get to see the film in the theater. In the early 1980s, we rented a VTR on a monthly basis and would periodically rent movies from the local video store, \"Videoflicks\", which was an excursion that was always an exciting treat for my siblings and I.For my birthday party, I wanted to watch \"Jaws\" with my friends, and my mother was a little concerned. She was debating whether we should do it or not, worried what the parents of the other kids would say as the film scared her pretty badly too.She was worried about it until my 5 year old brother said, \"Aw mom, it's just a mechanical shark.\"Of course, he too is traumatized, as were most of the kids at the party I'm sure.",

There seems to a certain attraction of movie goers' fantasies that draws them into identification with whatever Character is \"the Baddest.\" Just how many boys would rather play 'Don del Oro', Al Capone or Darth Vader; than they would Zorro, Elliot Ness or Obi Won Kenobi?As for Scary Cinema, there are several definite, distinct classifications. First of there are the Horror and the Science Fiction divisions, but of course there are a lot that have characteristics of more than one. Those we may call 'hybrids' to borrow a term from Biology Lab.But no matter which way we look at it, JAWS (1975) is a 'Monster Movie', for even though a Shark is not a Mythological Creature, nor the product of somebody's fertile imagination, it is still monstrous to we puny humans.We'd read an old reviewer's write up of one of Charlie Chaplin's Comic 2 Reel Shorts. We can't remember which one, but in the course of the review the author said something like, \"\u0085.the Movie Ushers really liked this film, and the Ushers see the Films almost as much as the Cops!\" We guess that some things just never change.When this film was released, I was in the midst of my 35 year run as a Chicago Policeman. In addition, employment working Security for ABC-Great States' UNITED ARTISTS Theatre. When JAWS was booked in, we soon had Cops working there from opening till the last showing of the day was over. Previously, we would have 1 guy there on weekday evenings, 2 on Weekends.Well, after a couple o' days, we went to \"Plan B\". That called for 2 men, coast to coast, all the way. The crowds justified such a change of staffing and necessitated bring in more 'urban mercenaries, more hired guns! You know, Schultz, more Off-Duty Cops! I mean the earliest show at around 9:00 A.M, would be packed!There was good reason for these crowds' seeming magical materialization. JAWS. You see, was a very good film. It was thrilling, dramatic, humorous, literate and it scared the living Hell right of you. All the elements seemed to be there in proper proportions. The balance achieved by Director Steven Spielberg, Novelist Peter Benchley and Screen Writer Carl Gottlieb, seemed to be near perfection. The movie goers were all seen leaving, were both laughing and crying simultaneously (and at the same time, too!). But whatever the case was in any particular instance, people were all talking about their collective and individual cinematic experiences of the previous 2 hours or so, and all of this unsolicited feedback was Positive, Very Positive.The key operative word here is \"mood\". JAWS truly benefited from a beautiful, haunting and even biosynchronous Original Musical Score from the Maestro (Himself), John Williams. From the very opening, shown from the point of view of the Shark, the subtle irising in on the swimming area, contrasted with the merrymaking on the beach by some of those Teen Agers!! Taking cue from the musical score, I swear our hearts began to beat much more quickly, and our whole nervous system joined in. The various \"scary\" scenes were done so well, that it did accomplish that need for \"Suspension of Disbelief and every Man, Woman, Boy, Girl and Pet who was in the audience shared in the fright and eventual fit of \"relief laughter\" that followed.The Production Team seems to have struck a really good balance or blend of just the right balance of all those above mentioned elements as to make for a \"real scary picher\" for all age groups, even the 'Big Kids'.Highly Recommended!",

Starting out as a pure horror tale about a killer shark terrorizing swimmers on the New England coast, it coasts through until we come face to face with the man-eating machine itself. The cast is terrific with Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfuss all giving one of the best performances in each of their distinguished careers. The real star, of course, is the shark, and Spielberg does a marvelous job of maintaining the suspense despite not seeing the shark at first. The film does have minor flaws, as it bogs down a little with too much footage of the shark hunt before quickly trying to cover back and make a strong finish, which it does. Nevertheless, this is true horror at its finest. It isn't particularly graphic, but some fantastic direction combined with John William's immortal score makes this one of the best films of the 1970s, of Spielberg's career, and of American cinema.",

Being responsible for influencing many current directors working today. Is it worthy of the classic status? Absolutely. Ohhh yes ladies and gentlemen, Jaws is yet another classic in Spielberg's filmography that has every right to be called timeless. He didn't just create a horror film, he reinvigorated the genre! It's not what you see on screen that terrifies audiences, it's what you don't see. Casual holiday goers getting dragged into the hellish depths of the ocean as our infamous Great White shark rips them to shreds. The effectiveness of this, is that you don't see the shark in all its glory until the second half. Spielberg used the shark's point of view as a camera technique in order to create the scares, and it worked tremendously. Incredibly genius idea back in 1975. Accompanied by John Williams' famous \"Da Dun...Da Dunnn...Dun Dun Dun Dun\" (best way I can describe it) score, it was destined to be remembered for a long long time. What I also loved was the fact that it wasn't just a straight up \"shark is in the water, run away!\" type of film. There's a conflict of interest on Amity Island regarding tourism and wanting to keep the beaches open for income. Then the second half is where our chief of police and squad go shark hunting. So it is a varied film and I like how the narrative changes, it felt natural. Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss were great and pulled off some charismatic likeable performances. My one and only criticism, was that the pacing was inconsistent during the second half. The terror lowers and focusses on character development which did slow the film down for me. Having said that, Jaws is a classic and is worthy of all the praise that it gets. The first half is masterfully crafted and cements sharks as being Hollywood's greatest movie monster.",

            "content": "But who cares?! Frankly, I'm sick and tired of hearing people complain about the shark looking fake. You didn't think the shark looked real, but you were still in suspense, weren't you? The fake-looking shark is a testament to Steven Spielberg's directing skills, because he still made Jaws into an intense and terrifying thriller. That shark may have been the reason that Spielberg only agreed to direct Jaws on the condition that the shark would not be shown until at least halfway through the film. (spoilers) Jaws wastes no time. The film starts off on a beach (a scene in which the film's time period \u0096 the mid-70s - is very clear), and some goofy young guy gets together with some drunk girl, and they waste no time in getting naked to go swimming. This is a confusing scene, though, because it seems to be dawn when they get to the water. Were they drunk and going swimming at dawn? And then, in the next shot, it's dusk again, and it even switches back and forth a few times. Needless to say, the naked drunken promiscuous girl gets munched, and they find her remains on the beach the next day. Spielberg wisely chose to present a very tasteful autopsy, which was not gory at all but still effective, and it was one of the little tricks that he pulled in this film in order to keep the rating down. The shark attack spells disaster for Amity Island (!!), a very small town dependent on its summer tourists for a substantial portion of its economy. The mayor, who proves to be not a very nice guy, wants to keep the shark attack covered up and keep the beaches open so that tourists will come, even though those very tourists would be in danger. Little does he know that an idiotic horror film - released four years later and nearly named after his town - will probably hurt the tourist economy much more than any shark could. Some of the best parts in the film come early on, as Brody (Roy Scheider) nervously scans the tourist crowded water for the shark, after having tried unsuccessfully to get the beaches closed. There are at least two shots in which the ocean itself looks menacing, which is significant because the ocean naturally radiates calmness and tranquility. \nRobert Shaw plays the part of Quinn, the hardened fisherman (who, we later find out, was once involved in a historic naval accident, putting him in the water with sharks for an extended period of time) who offers to go out and catch the man-eating shark terrorizing Amity Island, given the proper reward. He provides a good guide for Brody, the chief of police who doesn't handle himself very well in the water, and Hooper, the oceanography expert who doesn't seem to have as much field experience as Quinn. The final scenes with these three men at sea battling the shark are probably the scenes that this film is best known for. Obviously, this is the first time we get a good look at the shark (oh shut up, it was plenty effective enough), but also, I think that the scene where Hooper goes down in the shark cage may be the most intense moment in the film, because we actually see the shark coming while in its own habitat \u0096 underwater. Jaws is such a powerful film because it takes something out of nature, something that is real, and presents a situation in which that element of nature has become extremely dangerous and must be stopped. The film score is one of the most memorable in motion picture history, and the film also contains numerous pieces of dialogue which have quickly become universally recognizable \u0096 `Don't go in the water,' `You're going to need a bigger boat,' etc. Steven Spielberg proved his masterful directing skills with Jaws only four years after his first full-length motion picture, leaving audiences all over the world wanting more.",

Just like watching Silence Of The Lambs, you  are right there with Clarice Starling as she hunts the killer around his house, and in The Truman Show you are in there with Truman wondering what's going on and looking for a way out. In Jaws, this is achieved better than any other film. You really ARE on that boat with Quint, Brody and Hooper as the shark menaces them. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the film is superb, but it's the legendary boat sequences at the end of the movie that makes this head and shoulders above every other horror film (even Psycho and Silence of The Lambs). The shear thrill and fear you feel every time the shark comes near the boat is incredible, and when it throws itself on board and tips the entire ship up, with Brody and Quint metres away from that huge mouth full of razor sharp teeth...well, it makes you hang onto your chair with both hands. The unbearably tense climax ..it's incredible. Spielberg puts you inside the movie, and it's awesome. Odd to think the novel (which is superb, but not as thrilling) ends with the shark just dying inches away from the helpless Brody. ] The true mark of this movie is the impact it has had - all around the World, people still look at the ocean and keep a weary eye out for black, dorsal fins cutting through the water....",

This alone raises the film up 1* for me - it's impressively made.I don't, personally, think the story is as perfect as the aforementioned. Don't get me wrong it's all entertaining, but I feel it peaks with the shark terrorising the town as a whole - when it's down to just the trio, I didn't enjoy it quite as much. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss do give notable performances, though.Going back to my initial point, the effects for the shark are incredible. I kinda wanted to simply see more of just the shark, even if we do get more of the great white towards the conclusion. Heck, the film from the shark's prospective would've been 10/10. Lastly, that John Williams score is sensational - I think every film fan, whether they've seen it or not, knows that famous theme.Almost 47 years after its release, I've finally seen 'Jaws'. I don't honestly think the story/the characters itself are anything out of this world, but there's so much to admire and praise from a technical aspect. A marvel, really.",

            "content": "Much has been made over the years since Jaws first took the world by storm of the overall naffness of the mechanical shark, a.k.a Bruce. Watching it back in the year 2012, nearly forty years since it's release, it's amazing how good it actually looks. In a world overrun by computer generated jiggery pokery, seeing the raw ambition and physicality of an actual on location effect is an infinitely more rewarding experience than seeing some weightless digital manipulation which is an all too present feature of many modern mainstream blockbusters. Jaws is and always was far more than just a film about a giant shark terrorising a vibrant beach community. Based on Peter Benchley's bestseller, it owes a huge debt to Hitchcock in the way it implies threat and employs clever camera techniques to heighten tension. In collaboration with Benchley, Carl Gottlieb's superb screenplay is fleshed out beautifully with great performances including some wonderfully improvised moments that ground the film and give it surprising humanity. Richard Shaw's 'Quint', the stubborn old sea dog, Richard Dreyfuss' 'Hooper', the nerdy enthusiastic science puppy and Roy Scheider's 'Brody', the slightly neurotic worrier create a hugely likable trio that in the second half of the film come into their own in the hunt for the monster. A Jaws review without mention of John Williams' genius musical score is not a proper review. As with many other celebrated classics, Williams' music is the star of the film. With a few simple notes, Williams created something truly iconic that lives strong today in the vast subconsciousness of the world. I have nothing negative to say about Jaws, it still shocks, it still surprises and it'll forever be a classic piece of cinema from a talented director with the ability to use his influences to create his own brand of magic.",

I always found this film good in places but overall the viewing experience is an overlong and generally unpleasant one.This film has all the essentials of a good shark movie, the 3 R's... yeah Roy, Richard, and Robert.  Yes, the acting in this film is surprisingly top-notch for the genre, even Shaw who almost overdoes his thick seaman drawl to the point where it often becomes hard to understand.  There's also a classic musical score by John Williams, who with the Star Wars and Indiana Jones tracks has become one of the most successful composers in history, film or otherwise.  Probably the best aspect though is the photography which looks even more mystifying at night-time with an almost silvery-great look to the water than it does during the day.There, so it's a good movie but the hype surrounding it is totally overblown.  First of all, there's not really much in the way of action in this film.  There only are 4 actual shark attacks over the course of the film's 120+ minute running time.  The film slows down terribly near the end with the three men endlessly bantering amongst themselves ending with several repetitive scenes of them shooting harpoon after harpoon into the shark.  Maybe it's just the overfamiliarity of the subject matter that has come over the years, but the scene has very little in the way of tension. The mechanical sharks look awfully cheesy during some of the close-up shots revealing some wrinkles in the rubber nose.  On top of that, the ending was completely ridiculous, in that there was no way the guy could have gotten out of the cage and hid from the shark for several minutes.\nSo to conclude, this film is a good movie, but it never was really worthy of the classic status its overblown hype has brought it.",

It positively set the cinema world on it's ear upon it's release in 1975.\nThe story is well known and simple. Somehow a great white shark has made its way to the local waters of a New England town. People start disappearing, and the hysteria begins. The mayor (Hamilton) refuses to acknowledge that there is danger, as he wants to protect the precious revenue the summer vacationers will bring to the town. The police chief (Scheider) enlists the help of an marine biologist (Dreyfuss), and a professional shark hunter (Shaw) to battle the shark out on the open seas. Fantastic scenes include when Shaw recounts the story of a WWII vessel that capsized, dumping all of the seamen into shark infested waters. Nobody can watch that scene without getting affected. There's also the scene with Dreyfuss investigating a wrecked fishing boat for evidence of a shark attack, and the two old men who think they can catch the shark with a thanksgiving turkey as bait. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the opening scene involving the skinny dipping girl and the first shark attack, and of course, the entire last half hour... the true showdown with the beast. Excellent casting, and believable multi-dimensional characters make this a film that is proving to stand the test of time. Lots of people will tell you the shark looks ridiculously fake, but I always though that given the era this movie was made, WAY before even the earliest computer special effects, the shark looks pretty good. Besides, the performances and story are so strong, that you don't even stop to critically analyze the effect of the shark. Go out and BUY this film...

The directing and acting, in particular Robert Shaw, are flawless. I would argue that no movie has ever had the immediate horrific impact on a viewing public as much as Jaws. The film spurned a shark kill that has never, thank God, been duplicated. It was banned from sea-side communities on both the Atlantic and Pacific side of America. This movie made you afraid of something you did last summer. (no pun!) The chemistry that the cast had is something that I have never seen recreated. The whole Community of Amity, even the background players, flowed so natural I would believe Amity was a town I had visited as a child. If you have never seen this gem get on it now. 100 years from Jaws will still be a vital part of American cinema despite how many new movies may be \"more popular\". Jaws is forever.",

It was all there in Peter Benchley's novel, however, Spielberg made a few changes for the better and what you end up with is a thrilling suspense movie.Peter Benchley has mentioned that if he had known about the actual behaviour of sharks, he would have never written the book. Also maybe Steven Spielberg may not have made the film as the shark (named \"Bruce\" after Spielberg's lawyer) was never tested in salt water and caused a troubled and prolonged production. Fortunately this added to the films tense atmosphere and in the sharks case, less is more, as the actors get to show their stuff as the film builds up to a gripping finale.John Williams most memorable score gels the movie together. The acting is fantastic and also from the supporting cast including Murray Hamilton's Mayor, to Quints silent partner. The leading trio are on top form - Roy Scheider proves his performance in the French connection was no fluke, Richard Dreyfuss career was saved with his performance as Hooper and set up his future film work and finally Robert Shaw steered his performance away from a Captain Ahab rehash, to a sailor with a haunted past, Quint's tale of the USS Indianapolis will forever be one of the best speeches in movie history.Watch this movie and experience for yourself why the tagline read 'don't go in the water'",

The characters are very good and the actors involved in here provided very goof performances that really help you feel this fear and panic at the appearance of the shark. if I have only one thing to complain about it's that the characters were a bit predictable and despite the three main characters, the rest did nothing important.Well, in fact the shark does not appears until the last half an hour or so, until then you only have tension. Many underwater takes, as it were taken from the shark's point of view, swimming between the legs of all the people on the sea and the two-note motif created by Williams and that's even more effective than the appearance of the shark itself. And that's why it's so impressive when you finally see it, trying to destroy the ship of the captain Quill and each time you see a barrel floating out of the water you can feel the tension again.That's one of the best things of this movie. It really gets you in tension even if by now you can see that the shark was an animatronic, because it was so well created that it will surely frighten you. And as I said above, you have the score by John Williams, who collaborated here for the first time with Spileberg, and created a magnificent, frighten and grandiose score, that marked the quality of their future collaborations.A highly recommended movie, specially if you are a real fan of Spielebrg, John Williams and fan of the great cinema classics.",

This shark appears to have a personal agenda, and it's at that point, the move loses me a bit. Granted there are really fun performances by Shaw, Dreyfuss, and Scheider. They are such caricatures. The byplay between them works quite well. I did feel at times they did little to protect themselves and that was disappointing. You can be the soldier of fortune, but don't just walk in front of the cannon. There is suspense, and that shark is really frightening. What is done with the camera is the true star of the film. The shots of the swimmers' legs from under the water is true genius. And, of course, if you ever want to teach someone the importance of a musical score for a movie, you need go no farther.

Perhaps one day it will be released on its 50th anniversary on the big screen and a new generation will be haunted from going for a swim down by their local beach. I know that i will be first in the queue.Most users reading this review will be familiar with the plot. A gigantic Great White Shark starts feeding off the shores of Amity Island. A free spirited woman called Chrissie Watkins who takes a night swim is devoured in the film's unforgettable opening sequence. The Chief Of Police, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider in his most famous role) immediately closes the beaches in fear of another attack until he is persuaded by Mayor Larry Vaughan (Murray Hamilton) to keep them open because Amity needs 'Summer Dollars' to survive in the winter.When it becomes clear that the shark has no intention of going away and kills again, the authorities bring in Ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, brilliant) to determine exactly what kind of creature they are up against and how they can solve the problem. Despite efforts to convince the Mayor to keep the beaches closed, the Mayor refuses and horror strikes again during the 4th of July. Finally, and with no other alternative, Brody hires Shark Hunter Quint (Robert Shaw, in arguably his greatest role) and along with Hooper they set sail in Quint's vessel The Orca, to hunt the Shark which takes up the last fifty minutes of the film.The photography, lighting, set pieces (including the wonderful Orca itself) are absolutely brilliant. This is a film that ages like a fine wine. Some detractors and critics of this film might deride the Shark for its unconvincing close ups towards the end of the film, but its as good as any Computer Generated Imagery simply because it is really THERE.John Williams memorable score is one of the most popular in film history. The music is terrifying when the shark is around, and it is thrilling when the crew of The Orca chase the shark across the Atlantic whilst firing those yellow barrels time and again. William's Score was fifty percent responsible for the success of this Picture. He also won the Oscar for it. Enough said.This is Steven Spielberg's Best Film. It is also The Greatest Film Ever Made. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and especially Robert Shaw should have been awarded special Oscars for such brilliant character performances. There have been rumours that they are planning a remake or a re imagining of Jaws, but if this happens, then Hollywood will have swallowed itself like a Boa Constrictor, for this was the first film that defined the term 'Summer Blockbuster' and created an era of big Hollywood movies that were King of the Box Office...a remake might destroy that forever.My Favourite Film Ever.

Or the Devil himself, dragging each sinners back to Hell. Or making them live it. With the first victim, being a young ingenue, skinny dipping in the middle of the night. A cautionary tale? I think so. Nobody is spared. And that's what is so great about this book adaptation. And something that won't be allowed these days, when we see movies like The Meg. Because anything can happen, and it will. Even the death scenes are surprisingly tensed, and gory coming from the king of family adventures. Jaws is all that, and more. Even the humor is perfectly paced. And the actors do a terrific work bringing each lines and dialogues to life. And what about the special effects? Nothing to be ashamed of either. The shark works, and the fact that it didn't at first, is a blessing. It adds more suspense and anxiety, for that moment it will eventually leap out of the water. I stopped counting the number of times I've seen this movie. And wether the age, it is always open to interpretations. How many can do that? Not a lot I guess.

This made this horror movie one of the best ever to hit the silver screen. Not only for the movie industry, but for the people who watched it and were moved.",

            "content": "Based on a bestseller by Peter Benchley, Jaws is a thrilling story about a community gripped by fear as a great white shark brings death to their waters. It is also the film that truly cemented Steven Spileberg's reputation as a maker of hugely entertaining films \u0096 and introduced a trend of studios seeking to release \"summer blockbusters\" that has lasted to this day. More than thirty years since its release, Jaws still retains the power both to entertain and terrify. It is a classic, plain and simple.A naked swimmer is enjoying a dip in the waters off Amity Island when she is attacked by something beneath the surface that pulls her to her death. When her mutilated remains turn up with the tide, local police officer Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) discovers that she almost certainly has fallen victim to a man-eating shark, most likely a Great White. He decides that her death is probably a tragic one-off and allows the local population, plus holiday-makers from farther afield, to come to Amity Island for the usual summer recreations. But another victim is eaten by the shark, this time a young boy swimming not too far from the beach. A huge shark hunt takes place with all the local fishermen attempting to capture the one that has brought death to their waters. They believe they have succeeded when they kill a Great White and bring it in for public display, but a scientist named Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) isn't so sure they have caught the right fish. He convince Brody to cut open the belly of the shark to see if it contains human remains in its stomach, and they discover that it does not. With the real killer Great White still at large, Brody and Hooper enlist the aid of a crusty sea-farer \u0096 Quint (Robert Shaw) \u0096 to track it down. But it is only once they are far out to sea that they discover what a strong and formidable foe they have taken on. A terrifying game of man .vs. nature ensues as the three hunters and the shark play out a battle to the death on the lonely waves.Jaws is awesome. So many elements gel perfectly - the casting, for one, with Scheider outstanding as the police officer trying to protect his town and family from the underwater menace. But it isn't just Scheider who catches the eye; Dreyfuss also seizes his opportunity to etch a wonderful portrayal as the scientist simultaneously thrilled and terrified by the foe he is out to destroy. And Shaw is utterly mesmerising as the experienced shark hunter who comes to realise that he is on the trail of his most dangerous ever quarry. John Williams provides one of cinema's most recognisable scores, a simple but chilling tune that builds to a devastating crescendo as the action intensifies. Spielberg reinvents the meaning of \"thrill\" in cinematic terms, taking his audience to the point where they think their nerves can take no more\u0085 only to turn the screw even tighter. The finale, as Scheider clings to the mast of a sinking ship and watches the shark's fin cut through the water towards him, is so tense that it is impossible not to feel your palms sweating and your pulse thudding in your ears. A fantastic movie.",

I was absolutely fascinated and captivated.  That summer we went camping and at first I had no problems going into the ocean.  Nothing was going to keep me from swimming...and certainly no shark!   Well, that is until news spread that a guy had caught a shark while fishing from the pier.  Granted, it was just a baby shark, but that didn't matter to me.  As far as I was concerned, Jaws had a baby and I was NOT going in that water again!  Many years have passed since I was seven, but this movie has lost none of its charm for me (not even in the hundreds of times I viewed it).  The sprinkles of humor still make me laugh, I still love to hate Quint, and I still find that shark absolutely thrilling.  Over the years Jaws has lost very little of its awe or fear; and even in today's overwhelming special effects, Jaws still can hold its own.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can look beyond todays CG and other special effects and simply enjoy this movie for what it is and for its ability to make you think twice before swimming in the ocean again.  A truly fantastic movie earning  10 out of 10 stars.",

Jaws is so good and universal, it could have easily been made today and be a hit. The fear of sharks, the agenda to keep a beach running for tourist money versus some vague allegations of a shark threat, the psychology, it still stands today. Not only did this movie catapult Spielberg to fame, it started a genre of its own (the shark movie), and was even responsible for the real-life shark phobia we still experience today.

The dramatic elements are off-set well with the action sequences, and the overall structure of the film is nicely balanced (even though it is quite long).Robert Shaw is probably the highlight character, and Roy Scheider is pretty good as Chief Brody. Richard Dreyfuss is just as good as Hooper, who is the \"rational\" voice of the film, (opposing Quint's recklessness). The scene where Hooper tires to prove his way onto the \"Orca's\" crew is worth the sitting alone - it is ridiculously hilarious.Spielberg used his resources effectively, and there are no real cop-out scenes or short-cuts taken within the story. The real threat of the shark becomes apparent suitably, and you suddenly feel as if there is real danger for the crew, however see-through the dramatic devices/special effects are.This film is too legendary for me to add anything more - it is general knowledge that it is (or should be) the definitive modern (Moby Dick) adventure story.(Question: When Brody cannot close the beaches because of the Mayor, why doesn't he just go over his head to the next level of Government?)",

Overwhelmed by the Popularity and Zeitgeist of the Whole Thing, It was Certainly a Blockbuster and Cultural Phenomenon in 1975.A Slickly Made and Innovative Movie for its Time, Spielberg had Enough Clout and Money to Experiment with the Genre and was a Creative Talent that Crafted a Different Look and Feel to the Film that Helped Make the Movie a Slightly Offbeat Experience. John Williams Haunting Score Helped.But the Movie has Some Things that are Far From Perfect and Keeps it from Becoming a Masterpiece that So Many Claim. In the First Act, Spielberg Borrows from Howard Hawks and Includes a lot of Over Talking that is Just as Clunky as When Hawks Kept Pushing that bit of Pretension on Audiences.The Second Act is Corny at Times with Roy Scheider's Chief Brody Character Channeling Every Teen Sci-Fi from the Fifties Trying to Convince His \"Elders\" that there Really is a \"Monster on the Loose\", and When Robert Shaw's Over the Top \"Old Salt\" Shows Up, the Camp becomes Quite Silly at Times.The Third Act Suffers Mostly from Mechanics of the Shark Kind. When the Shark Jumps on the Boat, Suspension of Disbelief Goes Out the Window. But the Movie is Entertaining and it has Become One of Those Band Wagons that Everyone wants to Jump On for Fear of Being Left Behind.

Spielberg is a Craftsman, a Playful Filmmaker with Great Talent and an Ability to Know What the People Want and Gives it to Them in Heavy Doses.Jaws was His First Film of the Sort, and He has Never Really Changed and Strayed Only Occasionally from what Might be Called Populist Entertainment Rather than High-Art.

This was before the era of 3,000 screen saturation openings at large megaplexes.  Word of mouth really built up about this film and I knew that I had to see it.The Golf Mill Theater in Niles, IL was the place to go and I went on a Saturday night with a high school date.  It was the wildest, loudest movie audience I had ever experienced.  The men yelled, the women screamed and people were hiding behind the seats.  A teenage girl sitting near me sobbed hysterically every time we heard John Williams' shark theme. Women were grabbing onto guys they didn't even know and I think I broke the armrest of my chair.  You should have seen all those rocking seats fly back when that shark leaped out of the water.When the film was over the audience stayed in their seats and applauded the credits.  It was an incredible and exhausting two hours.  This was a time of large, single screen movie houses that would seat over 1,000 people and I believe every one of those chairs was occupied that night.  It was as rowdy as any sporting event and there was a real thrill in seeing that we all had the same reaction to this fine film.We had no idea who this young director was and we didn't really care at the time.  \"Jaws\" was the movie to see that summer and people were lining up around the block to get in.Whenever I hear a critic or columnist describe some action movie as a \"rollercoaster\" I'm always a little dubious.  I rode the best in the summer of '75.  Thank you, Mr Speilberg.",

And though some of his most recent works weren't great, we can still look back to the ones that were. So, i'm going to review most of his movies. I'm going to do the best I can. He's done a lot.The first on my list is Jaws, which was probably his first feature. When Jaws came out in 1976, it became the first Summer blockbuster, and it gave people heart attacks. And a lot of morons out there will say that \"Its not scary the shark is too fake\". Well, they are obviously braindead. It was the 70's. They also don't think its that scary because you don't see the shark that much. But i'll get back to that one.The plot is simple: In the peaceful town of Amity, a shark has attacked. A couple of times. Chief Brody(Roy Schneider) has been trying to save the townspeople, but the moronic mayor has put their lives in jeopardy. So, Brody, Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss), a marine biologist, and Captain Quint(Robert Shaw), a lunatic with experience, to save the townspeople from this killer shark.Your first viewing of Jaws, it will frighten you. After that, not so much. But the fun is still there. It's fun to watch all of the memorable moments, because, well, there are so many of them. My family and I watch Jaws every Summer, and it has never gotten old.The reason why Jaws worked so well was actually a blessing in disguise. While filming, Spielberg claimed that the shark messed up a lot and was an inconvenience, and that is the main reason why you only see it in the last twenty minutes. But to be honest, that was probably a miracle. Jaws wouldn't have been such a great movie if the shark would've worked.The main thrill of Jaws is not being able to see the shark. Not being able to see the shark makes the film more thrilling, making you wonder whats really out there(though its pretty obvious). Spielberg is such a great filmmaker that he thought outside the box, and because of that, Jaws has been claimed as one of the best films of all time, and that it is.A",

For the JAWS guru, it's really about more than a shark that swims around and eats people; it is a perfect machine, too cunning in its natural instincts to make a decision between good and evil; in the shark's mind, there is only food. The fact that it can so easily outwit some of the most skilled men is fascinating and at the same time terrifying. Even without the plot, this is still a fantastic movie. The cinematography is excellent (anyone who remembers the head popping out of the boat can attest to that), and the use of camera angles instead of actually showing the shark (until the last few scenes) is a brilliant idea.The acting was one of the best uses of method acting since Bogey left the screen,which worked out quite well. One of the best examples of this can be seen in Robert Shaw's account of the sinking of the Indianapolis, which was mostly ad-libbed. Also, before JAWS, there were not any good movies (generally) that came out in the summer; JAWS was the first of the summer blockbusters, bringing in almost $260,000,000 in its first year. With its great plot, bang-up acting and terrific cinematography, this flick is definitly one of the essentials for any avid moviewatcher's repertoire.",

I have never read Benchley's novel, though it doesn't sound any good (at least not in comparison to the film).  So, I won't compare the two.  As I often do, I will analyze the acting and other important aspects of the film itself.  There are no big-names among the cast - Scheider had made \"The French Connection\" prior to this, Shaw \"From Russia With Love\" and \"The Battle of the Bulge\", and Dreyfuss . . . nothing worth mentioning - but they were hardly big stars.  Nonetheless, the three heroes handle their roles perfectly.  Roy Scheider's performance is very good as Martin Brody, a police chief with a childhood fear of the water (due to an implied shark attack on him) and who's superiors (the Mayor, et al) think he's crazy.  Scheider is very good here, in a subtle way, as a man trying to protect both his town and his family - nothing flashy, just a solid performance.  Richard Dreyfuss, as Professor Matt Hooper, is my favorite character - he is very smart with a sense of humor - his quarrel with Quint is well-acted out and neither actor goes over the top.  What more can I say?  But it is Shaw's performance as the crazed Navy veteran Quint that carries this film.  In his earlier scenes, Shaw is merely somewhat eccentric; in the protracted finale, he snaps; he seems to go insane, which Shaw handles very well.  He smashes the \"Orca\"'s radio, sings sea shanties as the shark tries to ram the ship, and . . . well, he's nuts.  Listen to the deadpan way he recounts the sinking of the \"Indianapolis\" (ending with the perfect \"So we delivered the bomb\").  Shaw should've won an Oscar for his performance - just goes to show how tasteless the Academy is.  The rest of the supporting cast (especially Murray Hamilton as the Mayor and Lorraine Gray as Scheider's wife) is very good as well.   As for the shark?  Not seen until more than halfway through the film, the shark is not as horribly unrealistic (at least not always) in most of its scenes - I've seen more phony-looking pictures of \"real\" sharks elsewhere. Besides, at least it's there - I prefer Spielberg's cheesy but somewhat realistic shark to the heartless computer effects of \"SpiderMan\" and the new \"Star Wars\" films any day.    The attacks are all well executed; the opening scene is very well-shot. The dialogue is near-perfect; not a wasted line exists.  The scene with all the \"bounty killers\" hunting for the shark is one of the best of the movie; it portrays the panic, the confusion, the frenzy, the desperateness of the fisherman, shooting at anything that moves, carrying dynamite (!), overloading boats . . . well, I think Hooper summed it up nicely: \"They're all gonna die!\"  I could say more, but why?  I think \"Jaws\" stands for itself.  Nine stars.",

And then I learned that most people's reaction to \"Jaws\" was not admiration and respect for those wonderful creatures that sharks are, but fear and hatred! I was shocked - how could anyone hate sharks? I was sure everyone would realize how false the very idea of \"Jaws\" was, and understand that the movie is nothing but a 100% untrue, unrealistic fairy tale with horror elements - a modern Brothers Grimm equivalent! But obviously, many people believed it and as a result, supported the criminal idea of killing sharks. What a sick thing to do, I thought! Couldn't they separate the truth from the movie? Didn't they know how fabulous and actually not at all aggressive toward humans sharks had always been? Apparently, they didn't... and many grew to hate sharks *because* of \"Jaws\"!To sum it up - I would give the movie 9 stars for its value entertainment and minus 100 stars for what it did to sharks.

As for the advice, I would tell you to read a few good books on sharks and watch a few good documentaries before seeing \"Jaws\", especially if your opinion on sharks is not favorable.",

One forgets that this was Spielberg's first BIG budget film (not counting The Sugarland Express), and the pressure he was under was intense.  'Bruce' the shark could have been a phoney looking disaster in the hands of most other directors, but Spielberg adapted to the limitations of his animatronic 'actor' and infused the film with a sense of mystery and forboding by rarely showing the shark, and only in quick glimpses when he did.  The acting was first rate with great actors Robert Shaw as Quint, Roy Scheider as Chief Brody, and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. They made you CARE about the characters. Without that we would WANT the shark to eat them, and all tension and suspense would be nothing but chum in the water.    Perhaps the biggest negative about Jaws is all the sequels it spawned. The movie was great and should have been left to stand on its own, with the sequels draining some of the reputation that the original created. Imagine E.T. coming back with phasers bent on world domination, it just doesn't work.  See Jaws again for the first time, and remember how great it really is/was/will be.",

            "content": "This is the movie that really reminds me of high school; it came out the summer before I started my senior year, the summer I turned 18.\"Jaws\" was the \"Psycho\" of my generation. I don't apply this term to \"Halloween\", another equally scary film of the '70's involving pointy things that can kill you, because \"Jaws\" and \"Psycho\" have too very important elements in common with each other, and \"Halloween\" somehow seems to fall into a different horror genre.Both \"Psycho\" and \"Jaws\" are about ordinary people doing something ordinary and enjoyable, two activities one would normally never find dangerous: showering, and splashing about in the shallows of the ocean.I don't remember, but I can't imagine that this movie made people very happy whose livelihood depended on beach tourism, as it was released in the early summer.Seeing \"Psycho\" made many people afraid to take showers (including actress Janet Leigh, who starred in it and claimed she never took another shower afterwards), and \"Jaws\" made many people afraid to swim in the ocean. It scared the hell out of us teenagers and made for endless pranks at the beach that summer (hey, I was 17 when it came out in the theater, what can I say)? Two of my friends would take turns pretending to be an approaching shark in the water, using his hand as a fin, while hmming the classic \"Jaws\" soundtrack, or pretending to be the first victim in the film (minus the screaming, which upset the lifeguards), thrashing and flailing about in the waves as if being attacked and dragged underwater.\"Jaws\" was also Steven Spielberg's first (and I think best) blockbuster. It could only help boost the careers of the 3 lead male actors in the film: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss (this was the role that made Dreyfuss a star). It spawned one of the most classic and oft-quoted lines in film history: \"We're gonna need a bigger boat.\" It was also technically a very innovative film, with a mechanical shark that by all accounts was a great deal of trouble.I hadn't seen this film in several years, having seen it umpteen times when it first came out, and several times on VHS, as I owned an old VHS copy of it. But I recently got the 30th Anniversary Edition, and saw it again last night, in the dark, in widescreen, through the stereo (gone is the full-screen only old tape).Suffice to say that when the head pops out of the boat...I still jump just as much as I did the first time I saw it in the theater.The ultimate, and best, of the \"Scary Summer Movie\" genre.The \"Special Edition 30th Anniversary Edition\" (widescreen, of course) of the film includes some great special features such as deleted scenes and outtakes, a never-before-available interview with Spielberg, archives, and a two-hour documentary of the making of the film. The deleted scenes and outtakes are a riot; I can certainly see why the shot of Robert Shaw's clog-sheathed foot stepping out of a big black car with the words \"QUINT\" in white and a white outline drawing of a shark on its door were cut! Shaft! We never knew ya!",

            "content": "I don't know if it is pure coincidence or if they did it on purpose, but it's a fact that only a couple of days after we got the news that two people in the USA had been attacked by a shark in a couple of days time, this movie was shown on one of our national television channels (I don't really believe this was just pure coincidence, since they can't get any better 'publicity' for such a movie). And it has to be said: this movie may well be thirty years old, but it's still capable of scaring the hell out of people.The story of \"Jaws\" is actually a quite simple one. When a girl dies in the ocean near a peaceful community on Amity Island, it's immediately believed to be a shark attack. But because the mayor doesn't want to spoil an entire summer by scaring the many tourists away, he is able to have it called a boating accident, much to the new police chief Martin Brody's frustration. He's convinced that more people will die if they don't do anything against this ferocious predator and soon enough he's proved right when a boy is killed by the shark. Together with a scientist and an old fisherman, he goes after the giant white shark to get rid of it for once and for all...This movie may well be one of the most famous movies of the seventies, but that doesn't mean that it is perfect. As long as you don't see the shark this is really a terrifying movie, but from the moment on that they show that giant rubber 'thing', it loses quite a lot of its power. You just know that this isn't correct, because it just is too gigantic and it doesn't react like a real shark. And I'm not even talking about the fact that it attacks boats, what I'm talking about are some 'small' details like not closing its eyes when attacking or not changing the position of the mouth. Normally a shark opens its mouth further when it gets closer, showing a lot more of its gums. This shark however is lifeless as it attacks.However, the movie has a lot of good things to offer as well. The acting for instance is really good. Roy Scheider does a good job as police chief Brody, but in my opinion it was Robert Shaw who was the best with his role of Quint, the fearless boat captain. Also very good is the music. I believe there is absolutely nobody who doesn't know what it is like and if you ask ten people to hum it, nine out of ten will be able to do it. And let's be honest, if it wasn't for the music, most scenes wouldn't even be scary. It's the music that creates the atmosphere of tension and terror when there is in fact nothing to be seen in the movie. But it works perfectly and that's all that matters.Overall this is a good movie, but if it hadn't been from the hand of Steven Spielberg, I'm pretty sure this would have been an awful one. It was probably his very first really great movie and he proved with this one that he was able to make a very good movie out of a concept that begs to become a failure. Many others have tried to copy its success with two sequels, but also with other 'shark' movies and not one of them was able to get to the same level of fear. However, when you are at least a little bit interested in sharks, you know that what is shown in it isn't correct. Many people only feared sharks after seeing this movie and that's too bad, because this marvelous creatures really aren't the mindless terror / killing machines that this movie made of them. I like the fact that the movie is one of the best in the genre, but I wish it had been a bit closer to reality. That's why I give it a 7/10.",

Brody, Quint and Hooper. the three characters are very different to each other (slightly hippie academic rich kid, hard as nails working fisherman, and kinda edgy/disillusioned police/everyman) but they are brought together by a common goal. and the scene where they all get drunk and exchange shark stories is just brilliant. Shaw's recollection of events on the U.S.S Indianapolis is one of my favourite scenes in any movie, and he acts it brilliantly Brody, the cop that tried to get an easy life is fabulous as well, and he, Quint and Hooper share an entertaining rapport throughout.all of this, and the shark hasn't even gotten mention yet! i try to forget about the shark actually as this film made me afraid of the water as a child. and even though i've faced my fear since, I'm still scared witless of big sharks and this film is the reason!!! in actual fact the shark isn't a big deal and the parts where it starts leaping out of the water are less effective compared to what you don't see earlier on. and i'm certain that the shark scenes in this movie are small fry anyway by todays horror standards the movie uses a lot of real world footage so it captures a really nice authentic essence of the 70's. and the part where Brody flicks through the book on actual shark attacks brings the movie into the real world the sound in the movie is of course very memorable, and the jaws theme straddles the line between music and sound in an interesting way. also very nice underwater sound mixed abruptly with 'normal' sound as the camera breaks the surface of the water. i love that sound at the very start of the movie also just before the tune starts, which i think is a pod of whales or something like that. very cool anywayi'm not sure that the new generation would enjoy this movie so much for thrills, but for me this is a 100% classic",

But one summer, the summer of '75 a new visitor comes to the bech an enormous man-eating great white shark. Brody (ROY SCHEIDER) a former big city cop and now the local sheriff, finds the remains of a college girl and orders the beaches closed. Mayor Vaughan (MURRAY HAMILTON) and other city officials, however, rescind that order for fear of what it will do to the town's tourism. Brody and his wife Ellen (LORRAINE GARY) don't think that was the right thing to do and worry about the safety of their two boys. After several more people are killed by the shark, though, Brody closes the beaches and brings in Hooper (RICHARD DREYFUSS), an oceanographic expert, to help find the shark. In the end, however, they need Quint (ROBERT SHAW), the local, grizzled \"old man of the sea\" to hunt down and kill the shark. The three men then head out into open waters and bait, and wait, for their encounter with the dangerous shark. One of the great box-office hits of all time is also one of the best horror films in the last few decades. Spielberg's classic shark story, based on Peter Benchley's novel, kept millions out of the water during the summer of '75. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and the great Robert Shaw go shark hunting off the New England coast and find Melvillian adventure. A classic combination of suspense, effects, editing, cinematography, score and bristling characterizations. The movie that was supposed to be 1975's biggest flop, but instead it has become a classic thriller. This film briefly turned all of those actors into big stars, and for the next few years they headlined many of biggest released movies.From John Williams unforgettable score to Spielberg's unmatched directorial talent, Jaws is grand entertainment.",

This is probably John Williams greatest soundtrack, (probably not Spielberg's greatest movie though). Those shots at the very end where The Shark is sinking the ship were especially good. The acting was also good. Richard Dreyfuss especially. It's not a film I would particularly want to watch again though.One viewing is enough to terrify one of the water, which does make Jaws serve its purpose. This might sound a bit nit picky, and I know this movie took place on the beach, though a lot of the scenes were just too bright. There was a glare in most of the beach scenes. The lighting was perfect in the scene they were trying to catch the shark with bait though. But that's not why I gave it a 6. The concept of Jaws has never really interested me; a giant shark that terrorizes swimmers.I found a couple of the scenes in Jaws to be overdone. Now I realize, these scenes were supposed to shock the viewer and add to the horror, though the movie would have been just as scary without them. I am not referring to the scene with the head popping out of the canoe, or whatever, that was well-done. The scenes I am referring to are the opening scenes; the first attack the shark makes, on the one girl swimming alone in the ocean. I thought it was one of the weakest scenes in the movie. It just went on for too long. To me, the scene could of been much better if the girl disappeared under the water, once the shark arrived. Instead we have to view her flailing and screaming for about 20 seconds. The producers did make this scene more frightening by not showing the shark in this particular scene.Another one was the scene towards the end when the shark swam onto the ship and tore that fishermen to shreds. I mean, come on was it really necessary to show the shark biting him that many times?, with streams of blood spewing out of him? I think a little editing would have been very good for Jaws, as it is a PG movie. How it was rated that, is beyond me. PG does suggest \"parental guidance\", though only moderately. I think the parental guidance that would surround the viewing of Jaws, for children, should be much more than moderate.I also like for a horror movie to hide some of the violence, a lot of times it makes the movie more suspenseful. Jaws actually does do this in some scenes. For example, between all of the attacks, the shark is only shown a few times in the movie. So when the shark actually does appear, its all the more terrifying. These were the only scenes that bothered me though, everything else was well-done. I agree that Movies like this are classics (despite my six)and worth watching during some point of a persons life. Probably after they left all their beach years behind, as I saw this movie months ago, and have not swam in the ocean since. I was already scared enough of the ocean as it was, but Jaws just brought it too a whole new level. (I have to give it some credit for this)",

It's just got one of those feelings that Hollywood will never, ever be able to reproduce. I doubt there is anything I could say about this movie that would do it justice and that others haven't already said better than I, so i'll just mention a few of the things that make me keep on coming back for more.So many to chose from... well, there is the shark, of coarse. Brilliant move by Spielberg in not showing it until the third act. In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, \"We're gonna need a bigger boat\", \"This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propellor, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark\", \"Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!\", and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has recieved it has earned.I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a \"making of\", deleted scenes and outakes. Definately money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The \"making of\" feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it. 10/10 stars, and worth every one! G'night!",

I am not old enough to recall movies or the summer movie season prior to 1975,so I suppose I have to trust the voracity of that contention. The story's pretty familiar by now: around and about the 4th of July weekend in the New England beach town of Amity,a shark is killing unsuspecting swimmers along the coastline. Enter Sheriff Martin Brody(Roy Scheider),who with his family has freshly relocated from New York. He's not fond of the water and,to his great chagrin,the deaths of two swimmers has him running into unforeseen tension with the grinning,business-obsessed Mayor(Murray Hamilton),who doesn't want to close down the beach on the 4th. When Brody's warnings heed another attack,he is sent to find and kill the shark along with an out-of-town marine biologist(Richard Dreyfuss) and a crusty old sea salt named Quint(Robert Shaw). As per any creature feature,the task is going to prove easier said than done.Spielberg may've worked his most deft touches here: the amount of horror and tension here are choice,and,as is the case in his movies since(E.T.,War of the Worlds,to a lesser degree Jurassic Park)the creature of doubt is not revealed until well into the film. Off the top of my head,I don't recall if Peter Benchley wrote the screenplay version of his novel,but whoever did was able to keep the script tight and understated,so as to allow for a normal framing to a menacing situation.Well worth a collection for the cineaste,whether they are into monster/man vs. nature films or not.",

            "content": "In 1974, if anyone had been asked their predictions of what upcoming release would change the course of the industry, it is impossible to imagine there being a less likely candidate than Jaws. A pulpy novel adapted by a 28 year old near unknown director yielding one of the most infamously disastrous film shoots in the history of the medium (a duration of a projected 55 days exploding into 159, with a cantankerous cast, a mutinous crew and a barely functioning shark prop) - all things considered, the fact that the film was completed is a feat in itself. And yet, paradoxically for a film centering around a series of deaths, Jaws instead yielded a succession of figurative rebirths, being credited with singlehandedly pioneering the summer blockbuster and ancillary markets, terrifying and thrilling audiences worldwide and turning its amateur director into one of the most recognizable figures in the film industry - a certain Steven Spielberg. The combination of factors clicked, Jaws wormed its way into the collective unconscious with uncanny speed, and no viewer would ever look at deep water entirely devoid of fear again.The film is a true rarity - a 'monster' film which spends most of the film avoiding showing its iconic antagonist, a horror thriller in which the characters emerge as the most memorable, and a film with the simplest of premises which has yielded countless theories on the \"meaning\" of the shark (alternatively declared as emblematic of womanhood attacking the film's sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of masculinity, cold war nuclear destruction on a small American town, or the entire film as an extensive critique of American capitalism - particularly ironic for such an outrageously financially successful film). Yet Jaws also harbours a real pulsating life beyond being a mere collection of now iconic moments and lines. Scenes such as Brody's trading silly faces with his son at the dinner table and the three protagonists' drunken comparison of scars infuse the film with a genuine heart and emotional attachment, making the masterfully concealed yet still shoddy special effects all the more easy to swallow and the film all the more engrossing. As effective a directorial calling card as any, the film serves to showcase all the attributes which would serve to make Spielberg a cinematic legend: addressing familiar viewer expectations with a paradoxically refreshing immediacy, constructed yet honest emotion, sentiment trimmed of excess sap and credible optimism juxtaposed with real terror. A simple tale of men versus shark is evolved into a larger than life cinematic parable, and, crucially, remains enormously entertaining in spite of its countless other plaudits. Yet what makes Spielberg's film the most intriguing is its ability to accomplish so much with so little. From the skeletal plot to John Williams' timeless yet almost entirely two note musical score to Bill Butler's legendary shark point-of-view cinematography to the script's impressive use of few lines to suggest a wealth of characterisation, the film thrives on minimalism. Spielberg distills conventional story complexity and nuance into emotional chords (fear of water, the unknown, etc.) as primal as the film's antagonist. And antagonist the shark unquestionably is, overblown far past notions of realistic shark size and behaviour into the definitive foe, beyond conventional notions of evil into an unflinching, incessant force of nature, and all the more terrifying because of it. And it is the shark's unpredictable tearing through the picture which chaotically deviates from its minimalism, punctuating its crisp efficiency with bursts of brutal excesses. While Spielberg amps the tension of the pending shark attacks up to near unbearable levels, their sheer ferocity and the camera's tenacious refusal to shy away from the gruesome spectacle still manages to make them shocking and horrifying despite the anticipation. However, Spielberg is not afraid to take his time - after a while knuckled opening fright, the film slows down, allowing copious time for audiences to sit with and take to the down to earth honesty of the characters while slowly but surely moving its plot along, making the bursts of shark activity all the more surprising through having lured the audience into a false sense of security. And while such thrill driven films would normally pale in a contemporary context (and it is likely the film could prove too slow and comparatively bloodless to equally enthrall more gore-saturated modern viewers), Jaws defies such concerns through its sublimely creeping pacing and masterful technical work, making the film as superb an emotional assault currently as in 1975. Roy Scheider's gruff charisma proves the perfect emotional heart for the film, making his aquaphobic Chief Brody not only innately likable but entirely credible, an unshowy yet impeccably realized triumph of a lead. Richard Dreyfus is also wonderfully memorable, his devilish sarcasm making marine biologist Matt Hooper eons away from the stereotypical ranting scientist. Robert Shaw is simply mesmerising as grizzled shark hunter Quint, toeing the perfect balance between being raucously likable and dangerously deranged, with his chilling Indianapolis monologue searing into the memory. Lorraine Gary is also an entirely human creation as Brody's wife, with each action suggesting years of familiarity and chemistry. And Murray Hamilton maintains a gleefully infuriating paradox of being an insidiously hateful character, yet too slickly charismatic and nearly sympathetic to outright dislike as Amity Island's struggling mayor, famously refusing to close the beaches despite the danger due to the income from busy season. As unlikely as it may have been, Jaws proves a truly unforgettable triumph of a motion picture, proving that narrative simplicity and being geared to be enjoyable need not be mutually exclusive from quality film-making. Even years from its initial release the film remains uniformly superb enough to justify the exceptional burst of merchandising and publicity, proving one of those few films as unlikely to be fully shaken from the viewer's head as the collective unconscious. Never again will it be entirely safe to go back in the water. -10/10",

            "review_title": "The Original Covered Everything You Could Want in a Killer Shark Film",
            "content": "I have always been perplexed why Hollywood thought they needed sequels to this great film. As far as I know, Peter Benchley who penned the original novel never wrote a sequel, and Spielberg declined to direct Jaws II. Of course the answer is the producers and executives believed they would make even more money off the Jaws franchise, particularly among those who just could not get enough of the original. But as an artistic statement, this movie really doesn't warrant sequels as it covers just about everything you could possibly do with the subject. Aside from the shark killings themselves, the characters and the audience actually learn a little bit about sharks, there are political \"currents\" regarding whether or not to close the beaches, forces more interested in profits than safety are exposed, and there is even the lynching of a poor tiger shark which turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, i.e. he wasn't \"the shark\". I always felt sorry for the little innocent tiger shark.Two characters represent somewhat opposing views of the knowledge spectrum concerning their understanding of sharks: an expert scientist from the oceanographic society, Matt Hooper played by Richard Dreyfus, and a fisherman who makes his living catching sharks and other large sea animals, Quint played with convincing realism by the immortal Robert Shaw. Quint is not college-educated but he learned his trade through direct experience. Late in the film when Hooper and Quint are asked to sign on to a charter to kill the shark, their worlds collide. At interesting points, both characters misjudge the shark. Roy Scheider as Chief Brody, who used to defend innocent victims from mobsters in New York, finds his number-one most wanted man in Amity is not a human being but a shark. He ends up playing referee between Hooper and Quint. But as the last segment unfolds, we find Quint has some ulterior motives which may run contrary to killing the shark.The brilliant dramatic decision which pushed this movie into the realm of par excellence (rather than merely very good) is the delay in seeing the shark for nearly half the film. Despite the posters which show a young woman enjoying a care-free swim in the ocean with a large set of teeth propelling toward her from the depths like a menacing underwater rocket, the audience never actually experiences this scene as shown. Yes, the young swimmer is the first victim, but you never see her killer, sort of akin to a murder mystery in which you see and hear the victim's demise but you don't see the murderer. Certainly, the title of the film JAWS is a give-away as to the identity of the perpetrator, but the story begins as a kind of mystery, and almost immediately, the politics of the town begins to encroach on the decisions of Chief Brody who is mainly concerned with public safety. In one of the most memorable scenes, Brody and Hooper come upon the remains of the shark's destructive power without actually seeing the shark itself.This film was Steven Spielberg's big-time debut into the upper echelons of cinema. All kinds of interesting camera techniques are used to heighten dramatic and suspenseful effects. He even borrows a couple of trademark tricks from Hitchcock and Welles. The cast is A-list, although none of them were and ever have been big movie stars, but simply top tier actors doing what they do best. As the producers pointed out, the star of the film was the shark himself, so there was no need to put big name stars into the feature. If there is a standout in the acting department, I think it would have to go to Robert Shaw as Quint who is absolutely believable as the rough-and-ready harpooner, \"sharker\" and World War II veteran, a modern equivalent of Captain Ahab of Moby Dick fame. This is one of the all-time great action/suspense films, but don't waste your time on the ridiculous sequels. I think the original says all that needs to be said.",

            "content": "Ask yourself what Jaws is? Is it a Thriller? A Horror flick? An Adventure story? A Drama? The correct answer is that it's all of these things. It's a blockbuster! It's the definition of a movie that triumphs in terms of entertainment. Citizen Kane is considered the founder of films since it invented many cinematic techniques and styles used in films. Well if that's true, then Jaws is the legend of films. After this movie, everybody wanted to be Jaws. But why is that? First of all it's a masterful retelling of the novel, Jaws, by Peter Benchley, and the film adaptation is also a massive improvement over the original story. The cast is amazing, Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss pull off amazing performances and make one feel invested in the story since we're invested in the characters. They all feel like unique characters that break away from traditional clich\u00e9s associated with their character types. More importantly, they have amazing chemistry since they all play off one another. This is something Hollywood couldn't do today since it would be too concerned with appealing to ethnic and gender diversity rather than acting diversity. The cast is perfect. Additionally, Jaws replaces boring plot elements to create better pacing and it carries a tone appropriate for both horror movies and adventure movies. That's because it has a two act structure that works even with two different atmospheres for each act. The first act feels like a horror movie and functions as one while the second act feels like an oceanic adventure. This works because the intense tone is consistent throughout the story even as the atmosphere undergoes an evolution between the two acts. Why? John Williams! John Williams amazing score makes the movie lively and thrilling. Few scores can compare to the iconic theme for Jaws. The story is masterfully done and allows one to be entertained for the entire film. Jaws is also a massive victor in cinematography. The shark used in the film, Bruce, had massive problems that caused it break down constantly. Therefore, Spielberg decided to utilize as many shots that didn't show the shark on screen. This may seem lazy, but it actually works beautifully since the film plays off the fear of the unknown. By not seeing the attacker, the shark is more terrifying than it would be if we actually saw it. By the time we do see the shark, it's far beyond our wildest expectations and even then shown only occasionally. Additionally, the usage of first person shots for the shark, shots set between the water line, wide-scale shots, and close ups, we manage to see the story through multiple angles which makes the story all the more real to us. And if John Williams score wasn't already amazing enough, it further makes the cinematography feel epic. This whole movie is epic, and it continues to hold up to this day. It has one of the greatest legacies for a film. When you're film managed to lower beach attendance and make people afraid to go swimming, you know you did something right. The film is timeless and can be enjoyed by absolutely anyone. Steven Spielberg's greatest masterpiece and my personal favorite film of all time, Jaws is a brilliant movie that I will love forever.",

The fact that the (mechanical) shark was not working most of the time they shot, had to make everyone involved more creative ... and really stirred up the imaginations of the viewers.Great acting talent in front of the camera and a lot of locals who added some extra flavor ... and the blueprint for every bad decision mayor ever since (it's tourist season - we can't close the beaches - ah well the commercial and financial necessities) ... there is really so much here, that you could not have predicted or planned ... and yet all this made the movie even better. That doesn't mean that some might not like it - like Steven not being a fan of modern movies showing too much, some will dismiss this for not showing enough.But that would be missing the point in my book.

Even now, over thirty years since it was released, it's still scaring people to death because it's so brilliantly made. From the moment that I saw \"Jaws\" for the first time, I was amazed by the movie and it instantly became my favorite of all time.First of all, there's the fact that Steven Spielberg is in the director's chair and when that happens, you're guaranteed to get a good movie. Even the worst of his movies are worth seeing over and over again a few times. And \"Jaws\" is probably his best. I find it amazing he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. His great idea of not seeing the shark until the movie is half over was a great one. Although John Williams was and he won the Academy Award for his haunting and still very famous music score. It's definitely the best horror theme ever made. Very original and powerful.Also, we have a cast of talented actors. Roy Scheider plays \"Police Chief Martin Brody\", the law officer who is desperate to hunt down and kill the shark that is menacing the people he was hired to protect. The late and talented Robert Shaw is \"Quint\", a cantankerous modern Ahab who hunts sharks for a living. And Richard Dreyfuss is \"Matt Hooper\" a young marine biologist called down to help Brody and Quint handle the twenty-five-foot-long great white shark.Note: I also thought that Robert Shaw should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in this movie.\"Jaws\" is based on a bestselling novel by Peter Benchley (who died in January of this year, 2006). And although the book was a great one, definitely one of my all-time favorite novels, I prefer the movie. I liked some of the screenwriter's decisions better. Such as having Brody and Hooper being friends instead of enemies. And I also think that the ending of the movie is far more climatic than in the book. In the movie, the shark is killed when a tank of compressed air is crammed into its mouth and then shot with a rifle, causing it to burst open and tear the shark's head apart. In the novel, the shark just bleeds to death. This is not an insult towards Peter Benchley's ideas, I just felt that Spielberg's version was a better one.\"Jaws\" is the best thriller of all time. Definitely a classic that will always be around. I hope it never gets remade, because nobody will ever be able to do what Steven Spielberg and his team did on this movie. And besides, there will never be another Robert Shaw to play Quint.",

Then again I was only 13 years old or so...Enough childhood memories, let's talk about the movie itself. It's a story about a great white shark, killing people just of the coast of a summer tourist town. The 4th of July is drawing near, and the mayor is reluctant of closing down the beach, because they need the summer tourist's cash to keep the town alive, so to speak. But is that really an option with a killer shark in the waters? The Sheriff (Brody) is insisting on closing down the beach, but no one listens to him. He then calls in an expert (Hooper) who examines the dead body of a woman and confirms that it was a shark attack. But even then, the mayor stays put and the beach remains open.The story is excellent and well-written. It moves at a steady pace and delivers everything: suspense, humor, drama, shocks, good dialog and some gore.The music! Let's not forget the AWESOME music written by John Williams. After 30+ years, the Jaws theme is still a classic tune and just about everyone knows it.Steven Spielburg handled this movie with great care. No real sharks are used in this movie, yet the way the scenes are filmed truly gives you chills. In particular, the opening scene (with poor Chrissie) is a scene that has been burned into my brain for the rest of my life.What else? ... The acting is amazing. A very solid cast and no 'dumb' dialog. You are really going to love and hate some characters.Then there's the shark. Like I said, it's not a real one, but that doesn't mean it stinks. On the contrary, Bruce (the sharks nickname apparently) prevented me from going swimming in the ocean for years! Jaws is perhaps the best shark movie in history. Using CGI nowadays to bring monster sharks and such to the screen just isn't the same as clever directing and filming.A true classic. I give Jaws 9 out of 10 stars!

Granted the Jaws theme John Williams composed has remained a classic in film score and depicted with aplomb the anxiety and terror of a large predatory shark closing in, and the scenes are decently directed and put together if you assess them with conventional mainstream movie criteria... but this is so far removed from actual shark phobia in any realistic, poignant sort of way and is so completely disinterested with it aside from the very first scene (possibly the only really creepy moment). It never even attempts to be realistic or genuine and only settles for that big production plastic Hollywood atmosphere and basically self-imposed itself as the one good shark movie out there that was legit (all other attempts being cheap B rated rubbish). It had John Williams for the score, Spielberg behind the cams, and Scheider/Robert Shaw and Dreyfuss, all well established big names, to give it the outside credibility it really is all about in the end. And 'Jaws' was even a novel, so they already had their story written for them.Instead of looking to develop psychological triggers of thalassophobia (fear of the ocean), perhaps kenophobia (fear of immense empty spaces), or actual fear of sharks, where they could've shown a lot more footage of the deep dark endless ocean and managed the suspense up to a climax there, built tension of a lurking sea monster which looming presence is felt like its terrifying appearance is imminent, played around between the ominous utter silence of the ocean blue and filled up that silence with a sudden change of pace and horrifying panic... basically instead of doing their job at that with this being the supposed top notch 'fear of the ocean/featuring a great white shark' masterpiece, they settle for the bare minimum in terms of exploring the phobia itself and just go for processing a bland screenplay and script and scenes that are about as superficial and deep as the entrance of a beach.",

So it's a pleasant discovery to find a director who, with Jaws, was at the top of his game.Oh, it's all hollow, of course. No real message or depth, just a multiplex-pleasing piscine horror movie, yet the way each and every single shot is lovingly put together is truly commendable. There's neat touches, like Schieder's face zooming into close up while the background stays the same distance. Admittedly, he's ripping off Hitchcock left, right and centre, but he's doing it in such a caring way it doesn't really seem to matter. Other images stand out, such as the head in the boat, or the dead swimmer's buried hand crawling with crabs. (The crustaceans, not the STD). There are clever moments, like Roy looking through research pictures on sharks. Not only does this give out relatively discrete exposition, but also it gets in our minds the image of a real shark, a sense of foreboding that would cover over any misgivings when the actual rubber version finally appears. And with John Williams' supremely memorable \"der-der, der-der\" incidental theme, Spielberg has a Psycho-rivalling sting to deliver home the shocks.A man coming out of his hut with the sign \"Harbor Master Frank Silva\" is a little obvious in imparting information, but Dreyfuss' autopsy is another genius touch. In order to keep the film available to the widest possible audience, the gore is toned down. So what Dreyfuss' description does is to suggest it, which is scarier anyway. In fact, the first sighting of the shark isn't till nearly an hour into the movie, during which time Spielberg has skilfully borrowed and honed shots from classic cinema to blend into the picture. Characters walk too near to the camera, or in front of it, obscuring the view, while waves splash up it \u0096 all giving a subliminal illusion of reality.Yet it has to be said that the second half, with it's slightly camp incidental music, and ponderous male bonding dissipates the tension somewhat. It's as if Spielberg realised he was building up to something really special and lost his nerve. Shots of the shark itself actually amount to less than ten minutes of the film's duration, many of which are underwater shots of the real thing. Where the action (i.e. when he's eating the actors) dictates the fake prop must be used the movie is less effective. The rubber shark now looks, frankly, slightly ridiculous. It's ironic that while the shark is the thing on which the movie is based, whenever it appears it tears at the credibility of the piece. While the shark's indestructibility and extreme powers of devastation \u0096 \"smile, you sonovabitch!\" \u0096 is an air of the feint silliness that would be symptomatic of the vastly inferior sequels...",

I know, there is very little chance of being attacked by a shark, but that one or two or however much percent chance of that happening was enough to convince me to stay out of the water after seeing this movie. Let's face it, folks, \"Bruce\" or \"The Great White Turd\" as Steven Spielberg himself affectionately called him (and that's what it looked like when Brody shot him and he sank to the bottom of the ocean) made King Kong, Godzilla, Frankenstein, the Wolf Man et al look like wimps. Some of the macabre humor in this movie made you feel uneasy while you were laughing, eg., Mayor Vaughn's line \"I'm not going to have all these people standing around here while you do some half-assed autopsy on a fish.\" As good as this movie, and the book is, I can't help thinking that this story is a rip-off of MOBY DICK, with Captain Quint being the Captain Ahab character with his obsession with capturing the shark, and in the ugly manner in which he died. Also, at least in the book, Chief Brody was the sole surviving Ishmael character (in the book, Matt Hooper gets eaten alive while he is in that shark cage). Also, great white whale vs. great white shark. A lot of parallels.This movie does keep you on the edge of your seat. And this is the soundtrack that put John Williams on the map. Before, he was the man behind TV shows THE TIME TUNNEL and GILLIGAN'S ISLAND. He also did those Irwin Allen disaster movies EARTHQUAKE, THE TOWERING INFERNO and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. Now, he is probably the greatest living composer (along with Ennio Morricone). The thing about this soundtrack is, when you listen to it by itself, you don't have to watch the movie to know what is going on.

Perfect.Directed by a relative unknown film geek named Steven Spielberg, Jaws opened in the summer of 1975 with reasonable expectations.  Universal Studios at first thought very little of the movie during production, but the reaction from the test audiences was electric.  What resulted, sparked change in the movie industry and revolutionized the summer box office for years to come.Jaws begins innocently enough as a group of young men and women are drinking and singing around a beach campfire at dusk when two people decide to go for a late night skin-dip.  As the male passes out on the beach, the female dives into the waters off Amity Island where suddenly she is pulled under like a bobby on a fishing line.  Looking both terrorized and confused, she does not scream right away.  Within seconds she is being torn from side to side screaming relentlessly for help.  Suddenly she is pulled under and the quiet calm waters overshadow the chaos that just ensued.\nThe next day, the young man who accompanied the girl to the waters' edge searches the beach with Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) in hopes of finding his lost companion.  A deputy's whistle leads them to the gruesome discovery of a hand lying on the beach.  The mystery was over, the girl was dead.This was the opening scene in Jaws, an adrenaline pumping few minutes that incorporated sex, nudity, terror and horror.  The game was afoot and Spielberg was on his way to establishing himself as the master behind the camera.Adapted by the best selling novel by Peter Benchley, Jaws is a story about hunting.  A police chief, a marine biologist and a gruffy sea captain hunt the shark while the shark continues to hunt and terrorize the community. When the beaches remain open and a little child becomes the second victim, Brody enlists the help of Matt Hooper (Richard Dryfuss) to help convince the mayor of the town that the beach is unsafe.  Unwilling to close the door on tourism revenue during the holiday season, the mayor keeps the beaches open and Hooper, Brody and expert fisherman Quint, take to the sea in hopes of locating and capturing their lurking predator.Twenty-years later, more is known about the making of Jaws that makes it even more enjoyable viewing.  For instance, we know that the shark created for the film was never tested and sunk to the bottom of the ocean on first trial.  As a result, Spielberg used a camera angle that gave us the view from the shark instead of producing the actual beast itself.  The result was pure terror as most of the thrilling scenes had a predator that was more implied than exploited.The new collectors edition DVD features many interesting extras that give us a glimpse into the hell that was the making of this film.  A documentary featurette titled 'Spotlight on Location: The Making of Jaws',  details how Robert Shaw had a temper, constantly fought on set with Richard Dryfuss and that he showed up for some scenes intoxicated.  We also learn that Lee Marvin was Spielberg's first choice to play Quint, and how John Williams' contribution of the score was the icing that packaged the cake.  A recapping of the test audience by Dryfuss takes you back to a golden age of movies when reactions were more commonplace, and how Spielberg handled the pressure of the studio executives when the film's production time ran from 55 to 155 days.  Fascinating stuff.It actually amazing to see the documentary and watch the film again with the knowledge that it was only Spielberg's second real shot behind the camera after The Sugarland Express.  To see him handle the drunken Shaw, the drowning Bruce (the name given to the mechanical shark) and the feuds between cast members to produce such a flawless film, is a precursor to what Steven became in later years.Almost thirty years later the affects of Jaws are widely accepted as commonplace.  Jaws was the first ever film to cross over the $100 domestic growth plateau that is now used as a benchmark to rate the overall success of a films popularity.  Over 65 million people went to see Jaws in 1975, which made it the first summer blockbuster, and it was one of the first films to report and have widely publicized the weekly receipts totals.\n1975 was indeed the year of the shark.  From Time Magazine to local newscasts, sharks were everywhere, and thanks to Spielberg, they were in our nightmares too.  Perfect.",

Of course, I do fully realize that \"Jaws\" was \"just-a-movie\" - But, all the same, I'm hardly convinced that a shark (especially one of this predator's apparent cunning) would ever behave as this one inevitably did in its hot pursuit of Quint and his 2-man crew on-board the Orca.If you ask me - This great white rogue of the ocean was just too obviously dumb for words. Believe me, this blood-thirsty beast was just asking to be killed. (And, yep, in the end, its wish came true) In conclusion - From where I was sitting - 1975's \"Jaws\" was yet another one of those ridiculous, big-budget movies that (now 40 years old) still manages to be grossly over-rated for reasons that I'd say are, for the most part, quite unfounded.",

The killing of the little boy (a choice that Spielberg seems to me spending the rest of his career atoning for by having little kids get rescued in all his other movies) is an especially brilliant scene- writing, filming, acting and... oh God!... the pacing and timing!!! Excellent performances from all three of the leads and some of the supportings as well (Lorraine Gary... unsung brilliance sadly tarnished by later appearing in JAWS: THE REVENGE); Shaw's monologue about his pacific experience is one of the greatest movie speeches ever. The writing in general is excellent- they remembered to take the time to develop characters and such, rather than just move from one shark attack to the next- as is the filming (my favorite moment being the beginning, when there's a shot of the sun setting on the water, and you see Chrissie's arm and hand sink slowly beneath the surface).

But I gave in and we went. I was sitting on the beach, watching as She swam out into the choppy waters. She rolled over, belly up, and started drifting toward a nearby pier. I was watching, not really interested, when something broke the surface of the water on the far side of my wife. It was a momentary thing, but I clearly saw the arched back- and the fin. I stood up and shouted a warning. She waved me off and continued to drift toward the pier. I followed, searching the surface of the ocean for another tell-tale sign of you-know-what. When she finally came ashore, I told her what I'd seen. She argued that I was just lying to scare her out of the water so we could go home. She went back into the water and I spent the rest of that day watching for the attack I was convinced would come. There was no attack- but, the very next day, not one but THREE sharks were hooked by fishermen fishing off of the pier toward which my wife had drifted.

The film is set in the small seaside resort of Amity, a  peaceful holiday town and to its residents, the summer means everything to their business. However, all is not well beneath the surface of the ocean, for a 25 foot great white shark has staked a claim in the waters.  It begins to pick off some of the townsfolk and the panic begins to spread.  Enter Police Chief Brody (a career-defining performance from Roy Schieder), who tries to close down the beaches to protect the people but is soon met with opposition from the Mayor (Murray Hamilton) who refuses to have them shut down for the 4th of July weekend.  As a compromise, Brody calls in an expert from the oceanographic institute, Matt Hooper (one of Richard Dreyfuss' early roles, and one of his best) who warns the mayor also of the dangers of allowing people into the water when a beast of such mammoth proportions is lurking below.  Predictably, disaster strikes and the mayor finally relents, allowing Brody to hire a contractor, someone to go out and kill the shark. The contractor comes in the form of an old sea dog in the mould of Captain Ahab,  namely Quint (Robert Shaw in fine form as usual) who has had several experiences with sharks on his many voyages.  He accepts the duty (\"I'll find him for three, but I'll catch him and kill him for ten\") and so he, Brody and Hooper set out to hunt down the beast.  However, it isn't long before the hunters become the hunted...I don't think I've had as much sheer enjoyment watching a film as I have when watching this 1975 classic.  Everything about it is perfect, the cast, the script, the effects, everything.  Anyone who criticises the shark for being unrealistic ought to have their heads examined, not only was it as good as was available at the time, but I haven't seen it bettered in any modern offerings - \"Deep Blue Sea\"?  The sharks in that pathetic excuse for a film are shamefully poor, I am still shocked to hear people claim that that production bettered \"Jaws\" in any way.  Steven Spielberg's offering is far superior to any other tale of the ocean and I doubt it will ever be bettered.I couldn't write a review of \"Jaws\" without commenting on John Williams Academy-Award winning score - the best score I've ever heard.  Just listening to it without the images encaptures the spirit and mystery of the ocean and who could possibly forget the oft-imitated main theme used to indicate the shark's arrival?This is as close as cinema can get to perfection in the action-horror genre, every moment of \"Jaws\" is priceless,  and I for one will never tire of watching this marvel.",

            "content": "One of the first \"high concept\" films and father of the American summer blockbuster tradition, happens over no other than July 4 weekend on Amity Island, a vacation resort fuelled by the dollars of its tourism. A famed opening sequence sets up the incidence of a man-eating shark in the coastal waters. A girl goes swimming by moonlight and is pulled under, shrieking. All indications identify a shark, but Mayor Vaughn doesn't want to scare away tourists, and instructs Brody, the police chief, to keep the beaches open. The mayor marches along the beach wearing a sport coat and tie, persuading people to go into the water. They do, with inevitable consequences.A town meeting is disrupted by the second of the film's central characters, the coarse, peering Quint. He grates his fingernails down a blackboard with a sketch of a shark and proposes his help as a bounty hunter. Later on, Brody sits at home thumbing through books on sharks, an expedient that establishes the predator in our heads as we observe page after page of alarming teeth, unfeeling black eyes and fatalities with hunks ripped from their flesh.The third crucial character is Hooper, an oceanographer, recruited as an consultant, and practical for the movie as he can assert tense information. Brody is certain the beaches must be closed and the shark slaughtered. The mayor plays for time, and then after the shark makes the news, a big reward is proposed, and Amity is teeming with careless fortune seekers. It's here that Spielberg works in one of his most ingenious and chilling visuals for signifying the shark, a pier breaking loose from its quay and floating out to sea. Then turning around and coming back toward shore. Drifting items are employed throughout the movie to evoke the unseen shark. In the central action sequences in the last part, we're frequently looking at kegs and not at a shark, but the idea is so well recognized that the shark is there.In keeping the Great White off-screen, the man who not long from his work here could buy everyone on Hollywood's Power List was exercising an approach applied by Hitchcock throughout his career, the crucial, often mistaken difference between suspense and surprise. Spielberg uses the shark to suspenseful effect for most of the movie. And the screenplay doesn't loop itself into allegory. The characters all have clear-cut intentions. A little dialogue goes far. Single lines overhang for hard-bitten brevity. The finest scene in the movie is the night scene in the kitchenette, where the men chug brandy and Quint and Hooper equate wounds. Ultimately Quint embarks on a morose monologue, telling the WWII tale of the sinking of the Indianapolis. He was one of its crew. Of the thousand or so, he says, one of the three hundred something still left before rescue came.Most people seem too caught up to wonder why the shark seems willing to trouble itself so much, at one point even trying to eat the boat. The shark has been so completely determined, through dialogue and somewhat documentary background, that its actual presence is augmented in our minds by all we've absorbed. Also, Spielberg's first smash-hit features rudiments he duplicated in many of his movies. A night sea hunt for the shark presents an early instance of his pet visual trademark, a ray of light made perceptible by smog. He's continued to apply strong concentration on characters, rather than rushing past them to the special effects, as so many '80s and '90s effects directors did. In this watershed tour de force and later, he favors atmosphere over emotional battering, and one of the extraordinary things about the movie is its naturalistically low-key milieu. The recognizable theme by John Williams, which, I dunno, maybe you've heard, is subdued and cunning. It's frequently heard during point-of-view shots, at water level and below, that are another way Spielberg implies the shark without brandishing it. The cinematography, by Bill Butler, is painstakingly marshals the story amidst middle-class America. If Spielberg's preferred location would become the all-American residential communities, Jaws shows his favorite middle-class squatters on vacation.",

            "content": "The British film critic Barry Norman once described Steven Spielberg as the man who makes B-movies on an A-movie budget. That sounds like a devastating put-down, but I don't think Norman meant it as such. What he meant was that Spielberg borrowed themes from the cheap and cheerful science-fiction and adventure stories he had known in his youth and then gave those themes the full, glossy A-movie treatment. \"Jaws\" is a case in point. If a film on this subject had been made twenty (or even ten) years earlier it would probably have had some lurid title such as \"The Giant Killer Shark Horror\" and have been made on a very low budget with comically bad special effects. It would doubtless have disappeared from view almost completely, only surfacing for occasional late-night showings on specialist movie channels, probably on a double bill with something like \"The Blood Beast Terror\" or \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\". (I am not making that last one up; there really was a film with that title). \"Jaws\" is set on the island of Amity, somewhere off the north-east coast of the USA. (The film was actually shot on Martha's Vineyard). The film is a mixture of disaster movie and hunting epic. It is something of a convention in disaster films that the disaster should be either caused or exacerbated by human stupidity, negligence or greed, and \"Jaws\" is no exception. After a young woman is killed by a shark while out swimming, the local police chief Martin Brody wants to close the beaches, but allows himself to be overruled by the town's mayor and councillors who argue that the girl's death could in fact have been the result of her being struck by a propeller. They are motivated by the fact that the island is a popular holiday resort, dependent upon the income it receives from tourists, and any hint of a man-eating shark in the area would be economically disastrous. (There was a very similar plot line in the 1990s disaster film, \"Dante's Peak\", although that concerned a volcano rather than a shark). Of course, Brody is proved right and the shark strikes again, causing panic on the beach and killing a young boy. Soon afterwards a shark is caught, and the relieved local politicians announce that this is the one that was responsible for the two deaths. One man, however, is not convinced. Matt Hooper, an ichthyologist, believes from the wounds on the two bodies that the shark that has been caught was too small to have carried out the attacks. Hooper and Brody, who is suffering from feelings of guilt over the boy's death, charter a boat, skippered by a local fisherman named Quint, to hunt down the true culprit. Although the film was made more than thirty years ago, it has dated well, despite the many advances in cinema technology that have occurred since then. Today the shark would probably be conjured up by CGI, but in 1975 Spielberg had to rely upon a mechanical model. As this model frequently malfunctioned, we do not, in fact, see the shark all that often, although this probably adds to the film's effectiveness by making the scenes in which it does appear all the more frightening. Also very effective is John Williams's simple but eerie theme tune; like Bernard Herrman's score for \"Psycho\" this demonstrates that the most effective film music is not always that which would sound best in the concert hall. Roy Scheider as Brody and Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper play their parts well, but I have never really liked Robert Shaw's eccentric Quint. Although Quint does not actually have a wooden leg, a gold earring or a parrot squawking \"Pieces of Eight\", Shaw seems to have fallen victim to the curse of overacting which frequently afflicts film stars called upon to portray members of the seafaring profession. (He was much better in \"A Man for All Seasons\" and \"The Sting\"). The film has other weaknesses; at times it appears improbable (could a shark really batter its way into an iron cage so easily?) and at others, particularly in the first half, overlong. Overall, however, \"Jaws\" is a reasonably good film, and in the second half, when the great shark hunt is under way, manages to be both thrilling and, at times, genuinely frightening. Nevertheless, I certainly would not agree with all those who have voted it into your top 100 films (it is currently at #97). It was only Spielberg's second feature film, and his first major success, and I suspect that its continuing popularity owes as much to its place in the Spielberg canon as it does to its intrinsic merits. I have never been an adherent of the quasi-religious Cult of the Great Director which has grown up around Spielberg; he has made some excellent films, notably the brilliant \"Schindler's List\", but these have normally been when he has tried to produce something of greater significance than the popcorn blockbusters which have constituted much of his output. \"Jaws\" is a well-made and exciting adventure film, but at the end of the day it is still only a B-movie made on an A-movie budget. 7/10",

            "content": "Early on there are some interesting themes in Jaws: capitalism vs public safety, and mob mentality vs science and rationality. Ooh, don't you want to just punch that mayor for looking out for business concerns while letting people go to the beach after the first shark attack? It's almost an exercise in Darwinism when people return to the beach, and there's marvelous tension ala Hitchcock because we know the shark is out there, amplified by the classic soundtrack and the terrific feeling Spielberg gave us of being in the water. The film also a battle between working class experience (the crusty sea captain, Robert Shaw) vs college education (the oceanographer, Richard Dreyfuss), with the town's police chief stuck in between (Roy Scheider).This is a Moby Dick tale of sorts, with this one demonizing great white sharks instead of sperm whales, and the Ahab in this case seeking revenge on sharks after having watched hundreds of his shipmates get eaten in the South Pacific after they went down in WWII. Like Ahab, he's teetering on losing his sanity, giving the search he goes on with the other two an extra dimension. Benchley also seems to have lifted the climax to Melville's tale when he wrote his first book.There is a great feeling of authenticity in the town and its characters, and some of the reaction shots (like that kid floating in the water) are fantastic. As for authenticity in shark behavior, well, not so much, to put it mildly. It's hard to truly feel good about the film because of its exaggerations or outright falsehoods, spoken by the scientist character as if they were true. Yes, it's a fictional monster movie but yahoos went out and hunted sharks in the years following this film's release, and it had an impact that Benchley regretted. Spielberg was a genius in telling this story with great pace, ratcheting up tension, and in the little quiet moments he got in between big scenes, like the men comparing the scars on their bodies while drinking one night - but it's unfortunate he cared less about propagating harmful myths, and showed no remorse afterwards.Still though, it has to be said, it's a well-made film, one that has stood the test of time despite the occasional clunkiness of the shark, and it's probably the perfect example of a summer blockbuster. You play that refrain from John Williams' score and it's instantly recognizable, though I thought in other moments his soundtrack was too jaunty and intrusive when gravitas was needed. Overall though, it's an enjoyable thriller.Final note: How the hell was this rated PG with all of the violent gore? Oh right, there was no nudity or the F word, right, those are the important things to shield kids from. Clearly this was the system putting box office profits ahead of traumatizing children, which was an ironic reflection of the behavior of the town's mayor in the film.",

(And Grade A-junk, like Godzilla..)Watching it way back in 75, I clearly recall the jolts of terror, shock and disbelief rippling through the audience at my local cinema. The near-dissolved head in the wreckage of the fishing-boat gave me violent nightmares, and I didn't take a swim for ages after watching it (even in the shark-free waters of Norway, sightings of killer shark were rampant that summer!).Today, some of the thrills and horrific excitement has gone, but that gives one more time to enjoy the tight plot and the well-rounded characters. The references to \"Moby Dick\" gives John Milius` script literary credence, and the central premise of human lives being sacrificed in the interest of capitalism and greed is very powerfully realized.

Everything seems rushed in modern films, and when a film does get back to the roots of telling a proper story (this takes time) people complain that it is too slow.Let's take the way Spielberg sets up the beach scene for example. There was one to two minutes of establishing beach-goer shots. If this film was made today I believe 80-90% of that would be removed to \"speed up\" the story and we would be left with a single establishing shot of the water/beach then jump right into the scene. Instead we are treated to a montage of real people enjoying their day at the beach. This sets the realism of the scene; it does not feel like a film set with paid extras walking in their choreographed patterns given to them moments before \"Action!\" The town feels like a real place with real people dealing with a simple, yet serious, situation and it is done masterfully.

The young love birds decide to go skinny dipping on the beach where after the young guy falls flat on the sand beaches too drunk to follow, his female companion goes into the cold water in the dark where she swims out too far before feeling something underwater and being pulled under to her death.The next morning Amity police chief Brody (Roy Schinder) gets a phone call about the missing girl before heading to the beach.

Nobody believes Chief Brody that it was a shark attack as the mayor (Murry Hamilton) and everybody else hides it until an incident at the beach claims a boy's life where he's eaten in whole.With a reward at stake and a funeral to be arrange, all the shark hunters including local tough guy Quint (Robert Shaw) want a piece of the action to kill the animal; however Quint doesn't want a name for himself since he's already got a rep for demanding too much including getting all of the money the town makes in tourism and other stuff. Also invited on board is marine biologist Matt Hopper (Richard Dreyfuss) who is not convinced that the shark the first hunters killed is the actual beast where he's still on the loose.It's not until the mayor decides to open up the beach on The Fourth of July weekend where the shark returns to the kitchen to get more snacks and almost killing Chief Brody's eldest son where it now becomes a personal vendetta for the chief where he hires Quint and Hooper to go after the shark.

Oh, the vast majority of 'Jaws' is spot-on; Spielberg has correctly concentrated on the characters and not the situation. The mayor's grotesquely 'loud' jackets are just a little too obvious a labeling device but otherwise the town and its characters ring true, and we are swept along with these ordinary local folk as the plot develops. Robert Shaw's Quint has a few rather hammy scenery-chewing moments, and the actor does occasionally appear to have had himself a wee private party before filming some scenes. Still, he is supposed to be a local weirdo, and so his 'crusty old sea-dog' shtick isn't too much of a distraction. The changing relationships between the three men on the 'Orca' is another welcome subtlety often missing from horror movies. After establishing a supremely sinister presence throughout the movie, we must inevitably see the shark, and the more we do, the less we want to. The much-trumpeted animatronic creature doesn't really look alive, and even back in 1975 when audiences had no access to movies outside of a theatre, the moment when the 'shark' rears up out of the water and flops against the stern of the Orca looked absurdly like the attack of a colossal salami sausage. It's not a perfect movie, but 'Jaws' is most of the way there, and aspiring horror writers could do way worse than take a leaf or three from its meticulous care with the characters. After all, they are our stand-ins, and if we don't identify with them then horror turns to farce or worse still, tedium.",

Steven Spielberg took the story of jaws made by peter benchley, and he made a blockbuster movie out of it. what does blockbuster mean? it was the first movie to gross over 100 million bucks, a title coveted by several directors. jaws held this title for two years, until George Lucas took the title, for the release of star wars.If you watch today's modern day shark movies, none of them capture the classic horror of jaws. deep blue sea, red water, none of them take the horror, but somewhat develop more gore than jaws did.bottom line, it's an awesome movie. 9 out of 10",

Peter Jackson you were great as director of the Lord of the Ring trilogy and King Kong , would you have the inkling in doing a remake of the shark , I think you would be wonderful as the director , Steven Spielberg knew what he was doing , but he has to worry about the new Indy film out and how it is going to do against films like Speed Racer , but Jaws was perfection all the way , the remakes were laughable at best , the ones that came close to Jaws were not even Jaws related , they were The Beast and Open Water .

The nightmare escalates as the number of victims increase, and a hunting party runs into a series of problems. This leads to more fatal results. Eventually our trio of heroes gets a chance to fight the shark, which proves to more challenging than expected.Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw are three very different men and actors; yet in this film their work is remarkable in both their individual scenes and as a group. It is their group work that stands out because they are almost in every scene in the second half of the movie. They are excellent in their quiet moments as we learn more about each character's background, and also while combining their expertise to kill the beast.Spielberg filmed almost all of the water scenes in the open ocean, making it difficult for the entire crew, but the film looks and feels real. Had technology been more sophisticated, the film would be perfect in its technical aspects, but it might be those challenges that drove Spielberg to become more creative while planning his shots, telling the story. What amazes me is how little we see the shark. I wonder what it'd be like if the movie was made now. It'd still have his mark, and his ability to direct has remained constant, always trying to give us quality in a variety of genres.Many people were scared enough to stop swimming after seeing \"Jaws\". It worked because it is direct, about a real creature, and not marred by the overuse of technology. Proof of its quality is that since it came out, there have been few stories that even came close to what \"Jaws\" achieved. It's a classic.",

Apart from being a masterclass in tension building and horror Jaws humanizes victims making you feel empathetic and hopeful that somehow they'll survive seemingly obvious deaths.The iconic sound track is a great example of just how truly well made this film is, instigating terror in whoever listens to it due to the story being so well built, the characters are all made to seem human making you, the viewer, genuinely scared for their safety whilst the shark is around. This feeling of deep rooted terror is instilled within you by having a premise of consequence established through the film and when suddenly all the three main characters are on a boat far off land and mere meters away from a shark, you're terrified, to say the least.Speaking of the shark I would just like to mention how incredibly impressive it is given the time in which this film was made, the animatronic is incredibly realistic with the only honest criticism I can give being it seeming stiffer than a shark should be at times, but overall a hardly noticeable flaw.However, I must address the bad points, although being an amazing film with incredible cinematography and production it does have issues, such as it's sexist tendencies and the constant shark fear mongering which most likely lead to over fishing of sharks.Although excluding the previously mentioned issues, Jaws more than maintains itself 45 years after production and is definitely worth a watch by anyone but especially horror and thriller fans.",

The crux of the film's success lies in the camaraderie between the main characters, most of which were 2nd, 3rd or 4th choices. One of my favourite scenes is where Brodie is brought back to reality by his son imitating him at his dining table. Beautiful.

            "content": "I didn't revisit this film before writing this review, but that's only because I've seen it several times (once a couple months ago, in fact), so the film is still really fresh in my memory. As great as it is though, it's not my favorite kind of film to review since its strengths (the shift from a comparably slower police procedural thriller in the first half to survival horror in the second half, the mayor's poor handling of the situation, Quint's USS Indianapolis monologue, several iconic shark scenes, the soundtrack), have already been analyzed to death, so when I discuss those aspects, I feel like I'm just repeating things that many other people have already said. Therefore, I'll instead talk about some other aspects I like about the film which aren't brought up as often.Quint's aforementioned USS Indianapolis monologue is great and it could be argued that it's the origin of his rough outward personality, but I think his character is more complex than that. On the surface, his \"tough guy\" demeanor seems to represent masculinity or manliness, but the more you analyze his behavior, the more pathetic he appears as a character. He's an arrogant, obsession-fueled narcissist who's willing to put Brody and Hooper in danger to kill the shark (at one point, he even goes as far to prevent Brody from calling for help by smashing a radio). His view appears to be that acting like a dick to everyone around him gives him a sense of manliness. While Quint's USS Indianapolis monologue is an excellent scene though, none of the actions he mentions in that speech (which mainly consist of him floating in the water for several hours and hoping a shark doesn't pick him out of his fellow sailors to attack) seem braver than Hooper going underwater in a cage to try to kill the shark as a last resort or even Brody coping with his fears and setting out to hunt the shark (more on that later). Quint failed to kill the shark and got himself killed in the process, while Brody killed the shark instead. Compared to Brody and Hooper, Quint seemed significantly less manly and brave.I also feel like Brody is an underpraised character. Most people I talk to generally say that Quint is the best character in the film but, while he's complex, too, I think there's also a lot to praise Brody for. Before the shark showed up, Brody was an outsider who left New York to get away from the violence and settle down into a more peaceful community. As the shark begins wreaking havoc on the town though, he has to put up with several things, like the mayor refusing to close the beach and the other townspeople having a somewhat unfavorable opinion of him (Alex Kintner's mother slapping Brody is a powerful scene since the mayor was much more at fault for getting Alex killed and deserved the slap instead). These are the people Brody has to save and he isn't happy about this. Ultimately though, while his concern for the town has somewhat of an effect on his decisions, Brody's concerns for his family's safety influence his decision to hunt the shark the most (simple scenes of Brody telling his kids not to play by the water or his reaction to one of his sons going into shock after an encounter with the shark give his decisions an extra layer of resonance). To briefly go back to my points on Quint, that Brody eventually overcomes his fears and kills the shark makes him the more courageous and manly of the two characters by a long shot. Really, Brody is a terrific character and his arc doesn't get nearly enough credit, in my opinion.Overall, Jaws is an excellent film which gets better the more I rewatch it. That the quieter drama scenes prove to be just as, if not, more memorable than the shark scenes is truly something special that few horror films I've seen have been able to accomplish.",

But this film is the best popcorn movie of Steven Spielberg's illustrious career. At least in my opinion. Spielberg masterfully has blended suspense,horror,drama and at times humor into a spellbinding thriller. The best mainstream thriller since Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. The acting is excellent and not just from the three leads but the whole supporting cast. From Murray Hamilton as the disbelieving Mayor to the mother of the little boy on the raft who confronts Brody in a small but memorable scene. John Williams' Oscar-winning score is arguably the most famous of all time. The whole movie is loaded with classic scenes from the opening sequence where Chrissy meets her fate to Quint's horrifying story about the men on an ill-fated mission to deliver the bomb during World War II. Even though most scenes have been memorized by now, this film never fails to deliver. That is perhaps the truest test of any movie.",

A story about a seaside town attacked by a shark would not seem to be the basis for one of the most loved, respected and successful movies of all time, but Spielberg and the cast make it happen-scares excitement, laughs, good characters and great acting all contribute, along with fluid direction and a now infamous score. The budget was low, the filming at sea extremely troublesome, the shark wouldn't do what it was supposed to, but through all this the story prevails and we are left with a true classic.Scheider stars as Sheriff Brody, an ex-city cop with a fear of water who moves with his family to Amity, a popular sea-side holiday resort. There have been a number of deaths recently, and young shark expert Hooper comes to town to long at the bodies. He believes the deaths have been caused by a Great White Shark which will not leave the are while there is still plenty of food around. He advises Brody to close the beach, but the Mayor thinks it should be kept open for the July 4th weekend, the time when the town makes a real profit. When attacks continue, Brody and Hooper decide to track the shark and catch it. Local fisherman Quint who has met one or two sharks in his time also comes. The three set out on the tiny boat, and the shark soon finds them.There are scenes which have since become the stuff of legends- the opening night attack, the 'need a bigger boat' scene and others. The shark may look unreal now, especially as we all have a far better knowledge of sharks with all the documentaries and underwater technology. However, the tension is still high, and like Alien, we only see it near the end. The relationship between the three men on the boat, their arguments and jokes give the film a unique feel, ensuring the viewer is on the boat with them, and other touches such as Brody's son mimicking him are now a Spielberg staple. The death scenes are gruesome and real, thanks to the acting, and the score will is one of the best anyone has done, suiting the film perfectly. By the last few minutes, as the ship sinks, we are with Brody, waiting for the shark's inevitable return. Much has been made of the 'jumpy' moments, and every part of the film has since been dissected. It remains a film which everyone can enjoy, and one which will stay with you forever.10 out of 10",

But the shark proves to be a formidable adversary.\"Jaws\" is the first true blockbuster, one of the greatest money-makers in cinematic history, the definitive killer shark film. Its success at the box office surprised the whole world & spawned a whole host of killer animal films, from the excellent \u2013 the Australian killer wild boar flick RAZORBACK \u2013 to the downright cheesy \u2013 the Italian rip-off KILLER CROCODILE. \"Jaws\" made the name of then unknown director Steven Spielberg, who had previously made the brilliant DUEL.\"Jaws\" has gone down in history as one of the best horror films ever made (although there have been a few critics who are not impressed, perhaps having been poisoned by the vast army of rip-offs that have come out, including the sequels). Much of its success is due to Spielberg's uncanny knack of creating suspense & his mastery of red herring shocks. He makes the film go one way but then pulls back at the last minute with a red herring, at other times he distracts you before ramming the shocks home (the scene where Richard Dreyfuss investigates a sunken boat only to have a severed head pop out is a classic example of this).Once the main actors hit the sea in the small boat, the film turns into a sort of imitation of Moby Dick, with some embellishments thrown in by Spielberg. There's a wonderfully creepy scene where Robert Shaw, in one hell of a performance, tells of his experiences onboard the USS Indianapolis, of having survived the initial sinking only to face numerous sharks. It's a scene that really begins to make your skin crawl. The shark's first true appearance (up until that point, you have only seen the shark's fin or its POV), with the shark popping out of the water to scare the crap out of Roy Scheider, is one good shock jump. The film's pace starts to hit overtime when the shark effortlessly destroys the boat & goes after Scheider, who attempts to ward it off with a pistol & rifle, only to kill the shark by blowing it up.The film has some great acting, most notably from Scheider (who portrays a likable everyman-type hero) & Dreyfuss (as the marine expert). But Shaw steals the limelight from his companions, as the obsessed Quint, who tries to make up for his past wrongs by going after the shark with everything he's got, not caring if he dies in the attempt.",

While you'd likely not find it on many critics' best-of lists for the 20th Century, it's the most fully entertaining film I've ever seen -- a classic mix of drama, plot and characterization.I believe Spielberg was quoted as saying he was disappointed that the shark scenes near the chief's boat looked less than authentic.  And while it's true the shark that attacks the boat looks more mechanical than real, it's only in the film for a relatively short time, and does not distract from the overall brilliance of the movie.An expert buildup to the shark attacks, a sense of chaos and fear that never feels phony, a fine (and underrated) collection of acting performances, a terrific score by John Williams, and refreshing moments of comic relief to ease the tension.  All this and more make \"Jaws\" one of the great Hollywood films.I especially like the acting chemistry between Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss when the three are trying to hunt down the shark that's been terrorizing their beach-vacation town.  Also, I found Shaw's character's tale about shark attacks on survivors of his sunken WWII boat to be a memorable piece of acting.Spielberg aimed for higher meaning with films like \"Schindler's List\" and \"Saving Private Ryan,\" and he made more money with \"E.T.\" and \"Jurassic Park,\" but I maintain that \"Jaws\" is Spielberg at his best, doing what he does best: solid storytelling and characterization, memorable and gripping plotlines, and first-rate entertainment that pushes all the right buttons.",

This movie was so thrilling and never was there a dull moment.From the Start I thought that the whole film would be depicted on the beach. How wrong I was. At least 40 minutes of this was spent on the boat and thank Spielberg for that, because he knew that the second half of the movie needed to be better, and it definitely was.The most fascinating tecnique used was how Spielberg and his team rarely allowed the Shark to be revealed. Instead they used the camera to be depict the Shrak's view of what it's thinking.Another enjoyable part is the realism used. I cannot think of a film before this when attacks looked so real, especially when the boy got attacked by the Big White. A pool of blood leaked. Even Movies like THE BREAK UP have less realism in action scenes. You could literally see blood on the side of Gary's Nose, not coming out of it.To everyone who just read this, if you have not seen the film, go and rent it out because it is a timeless classic, which would be very difficult to shoe off.",

Everything a great film should be and have, great actors, superb script, amazing director and just an absolute joy to watch over and over and over again. MY personal favourite movie of all time and it was released on the year i was born in 1975. Sad to hear that Roy Scheider has died - he is Chief Martin Brody! Legend! R.I.P. to Roy and also Robert Shaw and Peter Benchley for giving me my all time favourite and truly one of it's kind- JAWS ! 10 outta 10! \" You're gonna need a bigger boat!\" - what a line! I've gotta add a couple lines in order to submit my comments on Jaws so i have to say that seeing Ben Gardner's head pop out the bottom of the boat was truly terrifying to a 5 year old when i watched it then and nothing has topped that since! Thank You Steven Spielberg and big up to Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton for being part of it all. Cheers!",

The plot is really simple a killer shark invades the waters off of a summer resort town and kills some people the Police chief Martin Brody wants to close the beaches the greedy mayor refuses to and puts more people at risk so he gets Matt Hooper a Shark expert from Wood's Hole to help him capture the Shark. Hooper is out of his League Enter the film's most colourful and memorable character Quint wonderfully played by Robert Shaw If Brody is the town's Heart and conscience Hooper the young Hero Then Quint is the modern day Ahab who becomes obsessed with killing the shark for 10 thousand dollars. the three end up on Quint's Boat the Orca and Hunt the shark in the films most memorable moments The Highlight is when Quint tells us about his time on the ill-fated USS INDIANAPOLIS and the deaths of the crewmen after the ship sank. Robert Shaw delivers a chilling story that creates it's own moment in Jaws. Spielberg shows us the genius that became his trademark he crafts a well honed movie with realistic people with flaws like us as they battle the monster only to find it's not the only monster haunting Amity. Wonderful film and richly deserved Classic. 1",

            "review_title": "There's something going on under the surface",
            "content": "NOTE: This review discusses the ending of the film.Jaws is virtually goreless, and we don't see the shark at all until almost an hour has gone by, and yet watching this film remains one of the most terrifying ways anyone can ever spend two hours. What sells it isn't the big toothy beast with the fins, but the people who have to deal with its presence.Jaws is set in Amity Island, a self-consciously idyllic tourist resort around the July 4th holiday. The beauty of the setting, shot to resemble the wonderful summer breaks we all think we experienced, is crucial to a film that hinges on the sense of contrast. The monster is horrific but this horror is set in stark opposition to the carefully-constructed carefree bliss of Amity, and that makes it all the harder to get to grips with \u2013 there is no retreat, nowhere that people can go to unwind because perfection has a killer lurking just out of sight. The cynical, paranoid chief Brody (Roy Scheider) has to endure the unimportant domestic quibbles of the town's bovine population, a stumbling block preventing him from giving full attention to the real problem. This sense of contrast and the frustration it fosters is never illustrated more effectively than the scene where old Harry (Alfred Wilde) sits in front of him, blocking his view of the sea just before the shark attacks.This being the era of burgeoning postmodernism, Amity's idyll is wholly artificial, a construct by the cynical and greedy mayor (Murray Hamilton) and various local businesses that depend on summer tourists for the economy of the town, and who value the dollar far more than human life. The shameless capitalism is best seen in the journalist Meadows, who wants to downplay the story of Alex Kitner's death and then highlight the captured tiger shark, which realistically is highly unlikely to be the real culprit but, more importantly, is a perfect excuse to keep the beaches open. As Mayor Vaughn impedes Brody at every turn, putting people in danger, the tension of the film mounts. This, and the film's lack of any real red herrings (perhaps the shark ate them) contribute to the forced removal of any sense of false security. In its place is just a sense of permanent, knuckle-gnawing uncertainty. Things come to a head in the only way they can \u2013 the heartless businessmen have pushed their luck as far as they can the result is spectacular, fatal and very, very public.And so into the second half, where Brody, oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled seaman Quint (Robert Shaw) \u2013 who looks like instead of being born he just came walking out of the sea one day \u2013 set out in a ludicrously ill-equipped floating shed called the Orca to find and kill the shark. The levels of fear diminish slightly, but the tension is maintained in the tiny, claustrophobic environment as personalities clash. The Ahab mk II that is Quint has nothing but disdain for the educated Hooper, whom he perceives to be an ivory-tower intellectual whose dedication to academia is no substitute for his own practical experience; Brody meanwhile is a cowardly landlubber who is best suited to the menial tasks like chumming and tying knots. Any distinctions between characters are soundly mocked by the threat they face \u2013 a soulless killer that can't be understood, rationalised or empathised with. It simply kills, because that's all that's in its nature. Meanwhile, Quint's famous monologue about the U.S.S. Indianapolis, delivered by a breathtakingly intense Shaw, shows that the characters themselves have more to them that meets the eye.So it is that the pale-faced intellectual (\"been counting money all your life\" sneers Quint at one point) proves his worth by choosing to enter the water with the creature, the hard-nosed working man's strength comes to nothing as the shark gobbles him up, and the coward saves the day. This isn't done in a trite \"finding the courage\" kind of way, but simply because there are no other options left. It's that or get eaten, and as such the complexities of the characters fall under the might of the shark's sheer indiscrimination and simplicity. He's no less of a landlubber, and consequently all the more a hero, and Jaws is all the more a classic film.",

Jaws can be called a classic for many reasons to name a few the directing of Steven Spielberg the good acting of Richard Dreyfuss as a genius scientist studying and analyzing the Great White Shark and Roy Scheider's portrayal of a good-hearted cautious town sheriff(Martin Brody). Most of all the musical score at the films beginning and really throughout all of the film makes such a suspenseful climax that movie fans loved I remember owning the 45 record I wish I could now find the CD or tape soundtrack. Jaws is not really a horror film, but more a suspense-thriller that builds up to a horror climax. This film really had many people I know terrified to go swimming at the beach, because of the portrayal of a shark being a human-eating machine.

            "content": "I call myself a movie buff, but I'd never seen Jaws up until a few months ago. I'd always put myself off of seeing it and I'm not sure why, I just never found the right time to start watching it. Eventually, I thought I had to see it and I purchased the 30th Anniversary Edition DVD.I was literally \"blown out of the water.\" Why had I waited so long to see this film? Everything about it is perfect - characters, dialogue, special effects, action, setting, everything! I hate myself for waiting to see Jaws, as I've seen thousands of movies and never considered that this could become my all-time favourite.Everybody knows the plot, so I won't get into it, but the entire story is told magically, thanks to Steven Spielberg and his crew. I am a traditionalist when it comes to film (classic stories, characters and endings) and Jaws delivers everything I could ever want from a film. The pacing is perfect and I cannot fault it at all.The music by John Williams is now legendary, but it really is much more than the classic \"Jaws\" theme that people recognise today. The entire soundtrack is both thrilling and wonderful, especially towards the end as the final battle ensues. Williams establishes himself as the best composer of all time with his score, here.The acting is perfect. For the film that reeks \"Summer Blockbuster\", you probably wouldn't expect the acting to be anything special, but everybody gives memorable performances (especially Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw) - and anyway, we shouldn't forget that this is the \"original\" summer blockbuster.Overall, I cannot say anything bad about Jaws. It is a remarkable film with some of the greatest characters ever committed to film. The story is inventive and glorious, and keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout. I know what kind of film Jaws wanted to be, but it turned out to be so much more - Steven Spielberg really is the world's greatest director. His ability to turn (what could of been) quite a mundane story into an epic tale of good versus evil is simply amazing. Oh, and I can't forget the magnificent ending - seriously, it's the best ending ever committed to cinema.Jaws could be my all-time favourite movie, and even if it isn't, it's pretty darn close. See it - you won't be let down.(5/5)",

Jaws is a film that has inspired MANY movie makers and is known as the 1st blockbuster film and one of Steven Spielberg's BEST movies! Jaws was released in 1975 and was one of the first movies to make A LOT of money at the Box Office and it became a HUGE success and is STILL a fantastic movie to this day! Roy Scheider as chief Martin Brody is GREAT in this film and his character as well as other actors felt like they were playing as actual real life characters in life! I was also impressed by Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw's performances in this film! All of the characters in the film felt like ACTUAL characters that are dealing with actual problems in life and that's one of the reason's why Jaws still works as a masterpiece! And yes, there are people today that say that the shark in Jaws looks fake. However, to this day the animatronic for the shark STILL works! And the main reason is that Spielberg didn't show the shark for the majority of the film which builds up the scare factor and it makes the experience A LOT more suspenseful and they also used some scenes with ACTUAL shark footage in Australian waters! There are many things that make this movie successful, but I can't do a review of Jaws without mentioning John Williams! His score for Jaws is absolutely beautiful and not just the scenes where the shark appears, but also certain scenes that take place in Jaws and the score brings up the suspense in the film! I am really surprised on the special effects they used in this film and they still hold up well to this day! Jaws is definitely one of the GREATEST movies of all time and it's a masterpiece and a timeless classic and it has stood the test of time VERY successfully and it's a film that EVERYONE has to see at least once and Jaws DEFINITELY gets a 10/10!",

The down-to-earth chief of police, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), a keen oceanographer, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and a scruffy yet Captain Ahab-like fisherman, Quint (the late Robert Shaw) set out in Quint's untidy boat to find and kill the beast before it strikes again.Steven Spielburg, who directed the movie, does a brilliant in taking a tale like this and creating a real stomach-churning, mind-numbing adventure. Plus, Spielburg, the three leads (Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss), and the screen-writers deserve a great deal of credit for their parts.  I can't forget to mention the priceless score that's done by John Williams and Bill Butler's colorful camera work.What made me enjoy the movie is that Spielburg uses fear instead of gore to scare the viewer and make him/her feel like anyone who goes to that beach.  Even the dialogue has its' share of good one-liners and the harrowing speech delivered by Quint (Shaw) about the sinking of the Indianapolis and the problems that he and the crew members encounter.  He covers just about every detail that you can think about those who made it out alive and those who didn't survive.In conclusion, \"Jaws\" is an excellent piece of pure movie entertainment.

He goes from serenity to insanity, from funny to despicable, and he just does it in a perfectly kind of way.The shark obviously is not the most real shark I've seen in a movie, but, for a movie from 1975 is reasonable.

Honor is made to it's director, who knew how to work the central theme and skilfully use special effects he had at his disposal, even if we think also in the failure he was trying to use that unfortunate mechanical shark. In fact, it was better that way because we have more fear of what we don't see. The actors went well with his role, particularly Shaw. The script was innovative for it's time, being the first to address shark attacks. The sound effects are excellent and John Williams created one of the most impressive soundtracks of all the history of cinema. It's impossible not to feel the heart beating faster when he heard that song that, unsurprisingly, has become a classic. This film won three Oscars (Best Sound, Best Soundtrack and Best Editing) and the Golden Globe for Best Soundtrack.It's not a mere coincidence that Spielberg is one of the few directors who won two Oscars. He is meticulous, inventive, perfectionist and genial.

Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw make a perfect trio and the film really starts to focus on these 3 characters and really starts to get thrilling as they leave land to kill the dreaded 25-footer. What follows is a fascinating portrayal of the 3 different ways these men handle what is before them. Roy Schneider's classic line 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' has been ripped off time and time again most recently with Godzilla 'We're gonna neeed bigger guns' A classic chilling film masterpiece from beginning to end. This does for water, namely oceans but large swimming pools can have the same effect what Psycho did for motels and showers. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you doing get off your butt and rent it now!!",

            "content": "Jaws has been dissected and analyzed perhaps more than any other cinematic work in history. There are several full-length texts that explore this film's every nuance, and countless articles have been written about the film itself, its birthing of the \"summer blockbuster\", and its impact on motion picture history. With this in mind, I am fully aware that I will not be able to shed any new critical light on this landmark film in a 1000-word IMDb entry. However, since Jaws is indisputably one of the greatest films ever made, and certainly in my all-time Top 10, I felt that I had to write SOMETHING about it.Few films are perfect. This one absolutely is. Jaws is the rarefied movie that can weather intensive scrutiny of each of its sum parts, and still emerge from this analysis as a clearly superior work in every aspect of its production. The acting is top-notch, and each of its characters are perfectly cast and essayed. The score is superlative, and as key to the horror within as the shark. The story itself is deceptively simple, yet powerful enough to remain both timely and timeless. The camera work and use of environment to create tension are unparalleled in the film medium, and every frame carries an implied menace, even when the shark is nowhere in sight. Every detail of the film-making process is performed here with such groundbreaking precision that the film almost becomes a textbook.Those familiar with the troublesome shoot that birthed this film know all the anecdotes associated with that process, so we'll skip those here. But it is worth noting that the film is actually better because of each problem encountered during the production, which certainly says a lot about the talented crew that put this together, but says even more about what role fate plays in the creation of true art. This film was supposed to be made exactly as it was, and the series of happy accidents and no-show mechanical monsters that forced the film-makers to turn the ocean into a monster with another monster inside of it ended up changing the possibilities of what a horror film could be, and tapping into each of the most potent fears of mankind simultaneously.It's also worth mentioning that Jaws is one of the only films ever made that not only surpasses its source work, but renders it relatively useless. Certainly, Peter Benchley's novel is a fantastic read, but no words can essay the endless possibilities for terror the way that the frames of the vast, mysterious ocean do in this film. While Benchley's characters were well-defined and offered layers of depth, the actors here don't play these characters, they BECOME them. The Amity Island in the book is a well-crafted fictional beach city, but the town and its denizens are so magnificently rendered in the film, we could almost be watching a documentary.But, stripping all that away, Jaws is a monster movie, and on that count it succeeds better than any other film in the genre. The unimaginable horror of being attacked by this monstrous fish and crushed between its titular Jaws conjures up agonies beyond comprehension, and even though we see very little of the shark's capacity for destruction in the film, the glimpses we do get, coupled with our own implicit subconscious knowledge that dying like the victims in this film would probably be about the worst way our lives could end, create a scenario borne straight from nightmares.In terms of this film's impact, I can only speak personally. The honest truth is that I am terrified to this day of the ocean; so much so that when I go to the beach, the only contact I have with the water is when I walk along the coast and feel it lapping at my feet. Now, I'm not necessarily afraid to go in the water because Jaws is a scary movie, even though it most assuredly is. What frightens me is that there ARE sharks out there in the sprawling blue-green enigma, and some of them DO attack humans, and though I am keenly aware that no one has ever caught a shark as big as Bruce, I am also aware that there are depths of the ocean we have yet to discover, and lifeforms down in these depths that we aren't even aware exist... and they probably swim up closer to the surface from time to time.Frame by frame, Jaws is quite simply a masterpiece, and considering the impact this piece of celluloid has had on my life to this day, I would have to consider it the most truly scary horror film I have ever seen. Yes, there is levity, and there are moments of peace buried within the razor tension of the film's core struggle of man vs. beast. But, overlying all of this is the inescapable knowledge that somewhere out there, shark's in the water... our shark.",

After 25 years of parodies (specifically in cartoons e.g. Mr. Jaw in THE PINK PANTHER SHOW). Now I finally saw it and boy it was like an answer to the question, \"What if Alfred Hitchcock made a monster movie?\" I like the way we get introduced to Quint. In the scene where the crowd is clamoring at the town meeting, we hear and then see, Quint's hand scratching the chalkboard slowly, and they all shut up. I was like, \"Whoa! That is so edgy.\" No whistle or yell for attention. No. Just scratching nails on a chalkboard. That got spoofed in an episode of SOUTH PARK where Cartman did it when Randy Marsh was having a meeting. John Williams' score is catchy and scary. The mechanical effects are rather clunky by today's standards, but back then, it was awesome and realistic. If you want to make a horror film or learn about film making, then this is for you! Bottom line: It's edgy suspenseful and scary. Go on give it a watch, I highly recommend it. Rated PG for language, scary and suspenseful scenes.",

            "content": "I was VERY young when I saw this movie. I'm thankful for that for two reasons: there is NO WAY I could watch it again now without some therapy so I'll be able to keep enjoying water sports, and also because that was a time that movies need not be ultra-primo CGI to be \"impressive\". This just scares the crap right out of you on its own.I remember hearing later that this movie unintentionally led to the hunting of Great Whites at a shocking level, which (if true) is horrible. As a surfer, spending days in an ocean Great White-free would be great, not having to worry about what's lurking about in my vicinity, and if it sees me as a juicy snack food. I have to say that the danger man-eating sharks pose to - well, man, is not a new concept and didn't start with this movie. So if a Hollywood movie made people suddenly afraid that sharks are a somehow new invention and needed their numbers suddenly controlled, I can't help but say how horribly sad that is - mostly for the sharks, but also for the people that let movies rile them up like that.On a side note, I've heard of new(er) inventions that can keep a shark basically uninterested in you. Or at the very least, keep your limbs intact should the unthinkable happen. Sign me up! That being said, whatever my mother was thinking letting me watch this at such a young age (or ever, for that matter), especially with our frequent family trips to the beach, I have actually hoped for some kind of way that I could mentally block Jaws - at least on beach days. I'm actually thankful to have endured Jellyfish stings because Jellyfish don't friggin' eat you.I remember this being a good and captivating movie, and likely the first \"horror\" movie I'd ever seen, sans ghosts; made up of real creatures and actual, possible events. It got the \"horror\" classification from me because I was terrified, just TERRIFIED, and came close so many times to needing to leave the theater if for nothing else than a change of pants. Good G-d. No demon from the front gates of hell could have an effect on me like one of these creatures.My summers were never the same, even with all my childhood friends in my pool with me, in crystal clear water. The deep end was, without a doubt, off-limits for me. Had our household had only a bathtub but no shower, I would have had to be the dirtiest kid on our block to ever exist - we're talking Charlie Brown's smelly buddy level - because bathtubs were ruined for me too! For the record, it wasn't until years later that I learned how to surf. How or why, I ever managed to turn that idea into a reality bewilders me to this day, even though I love to surf. I'd have to say prescribed anti-anxiety pills may have helped the mental process though (the balance part, not so much). Waiting for a wave can be nerve-wracking. I'm good at it now, but I'll likely always have mini-panic attacks every time I think about the fact that my legs are dangling off a board into water that I can't see into, past a few inches (the Pacific is murky). And seeing a dolphin in the distance? Forget about it.Need a visual into what has haunted me now my whole life? All I need to say is this: the cover of the movie. Just LOOK AT THAT THING! LOOK AT IT!! That swimming woman? She looks Barbie-sized compared to Jaws.This is without a doubt a scary movie - but never say you haven't been warned! I recommend it, but NOT if you ever want to have peaceful thoughts about that swim you want to take tomorrow, or ever again at any time for the rest of your life.If he's reading this - you are a talented, talented man, Steven Spielberg.

This is the story? Or did I miss out on something? I'm sure someone could have come up with a better and more original script.\nI had to see this movie twice to complete the whole movie since I fell asleep the fist time watching. Almost nothing exiting happens in the 125 minutes that it lasted, no suspense at all. Maybe I have a short attention span, but nothing scared me either to keep me awake or keep me interested. This was probably partially because the shark seemed very fake and unrealistic but the score by Williams really tried to cover up for this, and he almost succeeded. There's not much to say about the acting, Richard Dreyfuss did best but he wasn't mind-blowing, though above average. As of the rest of the actors, they were simply average.      Some tell me to give it another chance (just saw it again yesterday), but as I do it only gets worse. Surely not a movie I can recommend to any.

This movie has good photography, complete story, amazing special effects (at that time), and good directing. Though this movie was a disaster for Spielberg during filming, the box office still reached unbelievable point in film history. Obvious, this movie makes Steven Spielberg this name well known all over the world. the movie is intensive, frightening, and well entertaining. Spielberg is good in creating nervous shot (like shark's point of view for approaching the victim) and excellent atmosphere. In addition, the greatest music composer John Williams used simple three to four phonograms to grab the audience's attention. At any rate, this highly entertaining movie affects film making of this genre for the later thirty years.

            "content": "What was the cinema before this film? A sublime art that attracts attention of critics that could be rather positive or negative, and that people would rarely see only as a hobby. And the rookie Steven Spielberg, who was known for only 2 films with good reviews but commercial flops, and television directing episodes of unknown TV-series, found a dropped script and made a landmark in cinematic history.The story takes place in the peaceful community from Amity Island, where a young girl is found dead on the beach, in what appears to have been a shark attack. The new town sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) decides to give the order to close all the beaches from the island, but Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) prohibits the order at the request of several merchants of the island, because the city's trades relies on summer tourism. But when the mysterious shark attacks become frequent, the sheriff hires a marine biologist from the Oceanographic Institute, Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to help him find and kill the mysterious killer shark. And for this hunt it joins the mysterious local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) offering his boat. But the small group barely know they will need a bigger boat.This movie had everything to go wrong. Costs increase in the middle of the production of 4 million to 9 million due to several flaws in filming with cameras being damaged and problems with the mechanical shark. The Company was willing to give up the movie, but the young Spielberg insisted he wanted to go through with the job. And who would have thought that what was the predictable failure eventually end up grossing over 400 million dollars, no film before had hit that mark at the box office (which would reasonably up to 10 or 20 million). This film was the 1st blockbuster of cinema history, way before \"Star Wars\".Pity that nowadays people just see this film as a mere classic and nothing more. Nothing to compare with today's movies, right?! WRONG! This masterpiece (yes, masterpiece), has qualities of any great movie. \"Jaws\" not only marked just for have been the No. 1 blockbuster in film history, but its history also left critics and audiences amazed. The story is not just about three men chasing a white shark, well, it is, but how it is constructed. The screenplay by Carl Gottlieb and Peter Benchley (who wrote the book on which the film was based) building realistic and relatable characters, no film had ever done that before, bringing human reality to the film. Getting to make a realistic narrative characters, and several hilarious moments, bringing the film an excellent entertainment.But even with laughter, the film brings terrifying moments when the hunt starts. And Spielberg delivers one of his best directing debuts provided with excellent chilling scenes to breathtaking action scenes. And that's why Spielberg proved to be so talented, managing to have a large variation in he direction, ranging from sublime scenes of dialogue to the terrifying scenes of shark attacks, and the chilling last 30 minutes of the film. It also thanks the classic and terrifying soundtrack of John Williams, who will live forever and frighten us by his \"dandan dandan dandandandandandandan\" with the mysterious monster getting closer ever more.And also the performances are no bat at all, actually they are all superb. Almost the entire cast came from movies and unknown plays and even in the case of Robert Shaw as the magnificent and unforgettable Le Quint Dickey (which serves almost as a parody of Captain Ahab and his hunt for the white whale Moby \u00bb Dickey). This film also has also secured the fame of both Scheider and Dreyfuss entering in other films which would guarantee their first Oscar nominations and here they won their first fortunes.If you wonder why Spielberg is so well known and appreciated today, see this masterpiece. The master with this film not only mixed a loyal adaptation of a book with humor and horror, but redefined modern cinema forever. Thanks to this film, actors and directors today earn fortunes, people line up to see and be entertained with a movie, which gave us cinema of quality cinema. All thanks to a terrifying soundtrack from John Williams and Steven Spielberg, with \"Jaws\", one of his first of many masterpieces.10/10",

            "content": "Unlike most blockbusters of today, Jaws was blessed with a superb cast, a fantastic director, and a good screenplay.Most of Jaws's success can be attributed to Steven Spielberg's masterful direction. He brilliantly utilizes the Hitchcockian method of showing less and there by giving the audience more.  By not showing the shark for the first half of the movie and only showing the evidence of its strength and the aftermath of its attacks, Spielberg triggers the audience's imagination making the film all the more suspenseful. Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's screenplay is well written. Now granted, this is not a brilliant character study but the script is more character driven than most of today's blockbuster scripts. Evidence of the screenplay's strong characters can be found in the extraordinary chemistry between them and their motives for their actions. The cast does a fantastic job at giving life and voice to the characters of the screenplay. Roy Scheider wisely underplays his character, Martin Brody, making him very believable. Robert Shaw is absolutely wonderful as the sea-worn fisherman, Quint. Richard Dreyfuss is very convincing as the energetic, young scientist. Lorraine Gary gives a very naturalistic performance as Brody's wife. Murray Hamilton does a nice job at playing the greedy, sleazy mayor of Amity; the town endangered by the shark.Bill Butler's cinematography is first-class. He brings the ocean right into our laps by placing the camera at the water's level. Although there are many continuity errors, Verna Fields's editing is smooth and fast paced. Despite the fact that the shark is not seen for the first half of the film, the movie still manages to be suspenseful and interesting.\nJohn Williams's musical score, for this film, has reached legendary status for good reason. His simple use of a few notes to characterize the shark was ingenious. He brings the suspense/action scenes to life with his energetic score.Many people complain that the shark looks too fake. Do sharks really look all that life-like to begin with? I personally think the shark effects could have been much worse; they weren't that bad.All of these fine qualities are why Jaws has remained one of my favorite films for quite some time.",

Stephen Spielberg wanted to make a movie about a killer shark but it turned out to be one of the scariest movies of its generation. I'm talking, of course, about Jaws. This thriller has a very simple premise but turned out to be one of the best movies ever made. Filmed on Martha's Vineyard, this film was a pain to shoot, but the reward was well worth it.Jaws had a really strong cast with Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider, and Richard Dreyfuss. Chief Brody struggles to convince his summer town that there is a killer shark in their waters. The big problem is that it is 4th of July weekend and they need this weekend because tourists bring in all the money the town needs to survive. If word gets out of a killer shark that means no money which means no survival. Murray Hamilton plays the foolish mayor who won't listen to reason. The shark kills a few people and push comes to shove. Brody brings in Matt Hooper, a shark expert, and they figure out the shark is a great white. This thing is a cold blooded eating machine. \"All this fish does is eat, sleep, and make baby sharks, it's that simple.\" Eventually, the town hires Quint, a local fisherman and Brody, Quint, and Hooper venture out to kill the shark. That is our story and it really is done so well.Jaws is based off a book and they are similar. The basic story is obviously the same, character relationships and development is very similar. The only difference is that Hooper and Brody's wife have an affair. In the movie itself we see them get along and build a relationship and its interesting how Spielberg threw a little tease n there for fans of the book. Also the endings were both different which I also find interesting. The movie ending was way more explosive and enjoyable.As I said this movie was terrifying when it was released in the 70s, but it was scary by accident. The mechanical shark they used was named Bruce, but the thing never worked. To make up for it they only showed parts of the shark. It takes a long time to see what the full shark looks like. Sometimes it's not what you see that is scary, it's what you don't see, and that is what worked so well. We see a girl screaming for her life and getting dragged around, but we don't see what is doing it. It is almost disturbing but it worked and films have copied this tactic time and time again. There were also a lot of problems filming on the open sea. I mention this because any real fan of film would appreciate to know how hard it was to make this movie and how dedicated the filmmakers were to deliver.Along with the scary images of a torn leg, a decaying face, and blood being spit out of a mouth while the jaws of the shark pierce into the abdomen are horrifying, John Williams makes it ten times worse with two notes. Everybody knows the Jaws theme and how it starts out slow and picks up. As it gets faster and faster the shark gets closer and closer, and finally strikes. Music makes the movie, I say it all the time, and John Williams proves it once again, and he did it with two notes. Towards the end of the movie all the focus is on Quint, Hooper, Brody, and the shark. Hooper and Quint's relationship is really hysterical. It is old school verses new school. Quint is the rugged fisherman who just makes it up as he goes along. Hooper is the rich college boy with a plan. They butt heads a lot and their sarcastic remarks back and forth are very entertaining. My favorite scene in the entire movie is towards the end when the three men are on the boat telling stories of how they got their scars from sharks or whatever. Then Quint tells a true story of the USS Indianapolis. The USS Indianapolis was a cruiser that sank and all the sailors were in the water and over a few days sharks attacked and killed mostly everyone. Quint was on that ship and he tells the story. Robert Shaw gives one of the best speeches I have ever seen in any movie. The way he tells the story. \"And the thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes.\" He describes sharks really well and that story was not something I expected form the movie. The true story takes the audience out of the movie and you feel sadness. We dig into Quint's character and even the way the camera just focuses on Quint and how he tells the story. This is a scene I watch twice every time because I love the way he delivers the speech. The only problem I have with the movie itself is that there are two scenes that scare the daylights out of me and I still can't what, and it is impossible to understand what Quint is saying without subtitles.Overall, Jaws is a classic and I love the way it was made, the people in it, and the movie itself. The movie works and it is nearly flawless. Jaws is a movie everybody alive in this world needs to see at least once. I bought this on blu ray and it was the best up converted movie I have seen so far. The picture was perfect and the sound was amazing. Sometimes I find myself constantly changing the volume of my surround sound but not with Jaws. Jaws easily gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",

My son and I have been known to watch it, watch the special features and the documentary, and then watch it again all in one afternoon. Why do I do this? Because this is simply the best film I have ever seen.This film has everything! Drama, comedy, horror, romance, touching family scenes, interesting scientific facts and statistics, a moving tribute too a historic event, special effects, a spine-tingling soundtrack, you name it, it's in there. And even though the film was made in the 70's, the story is still current. The movie grabs you right at the beginning, and plays so smoothly throughout that you don't really notice the funky, out-of-date clothing. You are too caught up in the story and the characters to care about the dated hairstyles the actresses are sporting. All you care about, is whether or not they can kill the shark before it kills them. And when it's all over, even if it's thirty years later, you are still afraid to go in the water.",

Seeing that pool of blood and short glimpses of the shark is chilling. The music and camera work just make it great. Things get even better at the end when it becomes 'Man vs. Beast' in a nail biting ending.If you have never seen a Spielberg movie then you haven't seen many good movies. Spielberg is possibly the best director of all time. I just can't think how bad the cinematic world would have been if he never became a director.Spielberg has made many great movies. From great family movies E.T., Jurassic Park. To great adventure Indiana Jones and Jaws.I highly recommend this. The only problem i had with this was it got boring in the middle. But besides that Jaws is classic and will remain one for decades to come. One of Speilbergs best. This isn't just a monster movie. THIS IS Spielberg.8/10",

The shot selection and camerawork is great- which is a given fact as this is Steven Spielberg we speak of. The acting is great throughout and the trio of Chief Brady, Hooper and Quint have become a fixation of cinema pop culture over the years, primarily because their banter and experience aboard the Orca is what most people remember.

If I had to guess why some wouldn't like it, I suppose it could be because Bruce doesn't match the live shark footage in the film. Or maybe people prefer a CGI shark?  I'm stumped.  See Deep Blue Sea if you want that, and you'll see that CGI sharks don't make a movie.  Besides, Bruce looks great in 90% of the shots, especially when he rises up under Brody during the last stand.  I've often wondered- why is it that as the years go by and technology advances, the sharks in the Jaws movies just look worse and worse?Everybody has seen this, so to summarize the plot is a waste of time.  No other movie has terrified the world in such a way.  The most terrifying films of all time don't get into your head like this.  There are few people who are afraid of hotels due to the Shining, and even fewer fear demonic possession (Exorcist), or Zombies (NOTLD).  Now these are among the scariest films ever made and I love them dearly, but they don't get to you like Jaws. I've heard that in the past some people feared the shower after seeing Psycho, but come on, Jaws kept MILLIONS away from the beaches, and people still fear the ocean to this day.  That is true, irrational FEAR, spanning 25 years, especially since it is rather common knowledge that sharks are about as interested in eating people as they are logs.  This movie had the same effect on cinema as War of the Worlds did on radio.  It showed that the entire nation can be profoundly affected by what is on that screen.So see this masterpiece again, and for heaven's sake, DON'T watch it on TV. The edited pan and scan version just doesn't cut it, and you don't even get to see what happens to Quint. As for my feelings about the DVD, I really enjoyed some of the new sounds, but overall the original is still the best.  It doesn't matter though, only people who've seen this film hundreds of times like me will notice the new sounds anyway.",

Hamilton, in a fine supporting performance, depicts that same lack of kindness that he showed 8 years before as the husband of Anne Bancroft in \"The Graduate.\"Roy Scheider, whose career really never took off, hits his stride as the police chief. The late Robert Shaw gives a tremendous performance as the adventurer with the problem that he garbles his words when he spoke. There were several scenes where I found it difficult to understand him.Lorraine Gary, as the wife of police chief Brody,(Scheider) is adequate but she doesn't seem to be caught up enough in the action.The second part of the film deals with our trio-Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw, on board to kill the ferocious beast. While I will be in the minority here, I felt that the film begins to drag somewhat. Yes, the scenes with the shark trying to kill our heroes are great, due in part to the wonderful editing here, but the talk among the central characters is down right dull after a while.",

It's a wonder it took me this long to get around to seeing it, and I have to say I really found it to be quite great. Even After 30 years, 'Jaws' is still an entertaining, engrossing and even a bit scary motion picture. Sure, it has lost a lot with age, but it still manages to pull it off after all these years. This is one of the brilliant Steven Spielberg's first films and he knocks it out of the park. It's a damn shame he didn't get an Oscar nomination for this. Roy Scheider is great as town Sheriff, Brody, while Robert Shaw is ultra-creepy as the weird sea captain, John Quintis. A very young Richard Dreyfuss also does a superb job as the marine biologist flown in to this small summer town to help track down the man-eating 300 ton great white. The film features excellent action sequences especially the last 15 minutes of the film which could be considered masterful. The film drags a bit towards the middle, but everything else is very fast-paced. Grade: B+",

It had been a while since I had seen Jaws, but it seemed to be as terrifying as I remember.  Of course there are shots where the shark looks a little fake, but the camera angles used in most of the attack scenes, or false alarms are excellent.  It still is very creepy in some parts, very atmospheric - with the music, camera angles, pauses by the actors - it all comes together very nicely.  The story is not too bad either, especially when we forget the 3 inferior sequels.  Jaws is still the ultimate monster movie, even with films like lake Placid and Deep Blue Sea trying to reinvent the genre with comedy/horror, Jaws knocks them over anytime.  The casting of Jaws was really very well done, and all three actors- Dreyfuss, Shaw, Schneider seem to have a great chemistry between them- although this is not really seen until over half way through the film when they board the Orca. With Jaws it doesn't seem that the attacks are what are most terrifying, its the buildup.  Its when its very still and silent in the water, most definitely the calm before the storm.  What is most impressive about Jaws is that it has aged very well.  Even with the enormous advances in special effects, and computer generated imagery Jaws still seems to have some real power - heaps more effective than the sharks in Deep Blue Sea.   Jaws has certainly stood the test of time.",

I wish I hadn't, because it spoilt my holidays on the beach...Spielberg seems to be the only director of a JAWS-movie who understands how to make his movie scary. I mean very scary, and not laughable as the sequels are.How did he succeed in that? Because he didn't do any more than show us what we are and have always been afraid of: that there is something in the water that can attack us at any time. And we don't get to know much more than Brody (the chief of police) about the shark, and that's why we can fully identify with him: When Brody is looking in a book about sharks what these animals look like and how they attack, we look with him over his shoulder, as fascinated as he is; When Brody is uncomfortable sitting on the beach (being a guard, knowing there may be a shark around), we are.Spielberg keeps his story simple, but very effective. I couldn't find a single weakness in the entire movie, although I have seen it about 15 times or so. The first part of the movie is a lesson in how to build up tension; the second part is a fascinating 'Duel' (referring to Spielbergs debut, which is about as good as 'Jaws') between the shark and the three men. Although they don't seem to be the perfect trio to fight the shark, I think they are the best to appear in this film. At least, I can't imagine who would have played the roles of Brody, Quint and Hooper better than Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss did. Especially Robert Shaw (my favourite actor) is fantastic: I have never seen a more adorable macho than Quint. What a pity that this great actor died in 1978. I almost forgot to mention the terrifying music: couldn't have been better for 'Jaws', the ultimate horror film and my personal favourite.",

Here you have what could easily be considered your standard B-movie material (not that there's anything wrong with that) that gets turned into a masterpiece by the one and only Steven Spielberg. The movie starts out innocent enough, a group of teenagers are hanging out on the beach, a young man and a girl decide to go off on their own. The girl wants to go swimming and the young man wants to accommodate her, however, he is clearly suffering under the effects of alcohol and doesn't make it into the water. Lucky for him, because shortly after the girl goes in, we, the audience, can clearly see that something is lurking under the surface and is getting closer and closer and then STRIKE, the girl is grabbed, whipped back and forward, pulled under again and again, and screaming for her life. In a few seconds, its all over as she is pulled down for the last time. From then on, we know that we're in for one hell of a ride. There are so many great things about this movie that I'm not even sure where to start. The acting is superb: there's the always reliable (and sadly, now deceased) Roy Scheider as Chief Brody and Richard Dreyfuss as the brilliant and sarcastic Hooper. However, the most brilliant performance may be that of the late, great Robert Shaw, who plays the hot-tempered but likable old fisherman Quint. Despite his enormous ego, you can't help loving him. In addition, there's Murray Hamilton who gives a great performance as a typical politician and Lorraine Gary in the role of the supportive chief's wife. The real star of the movie though, is the shark himself, who is created with a combination of real shark footage and a mechanical creation, which, while it may look a little fake in some scenes, still looks pretty scary after all these years. Filmed at the famous Martha's Vineyard, \"Jaws\" is a movie that revolutionized the film industry by creating the summer blockbuster and made people afraid to go into the water. Oh, and who can forget the iconic theme by John Williams, a theme that has become so embedded in pop culture that every time anyone hears it, they know what it is. To put it bluntly, you are robbing yourself by not seeing this monumental achievement. Watch it and be afraid, be very afraid the next time you go into the water, because you never know what might be down there.",

            "content": "Long cited as the movie that changed Hollywood into a sensation- bound blockbuster factory, Jaws continues to be regarded as a high- point of Steven Spielberg's oeuvre - a near Hitchcockian exercise in transference of guilt and making the audience pay for its illicit pleasures. The setting is almost quaint by today's blockbuster standards. Instead of a faraway fantasy realm or a city sheltered by superheroes, Jaws takes place in the beach-side town of Amity during a blazing hot summer where tourists are out in force. However, the film's opening moments foreshadow the trauma that's to come as a young woman's sandy frolic ends with her gurgled scream as she disappears into an ocean, having fallen prey to the great white. While more bodies turn up on Amity Island, Spielberg milks the slow burn, hiding the shark in his watery depths, instead introducing us to Roy Scheider's protagonist, Police Chief Martin Brody. Despite Brody's protestations, the incidents go largely unreported as the town mayor doesn't want panic to keep the all-important vacationers away. But when an attack is witnessed in broad daylight, mass hysteria takes over and there's no denying the calamity the town faces. Soon, it's left to Brody, ballsy shark- hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) and oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to head out into the ocean on a heroic expedition and finish off the aquatic beast.Jaws begins as a sunshine-bright horror movie: ordinary people motivated by greed and pleasure are shaken upon understanding that a murderous uncanny fiend has arrived in their midst. Then it becomes an astounding descendant of nautical tales: rage and obsession unleash a flurry of vehemence. Spielberg expertly conceals the monster (don't listen to the cynics who claim the shark looks iffy now), luring us into a false sense of security before unleashing him into the frame sparingly to create impact jolts. Four decades later it continues to instill fear because Spielberg's direction is so assuredly taut, and is ably bolstered by John Williams' now-iconic, terror-inducing 'da- dumb' score (the alternating two-note motif still signals a shift to the edge of your seat, creating a throbbing sense of menace). Spielberg wants us to be terrified by his film, but he also wants us to be awed and excited and he achieves that with aplomb. Credit is also due for the cast for investing the monster movie premise with such believability. The trio's cracking camaraderie has seldom been bettered and the aquatic terror is deftly balanced with lively, likable characterizations. Jaws is a marvel of economic storytelling; its formula so hard to capture it's now near-mythical \u2013 filmmakers have been chasing it like Ahab chasing Moby Dick ever since.

Steven Spielberg is the master of contemporary artful entertainment, counting the likes of John Frankenheimer and Alfred Hitchcock among his cinematic forefathers.Jaws initiated that spell between the mid-1970s and early 1980s when, seemingly, Spielberg could do no wrong (well, except 1941). He had shown a sure hand and a feel for thrills in Duel, but nothing prepared audiences for the brilliance of Jaws. Everything in Jaws falls into the correct place and, even though it pales in comparison to the maturity of vision in ET and Close Encounters, it's likely one of the greatest action- adventure films you're likely to encounter.What I think separates Jaws from its imitators and from lesser action films is its unwillingness to abide by conventions. Eschewing the lax characterization inherent in most thrillers, Jaws makes sure we understand the three leads, while never offering up scenes that serve only to establish character. Nearly every scene that allows us to delve a little deeper into Quint or Hooper also advances the plot (though I would argue it does so imperceptibly). The film moves like the shark--smoothly and forward. Even what appear to be divergences come around to forward momentum by their end. Take the scene in which the men compare scars: here we learn quite a bit about Quint and, at first, it seems that's the scene's entire purpose, but then the shark returns and damages the boat. Most scenes in this film operate in a similar manner. It's a basic screen writing concept, but one that keeps Jaws fresh with character insights and action.Then there's also Spielberg's decision to postpone the visual arrival of the star for nearly an hour. People may have come to this film to see a shark, but instead they found a couple glimpses of fin in an otherwise land-based drama. Most movies of this sort put off the monster's arrival but precious few postpone it for so long. The story is enough to carry this movie--the relative success or failure of the film does not rest on the back of the shark. Think about it this way--Spielberg creates such a fascinating story about a shark without actually showing us the fish that, when we finally see the entire thing, we're amazed, but it doesn't really matter because we're entirely hooked already. That's impressive and admirable. Since Jaws, Spielberg has gone on to make better films, but his greatness manifested itself here first. Jaws is a superb film and superb entertainment.",

Unfortunately Jaws comes under criticism nowadays. The main criticism aimed at Jaws, some viewers of today claim that the movie is disappointing because they don't see enough of the shark. Well my response to that is that that was intentional, Spielberg wanted to create scenes of false scares along with some actual ones where we as the viewers actually see the shark. That is what makes Jaws so memorable. When released it became one of highest grossing movies of the decades.Spielberg for me has conquered almost 2 decades, in the 70's there was Jaws, 80'S was E.T. and 90's was Jurrassic Park. Unfortunately he has yet to make a memorable movie of this decade. Unfortunately none of the 3 sequels could match the brilliance of the original. Classic chills from the master of entertainment.",

In attempt to reduce my fear, my mother told me Jaws was the size of the swimming pool at the YMCA, and I have not swam there since.  I appreciate the movie on an entirely different level now, but I am still in awe at it's pure genius. The fear that the shark induces will never fade in my eyes, I will never grow out of that.  But I have learned to appreciate the characters, dialogue, and depth that Jaws offers.  Rarely does an action film give you a chance to analyze the characters more in depth than face value, but the characters in Jaws are presented as complex, complete people.

The expert blend of suspense with genuine shock is proof that Spielberg is the second coming of Hitchock. The cast is top notch with the three leads fully emerging themselves and the audience in their characters, and their chemistry creates a film that would be interesting even without the man-eating shark. Jaws also helped me to get into my now favorite genre of film: the monster movie. And also holds the distinction of being my all time favorite horror film. Every aspect of Jaws works, from John Williams ingenious score to Exhilarating opening, Jaws will grab by the gut, throw you around and never let up and you will enjoy every second of it. My favorite aspect of Jaws, however, is that fact that a film with such a simple B movie premise managed to not only be good but be one of the greatest films ever made! That is why I love film.",

            "content": "It's almost impossible to give an objective review of this film \u0096 a cultural phenomenon, the first modern Hollywood blockbuster, the movie that propelled Steven Spielberg to iconic status and was the progenitor of that horrible cinematic trend known as 'franchising.' Nonetheless, as I watched it yet again last Sunday, I realized I had never actually reviewed this film, and as I spend enough time poring over bad and mediocre films, it would be a nice change to review a good \u0096 nay, a great \u0096 one.Set in the resort community of Amity, Jaws follows the story of what happens to the town when a shark comes hunting and threatens their precious summer economy. Of course there's much more than that going on; it's also the personal story of Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) a man living on an island who's afraid of the water, and those who help him pursue the shark: oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and the colorful, cantankerous shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw).Spielberg sets up the film economically and effortlessly, sketching Amity with exactly the right details, rendering it familiar to us in an instant. From the Boy Scout water badge tests to the man badgering the chief about painting a red zone on the curb in front of his house, Amity is suburban anywhere, circa 1975, a small, quiet town of normal people whom Spielberg breathes to life with swift but textured strokes. Standing out amongst them is Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), whose interest in preserving the town's economy nearly leads it to ruin; but rather than render the mayor a one-dimensional villain, Spielberg gives him a moment of stark humanity in a scene in the hospital where he is so unnerved by a shark attack a few hours earlier that he absent-mindedly starts to smoke. He turns to Brody and hisses in a wavering voice, \"Martin, my kids were out there in that water too.\" While Hooper joins the proceedings relatively early (in a hilarious scene where every fisherman in the northeast is launching their boat to try and nab the $3K reward on the shark) and is saddled with the lion's share of educating the audience about sharks (the exposition is seamlessly worked into three conversations between Hooper and Brody), Spielberg is wise to save Quint until the second half of the picture. Although he makes a brief cameo earlier (scratching his nails on a chalkboard to gain everyone's attention \u0096 how's that for an entrance?), once Quint is on board full time the movie really kicks into high gear. His disdain for Hooper's easy life and modern gear aside, Quint is like a character straight out of Hemmingway, and Shaw fleshes him out to perfection. In the hands of another director and actor, Quint probably would have been easy to dislike, but here, he steals the show from the other two men, and again, much like the mayor, he is given his scene of humanity, where he discloses that he was a crew member of the USS Indianapolis, the ship that was torpedoed by the Japanese on a highly secret mission to deliver the atom bomb.Spielberg masterfully follows the heroic plot arc in this movie. The hero's simple village is threatened by an external force it cannot understand or defeat; outsiders are brought in, even while the hero must face his own inner fears and 'grow up' to conquer them. Quint is the transitional hero here, an outsider in the community (even though he resides in Amity), whose anti-social nature and unwillingness to compromise permanently exclude him from the village; we know as soon as his boat is ruined that he will die, for now he has no home, no place to live (can we really picture Quint sitting at the Brody dinner table as Hooper did?).Of course it's not just the brilliantly executed structure of Jaws that makes it so great; the performances are all spot-on, terrific; all three of the main actors shine here, and even tiny bit parts are played perfectly. Spielberg also uses terror more effectively here than he ever has since; while apparently the mechanical shark wouldn't work and he had to disguise it in filming and editing, not seeing the menace for most of the film heightens the suspense and terror far more than revealing it would have.This film is Spielberg firing on all cylinders, every piece in place, a masterpiece from start to finish. It's rare that you encounter a perfect film, and that's a phrase I don't even like to use; but it certainly fits Jaws, which is as flawless a piece of movie-making as you will ever encounter. It's a good bet most of you have seen it (it is thirty-one years old, after all), but if you haven't seen it in a while, maybe it's time to get reacquainted with a classic once more.",

The storyline involves a small island near Cap Cod in Massachusetts that unexpectantly has a series of shark attacks just before July 4th weekend, their busiest revenue generating time of the year. When they catch a shark on the coast they feel it's safe to move forward with the festivities. The sheriff doesn't agree. When the sheriff is overruled by the mayor, what could go wrong? This movie is directed by Steven Spielberg (The Color Purple) and stars Roy Scheider (The French Connection), Robert Shaw (The Sting), Richard Dreyfuss (The Goodbye Girl), Murray Hamilton (The Gradiate) and Lorraine Gary (1941). The storyline for this is compelling with a constant battle of beliefs on what's happening to the community. The acting is excellent as Scheider battles his own conviction and perspectives throughout the film. The casting and soundtrack are both perfect. What really makes this film work is the underwater cinematography as well as the shots above the water looking down at the shark. The child dying on the floaty really starts the film off with the right feel and the July 4th beach scene is legendary. The camaraderie between the male cast members as they hunt the shark towards the end is awesome and the mechanical shark still looks great. Overall this is a classic American film that is entertaining to this day. This is an easy 10/10 for me I'd strongly recommend.",

            "content": "\"JAWS\" (1975, Spielberg) is exploitative trash at its lowest, boasting poor visuals and a monster so rushed that it is deserving of deepest sympathy rather than fear. The only things holding this garbage together are a great cast, brilliant music, simplicity, and being based on a solid work of literature.This is one of those films that, sadly, got many of us into films as kids. I know that for me the voices of the performers were as important to me growing up as my own family's! But, nostalgia aside, this is also one of those films that rarely gets criticised and it should.It's a shoddy film, poorly made, and John Williams's score covers a multitude of sins, like lacquer over cheap splintering wood.I love a physical monster as much as the next sensible person, but this shark is transparent from the side, floppy-mouthed and growling (yes, growling, and I don't just mean the dinosaur sounds added over its sinking carcass; if you pay attention to a couple of scenes well enough you'll hear what at first sounds like water rushing, but is in fact a subtly placed growl, so it wasn't the ridiculous 3 & 4 that invented that) monster that needs to be put out of its misery. And when that time comes it is stupid. A shark, swimming towards a man on a sinking boat, chewing an oxygen tank like a big silver cigar, that gets blown inexplicably up into little pieces.To make things worse this did such a good job of scaring people that it made heroes of any dumb fisherman who wanted to go and murder sharks and gave false intrigue to the average holiday goer or idiot when confronted with a set of freshly torn out jaws to buy. ... much to the bewilderment of the cast and crew who had been sure the film was dreadful.I take umbrage with anyone who says Spielberg did a great job because he scared people out of water. Yeah great, let's be scared of going swimming. Let's scare our kids out of enjoying the world. Spielberg's job was to make money for Universal, which he did successfully because mugs love to rip themselves off. When I go into the sea the last thing I'm thinking about is floppy old Bruce eating his way towards me, I'm more concerned about stepping on a weaver fish and going to hospital.I also hate this idea that \"JAWS\" changed cinema for the better. How exactly? \"JAWS 3D\" and \"JAWS THE REVENGE\" are in constant competition for worst movies ever made and aside from them there's been a glut of subpar rip-off movies from around the globe since. Yeah, great.Then there's the hilarious sequels, each just as bad as the first, all anti-shark propaganda aimed at the most vulnerable in society- the gullible, the young, and the foolish.The novel by Peter Benchley is the superior work but it's still exploitative trash. How \"JAWS\" the movie captured the imaginations of millions (including me for many years) is beyond me. The only bad review I can find is from the LA Times in 1975 who took issue with it being a family film when it will be so frightening for children. That is a sound concern but \"JAWS\" is worse than that, it's garbage that we're told is genius. Think for yourselves.",

Thus is the norm within the industry of movies or any other. Few directors have been tagged with titles by fans as leaders in such mass revolutions. James Cameroon (Avatar, Titanic) Michael Bay (Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, Transformers) Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator) Todd Phillips (The Hangover) Mel Gibson (Brave heart) and Wes Craven (Scream). Take a moment to consider the above names and the titles. These titles will always be industry benchmarks until otherwise a newer title tops it. How many times have you watched a movie and it's not as good as the Hangover or Brave heart was better or the soundtrack in not as good as the Gladiator. There is one man who can be considered THE GODFATHER, THE DON amongst the directors/producers and cinemas William Shakespeare. Please welcome Mr. Steven Spielberg! #applause#. Jurassic Park, ET, Saving Private Ryan, Minority Report and the feature of this article JAWS. All of the above done by Spielberg are trend setters within its genres and some of them are yet to be topped by another even at date.Set in Amity Island in the Early 70s (way before I was born!) JAWS is a frightening eye opener that scared me clear of dark waters up until this day. Chief Brody (Ray Scheider) who is not a great fan of the waters is put to test when the small island community is hit by a suspected Shark attack. The New Yorker who has moved in with his wife and two sons, steps immediately into full throttle and makes preparation to close down the beaches in Amity Island until the matters are resolved. Dollar hungry Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) does not allow for this to happen and keep the beaches open at the risk of further danger just so he can rake in the summer dollars to the town budget. Death strikes again and this time a young boy is devoured whole by the monstrous man eater in broad daylight in front of the happy summer tourists. An immediate community meeting is called in by the mayor and the businessman of the community to handle the situation before they lose on the summer tourism. A price is set on the man eaters head at $10,000 by veteran seaman Sam Quint (Robert Shaw) and he guarantees them \"the head the tail the whole dam thing\". No agreement is made at this point by the mayor. In the meantime the amateur sailors in the community head out in hunt of the man eater and comes back to shore with a tiger shark a few feet long. Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) who is a marine scientist - an oceanographer who investigates the remaining within the sharks belly believes that the bite radius does not match with the captured shark. He suspects it to be a great white!For a movie that is 36 years old JAWS still remains as one of the most frightening movies to be done with man-eaters in the ocean. The lack of technology in the 70s brings the man and shark closer and the encounters are face to face and the intensity is raw. If set in today's time I am sure they can fry that great white with a flick of a switch from the sea shore. Although this was a hit back in time and also this was one of those movies I grew up with, the younger generations of today underestimate the value of classics as this. At a time where most movies are being remade in high tech studios it's time we salute those movies of the yesteryear. Its time you all watched JAWS.

What also helped make this movie scary was the soundtrack. The infamous string noise(DA-na) of the great white going in to attack was what startled me the most. It was unsettling.Something great that the cameramen did was shoot at water level, giving the audience the impression that the great monster was just under the surface ready to strike again.

Although not quite as brutally effective as his earlier 'Duel', 'Jaws' is still a fine, minimalist thriller based on a very simple idea (namely, \"big shark\"), notable also for the absence of a single obvious hero (all three human protagonists have flaws). On the downside, John Williams' famous score is a little proscriptive at times, and although the shark is very frightening, the man versus shark fight is realised with only partial success: one never quite believes that all participants are in the same environment.

Everything about the movie is excellent. The job done casting this movie was perfect and very interesting since none of the actors were huge stars at the time. Roy Scheider is perfect as the anal police chief, facial expressions and all. Richard Dreyfuss does his usual character, and is the most enjoyable to watch. Robert Shaw, however, delivers the best performance, and should have recieved a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The writing is superb, as well as maybe John Williams finest score. Steven Spielberg became Hollywood's \"boy genius\" with this film, and for good reason. He sets every mood with his direction and allows the suspense to build naturally. His pacing his excellent. I believe it is his third best film, behind E.T. and Schindler's List. It makes my top 20 films of all time. 10 out of 10.",

It follows the Peter Benchley book of the same name - an obsessed police chief enlists the help of a marine scientist and a veteran fisherman to help track down and hunt a giant Great White Shark who has been terrorising the North-eastern US community of Amity Island. Spielberg - who knows how to shock and keep an audience at the edge of their seats with Duel - is certainly in his element here in Jaws.  He places the audience in an strange environment - underwater camera shots at swimmers who are blissfully unaware that they are about to become Shark dinner.  The excellent John Williams score also keeps up the tension. All the leads are well cast - Roy Scheider as the outsider Police Chief who is on the edge and Robert Shaw as the old, wry fisherman. Yes - the mechanical shark might look cheesy by today's standards - and yes - the film depicts the shark quite unfairly and inaccurately - But I was sucked into this film when I first saw at the age of 3.  Ever since seeing this (I'm sure I'm not alone here) - but I always felt like there is something waiting for me down at the beach.",

Many say this film, along with George Lucas' Star Wars, was among the movies to really set in motion the summer movie movement. You know, rampant marketing, familiar characters and stories, ridiculously huge box office draws. However, there is one thing that sets this film apart from most contemporary duds: character. The characters here feel so real to one that you feel you know them. Roy Scheider (Brody) is just fantastic, Lorraine Gary is also pretty good and Richard Dreyfuss is pretty awesome. Who can forget Robert Shaw's (as Quint) entrance with the nails on the chalk board? These characters have been so ingrained in our psyche that we often do not even realize when modern films and TV shows pay tribute to them.It's also Spielberg's greatest attempt at horror. Though he's had some relatively close ones like 2005's \"War of the Worlds\", it still doesn't compare to his work in this one. And duh, John William's score is just BAD-ASS. That theme is probably one of the composer's most iconic themes ever, but there also many quiet moments that create splendid tension. And our friend the Great White, surely one of Hollywood's greatest movie monsters most definitely.An unbeatable classic.",

Even though Spielberg is popular for his blockbusters, the man is incredibly versatile and has proved with almost each and every film that he can handle any subject matter and give it life on screen. For many reasons 'Jaws' has become a landmark classic throughout the years. What sets this one apart from the usual monster flick is the creation of tension. It is rather an atmospheric film where the monster only appears halfway through. The director tones down the visual horror by not overdoing blood and gore. There is the shocking sequence of a boy getting devoured by the shark which is so horrifyingly executed. One hardly witnesses a child being killed by a monster in the movies and here Spielberg does it smoothly without being too visceral. The use of a robot shark is highly effective and looks eerily real, much more frightening than any CGI shark. John Williams's score is another plus. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss and Lorraine Gary don't let the shark overshadow their performances. They play their characters like humans rather than caricatures. 'Jaws' is definitely another landmark film by Spielberg. There have been numerous shark flicks ever since but nothing has been as impactive as 'Jaws' which had lead to a small loss in the American tourist industry.",

            "content": "Jaws is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,thrilling and suspenseful classic that combines amazing direction,a wonderful cast and an iconic and terrifying film score and with those elements Jaws is one of my favorite films and is cinema and Steven Spielberg at their best.Based on the novel by Peter Benchley and set on the fictional town of Amity Island,Jaws tells the story of Martin Brody(Roy Schneider),the new Chief of Police in Amity who discovers that there is a great white shark attacking and killing people in the ocean and menacing the community of Amity. Out of options and nowhere to turn,Brody enlists the help of Biologist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss)and shark hunter and sea captain Quint(Robert Shaw)to hunt down the shark and kill it at all costs.What can be said about Jaws that hasn't been said before? It's one of the greatest and most iconic movies of all-time that is apart of Pop Culture,it was not only the first Summer Blockbuster but was the movie that also introduced film audiences to one of the greatest and most iconic Filmmakers of all-time in Steven Spielberg. Scary,frightening and unforgettable Jaws did for swimming in the water and ocean like Alfred Hitchcock's Masterpiece Psycho did for taking showers. Right from it's shocking and terrifying opening Jaws is a truly brilliant and amazing cinematic experience that keeps you glued to the screen with great intensity and power constantly putting viewers on the edge of their seats the whole time with white hot suspense that is like a tightrope and is an assault on the senses. The suspense and terror is Jaws is powerful and sensational and handled with great timing because the movie not only scares viewers with the idea of going into the water and being eaten by a shark but with fear of the unknown because we never see the giant shark that attacks but only the shark's point of view when it attacks for the first hour and the terror feels real. Spielberg and others have said that the shark didn't work right at first which was a blessing in disguise for the movie because it added to the intensity and dread of the film. The beauty of Jaws and why it's such a great film is the way the story is told and how the film is shown in two parts. The first half-hour is an examination in terror and fright giving viewers the set-up and showing us various characters while the shark terrorizes the beaches and waters putting you on the edge of your seat. The second half of Jaws is a sea Water Action-Adventure with Brody,Hooper and Quint trying to kill the shark while being on a boat in the sea with the same terror and fear of the first half. That's One of the things that I love about Jaws is that with those two different half's of the film the movie crosses into many different genres it's a Suspense-Thriller,a Sea Adventure,an Action movie and a Horror film all in one giving viewers the best of all of those genres with such excitement and great energy that never stops for over two hours. The three main characters in Jaws Brody,Quint and Hooper are some of the best characters in movie history and when you first see them you will love all three of them immediately and I think the main reason all three characters are likable is because they are real characters with humanity and depth and you will see that throughout the film. It's because of Brody,Quint and Hooper's humanity that when they are on the boat trying to kill the shark we are not only rooting for them but afraid for them as well because the three of them are in the ocean in the middle of nowhere trying to catch a shark where anything can happen. Brody,Quint and Hooper are three classic characters you will never forget. The shark in Jaws is one of the greatest villains in movie history not because the shark is an animal but because the shark is a killing machine who will not stop killing and you can't talk to it or ask for remorse because if Jaws sees humans or blood in the water the shark will eat and slaughter it's prey with no remorse or pity because the shark doesn't care one way or another. Jaws is a study of man vs nature and it is told in a classic and powerful way. The ending of Jaws is one of greatest and most intense endings in film history and you as a viewer will be thrilled,scared and happy with the results of what happens at the conclusion. A classic ending.The cast is amazing. Roy Scheider is excellent,memorable and heroic as Marcus Brody,with Scheider bringing depth and intensity to the role. Robert Shaw is brilliant and unforgettable as Quint,a sea captain. Richard Dreyfuss is terrific and humorous as Matt Hooper,the marine biologist. Scheider,Shaw and Dreyfuss are amazing and have great chemistry together. Lorainne Gray is fantastic as Ellen Brody,Brody's wife. Murray Hamilton is wonderful as Vaughn,the mayor of Amity.The direction by Steven Spielberg is brilliant and memorable,with Spielberg constantly moving the camera and bringing a great atmosphere and intensity especially during the scenes involving the shark. Terrific direction,Spielberg.The score and theme by John Williams is outstanding,frightening and iconic and one of the most famous scores in film history,with Williams' score being intense,scary and adventurous. Classic score,Williams.In final word,if you love Steven Spielberg or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Jaws,an excellent,suspenseful and terrifying classic that you can watch again and again and will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

            "content": "After Steven Spielberg directing his TV movie \"Duel,\" and his first theatrical movie \"The Sugarland Express\" he would go on to direct a movie about a man-eating shark that attacks people. The movie is about a great white shark, that has been causing all the issue for attacking innocent people on Amity Island as our three main characters set out by sea to go find the shark, and kill it so no one would have anymore shark problems whatsoever. \"Jaws\" is a cinematic masterpiece of filmmaking, and I thought Spielberg is able to bring such tension of suspense and excitement as you are going along with the ride. The production of this movie had numerous problems to get the shark to work, but Spielberg made such a wise choice to not show the shark as learned from one his idols Alfred Hitchcock as he makes this movie very suspenseful as he did with \"Duel\" for not showing the truck driver. He only shows the shark toward the end of the movie, which it makes a very good build up to show the shark. Also, the movie works well with the human characters as they don't come out as cardboard cutouts, but make them as they act like real people. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss are excellent together in this movie, and they make a great chemistry. I have never read the book, but I'm sure that movie is different than what the book represents. Peter Benchley wrote the book, as well as co-writing the screenplay with Carl Gottlieb and the movie does have a very well written script. The shark itself is very well done for its mixture for using practical effects, and real-life shark footage by Ron and Valerie Taylor; this is before CG as they had to film a real shark so the filmmakers won't have to keep going practical with the shark. As for John Williams, his music is completely unforgettable and really loved the theme that he created for this movie; its a good thing that he won an Oscar for his music of the movie, and he really deserves that kind of recognition. The movie does go at a very good pace, and I thought the climax at the end between Brody and the shark is very well done. The opening scene, in my opinion, is really Spielberg's own shower scene from \"Psycho\" as it is shocking to see this poor woman get killed by our main antagonist. I'm not going into much detail about this movie because everyone has seen \"Jaws,\" and it will always continue to be a classic movie as well as one of Spielberg's best films. \"Jaws\" will always be the definitive shark movie, and nothing can compare to this masterpiece. I give it a 10 out of 10.",

Steven Spielberg would go on to projects of greater artistic ambition (\"Schindler's List,\" \"Saving Private Ryan\") and would enjoy the services of much more reliable and convincing special-effects monsters (although less convincing humans) when he brought dinosaurs to life in \"Jurassic Park,\" but has yet to make anything that's as perfect as \"Jaws,\" on its own terms, was and is.

It won 3 oscars and as on pretty much every 'Greatest movie ever made' list that I have ever read. So what made this film so iconic?If you have been under a rock for the last 45 years, Jaws is about a small holiday town on an island somewhere on the east coast-ish area of the US. This town is being plagued by a giant shark and the chief of police not only has to deal with a man eating fish, but with politicians that don't want to risk loosing the town's summer income in order to deal with the problem.It is pulse-pounding, nerve shredding tension right from the start. And there probably isn't a film aficionado left on earth who doesn't know John Williams famous score for this film. That serves as a way of really dialling up the suspense. And what is so great about this, is that it does all of this without you actually ever getting a good look at the shark. That is left entirely up to your imagination, as all good scary movies should be. That way you are naturally inclined to imagine the worst thing you can think of. Which in a film like this, means you get all the scares with none of the expensive CGI bills.The acting isn't always the best, the brief glimpses of the shark we do get make it obvious that the thing is basically just a stuffed puppet, and it isn't exactly the fastest paced but it IS a classic and one that every film fanatic should see at least once for sure.Recommended for fans of:\nJurassic Park\nThe Thing",

It is a real achievement to build a shark of that size, to get it to move and look real as it does. It makes you think that all the use of CG in films like Deep Blue Sea recently and yet a model shark used in a film that is 30 years old still looks more realistic.After watching this movie I will guarantee you will feel different about going into the water again.10/10 - Scary, Jumpy, Funny, Tense and pure edge of the seat entertainment, especially recommended for shark fans.",

            "content": "Funny how one of the worst books ever written can be adapted into one of the best movies ever made. Peter Benchley's tawdry gutter fiction is hugely improved upon by Carl Gottlieb's screenplay. With Spielberg's taut direction, Williams iconic score, terse editing, lovely anamorphic Panavision photography, and wonderful chemistry between the three leads also to its advantage Benchley's novel thankfully becomes a distant memory.Before Spielberg became the biggest name in Hollywood, capable of green-lighting anything he wants, he wandered in Richard Zanuck's office and picked up the script thinking he could churn out a decent B-movie. His only theatrical movie before this was The Sugarland Express, though it wasn't a huge hit. Jaws became the first summer blockbuster when crowds literally lined-up around the block to see it. $470 million dollars worth of bust is enough to kick-start any career.In the Atlantic waters off the coast of Amity Island a 25-foot Great White Shark has staked a claim for his hunting ground. The bathers and holiday makers are all he needs for his breakfast, lunch, and dinner. New police chief Martin Brody wants to close the beaches but the greed of local business owners keeps the meaty flesh of human on the sand and beneath the sun.When a young boy is devoured his mother offers a $3K reward for the killing of the shark, causing the overzealous, money-hungry local fishermen to crowd the waters with dynamite and chum. Only Quint (the one and only Robert Shaw), a WWII veteran with a personal vendetta against shark-kind, has the skill to pursue the monster. Brody and oceanographer Matt Hooper (a 'young' Richard Dreyfuss) join Quint on his hunt not knowing how monstrous the shark really is.Jaws is split into two perfect halves. One landlocked, filled with fences, boundaries, and a sense of being contained. The other filled with isolation and a sense of not belonging. The Orca, Quint's ramshackle boat, becomes its own little island, ever so slowly disintegrating and sinking as their safety slips away. Brody, already afraid of the water, almost buckles under the pressure, Hooper loses his cool when no one trusts his judgment, and Quint loses his sanity as he aggressively, psychotically pursues the shark.What makes Jaws special is that it scars and stays with you. The only other movie that I can of that has had similar success is the 1999 horror The Blair Witch Project. In much the same way as Jaws kept millions of people out of the water, Blair Witch kept them out of the woods too. There are some places that humans are just not supposed to go. Whenever you've been paddling at the beach and suddenly wander into a 'cold bit' don't tell me you've never thought about Bruce the shark coming to get you.He IS out there, you know. For real.",

Perhaps it's a matter of satiation overload and that with time the numbness and the redundancy has dulled the impact of the original contemporary horror-monster movie that started it all. Too many mayors who ignore warnings because of economics, too many mysterious deaths, too many gruff, war-weary veterans and too many sharp, whiz kids, and too many normal everyman has seemed to have made one immune to the scares and thrills, the upsets, and the boiling over stupidity of various what have become stock characters now. JAWS brought to the big screen the fear of the ordinary, the graphic depiction of both hidden horror and the in your face horror ending sequences, from the authentic crowd panic and trampling of people that would be later seen in THE WAR OF THE WORLDS (2005) remake. Nevertheless, the original has to be recognized for its vitality and freshness of the genre it brought to the bring screen.",

I was left with a sense of disappointment. There wasn't enough suspense, and in some scenes, the music killed the vibe. The ending was... not what I expected for a horror film and it left me with an unpleasant feeling. The death scenes were not clearly shown/depicted. And I get that this film wasn't trying to be gory, but not being able to see the deaths and the bodies kinda made me feel frustrated.I know that the making of this film required more money and time than expected and that it took a heavy toll on everybody, especially Steven. But that's no excuse for the poor execution of the ending.

It's EXCELLENT! You know what I say? I say it's a great entertaining film but it's not one of the best films ever made, trust me. The best SPIELBERG film would have to be a tie between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Yes, I agree, Jaws is a classic and always will be but yet not as much as ones like the old classic Disney cartoons orrr, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. That would be The Untouchables. It's a wonderful crime-drama just like another EXCELLENT film, The Godfather. They both have their own sense of style and both directed by different Italian directors, Francis Ford Coppola (for The Godfather) and Brian DE Palma (for The Untouchables). They both involve Italian mobsters, Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). I was tempted to put Dona Vitoa Corleonea when talking about the Italian character but I held it back. See those are two classics. Jaws to me is a great but not EXCELLENT film to be ranting and raving about. I mean the story is about a killer shark haunting the citizens of Amity Island. The highlight is definitely (the late) Robert Shaw's character, Quint, who plays the crazy boat captain also trying to look for the killer shark along with Richard Dreyfuss, playing the wacky Matt Hooper whom is very experienced at his job. Then you got Roy Scheider playing the friendly police chief. He's nothing much. Robert Shaw tops 'em all however in his acting. He was always a great actor and also the highlight of James Bond: From Russia With Love. What do these people have to do with this killer shark? Well, the gotta kill it! Before it kills everyone in Amity Island and then continues on its journey to kill other people too. However, the annoying, roly-poly mayor disagrees with their intention. He'd rather keep the beach open in order for people to enjoy the nice, soothing, relaxing water. Basically he bribes with them. If they want to do this and close down HIS beach, he'll want a lot of money for this doing. So the adventure goes on and on and on until finally\u0085 the classic ending which everyone should know about. Not only does Quint pass away gruesomely in this film but also Robert Shaw himself is dead in real life too. Then leave it up to the people hungry for more. Here come some more sequels, Jaws II, Jaws III, and Jaws the Revenge with whom of all people, Dennis Quaid! Now what's he doin' in a flop like that. When it comes to classic ORIGINAL films, they're great! But then they get put down because of the horrible sequels that follow it or the prequels that begin it. It usually happens that many original films either have sequels or prequels or both. It happens all the time unless every single character dies in the original film or it's based on a true story so they'll just have one film and give up. Movie directed by Steven Spielberg.",

            "content": "I remember seeing Jaws a long time ago; well maybe it wasn't ages and ages ago but several years is more than enough time in-between viewing a film. What I expected from Jaws this second time given the amount of films from Spielberg I've seen since and the amount of films I'd seen as a whole anyway was something a tense, taught, 'slowly building it up and then hitting you' horror thriller. True, I couldn't remember much from the first viewing apart from some of the more memorable moments not only in Jaws but in film history overall; these included the finger nails down a blackboard scene and the now famous 'trombone' shot as Brody (Scheider) sits on the beach receiving a massage as the shark claims its latest victim.Even if what I got was very different to what I was expecting, that still isn't saying I didn't enjoy it after this gap. I found Jaws to be tight, clever, sharp and highly entertaining \u0096 the only real complaint being that the editing has not dated well. Some films are lucky to have anything truly memorable in them at all - Jaws has; in its opening twenty five minutes or so, about three to four things. These things, when either repeated or spoofed instantaneously remind you that it was from Jaws. These are things like the now famous musical score from John Williams, Quint's (Shaw) introduction with the blackboard, 'the' shot of Brody on his chair, the two swimmers in the opening scene and the wonderful point of view shots we have of the shark; allowing us, the audience, to be the killer every now and again.Not only do these events now have something of a 'cult' status but the pacing of each scene within the actual film itself took me by surprise \u0096 Jaws is, in truth, an unrelenting barrage of entertaining and unpredictable situations pieced together in such a fast and refreshing way, I'm amazed it didn't have a truly lasting impression on me the first time I saw it half a dozen years ago. The film really does suck you in, no exaggeration \u0096 and it does this through keeping a strong, steady figure (Brody) at the centre of the film whilst systematically introducing new characters and situations as it pleases. We are shown that Quint is around but his help is rejected although later on they need him, we are introduced to a shark expert from the mainland and find out a bit about him as things carry on and of course, the constant threat of the shark looms savagely making any shot or scene where either beaches or water is involved, truly uncomfortable and simultaneously, disturbing to watch.Not only this; but tension and anxiety is played with very effectively. When the shark expert Hooper (Dreyfuss) has to go down into the water and inspect the bottom of a boat even we are unsure as to whether it's safe. As well as this, when it's realised the shark is in the 'pond' part of the beach, where Brody's children are, we are equally unsure as Brody's children strike us (at least they did to me) as expendable characters \u0096 wouldn't give Brody a bigger and more personal drive to catch and kill the shark if his kids were victims? The scene involving and surrounding the capture of another shark early on is played with very well as some detective work is needed to work out if it's the right one.When Jaws enters its final third, it is quite literally 'man vs. beast' as these three guys are out at sea, no where to go and with a mission in mind: eliminate the shark problem. This is played out using several techniques and situations, all of which score. The sheer unpredictability of the film as well as the action that pops up every now and again is wonderful as guns, harpoons and even yellow tracking barrels are used to try and defeat the monster. When they realise defeating it from the surface is a little too hard, they even try and match it under the water resulting in a heart stopping scene involving a shark cage. It's not all barrage upon barrage on the animal, though \u0096 the shark wins its fair share of the fight. Jaws is very clever in its delivery, pacing and realism. It's also very entertaining and is up there with some of the best work Spielberg has ever done.",

Instead, it's more than halfway through the film before the creature appears in full view of the audience.Until then, only William's haunting score is there to warn you of the approaching danger as people get picked off one by one in the surf.  It also allows sufficient time to develop each of the main characters: Brody, the city-boy cop trying to deal with small-town politics, Hooper, the oceanographer who also thinks about the scientific possibilities, Vaughn, the slick mayor who turns a blind eye to the problem in favor of the business people that put him in office, and Quint, the hunter who will solve the island's problem for a handsome fee.The movie only gets better in the second half as Quint becomes a modern Ahab, who looks upon the shark as an adversary and pledges to rid the seas of this great white terror without much thought of this daunting challenge or its significant consequences.  Meanwhile, Brody and Hooper now face two problems: the menacing shark, who seems to be toying with them, and Quint, who has no problem taking them down with him should it come to that conclusion.Having grown up on the water, had I seen this film as a young boy, I may have thought twice about dangling my hand over the side of the boat or diving off the town docks.  The horror genre is usually synonymous with bad cinema but, on the rare occasion, some unforgettable classics are created and the first of this series (the only one worth watching or owning) is such an example.",

            "content": "Above all, Jaws is two memories of my childhood: first, it's a shark toy. It was big, very look-like and mean, with white hard teethes on a articulated jaws: the game was to retrieve things inside of its jaws, a sort of Dr. Maboul. Then, I have also a Playmobil yacht and with my star wars figurines, it was hours and hours of play. The second is the Benchley's book that I have found in my father's things. I suppose he had bought it in 1976 at a time when my brother and me couldn't speak yet. We were only jaws then. The only difference with the movie i recall is a crude sex scene between Hooper and Brody's wife. I think my father was a fan because we also went to \"Jaws 3D\", maybe my first experience of 3D on screen, with the fingers of the body stroking my face. Back to the movie, as a lot Spielberg's, I discovered it on TV and maybe VHS tape so this was my first viewing on screen. Honestly, this time the magic didn't devour me. Sure, it had a great cast, great locations, great score and suspense but in some way, I feel alienated: Maybe it's because i know it by heart, I find it fast, really fast. Then, it was too much a men's hunt. I think that if Spielberg has a weakness, it's that women are often not his focus and Jaws is his best example. In all cases, this movie was the really first to star a killer animal but actually this idea has leave the family and holidays feeling that Spielberg has impulsed to plain gore, blood and blood.Pairing: \"Jurassic Park\": another kind of jaws and again a book adaptation...NB: With Google help, I have found the shark toy and I was surprised to see it's actually an official product of the movie: it's the Ideal game and it's just the best piece of merchandising ever. Wish I could find it again and have kids to make them a good gift!",

            "content": "If you ask me, there are only a hand full of movies that I can call \"perfect\", and this is one of them! Jaws tells the story of Martin Brody, the Chief of Police on the quiet island of Amity, and how his life was changed forever one fateful summer. It all starts with the mysterious death of a skinny dipper, soon found in pieces on the shore. Believing it to be a shark attack, Brody attempts to close the beaches, but this upsets the mayor of Amiry Island, who's main goal is to make money off the tourists coming to the island. Things become worse when a little boy is also killed by the same shark, putting fear and anxiety in the hearts of Amity's people. Trying to find a way to stop this shark before he strikes again, he teams up with Matt Hooper, an oceanographer hired to find out more about the shark and how it works, and Quint, a war vet with a terrifying past and a vast amount of sea shanties to sing as he hunts down this great white. Will they find and kill the shark? Or will they be the latest thing on its menu?First thing to comment on, of course, is the story. No other person on this Earth could write a more realistic, terrifying, and classic story like this! The movie is based on the book written by Peter Benchley, so he is given the praise for making one of the best stories ever put on paper and screen! Next up, the acting. Jaws gave us the best performances from Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, and, most of all, Robert Shaw as Quint. His performance has sent chills doe the spines of many, and those chills never stop. Next, the score. It's John Williams. That's all I need to say. Up next, the effects. This is the only negative part of this movie. The effects are not the greatest, and especially considering the budget of the film, which I calculated as over $35,000,000, it's a wonder how this shark looked so strange. However, you have to admit that it was a good idea to keep the mechanical shark hidden until the final third. The shark may look odd, but it still scares the crap out of me to this day. Finally, the cinematography. The film is very beautiful and you can see that by just looking at the multiple screenshots. It's dark and disturbing when it needs to be, as well as nice and pretty when it needs to. Really, this review can't do this movie justice. All I have to say is watch this movie. Just don't watch it before going to the beach. You never know what could be down there...",

Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw all make good as the group set on destroying the dreaded killer fish, and the supporting roles do a nice job of fleshing out the citizens of Amity.The end result are some tense and mildly gory frights, another classic John Williams score, and a thoroughly entertaining movie.  The 25th anniversary re-release is worth getting, especially if you don't own the movie already. The film has been nicely restored, with an informative \"making of\" documentary, theatrical trailers, deleted scenes (see Quint terrorize oboe playing children!) and a few extras give this package some real (forgive the pun) meat.A fun classic film, although its sequels are absolutely ridiculous.

The other reason is that, despite the wisecracks about rubbery sharks, we don't really see the shark attacking that much; rather, the beauty of the film is about the presumptions we make and the fears we have about what's going on beneath the water, and what's out there in the deep.You should see this film again - bear in mind how old it is, how good it looks, (the locations on Martha's Vineyard are beautiful), and how you'll jump out of your skin in the 'head' scene!

            "content": "The legacy of Steven Spielberg's \"Jaws\" is immense and immeasurable. It spawned countless monster/giant predator horror films and campy knock-offs, it infiltrated culture so significantly people didn't want to go swimming at the beach, and it was the first film to gross $100 million dollars, turning summer into the profitable blockbuster movie season we know today. But amid all the hoisting up of \"Jaws\" as a phenomenon, what has a tendency to get lost is the drama, suspense and craftsmanship.Although largely touted as a horror film \u2013 and rightfully so given how much it actually scared people at the time \u2013 so much of \"Jaws\" is drama. The visual effects and suspense have become so iconic over the last 40 years that they overshadow Spielberg's attention to the characters and the impact these traumatic events have on them. The truth is that commitment to meaningful storytelling is what makes the film great and worthy of a Best Picture nomination as opposed to simply \"one of the best horror movies of all time.\"\"Jaws\" has two distinct halves that allow it to function as a multi- genre film. The first takes us to the New England seaside town of Amity where the new sheriff (Roy Scheider) has to deal with a few gruesome shark attacks despite the mayor insisting the beaches stay open for business. The second follows Sheriff Brody out to open sea with a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a moderately insane shark hunter (Robert Shaw) to track down the voracious great white.Part one brings most of the suspense. We don't get to see much if any of the shark as Spielberg's camera looks upward from the ocean floor at various potential victims. Of course every great suspense film needs two things: a great editor (Oscar-winner Verna Fields) an even more suspenseful score. John Williams' legendary \"Theme from 'Jaws'\" provides just that \u2013 a palpable sense of fear and danger. In between heart-racing moments, Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's script (based loosely on Benchley's novel) explores the actual impact of what would happen to a town with a shark problem, with Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) driving us mad by downplaying of the attacks. Considering the countless films since 1975 built on the concept of \"Jaws\" that ignore the victims and the real-world implications, the fact that \"Jaws\" doesn't neglect them adds to its shelf life.Eventually, \"Jaws\" transitions into somewhat of a \"Moby Dick\" tale following three strangers isolated on a boat somewhere in the Atlantic with the goal of taking out a gigantic shark. This final act is when Spielberg reveals the infamous mechanical shark, which again, makes it easy to forget the number of scenes on the boat in which these men share war stories and sing songs, the tension between them reflecting the tension of the audience as we await the shark's next move. These dialogue-heavy scenes definitely slow \"Jaws\" down in a way that's less than ideal, but the trade-off is the greater intimacy we get with the characters. Plus, it gives the stars some space to do actual acting rather than serve as human props for Spielberg's toy shark.With its larger than life ending, the likes of which had not been seen before, \"Jaws\" cemented its place in film history as the first modern blockbuster. The combination of storytelling and overall good filmmaking technique with technological innovation resulted in a product that was not only revolutionary, but also tapped into a deeper part of the human nature of its audience, our instincts for danger and fear. \"Jaws\" was a thrilling wakeup call to Hollywood and reminder to moviegoers everywhere that movies allow us to come as close to experiencing actual danger and fear than most of us will ever get. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

I am immune to this movie. Nevertheless, I think it is very much worthwhile viewing and would recommend it. The characters are good and almost cliche by some of todays Spielberg standards. The acting is top-notch and convincing. The story is almost too easy to follow - it's practically a template for future similar movies. And, yes, there are quite a few tense moments with the occasional body-part cameo. The shark? Yeah, Ok it is convincing when it needs to be. In fact, this movie has probably single-handedly put the kibosh on the rest of the world's remaining shark population forever. More people die from being kicked by horses every year than by encounters with sharks - but this movie got people worried. I suppose you could classify this movie as having cultural impact as well.

Okay, maybe it's a little outdated, but it still packs a wholloping bite and it still sends a shiver down my spine. The story, based on the intriguing novel of the same name by Peter Benchley, is simple, following a police chief named Martin Brody as he and the entire community of Amity Island is terrorized by a Great White shark who doesn't seem to want to leave. Spielberg keeps the story at a perfect pace and the plot stays tight and gripping, with some genuinely scary shark attacks and effects that still hold true today.

The mother of the boy offers a bounty of $3,000 for anyone who captures and kills the shark. The chief of police, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), wants to prevent people from going into the water, but the major Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) fears that any move would ruin the town's economy and tourism industry. Vaughn ignores the dangers until it was too late. With the help of marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), Brody goes off to hunt for the shark.Jaws is told in two parts. The first is about the investigation, the local reaction and the rivalry between Brody and Vaughn. The second forces on the hunt for the shark. The plot is basic. What Steven Spielberg did was making the characters believable and let them develop. The characters form friendships and rivalry and you even question some of their actions (in a good way). John Williams gives the film a excellent score and they is a fine editing job (for the most part). Steven Spielberg films some fine action sequences and shows he is the master of his craft.Jaws is far from perfect and is not Spielberg's best film. It could have been about 10 to 15 minutes shorter.

Where is she now, on the 45th anniversary of 'Jaws'?With alcohol and adrenaline running through her veins after a late night Amity Island beach party, the youngster stripped out of her clothes and dived into the grey, sparkling water. As her drunken partner dozed obliviously in the sand, Chrissie was about to die one of the most horrible, visceral deaths in the history of cinema - and you never even see her killer.Her real name is Susan Backlinie, and although she was obviously not dragged to a watery death by a killer shark, the reaction you see on her face as she's pulled under was real. After a few takes, Steven Spielberg decided Susan's reaction wasn't realistic enough, so he instructed the diver beneath the water not to tell the actress when he was going to pull her under - that desperate gulp for air is real, and it sells Chrissie's death perfectly. It's the reason so many of us still don't think it's safe to go back into the water.Backlinie was no stranger to the briny deep. The 28-year-old was a stuntwoman who specialised in animal training when she accepted the pivotal role in 'Jaws', although sharks were clearly not in her remit. Nudity, however, was - she posted nude, draped seductively over a real lion, in a 1973 edition of Mayfair.",

            "content": "When a young woman's body is discovered in the water it is quickly determined that she has been killed as a result of a shark attack. Upon this discovery, police chief Martin Brody wants the beach to be closed down, but Amity Island mayor Vaughan isn't keen on this notion as he is worried about the impact on tourism. Shark hunter Quint offers to kill the shark for a large sum of money and with the assistance of Brody and oceanographic expert Hooper the men set out to sea to kill the shark, but trying to defeat one of the deadliest predators in the ocean proves challenging and is fraught with dangers even for experts such as Quint and Hooper...Jaws is an iconic film no question...for many years after its release it was responsible for many a man woman and child being too scared to go in to the water and its famous line uttered by Brody of \"You're gonna need a bigger boat\" has become legendary as being one of the most famous lines in the history of cinema. Jaws is also one of the first of what would become known as 'summer blockbusters' so its reputation very much proceeds it. Whilst Jaws is still a very good film and is a must see film I didn't quite enjoy it as much watching it again having not watched it for about 10 years...When the focus is on the shark and the terror that it is bringing to the island Jaws is a first-rate thriller; the shark is not revealed until quite late in the film meaning that the threat is always there and you never quite know when Jaws is going to strike. This creates tension and suspense within the film and it is these components that make the film enjoyable.Where I found Jaws to be slightly problematic was when the focus shifts away from the sea and back to dry land. It's fair to say that the politics that engulfs the first half of the film is not all that interesting and there are a good number of characters here that don't convey much in the way of interest either. There is one point when Brody, Quint and Hooper are a bit drunk and all have heart to hearts, but for me this went on for too long and took away from the tension and suspense that Spielberg had masterfully built up till this point.Working in the film's favour though is that fabulous score by John Williams (which in my opinion is one of the best scores that I've heard). As soon as you hear the strings of that cello you know trouble is never far away. The acting is generally good; Shaw and Dreyfuss reputedly hated one another and some of this hatred is well-conveyed by their characters on the screen.If you haven't seen Jaws then you owe it to yourself to see it as it is very good, but it's fair to say that watching it again it certainly has its slow spots and, for me, isn't quite the flawless masterpiece that many claim it to be.",

            "content": "This was a film that I wasn't sure if I had ever actually watched all the way through or, but I had seen most of it multiple times. It definitely is a blockbuster film and one that really changed the landscape of cinema. I can say now, that I've seen it all the way through twice, both on 35 mm thanks to Gateway Film Center, plus another viewing at the drive-in due to COVID-19 and theaters not being open currently. The official synopsis is a local sheriff, a marine biologist and an old seafarer team up to hunt down a great white shark wrecking havoc in a beach resort.To start off, this film definitely has interesting dynamics for me. This is a summer on an island where they make most of their money for the year off of the people that come there for vacation. This makes it a lot like those crab fishers or other professions that have a small window where they make a majority of their money. When there is the fear that a shark might be stalking the waters around it, it is a big deal. Quint (Robert Shaw) puts it best, if they don't make their money they will have to go on welfare and they are proud town. This makes for an interesting dynamic in that Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is an outsider who is the chief of police. He has the best intentions, but he is talked out of it by the mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton). His wife, Ellen (Lorraine Gary), points this out from the beginning as well. It really makes for an interesting though when the mayor and city counsel want the beaches open and are constantly trying to convince those around them that this isn't what they think is happening.I did find the shark aspects of the film to be really good as well. We don't get to see it much, which this was due to the mechanical sharks used kept breaking down. I personally think this actually helps to build the suspense of the film. Which also is interesting though is that we get a young woman who is killed in the opening sequence and more deaths happen soon after. There is a long stretch in the middle where the interactions with the shark taper off, but the film never really drug during that part for me. Personally, I feel this helps to build the tension of wondering if the men will be able to kill this animal gone rogue. On top of that, once they're out on the water, they try a few different ways to kill it and they fail. It is just showing that nature is pretty awesome to be honest. I felt that the editing helps to build this tension to the satisfying climax.Something else that not everyone is a fan of is the time Brody, Quint and Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) are on the boat. I personally love this part as Quint is my favorite character in the film. I think the story he tells about his time in World War II is interesting and it explains a lot about his character. He comes off so hard and this really humanizing and explaining his vendetta against these animals. What he says about the sharks he encountered during his time over there is quite haunting and I actually think it sets up their final showdown.From there we should go to the acting. I thought Schneider was really good in his role. I find it interesting is that he is the chief of police. He doesn't like water, but lives on an island. He is from New York City, where he was also a police officer and he had to be tough there. He is such a pushover when it comes to his authority here and how he is bullied into going against what he wants to do. Shaw as I stated above was my favorite character in this film. I feel that the reveals we get about this character make him some a tragic person. Dreyfuss is good as the educated character that is an outsider. Quint nor the counsel buy into what he is saying. Gary is good as the counterbalance to Schneider and has a couple funny moments. I also really like Hamilton. He makes you sick with what he does to override Schneider, but it is really hard to fault him too much. I thought the rest of the cast round out the film well.The effects of the film were something that really were a point of contention with director Steven Spielberg, but I actually think it ends up working out for the film and helping it to be more suspenseful. The times we get to see the sharks, I know it isn't real, but I think it actually looks much better than many films that use CGI sharks. Sharks that you see on television or in aquariums do seem to act very similar to the one in this film and I thought it was good. The blood and chum in the film also look good, I had no complaints there. It is also shot beautifully.Something that might not be a popular opinion is that I'm not the biggest fan of this soundtrack. Now I love the main theme for the shark. I think that helps to build tension and the scenes that are shot from below the water that use this theme, I think are great. There are a few times in the film where the music was a little bit upbeat and didn't fit for me personally. Now I'm not going to take off any points here as I feel this is a minute quibble with it.Now with that said, if you haven't seen this film I would highly recommend it. The realism of what happens in this film is great, as it is loosely based off an incident that happened off the coast of New Jersey, which is also referenced here. I found the story of this film to have some interesting dynamics and interactions with the characters. I thought the pacing of the film was good. It builds tension all the way through to the satisfying climax. The acting I felt was superb. The effects seem to have benefited by the machines not working as they wanted as I think it helps with the tension and suspense. I'm not a huge fan of the soundtrack, but I think some parts of it are great where others don't necessarily fit. I still think that this film is definitely worth viewing and is great.",

            "content": "A movie that keeps its intensity all the way through. You always feel the presence of the shark even when it is not there this is achieved by featuring first person shots. Jaws also achieves a claustrophobic feel even when the characters are on land. But definitely the best part of the film are the characters. One of the best character writings ever. You can see how scared Brody due to his fear of the water. He is determined to kill the shark to keep the town and his family safe. His love for his son is fantastically shown by the short and cute scene where his son mimics his movements. And even when he makes mistakes you feel for him. Hopper is a oceanographer who thinks he knows all about shark but is terrifyingly surprised when the shark is not behaving naturally. Hopper and Brody have an amazing chemistry between them. The conversation between the two is natural, funny and scary. But hands down the best character is Quint. The shark hunter who will destroy any shark for the right amount of money. His monologues are astonishingly written and acted out. You can see the terrified look on his face when he talks about his past. He is also a natural with Hopper and Brody even though being a little rude to them. The boat Orca is a very good final act setting for the movie because now the characters can't go to a safe place so they are forced to take action. The movie ends in a very climactic way with the shark eating Quint and Brody killing the shark which is a very good character arc because he was the most afraid of the creature. Quint also gets a good character arc he goes down with his ship trying to kill his target even in his last moments. The movie ends with Brody and Hopper sailing on a piece of wood.Amazing movie! Definitely watch it!",

            "content": "JAWS wow what can be said that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece? Legendary heartfelt filmmaker STEVEN SPEILBERG gave us the scariest movie ever set on the water with this Shark Thriller that is still Absolutely terrifying & has lost none of it's bite. SPEILBERG is a legend, a director that touched our hearts & imaginations growing up & impacted all our childhood's with his special films. I grew up on Hook, E. T, Jaws, Duel, Close Encounters, Jurassic Park 1&2 & many other films that SPEILBERG was involved with as producer such as Arachnophobia, Gremlins 1&2, InnerSpace, Batteries Not Included, Poltergeist, Casper, Small Soldiers, Men In Black, Harry & The Hendersons, The Haunting, Who Framed Roger Rabbit? These are just for an example. Spielberg was a huge part of my movie-loving-world growing up as was Joe Dante & John Carpenter. Spielberg is a genius & for what he gave us i love the guy.\"Jaws\" was one of the first movies i ever saw as a kid that got me into proper films & not just animated stuff, well along with a few other's like \"Halloween '78\" \"Ghostbusters 1&2\" & probably the original \"Star wars trilogy\" so yeah Jaws had a big impact on me growing up.Roy Scheider is the man, a guy that i feel connected to because of his outstanding performance as Cheif Brody. Roy is the everyman of Cinema & when i think of Jaws or even going to the beach, i think of Cheif Brody!!! Roy & Jaws had such an impact on me from being little & watching Jaws every summer it came on t.v, i love Roy for being the anchor in my movie-loving-world.Jaws is the greatest summer blockbuster popcorn movie of all time, the film that truly started the big \"Summer Blockbuster\" & it still holds up perfectly. No amount of today's flashy over-the-top C. G. I heavy mega budget films could ever beat Jaws on any level, the excitement & suspense & characters are a work of movie magic & art, a movie that is absolutely perfect in every single way & is still Spielberg's best movie in my opinion.Nostalgia overload when i watch this Classic & it's still as tension-filled & scary with each viewing as it's lost none of it's powerful impact. A timeless piece of filmmaking & an iconic performance from the legendary Roy Scheider as Cheif Brody. Whenever i think of Jaws the first thing that comes to mind is Roy Scheider's worried face, love that guy.All i can say is how much i love this movie to death & it's probably the main reason I'm obsessed with movies also with the Ghostbusters films as these i watched as at a very young age\nBut Jaws was my first experience watching a Horror film that's also part adventure & Thriller,Jaws had it all & stuck with me all my life thanks to Spielberg being a brilliant director & the outstanding beautiful music by John Williams & the BRILLIANT cast & performances & the beautiful Amity island setting.Roy scheider as Cheif Brody is one of my favourite movie characters ever, he's a fantastic average joe blue collar kinda guy & the legendary Roy scheider was never better R. I. P in my opinion & that's why Jaws 2 was also EXCELLENT because we had another film with Cheif Brody!!!Roy scheider is immortalised as that iconic role as the panicked Cheif Brody & it's truly one of the greatest performances & characters of all time in cinema.Richard Dreyfuss who i also love as an actor also gave a fantastic performance as marine biologist Hooper & he was just perfect & had lovely chemistry with Cheif Brody it was heartwarming especially the end when they swim back in together with thay beautiful music playing it's really a special scene that is movie magic.Robert Shaw was excellent as the rugged no nonsense captain quint & his performance was his most iconic role of his career & so it should be he was fantastic.Also brody's wife Ellen is also a great character & performance by Lorraine Gary she's just as important as the main three leads as she is like us the audience seeing it from the shore & terrified & in complete fear for her husband's safety when he has to leave in the boat to hunt that killer shark, she's a great actress & that's why i loved Jaws the Revenge because that was her movie her story of the effect these sharks have had on her family.Jaws is a special movie that takes a big chunk out of my heart & childhood as it's a movie I've grown with & everyone in my family loved the film especially my older brother.Jaws is in my all time top 3 & that's a hard thing to say as i love so many movies but really Jaws had to be in there as it's so rewatchable & so beautifully made it's perfect.Everytime i rewatch Jaws i fall in love with it all over again, it's perfect, beautiful music & performances & just simply the movie of movies.Spielberg has never done better than Jaws in my opinion now i know he's made way more important films but none are as exciting & none have had the characters as well done as Jaws.Jaws & it's characters will always live on & continue being some of the greatest in cinema history.SCHEIDER, DREYFUSS, SHAW & GARY are outstanding & gave some of the most memorable & beautiful performances in all of Cinema History!!! Big Nostalgia LOVE for Spielberg's Summertime Shark Horror.I love Jaws!!!!.My all time top 3 favourite films that i grew up loving is JAWS, GHOSTBUSTERS 2 & DRAGNET.",

I watch it now and it still evokes the same fears I had in 1973, my favorite scenes are still the same.  This is a classic because it hits on our most basic fears and insecurities.  Lovers of scary movies love the rush of being frightened.  It is a personal challenge to see if we can handle it.  I am a horrible swimmer, so staying out of the water became easier after this one. Spielberg created a masterpiece despite the challenges of working with a mechanical shark.  The suspense builds scene after scene, even though we don't even see the shark early on.

            "review_title": "Classic film, Spielberg's first hit and arguably Spielberg's best",
            "content": "The fearsome cartoon shark, Bruce, from Finding Nemo wouldn't have exited without Jaws. So many people's fear of the ocean, and particularly shark infested waters near otter and seals (such as up and down the California coast), wouldn't be what it still is (save for the gotta-cowabunga surfer-dudes), thirty years later, if not for this blockbuster summer hit that was Spielberg's breakthrough film.The 26 foot great white is introduced slowly, as a blur killing the little boy, more as bird's eye under the water killing the guy in the 'pond', but fully at the stern of the Orca, at last, and which then proceeds to attack the boat and its crew as if this fish were the equal of Rommel writing on tank tactics, and were as unstoppable as any terminator juggernaut - four barrels!, says Shaw's Quint, in disbelief. The barrels represent the shark, of course, when they pop to the surface (a sort of black humor).Schieder as the chief is very believable. Spielberg said he looked to cast an elderly Sterling Hayden, the nutty general from Kubrick's, Dr. Strangelove. But Hayden had other plans. Schieder is good. Dreyfuss is the same, for a guy whose characters veer into the annoying. He gets excited, and sometimes doesn't know what to say to bullies. But he's brave, at the last, and shows that he is paying attention. And Shaw's Quint does the same. Sure, he has the bluster of one who just doesn't like or trust people, as with the classic nails-on-the-blackboard scene where he negotiates his price of ten thousand, which eventually they pay. But when Dreyfuss tells Schieder to watch it, on the Orca, or else tip over some compressed air tanks (to introduce the essential plot resolution, later), after sort of dismissing Dreyfuss, Shaw in more hushed tones tells Schieder's character to watch it, as well - ask if you don't know what you're doing. So he's paying attention. But the character flaw of Quint, suggested by his general demeanor and craziness, is that he copes poorly under stress. He just flakes out. He becomes dangerously unglued. One could only imagine his difficulty in the water after the sinking of the Indy in WWII, which his character in this story was said to suffer.As for the script, it seems much was opportunistic. Spielberg was up against it. Things weren't going well, it seemed. He thought they might stop production, and that would be it - and his career it might have turned out. But as others have pointed out, and I think Spielberg's friend and close collaborator, George Lucas, should take note, the success of the film was due not merely to the outstanding and appropriate score, but to what you didn't see on screen. It succeeded not because of the hard fought effort to get the effects to work, but because for the longest time, they didn't, forcing the filmmakers to improvise. What you got, instead, was an almost clean, theatrical encouragement to imagination - film-making as substitute for radio serials. Crissy, the opening victim, doesn't even seem to bleed. Something is happening to her, but there are no bloodpacks in the mouth, as later with Quint, when you've already seen the shark. She just, literally, gets jerked back and forth and is pulled under. It's much the same for the mannequin, the remains of the fisherman found in the dead of night as Dreyfuss confesses that he's rich and bought that boat/yacht, himself. The dead head is obviously a prop. But the reaction shot, the pacing, and importantly that Spielberg has your suspension of disbelief at that point, might make it work. At lot is left to the imagination for you to ignore that it's obviously a prop, a dummy.Looking on the shark, now, in 2006, it's difficult not to see that it's obviously a mechanical prop. But in 1975, if you'd said to most people, they're building a large mechanical shark, people might have said - why? Great whites were known to those who would know. Those around Martha's Vineyard knew, of course - and that it didn't work, most of the time. But I think to most, this was the introduction of a creature they didn't know existed. So caught up in the film's suspense, the pacing, the direction, I think it was easily possible not to see this as a mechanical thing, but literally by imagination to overlook the obvious and make it seem what it was supposed to be - a live, gigantic, smart as an elephant, shark. But again, fortunately for the filmmakers, the fake shark was broken much of the time. And some of the key underwater footage was of real great whites, sometimes attacking a small model of the shark cage, scaled down. And Spielberg even shot a few brief shots of 'Dreyfuss' in the cage at the very last in someone's swimming pool.There are a couple of key scenes. The set up for the shark eating the guy in the dingy, in the 'pond', apparently goes to some theme of the novel of the greedy businessmen who would overlook their civic duty and responsibility for the sake of not shutting down business on the big holiday. And then the 'shark fin' attacks, the frightened adults paw over the kids floating in their way, and trample the oldsters who can't get out of their way.Another is the first view of the shark, showing that it is as big as the boat. That's the key scene because Quint jumps into attack mode, rather than abide the advice that they should retire from the scene - they need a bigger boat. This isn't a shark - it's Moby Dick.And the last, obviously, was the one set up by the air tanks falling. Jaws bites one, holds it in its mouth, and policeman Scheider gets off a lucky shot. Otherwise, the movie ends as it should have ended.",

His direction is truly brilliant - capturing the horror and sudden shock of shark attacks in a way that has not been equalled yet. The special effects are good, even by today's standards - the blood actually looks half convincing even if the mechanical shark itself isn't exactly top-class. Jaws was a simple idea - a shark plaguing a beach and killing the civilians - turned into a great film that inspired several followings (this isn't exactly a cult film) and several less-than-brilliant sequels. Steven Spielberg owes all the success he has today to Jaws - 30 years on, people are still loving it like it's still the 70s. And it is actually quite harrowing in parts - lots of fake blood and screaming. Jaws' death at the end is massive - an image that will stick in your mind long after the screen in front of you goes blank. And that is Steven Spielberg's greatest talent - creating monumental images in film. From the menacing start to the action-packed end, this is, in every sense, a classic. 9/10",

            "content": "Do you love the water?Given director Steven Spielberg's predilection for calling his more sensational films 'fast-food movies', anyone approaching Jaws for the first time might feel an extra reason for combining horror and camp humour in their advance thoughts. There is always a fairground attraction element in revisiting old scary movies. Jumping out of our seats is combined with a know-all feeling that the special effects are somewhat dated. But as there is much more to Jaws than a rather unrealistic model shark, it still has plenty of power to thrill.The basic story is simple enough. A killer shark threatens a popular beach resort and people are slow to believe it for fear of lost revenue. Spielberg notches up the emotional tension with a range of equally iconic characters, deft camera work and an ominous music by John Williams. The memorable leitmotif - low thumping staccato notes like a heart pounding too quickly - announces the approach of the shark so effectively that the sound scares us half to death even before any visual sighting.The three main characters, Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as rational scientist Matt Hooper, and Robert Shaw's grizzled man-of-the-sea Quint, offer three very different personalities with different emotional trigger points. The deft editing produces constant mood switching that keeps us on the edge of our seats for all of them, plus some puppy dogs and a young-and-beautiful surf set to pull in anyone not moved by the more high-minded heroes. A severed arm is discovered on the beach in a warm community context. Our nerdy policeman is visibly upset.These superb performances are supported by inventive camera-work. Look out for the moment when Dreyfuss, getting a shoulder-rub from his wife, witnesses a shark attack on the beach. The camera tracks forward while zooming back so Dreyfuss' image stays constant but the perspective changes suddenly - it's as if the background closes behind him. This disorientating effect (famously used by Hitchcock in Vertigo) prepares us with stomach-churning anticipation for a glimpse of the shark.Together with The Exorcist and Star Wars, Jaws heralded the advent of the modern blockbuster. Released on multiple screens without the usual word-of-mouth advertising, going to see them became a cultural necessity. Jaws is a well-made, nuanced, gamble of a film that paid off handsomely and also assured Spielberg's future. The era it heralded also, unfortunately, opened the floodgates for much less worthy films.Many years on, Jaws still has the power to thrill - and perhaps make you think twice when going skinny-dipping.",

            "content": "Jaws is a classic in the thriller genre that is directed by Steven Spielberg and it is the film adaptation of Peter Benchley's story. This film follows a sheriff dealing with shark attacks in a tourist town as he struggles with a mayor who won't shut the beach down. During this he receives help from two unlikely allies that help him go after the shark.This is a simple plot and while it isn't the greatest nor the most intriguing, it's made up for by heart-pounding moments here and there, made all the more suspenseful by John William's haunting soundtrack. These suspenseful moments serve as a way to build up the mystery of the terrible shark, making for an even greater reveal when the viewer finally sees the shark at the end of the film.Besides the technical aspect of this film, this film is also ahead of its time because of its moments of suspense and pure terror that were unlike any before its time. Not only is it ahead of its time, but the moments of suspense and terror makes it a film that holds up well today. The casting in this film was well done, especially in the three main characters ( Martin Brody, Matt Hopper, and Quint). Each of these main characters give great performances that make for some excellent character development. While this film is mostly classified as a horror movie, it has a great balance of suspenseful moments, light-hearted humor, and even some unexpected monologues. This film has great pacing that builds up for a fantastic final act and has very few negatives that aren't usually noticeable upon the first viewing. All of this makes for an easy 9.5/10.",

            "content": "If you're a filmmaker and you've made what turned out to be a \"summer blockbuster\" since the summer of 1975, then you owe a debt of gratitude to Steven Spielberg. \"Jaws\" is not only an amazing film in pretty much every way(OK, the shark is phony looking, but it's not like they had CGI or Stan Winston), it is the movie that redefined the way movies are marketed, not mention it raised the bar for filmmakers everywhere. \"Jaws\" could easily have been a mess, what with the budgetary constraints, uncooperative islanders, bad weather, untried methods and relative inexperience of it's director. It could've been remembered as one of movie history's greatest blunders, or worse, not remembered at all. Steven Spielberg, however, chose talent over star power and the power of suggestion over shock value and gave us a masterpiece, not just of horror and adventure, but of true human-factor driven movie magic. It's not the shark that makes \"Jaws\" great, though it serves it's purpose just fine. It's the characters. It's the knowledge that, this isn't some alien planet or time long past or yet to come. It could be anytime, anywhere, anyone(assuming that you live near the ocean). Sharks are real and the events described in \"Jaws\" are not at all far removed from reality(i.e. - New Jersey, 1916, the Mattewan Creek incident, Rodney Fox, Henry Bource, etc). We've seen the startling images of massive great white sharks leaping from the water at 30 mph to rend some unsuspecting seal into shreds of torn flesh and shattered bone. We've seen the scars of the survivors. Aside from that, we've all felt out of our element, up against things we don't understand and fear, just like Chief Brody. Many of us have felt the drive to fight and win, regardless of the cost to ourselves or others, like Quint. Some of us have rushed into danger, brimming with confidence and know-how, only to be defeated by something too big or powerful for our skills, like Hooper. \"Jaws\" is a very human tale, giant carnivorous fish aside. There is also the technical aspect of \"Jaws\". Verna Fields' masterful, Academy Award winning editing, cutting in all the right places to heighten the tension or magnify the emotions. There is the incredible, unforgettable and oft-imitated score by the great John Williams. His massive, pounding shark theme is forever linked, not just to sharks, but to the dread of what's beneath you, unseen, ready, waiting and hungry. Then, of course there is Spielberg himself, giving us images of naked flesh from below, unaware of the unseen beast stalking from below. Images of children playing as one of their own is torn asunder in massive jaws, no pun intended(well, maybe...). The image of that fin, cleaving water like a blade cleaves meat, moving towards a helpless victim. Spielberg waited, giving us teasing glimpses of his behemoth so that when it is fully revealed, our imaginations are already primed and giving us our own ideas of what the monster looks like. It is both a joy and a jolt when the titular beast breaks the surface before Brody, scaring at least two years off of his life. \"Jaws\" is a great film, pure and simple. It is funny, exciting and frightening, all at once. It is a standard by which others should be measured. I assure you, though, if you wish to stand up next to this masterpiece, you'll need a bigger boat.",

Just single, huge theaters where u had to wait online for an hour. And get the real movie experience of seeing it in the theater with 500 other people. And boy, was it scary. Still remember a girl a couple rows in front of me chucking her popcorn in the air when that head pops out in that boat scene. Now many years later, i finally caught in on cable (real cable, not those bs channels that have commercials every 5 min. and there stupid pop up add adv.) And it still holds up. Great acting all across the board. The filming is perfect. I even tried to look for flaws in the shark itself, and it looks real to me, with the one exception of the scene where the shark land on the back of the Orca and starts to sink it. But thats a minor gripe. Whenever i'm down the Jersey Shore, I still have this image of Quint singing the Fair Spanish lady song. For a horror movie, There are funny scenes like that also.

This is the movie which made the line \"We are gonna need a bigger boat\" one of the most iconic lines in all of cinema. The soundtrack of this movie is one of the most influential and has been imitated by numerous other musicians. Jaws revolves around the life of a police chief whose duty is to ensure the safety of the people swimming in the water. Due to a killer shark who manages to kill two people, chief Brody tries to close the beach but is not allowed to do so as the people in that area are dependent on the tourists in order to run their business. However, due to the death of another person, the beach is closed until the killer shark is captured. A fisherman volunteers to do so in exchange of a hefty reward. After that the chief, fisherman and the marine biologist who was called in for his expertise on sharks. Now, on the boat we witness some of the most thrilling scenes seen at the time it was released. The soundtrack heightened the suspense which made it all the more riveting to watch. The film features a number of unusual camera angles which is a testament to the perfectionism of Steven Spielberg. The movie is well-known to have gone well over budget and also exceeding its production time by 100 days. The final product though makes it worth the wait and Jaws propelled Spielberg into stardom. Jaws must be watched by one and all but be prepared for one hell of a ride.",

Being born 13 years after it came out, I wasn't aware of the amazing impact the movie had in the seventies. But after seeing it, I can imagine what the impact was. I remember watching it when I was 8. BIG MISTAKE!!! I was probably thinking it was some monster from a Disney movie or something. That movie scared the living ***p out of me. I'll admit that I still can't swim in water were you can't see the bottom. The price I had to pay for watching it as a kid. Oh well, I wasn't a avid fan of the ocean anyways.But I bought the movie some years ago and as a teen I enjoyed it thoroughly. Fantastic thrilling music, great actors, great setting and off course a great director. Deep Blue Sea is an okay movie, but if you want to see a good shark movie, watch Jaws, don't think, just watch Jaws. Trash such as Shark Attack, Megalodon and all that other junk is absolutely a waste of time. And to join the discussion about sequels, Jaws 2 is okay, but don't watch the rest, it's kind of silly.

I've noticed this is many of his films but it is most obvious in this. Spielberg can turn an audience from crying with laughter to jittering with fear in a matter of seconds and that it why this film must be admired.I normally try to come up with some sort or criticism for a film no matter how good when writing a review, but I honestly cannot think of anything except that it didn't win more Oscars, although if I'm correct it was up against One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest another fantastic film that stole all the awards.Jaws is a perfect thriller, action, comedy, horror, romance film in which you surrender you emotions completely to Spielberg and can lose yourself for two hours of pure enjoyment.9/10",

This is where it all began, all those movies on sharks, and oceanic predators; god knows how many people from the film fraternity as well as from the pool of ordinary spectators got their dosage of inspiration right here.In a way, this venture revolutionized the entire industry from the inside out. It transformed people's viewpoints and beliefs on what could be achieved with a little ambition in your heart. And it is needlessly to say, Steven Spielberg not only was the quintessential catalyst behind all these reformations, but he also made a ton of crucial contributions to this industry or to this medium of 'Cinema' in general, which I believe will keep on bearing fruits for the eternity.Now coming back to the film; while I may not put it on my all-time favorites list, I can see why this garnered so much love and appreciation from the audience. Despite having a simple, uncomplicated narrative, it managed to keep us thoroughly engaged for the full duration. It is fraught with tension, anticipation, and a bunch of unforgettable moments (Like when Hooper located the dead body inside of the sunken boat).Nevertheless, it had its fair share of issues as well. For example, following such an incredible build-up, the concluding act seemed to have dragged on for too long. While the characters themselves had some interesting stuff to share, all their emotional availabilities came about missing. Maybe it's just me but unlike Steven Spielberg's other works (the likes of Jurassic Park, E. T.); I could not seem to establish any personal connection whatsoever to any of these personalities, let alone care for them!",

            "content": "I admittedly think Steven Spielberg is a rather overrated director - he seems to make quantity over quality - but boy, this film certainly falls into the quality category, and we need to remember this was one of the director's first few movies.It amazes me that we got such a great film when there were a lot of problems on set, the most significant one being the mechanical shark not working properly. I believe they also weren't on schedule and definitely went over budget for this film. Spielberg was very clever to compensate for the mechanical shark though - he turned to suspense, a la Hitchcock, to frighten the audience by not actually showing the shark until halfway through the film, which was a brilliant decision. Who knows? Maybe the film would have seemed more quirky if more of the mechanical shark was shown if it wasn't malfunctioning.The character development of Brody is simple, yet really strong and smart for the context of the movie. When you're up against a giant shark to defend an island community, what a train wreck it is to be afraid of the water. At the conclusion with the closing line \"I used to hate the water, I can't imagine why\" we know he's come full circle - if Brody can take on a monster of the sea, what makes you think water would still scare him?Jaws also has some really good humor, a lot of it stemming from the character played by Richard Dreyfuss. The quirky shark-studier is a great character to balance out the tension between a man who wants to protect his community and a man who has a personal vendetta against sharks - who by the way delivers one of the best monologues in film history.One thing that bothers me is that Brody is blamed for the first couple of victims when the mayor of the town puts heavy pressure on Brody to keep the beaches open in order to turn a profit. It doesn't bother me in the sense that it is a bad aspect of the film, it just seems unfair, and you sort of sympathize with Brody since he wanted to protect the community and he let the community down. If anything, this is a great aspect of the film if it gets you to sympathize with Brody like it did for me.Even though this film is PG, maybe hold off on showing it to kids (unless they close their eyes at certain points) as it can upset them easily - I was terrified of Quint spurting out blood at the end of the film as a child. In general though, this is a movie everyone should see in their lifetime.",

Do not get me wrong, the novel is a classic. But the novel had a of very slow parts and if they were put in the movie, it would have slowed the pace right down.A lot has been written and said about the troubles during the production of the movie. It has all being well documented. And the main issue was that the shark was not always working. As it turns out, the shark not working saved the movie in a lot of ways. We would have not got the suspenseful scenes such as the Orca chasing the barrels to use as an example. There might be some errors throughout, but to me this movie is flawless. From the actors wonderful performances, from Spielberg's directing and you cannot forget (and will forget) John Williams score for the film. The main theme for Jaws still sends shivers up my spine to this very day.Not only is this the BEST shark film ever made, but also one of the best movies ever made in my opinion.

Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss played their parts extremely well, as Brody and Hooper, but the man who should have won best actor was easily Robert Shaw. He greatly illustrated the part of Captain Quint, the salty old sea captain from years back. But the entire last half of the movie was definitely the best I'd ever seen. The scenes from the Orca were great, and the parts of the actors balanced out the movie. Scheider provided the worrier, the easy-to-panic man who's scared to death of the ocean but bravely steps up when he's the only one who can kill the shark [Smile you son of a -----! :)]. Dreyfuss gave the comic bits and the memorable lines, and Shaw, of course, gave the movie the best actor of the decade in my opinion. Jaws was the basic summer film; shark attacks, the chief police officer acts in the town's best interest, the mayor tries to stop it, and before we know it we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis not unlike the 1916 conflict that actually occurred.

            "content": "In 1975, the first blockbuster was born (it was the success of the film that led to the coining of this expression), the film \"summer\" event in the USA and a new model of exploration of entertainment cinema, a model that, in a more vulgar and diluted way, persists to this day. But what really matters are the lasting power of what we see on the big screen or small screen. Jaws is timeless classic in its tension, suspense and uses the power of suggestion to the fullest.Producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown bought the rights to Peter Benchley's book \"Jaws\", they were left wondering what to do with that material that seemed to be impossible to film, due to the complicated conditions in filming something that happens a lot of time. In the open sea. But the idea of taking Benchley's text to the cinema seemed like something I couldn't refuse; and so, they decided to go ahead. That's where Steven Spielberg entered the picture. One of the masters of cinema was not yet the \"trustworthy\" director we know today, when he took over the helm of \"Jaws\". Having previously done only one lauded direct-to-film work (\"Mad Escape,\" 1974), Spielberg still needed to prove he was really good. Demonstrating talent in his debut feature: \"Cornered\" (1971), the then young director just needed a project that would reach a wider audience and project him to fame.The story begins with the fateful death of a young bather, victim of a surprise attack by a huge white shark. After the incident, the chief of police, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), believes that the most correct thing would be to close the beaches in order to avoid new deaths. However, the city's mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), decides to keep them open in order to prevent the financial impact that such a measure would entail. Then comes a new attack, forcing the police to turn to a specialist, oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), who when analyzing the case reinforces the need to keep citizens and tourists away from the water. Experienced shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) offers to kill the beast for a reward, but as no effective measures are taken, more deaths follow.Spielberg chooses to follow an approach similar to that of \"master of suspense\" Alfred Hitchcock, using camera movement to simulate the creature's perspective without initially exposing it. In fact, it is precisely the choice of such angles that gives the creature an almost supernatural character, generating a constant feeling of dread and apprehension in the spectator's unconscious. Carl Gottlieb's screenplay, co-written by Peter Benchley, who had written the novel of the same name the year before, is linear, with no digressions. Shark attacks resort island. Police officer sees the threat, but fails to convince the mayor of the impending tragedy. Tragedy happens. The policeman, along with an oceanographer and a veteran fisherman, sets out to hunt the huge creature. In less skilled hands, something like this would have become a made-for-television trash movie. Spielberg takes the obvious and traps his audience in a deadly and hopeless hunt.And the director's greatest weapon, in the arduous process that was the production of this work, can be encapsulated in just one word: sound. The opening sequence I have described is the obvious sign of this. Shark's sound architecture literally replaces the creature. The soundtrack composed by John Williams is without a doubt the most memorable element of the entire feature film, especially the theme track of the shark attack, whose legacy transcends the film's audience, making it possible that even those who have never had contact with the work meet the iconic melody composed of only two notes.And Spielberg still makes a point of marrying all the sound work with visual details that hint at the shark's presence without actually showing it. Spielberg was forced to do more with less, he couldn't show the creature much due to the numerous problems with the mechanical sharks and the way he found to get around this mishap was precisely to make a thriller movie, which only suggests that the creature is close, showing it very punctually, always in pursuit, similar to what he had done in Cornered. With the animal's point-of-view shots, alternating between focusing on beachgoers ignorant to danger, Spielberg makes it very clear what is about to happen. In the opening scene we know that the attack is imminent, such is the effective simplicity of the direction. When the attacks finally occur, we don't see the being either, only the victim struggling or being swallowed by the sea, followed by a literal bloodbath, with red, practically not used in any other context (whether in the costumes or in the scenarios) of the film, standing out, thus generating the necessary impact on the audience, which automatically assimilates the shark to the danger.The script managed to adapt the novel well, taking certain creative liberties in favor of a leaner and more fluid narrative. Spielberg wanted to take the subplots out of the original book and focus almost exclusively on the shark attacks and the hunt for the creature and that's exactly what we see in the book. Shark doesn't make room for daydreams or even construction of characters other than those strictly essential for the general plot. It is an extremely linear work whose main objective is to create tension in the spectator - what is revolutionary here is not the plot, but the way it is presented in the plot.The plot is divided into four parts: the first is the attack, the second is the group's discovery of the presented monster, but no severe action is taken, the third part is the conviction of the authorities in relation to the imminent confrontation, and putting an end to the fourth part, the encounter and duel with the beast. Perhaps the film loses the range of perfection precisely because of the last part, in which the confrontation is quite lengthy, approaching almost 50 minutes. Martin Brody's character is the best worked here, the identification is almost straightforward, in an oppressive environment where the mayor ignores the attacks, and only cares about American holiday-related tourism, the character's desperation is palpable, and the work of movement is essential to pass on this anguish.Exceptions aside, there is a progressive development of characters, especially the trio of protagonists who have credible motivations that are already familiar to the general public. Officer Brody, for example, fits the typical hero archetype, readily heeding the call to save the day. The biologist Hooper, in turn, can be characterized as both the herald, a character who shares vital information for the hero to continue on his journey, and the ally, the one who is always by his side and helps him overcome challenges. The old sea wolf, Quint, follows the chameleon archetype to the letter, sometimes favoring, sometimes harming the group thanks to his obsession with the sea creature.The text never allows the spectator to distance his thoughts from the title creature, at any time he appears in the characters' dialogues, either directly or indirectly. This point is used to generate that harrowing anger towards the characters who are more concerned with the income of the small town than with the safety of bathers, an aspect that, of course, only increases the sense of danger generated by the animal. In addition, Spielberg needed to show some deaths and attacks to create fear in the viewer, in addition to regimenting the language used during the film, a crucial point for the climax to work, which depends almost exclusively on silence and \"tranquility\" to be so effective.It is also important to note how the work is constructed from very well-defined acts, which could generate a fragmented narrative, in the hands of a less talented director, but which ends up being essential for the renewal of this experience. When we see that the fountain is about to dry up, the film takes us out to sea, having its atmosphere significantly transformed, in such a way that our attention is regained before it is even lost - making it very clear how much Spielberg understands his audience.It is all these elements that engage us so much in the narrative, allowing us to reveal the punctual plans, at the end of the work, which show more than they should, evidencing the flaws of the mechanical sharks built. At this point, of course, Spielberg needed to show the creature and, in general, everything works perfectly, with the exception of a few moments when we can clearly see that it is not a living creature. Our immersion, however, is such that we do not let ourselves be carried away by it, the result of that already mentioned urgency that has been built since the first victim.That said, Jaws manages to stay current to this day and, as much as repeated attempts to replicate this exceptional thriller have been made, none, in fact, managed to capture the soul of this harrowing Steven Spielberg feature film. It is a result of all the circumstances surrounding its production and, of course, the vision of its director, who knew how to provide us with more with less, thus guaranteeing the timelessness of his work, which paved the way for Hollywood today.",

No wonder the big fish couldn't resist taking a bite!Oscars for editing, score and sound; outstanding direction by Spielberg; superb acting by Richard Dreyfuss; and a Peter Benchley story that kept your interest throughout.

            "content": "When going to the beach, most people think about strolling on the boardwalk, soaking the sunrays and enjoying the water. What lurks below the water line is probably the least of people's concerns. But after viewing this film, people might not even get close to the shoreline. Sharks have always fascinated and terrified their admirers simultaneously. With their sharp teeth, deep black eyes and insatiable appetite, meeting one in person probably wouldn't be a comfortable experience. Luckily, no regular civilian has this type of job. That is unless, there's no other choice and that's pretty much how this thriller part horror story heads in. When a great white starts making the beachgoers of Amityville its regular meal of the day, it's up to a sole Chief of Police to find a way to get rid of it.The Chief is played by Roy Scheider, who's probably best known for this role even though before this he was in The French Connection (1971). Scheider as the Chief, with a fear of water performs competently. His portrayal as a concerned man about his family and other families' sake feels real and genuine. Unfortunately, swaying people not to swim puts just as much stress on him as just thinking about it. The mayor (Murray Hamilton), wants to keep the beach open. In some respects, the mayor has good reason to (revenue wise) but on an ethical level - yeah he should see a psychiatrist. The good thing about the mayor is that it gives Scheider's character the ability to develop as the main lead, which is great writing.Helping the Chief have a better understanding with what he's up against is Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), a marine specialist who's main focus is on sharks. What's funny is that although Dreyfuss demonstrates that his character can become extremely frustrated and nervous with little issue, his actions may come off more comical than serious. That's not to say they don't entertain nonetheless, Dreyfuss is good here. Then there's Quint played by veteran actor Robert Shaw. Quint is an old sea dog who has a narcissistic attitude and enjoys the thrill of the hunt. His scenes are perhaps the most interesting because of either how commanding or mystifying his dialog can be. Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb who constructed the screenplay did a fine job at defining each character differently and equally giving them proper development.The only thing that is illogical about the story is the way the shark is portrayed. Sharks do attack swimmers from time to time, but none have the brain of this particular shark. Gottlieb and Benchley try extremely hard to characterize this shark like most others by having it perform actions close to what has been researched and is known; such as following blood trails from chum. But there are times where they slip; some in logic, while others in factual information. A logical error is the shark having what seems to be a strong memory bank. I'm not sure if they remember that much. Another example is that sharks do not attack humans intentionally at sea level or just for the sake of. We are not their diet. Also if a shark is stuck with a barb, how do they suddenly get it off themselves? Of course, when watching this, most viewers will be far more interested in the outcome, then these minor errors.The editing is tightly woven by Verna Fields so not to reveal the shark too much until the end and it's crafted effectively. Fields also edited for George Lucas' American Graffiti (1973). Bill Butler's cinematography looks amazing. The beach and out at sea shots help show how easily accessible the ocean is and how close the shark is as well. And of course, last but not least, who could forget one of John Williams' most popular scores. With a simple yet effective two-note theme, the tune that is parallel to what the shark sees when it lurks is extremely creepy. However, this isn't all, Williams also has tracks that are much softer in tone. These particular scenes involve either family related or adventurous-like moments that would seem exciting if one were in the picture. The funny thing is, the score still works if you want it to be a horror score. Overall with its small factual errors, it's still a great movie.The story is misleading about the actual behavior of sharks, but audiences will be too invested in the story to even notice. Its characters, music and suspense work extremely well for its time.",

Given this situation, it was a little hard for me to look past the cliche and overly dramatic flailing about that the actors, shark, and camera work seems to do. However, the structure of the movie draws one in, despite the ridiculous nature of the plot. We are given a clear picture of the stakes for this town, the mayor, and the people that had decided to face down the monster that terrorizes the beach. When a small town becomes prey to a large offshore shark, the mayor, a local scientist, and a sea captain team up to defeat the deadly monster and save both the towns citizens and the local tourist industry. The camera work often gives a seemingly first-person perspective of the action and gives a sense of immersion to an otherwise unreliable scenario.",

And a young director by the name of Steven Spielberg was given the chance to make the book into a summer fright film. The rest is cinematic history. By now, we all know the story, so here's the overview: A monstrously-large great white shark has come into the waters off Amity Island, feasting upon swimmers. Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) along with shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and salty fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) are tasked with hunting down and killing the shark. Everything about this movie works wonderfully from the beautiful cinematography to the fast-paced editing and the legendary Jaws theme.

This is probably the greatest action/horror/suspense/drama film ever. It has all the good elements that a film needs to hold the audience's attention for about 2 hours. The opening sequence sets the mood perfect, with John Williams' haunting score. I really do squirm and grit my teeth when that first victim gets killed. God, what a scene to start a film with! From here on, the film gets better and better. The four main characters are great. Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss, and the rubber shark all have beautiful screen time together, and they work off eachother well. (Hehehe I've lost it you think? Yes I have!) But, seriously, these four are what make the film so entertaining. And damn those critics for saying the shark looks fake! Is it just me, or doesn't it still look as good today as when you first saw it? It still scares the heck outta me! But, to me, the guy who steals the show is Shaw's crazed sea captain. He has seen some horrors in his time, and in his (mostly improvised!) monologue, we really feel close to him. He evokes an emotion that many directors feel the music must create. But he does so, without any aid of music. Bravo! This is the first, and, of course, the best film of the series. It's most likely to be THE best monster flick ever. Spielberg, directs this with an energy akin to that of the unstoppable shark. He plows ahead, until the final 'explosive' climax.    It's also a buddy movie. The three characters on the boat, at first look out of place with each other, but they soon begin to bond, especially Quint and Hooper. that scene when the two are comparing scars is priceless. Although there were many, many, many mechanical problems with the shark, this films still floats perfectly. It is a film that deserves to be owned. If any of you still havn't (for some BIZZARE reason) seen this landmark film, then do yourself a favour and watch this film, you will not be dissapointed. Without a doubt a perfect 10*! I couldn't even consider giving it anything less. This film has left it's mark on me, and probably I'll never venture into another beach alone again! \"Show me the way to go home.

            "content": "Action films simply do not compare to movies like this. Jaws is subtle, clever and at times hilarious, and unlike most blockbusters does not rely on special effects and trifling acts of sensationalism to sell. The film is about a killer shark, but for the first half of the film we do not see her - this is what makes the film great - we are able instead to concentrate on the way humans react to this unseen force. The scheming town mayor is an accurate satire on the self-important local busy-body who thinks only of the financial ruin the shark could cause. Don't miss the on going duels between the rich college boy Hooper and the working class hero Quint - it is here where some of the best dialogue appears. The first half of the film is so good one almost forgets about the shark as a physical entity, more of an abstract notion which is only conceived by the way the islanders behave. The second half is where all the action happens as far as seeing the shark up close and personal.Excellent performances from the three leads (Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss) guide us from a powerful beginning through to an adrenaline rush climax. Its not surprising to note that Spielberg's favorite scene from the film is not an effects moment nor an adrenaline rush sequence but a character scene as Quint (Shaw) talks about the USS Indianapolis incident. This scene, among others elevates the film to a height seldom equalled in other films. The claustrophobic isolation of Quint's creaky fishing boat sets the scene for a final stand off between man and man-eater. The three make an ill-fitting team and it's clear from the outset who's going to come off worse. When the final pay-off comes, it's every bit the result of two hours of carefully racked-up tension, and enough to leave the viewer heaving a sigh of relief when it's over.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",

The use of suspense is very good and the light-hearted bantering of the various semi-comical characters keeps the plot moving along without seeming tedious.That said, nearly forty-five years after its release, the gouging of the giant shark seems very cruel--rather like bullfighting. While watching the boat scenes, I could not help thinking about all of the other cruelties human beings have perpetrated against sea life: plastic pollution, oil spills, etc. The shark is depicted as a menace to humanity, when in fact (we now know) that is exactly the reverse of the true story. Spielberg does provide a bit of animal revenge when the shark kills the shark hunter, which seems oddly satisfying given his vocation. But the good sheriff actually blows up the shark, which seems incredibly gory and horrible to me.I won\u00b4t watch this movie again, but I am glad that I did, just to see how Spielberg builds suspense so masterfully.",

Even the dog, the animal that most intimately knows us and our vulnerabilities recognizes us as a better food source alive than dead -- but woe is it to something that threatens that food source! Think of the Dobermans in \"The Boys From Brazil\" who dispatch a nazi war criminal in a particularly well-deserved manner.The people that \"Jaws\" kills aren't so guilty. They just happen to meet a very large, hungry, rogue shark -- the sort that sees humans in the water as meat. The tables are turned, and Man is deposed from what his throne as the biggest, baddest predator since T-Rex. If that isn't scary, then what is?This is a very gory movie. The closest parallel is Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" in which a crazy man becomes an animalistic killer, someone out of control of his impulses, who must kill because it is his nature. \"Jaws\" has more explicit killing, with human body parts left behind and great amounts of blood. The setting is so much different from the dry land of Arizona and the Central Valley of California that one cannot see a ripoff of Hitchcock. Like \"Psycho\" this is a relatively low-budget film -- but just as Hitchcock did with \"Psycho\", Spielberg did everything right.This movie is not for the faint of heart. Neither are the crude ripoffs involving tigers, killer whales, octopuses(?), piranhas, snakes, bears, and crocodilians. The ripoffs are simply cheesy flicks that would have been best unmade.

His attempt to close the beaches is rejected by the mayor (Murray Hamilton) and it isn't long before another innocent beachgoer winds up as a victim.

And once you remember and know by-heart the thrills and shocks, Speilberg's directorial genius becomes even more apparent.  The ensemble cast of Jaws is something else.  Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are an acting threesome made in heaven whilist those based at land, such as Hamilton and Lorraine Gary, and many other of the suffering locals stand out strongly.  To sum it up everything is awe-inspiring.  The cast, the shark, the script, the directing, the techniques, the music and everything else.  Jaws is a forever unrivalled cinematic masterpiece.",

To watch this film in the cinema all those years ago when it was released was like an epiphany. I suspect that most people must have been aware of the story line before they viewed the film but quite naturally would have wanted to watch it first. The film hits you from the first second and keeps the tension and excitement throughout. Once in a while a film comes along which just bursts on to the film scene and it is immediately obvious that you are watching something very special. I would highly recommend anybody watch this magnificent creation. To the cast and crew that were responsible for this classy piece of work I would personally like to thank them all for their efforts and the professionalism and craft that they all applied in its making. Once again when the resulting film is very good the total seems to be greater than the sum of all its parts and in my opinion this is one of those films. This film has numerous added ingredients which are naturally occurring but only in the better films and it is these intangibles which make the special films special. I have never been entirely sure what all of these intangibles are but when you watch a really good film you will know when they are there.",

No matter who you are, you will love this film. Essentially the first \"blockbuster\" (grossing more than $100 million dollars) film to hit theaters, it's surprising how minimalistic the movie really is. It's just three guys and a shark out in the sea for over a third of the film. What makes the film work so well is the performances of the three main actors (Schieder, Dreyfus, and Shaw) and the editing style that Steven Spielberg used to create the atmosphere and tension in the film. We still feel the influence of \"Jaws\" even today, as it has caused thousands of people to swear off swimming in the ocean due to a fear of sharks. If you've already seen this film, you don't need me to tell you how good it is. It is, by all rights, still a film classic, and it's legend will endure for some time yet.Bottom Line: If you saw it, go see it again. If you haven't seen it, go buy the Anniversary Edition DVD.

            "content": "I was only 11 years old when I saw this film and it gave me a awareness of water safety I have never known. And from there it gave a whole new meaning about the creatures of the deep and their contact with them when you're in the water and what to do if they come your way. This movie serves as a reminder of the dangers that are out there on our beaches these days especially with the recently attacks on people.That movie was \"Jaws\". Released in the summer of 1975 and this was the movie that gave theatregoers the term \"summer blockbuster\" long before the onslaught of George Lucas' spacesaga would invade theatres two years later. This would go on to be the #1 boxoffice draw during that year and eventually received an Oscar nomination for its musical score from composer John Williams.Since this is based on Peter Benchley's novel of the same title(who would go on to put two other novels out based on monster sea creatures as well including \"The Deep\"-which was made into a movie starring Nick Nolte in 1977,and \"The Beast\"-which was made into a TV-movie about a giant killer squid)and it is about a killer shark who wrecks havoc on a seaside community in Massachusetts during a July the 4th activity fest.About the movie,what is there to say? First off,you have the elements of a good suspense thriller(which director Steven Spielburg takes cues from Alfred Hitchcock for suspenseful techniques),and one hell of an action/horror flick that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat because you'll never know what to expect next. \"Jaws\" was one scary movie and to this day it still holds that effect. Steven Spielburg's first foray into suspense garnered him status and praise as a director and he still has that in some of movies he does turned out(from the breathtaking sequences in \"Close Encounters\",\"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\", \"E.T.\",to his latest projects \"Minority Report\"and others).This is the first. A Grand Classic from the golden age of 70's cimema. Kudos to Roy Scheider(Brody),Robert Shaw(Quint),Richard Dreyfuss(Harper),and Lorraine Gary for making it happen. Peace.",

The Amity police chief Brody is the main human character. (Roy Scheider).When it becomes apparent that Amity has a problem! Brody with the help of a marine expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) take to the waters to hunt the beast down aboard a fishing vessel that looks woefully inadequate! You are going to need a bigger boat!Brodys immortal line 'Where gonna need a bigger boat!' becomes one of cinemas greatest lines of dialogue.The music score by John Williams is incredibly scary and recognisable becoming again totally associated with the film. One of the best scores I have heard.The shark effects are totally man made. Cheap but effective and long before CGI ruined films!The death of Quint is one of the most gory images I have ever watched and I've watched some sick films. Recent advances in ultra high definition and restoration add gravitas to this scene alone!Spielberg would reach global fame for this film and his great work would go on for years.Robert Shaw as Quint looks totally different to the Red Grant character he played 12 years previous in From Russia With Love.A cinematic masterpiece.

YES!Is Jaws a natural disaster movie?  YES!Is Jaws a monster movie?           YES!Some people give it a bad rap for the shark effects, but that's ok, every great ________ (movie,person, etc...) has it's flaws. Besides, the shark looks pretty good compared to some newer effects I've seen lately. I would rather have a somewhat mechanical looking shark thrashing about and splashing water everywhere, than have it drawn in like a cartoon (Sorry, that's a Deep Blue Sea reference). This movie is scary on so many levels... First, the idea of something eating people you live near is scary. Second, the fact that it's a shark (something that really exists and you could actually see one) is scary. Third, there is a possibility that nothing will be done to protect innocent lives. (that too is scary)This is my all time favorite movie and would recommend that anyone see it. Some users posted that it should be rated PG-13...  Well the movie was made in 1975, has very little harsh language, only has 5 deaths, and the PG-13 rating wasn't established until 1984, so that doesn't quite work out.This is a must see!",

I can't say enough good things about it.The first half of the movie is a horror flick with Jaws stalking his prey. The second half is an action flick with the three main characters going out to sea to hunt Jaws down.  The interaction between the three characters at the end is what elevates this movie above others.  A common complaint on horror/action films is \"lack of character development\".  Jaws succeeds in creating three characters that I liked and cared about. \nAll in all, an outstanding film.",

Later, when I watched it again for the first time in a while, it didn't scare me as much, but it certainly was thrilling. Now, having read the book it was based on, I have a fuller and more in-depth understanding and appreciation of all sides of this classic story. With the knowledge of what was missing in the movie from the book, I thought it would detract from the viewing experience. Instead, I found that the book and the film covered two very different aspects of the story, each expertly done for the utilized medium.In the book (which was released a year before the film), we find that the shark hunt is not only a matter of public safety but also infused with the politics of the island of Amity and the personal drama of a cuckolded police chief. These human elements made the characters seem more like the monsters than the actual shark did. Those who have seen the film will know that there is no affair with the police chief's wife, mainly because there's no time to cover it. Instead, the film focuses on the tense chase and destruction of the shark that terrorized an island in the midst of the height of its tourist season.What I found interesting about watching Jaws this time around was actually how Hitchcock-esque the film seemed. As Spielberg's breakout film, Jaws did have a few moments of his signature, albeit still undeveloped style, but much of it almost felt like Alfred Hitchcock was behind the camera (especially with the \"Vertigo shot\" at the beach). So much of the cinematography was expertly framed and shot that you almost don't realize that practically a third (or more) of the film is just three men on a boat. Even though I had seen this film many times before, it still is a thrilling ride up until the explosive conclusion.An excellent film adaptation to accompany a fantastic book's plot, I give Jaws 4.0 stars out of 5.",

It is interesting to note that I have seen this movie maybe ten or more times and it still delivers on acting, scenery and score with excellent directing. The premise is a good and fresh one. A rogue monster sized shark that likes to eat and kill and then repeat makes itself at home in the waters off Amity where it just snacks until they get wise and take a second look. We then are introduced to politics not solutions and before you know it, we are immersed it what appears to be a perfectly plausible premise with everyday people simple like-minded people caught every which way. That's what keep us entertained. I just finished watching it again just now and I noticed that even though I knew the ending, I waited to see every bit of it. The fine acting does that. At the time this came out, no one wanted to go swimming in 3 feet of water 10 feet from the shore as the movie shares. Why? That's where most of the attacks take place. Chilling sub-story comes up about the USS Indianapolis which was the ship that delivered the nuclear bomb to its secret destination and on the way back was torpedoed. The men who survived turned into fast shark food. Unfortuanely this was a true story. Only 300 survived out of 1100. This adds realism to the main plot quite nicely as told by Robert Shaw expertly I might add. What a pleasant way to spend 2 hours. Good movie to eat your favorite snack and have a tasty drink too. This one lives on for the next generation and the next too. Enjoy",

            "content": "\"Jaws\" (1975), if there were lyrics in the signature theme song, it would go like this: \"bor-ing, bor-ing, bor-ing, bor-ing.....\" This \"film\" is based off a novel (big shock), by Peter Benchley. I have read the novel, and it is actually better than this \"movie\"! They had a decent concept, but, it has been marred by poor scriptwriting and mediocre acting. You would think being a film directed by the one and only Steven Spielberg it would be great! But, this \"film\" has a boring and cliched story, standard to terrible acting and cheesy special effects. The story isn't a total loss, there are a few scenes that stand out. However, the rest of the \"film\" just drags on way too long. It should have focused more on the shark hunt! One thing that is a brilliant idea, I have to admit, the shark doesn't make it's first official appearance until about an hour into the \"film\". The fact that the shark stays hidden until that particular scene made the creature all the more mysterious. Therefore, it makes the scenario all the more intense. On that note, the scriptwriters were on the right track. But, I think if they followed the original novel a little more closely, or proofread the script one more time, then the plot line would have been a whole lot stronger. Maybe it was scriptwriter Carl Gottlieb that screwed it up? For those who may not now, the actual author, Peter Benchley took part in writing the script! He should have paid more attention to Carl's contributions or changes to the screenplay. As for the acting, it's standard to just mediocre. The only worthy performances come from Roy Schneider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss. Those three are the only actors who appear to actually be trying. As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they are just terrible and even a bit over the top. Now for the special effects, most of them are well-done and hold up to this day. However, the longer the shark is on-screen, the less realistic it becomes. Plus, some of the blood looks fake as well. The ironic thing is that this prop shark is more realistic than the ones in the unnecessary sequels. Usually, special effects are supposed to get better over time, but in this franchise it's completely backwards! How ironic, right? The only two positives in this \"movie\" are the sets/locations and the soundtrack. Being filmed mostly in Martha's Vineyard, in Massachusetts, it gave the \"film\" a decent atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack by the one and only John Williams is fantastic. He is my all-time favorite film score composer and this one is no exception! Whenever I hear the main \"Jaws\" theme, I immediately think of this \"film\". Plus, that theme is so versatile, you can use it for pretty much any scary situation in a movie or TV show! That's the marking of a great film score, when it's good for more than just the \"film\" it was written for in the first place. \"Jaws\" had a lot of potential, but overall, I think it was just a jumbled mess. Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite movie directors, most of the films he gets involved with are fantastic. \"Jaws\", for me, is one of his weakest films, along with \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" (2008). Still, I think I would watch \"Jaws\" over \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" any day! I am glad I saw it, but I don't think I'll be seeing it again. It's just a boring \"movie\" as a whole! I rate this \"film\" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from \"Jaws\" and especially it's horrible unnecessary sequels. Swimming in the ocean is a lot more entertaining than watching this \"film\"!",

            "content": "During the 4th July celebrations 3 men attempt to stop a dangerous great white shark from harming the people of Amity 35 years on from its first release and this Spielberg masterpiece has generated its fair share of parodies and mock ups but this picture is by far a unique piece of tension and adrenaline showcased through a terrifying ideology.The story begins with some frisky teens and when one goes missing through a point of view shot of an anonymous underwater predator does the story take a sharp turn in the right direction of family entertainment.The title sequence underwater is juxtaposed with some great John Williams music that has been talked about for numerous decades and taught Steven Spielberg the value of significant score in relation to a terrifying creature. The development over the decades has seen the director tackle the T-Rex in Jurassic Park and the fantastic boulder chase in Raiders of the lost arc, all John Williams collaborations that all have made excellent impressions worldwide, not to forget without such great build ups in tension and action, we would not have had countless sequels to Jaws, Indiana Jones or Jurassic Park.As a piece of direction, Jaws balances finely on a thriller whilst for me on first viewing, had a sense of dignified horror whilst not over indulging itself on sharp screams. It was quite surprising to see this given such a low certificate rating despite the amount of action involving blood and the motive of threat throughout.Regardless the pace is on the money, the actors do a good enough job to get a feeling of terror mixed in with their ordinary character's lives.As mentioned Jaws now 35 years old has dropped in terms of viewing pleasure for many as a source of being shown countless times but having this picture as a source of viewing infrequently makes it a guilty please in today's society.For example the rapid development in technology, especially given what has just happened with James Cameron's Avater, make this picture look timid and ordinary. But cast the eyes back to its first release and this was all the rage. Whilst the lighting is occasionally off key, particularly during the opening beach scene, there is still an impressive sight given when we eventually see the shark and how Spielberg accomplishes his feeling of authenticity through great set placement and ideology.Looking at some of the great horrors over the years they all share a same concept. Predator, hung in the background, Alien, hung in the background, T-Rex appeared when we least suspected it. Having the presence of mind to encode an unusual but equally brave creature and using it as an evil semiotic in the plot delivers so much joy and entertainment, and it is as valid here as it is anywhere.In the wave of recent blockbusters this perhaps does not have enough panache and swagger as modern releases do but this is still a tremendous excuse to sit back and be either terrified or excited by some great direction and creepy ideology.",

            "content": "John Williams score was one of the spookiest sounds that I have ever heard. No wonder that this movie cleared the beaches when it came out in the summer of 1975. Steven Spielburg has directed so many fine films, but this is his finest. He knew how to make a first class thriller just like Alfred Hitchcock did. Spielburg did such a wonderful job with Jaws because when you think about it, you didn't really see that much blood and gore and you did not see the shark until almost the end of the film. Steve shied away from using bloody special effects the way that so many directors of these cheap slasher films do today and I think that made it a better movie. He just used things like the spooky music to make you hide your eyes in fright in anticipation of what might happen. This is one of the few films that is better then the book. Roy Schider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfus make a dynamite trio. They do such a wonderful job that it is hard to tell who steals the show from who. When you think about it, they have to carry the last half of the movie all by themselves and they do it so well. I read that Shaw and Dreyfus didn't like each other during the filming, but that made it even better. I do not know if people realize this, but that speech about the USS Indianapolis that Quint makes is based on fact. There really was such a ship and Robert Shaw (who was an accomplished writer and playwright) insisted on writing this himself. He should have gotten an Oscar for this amazing soliloquy who gives. The USS Indianapolis was a heavy cruiser that delivered the uranium for the atomic bomb to the island of Tinian. On the way back, it was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine. There were 1,196 men on the ship, based on the accounts survivors gave after they were rescued, it is estimated as many as 400 may have gone down with it. The men were in the water for five days before they were finally rescued! By some sort of SNAFU, no one reported the ship as missing and they were found only by accident. After all that time, only 316 came out alive and about 100 of the casualties had been eaten by sharks.",

            "content": "When people think of what was the film that kickstarted the summer blockbusters we've had for more than forty years, they think of Steven Spielberg's Jaws. Based on the novel of the same name by Peter Benchley (who also co-wrote the movie), the film suffered numerous production problems, mostly due to the fact that some of it was shot on water, and the shark was a pain to work with. Thankfully, the ends justify the means, because not only did the movie score with critics and audiences but it earned so much box office moolah that it became the first ever summer blockbuster, forever changing Hollywood and Spielberg's career. However, does it still hold up after so many years?In all honesty, the story itself is kind of silly, as it centers around a giant man-eating great white shark that attacks beachgoers on Amity Island, prompting the police chief Martin Brody to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist Matt Hooper, and a professional shark hunter Quint. It doesn't help that the movie doesn't really depict sharks realistically and more like mindless killing machines that randomly attack humans out of instinct and horror. However, what elevates the story to better heights are the great dialogue, the splendid cast of characters, and the brilliant uses of thrills and music. The dialogue feels very natural to the kind of film this is intended to be, as the conversations come off as convincing and even intimidating. While it is obvious that they should get rid of the shark due to the horrible sins it committed, you also wonder how the characters feel in regards to said events, and each character motivation is built up with splendid lines delivered with raw emotions, high determination, and even some humorous banter. I doubt \"You're gonna need a bigger boat\" will ever be forgotten by the public it's that suspenseful of a line.Adding into that, the characters make this film all the more worth while. Chief Brody may be frightened, but he's also heavily concerned for the safety of the Amity Island residences, and his moments of bravery bring out the tough guy we wish to be on such a daring adventure. Hooper can be a curmudgeon, but he's highly intelligent as a marine biologist and his banter between the cocky and tough albeit hysterical Quint are simply hilarious. The mayor Larry Vaughn himself really is hard to deal with given how determined he is to keep the beaches afloat, but even he has concerns over when the shark will come next at some point. The other characters like Brody's wife Ellen and kids, Deputy Hendricks, and Chrissie Watkins fit their bill well enough to progress the plot and to keep the characters motivated. Add in splendid acting from the likes of Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw, Lorraine Gary and more, and you've got a cast of characters worth rooting for.Lastly, the suspense and tension in the film are what make it all the more timeless. During production, they could barely get the shark to work, so Spielberg chose to have the shark appear sparingly up until the end and use props and camera motions to suggest the shark was there to heighten the thrills. This was a brilliant move on his part, as it helps put the audience at the end of their seats wondering what will become of anyone swimming, aided by an appropriately stunning score by John Williams. The very idea of something dangerous trying to eat you in the ocean is horrifying enough, and I can imagine why this movie would give people phobias of going in the water. Granted, the shark does look more fake the more you look at it, but they still succeeded in making it threatening without showing too much of it.Steven Spielberg became a household name thanks to this movie, and it more than ever deserves its high recognition. From gripping suspense, to solid dialogue, to memorable characters and a soundtrack still remembered to this day, I think Jaws holds up today just as much as back then. It just goes to show that you can execute a silly idea into a gripping, fun and exciting thrill ride of a feature if you know how to bring it to life. So whenever you can, pick up a copy of Jaws and have a blast with it...just don't shoot a movie on water like Spielberg did.",

All three actors deliver great performances, making their characters very memorable and creating a bond between them and the audience.Underneath the suspense and fear that the shark causes, there is a subtle but good message dealing with ethics. While Sheriff Brody wants to close the beach for fear of the lives of those in the water, Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) wants to keep the beaches open as it is the primary source of money to come into the community. A good thing that comes with this is that it could have easily made Mayor Vaughn out into looking like a horrible, unlikable person, but instead it makes him out to be a leader who made a choice for the greater good of his community that turned out to be the wrong move.The best part about the film that no other film, including the three \"Jaws\" sequels, could pull off is the suspense. Originally, the shark was going to be seen more, but due to technical difficulties with it, the usage of the shark had to be dialed back. Instead, we just get glimpses of the shark when it attacks. The audience does not get to see the shark until the very end and instead all we have to work with are the brief glimpses we get of the shark and the description of the shark that is given. With that, the film adds another layer to the horror as the audience is building this horrific image in their mind of what the creature looks like. To keep that suspense, we only truly see the full shark within the last five minutes of the movie.With superb movie making and a killer soundtrack by John Williams, \"Jaws\" is a classic and one of the scariest movies ever made. How can I say it is one of the scariest movies ever made? Try going back into the water after watching this film.",

            "content": "Arguably the greatest or at least most influential \"monster\" movie of all time is a cornerstone for the horror genre. Between the sleepy little New England town, cozy beaches and homely locals, and the dark unknown that is the sea creates shear contrast thus making it all the more terrifying. Through no intentional act by the young Spielberg, merely coincidental issues with the shark robot more famously known as Bruce, the audience doesn't see the antagonist until halfway through the film. This creates suspense that is hard to match and many have used the same approach since and has some-what become a staple in the horror/thriller genre. This is a classic above genre and is the reason we've enjoyed so many other Spielberg projects since. Let's also not forget this is John Williams debut and first collaboration with Spielberg who has gone on to receive countless score nominations, even though it's arguable the Jaws \"duuudda-duuuuddaa-Duda-duda\" is his true masterpiece. This deserves to be included in the Top 100 of All Time simply for its iconic quotes, scores, shots, and of course it's poster which has been replicated countless times as well. 9.7/10",

The movie is pretty good, not that scary, but the shark is pretty creepy. Steven Spielberg always does a good job on his movies, so this one was well done. All in all, the movie wasn't great, but wasn't bad. I give it an 8 out of 10.",

Jaws is the ultimate suspense thriller, it is a magical movie because even it has enormous amounts of intensity it contains so much humour, The characters are more attaching than the ones in Raiders of the lost ark because they are more real everyday persons and they evolve with each others in a more touching way. The reason why Jaws is truly spielberg most entertaining film is that he really made the movie for us, he always wanted to make us laughed, or make us scare. He was extremely determined to create suspense.Instead of reminding us that Jaws was a nightmare to shoot, spielberg should rather remember all the advantages that Jaws brought to him as a filmmaker more than any other movies he has made.",

John Williams went on to compose many iconic film scores and the work he did for Jaws holds up very well. The story is a little thin and there's very little in the way of subtext, but that's ok as there is enough here to make Jaws a fun and enjoyable viewing experience.

You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone that wouldn't give this movie some thought before ever heading into the ocean again. This story is essentially a man versus nature tale, and serves as a reminder that although we are the most intelligent species on the planet, there are forces of nature bigger than we are.\"Jaws\" succeeds in establishing a dynamic group of characters whose interactions with one another are interesting to watch. The war veteran turned fisherman gets his rocks off by teasing the intellectual scientist, the chief just tries to keep peace to save his community...the dynamics of the relationships were interesting enough. Where I feel \"Jaws\" fails is in the story department, because although we have some interesting multi-faceted characters, the plot is still that of a B-movie. The story of a shark terrorizing a coastal community could easily have been a Roger Corman production. Spielberg manages to elevate the material to A-level status with his use of great actors and a script that fleshes the characters out more than any B-movie would attempt, and his direction produces some genuine moments of suspense, but it's predictable fare. There are few surprises for the viewer, and anyone that believes the movie will end with the shark still alive hasn't seen enough Hollywood films.I commend Spielberg for making entire generations afraid to go into the water. But nevertheless let's not forget this is a popcorn film, elevated slightly by a good set of characters.",

So a sheriff, a scientist, and a fisherman go out to hunt it down. It starts out with the shark just going around killing people. But once Martin, Matt, and Quint get on the Orca the movie officially begins. It's kind of like a part 1 and part 2 movie. My favorite part is when Matt and Quint are having dinner, and they are drinking to their wounds. Then the mood changes when Quint tells a story when he was on the USS Indianapolis.

Just as good when I saw it he first time. The standout scene has to be quints speech about the USS INDIANAPOLIS. I've watched this film many times and it always gets my full attention.

I have first seen the movie in the late 90s when it was on tv so it has the chance of childhood nostalgia...which it has a little bit but...I don't know. This time it wasn't as good as I hoped it to be. I had this optimistic look that maybe the movie is even better than I remember but it didn't do any new tricks.The movie starts with pretty small budget as we only see people on the beach that are occasionally attacked by the shark. This slowly builds tension but it isn't as spectacular as a film of this caliber (its fame) should be. The best part starts only later when the three main characters head to the sea to hunt down the shark. This adds more adventurous and thrilling atmosphere.There are two moments in the film that are legendary classic to me (and probably to everybody else): the corpse in the sunken boat, and the night on the fishing boat when the captain is telling tales of his past. As a whole the movie is not bad but these are the moments that I looked forward and those were still the most effective.Overall: Jaws is not going to my top-favorites and I think its legendary fame may be a little bit exaggerated. But it's still an interesting and exciting film, so if you haven't seen it I recommend seeing it. But don't pay too much. Try to grab some special offer.",

The movie aged well to this day and the scenes have a flair that makes the scenes of shark attacks more tense than they have any business being. These scenes are incredibly simple in their organization and concept, but are executed in a way that makes for a fun experience.The characters that are followed in this movie are an interesting bunch. The problem is that they do not have much character besides they want to hunt the deadly shark.

Yet its just as scary if not scarier.The story starts off as you all know with a great white shark involved in a series of killings.  They decide to set out to find and kill the shark. The famous quote \"We need a bigger boat.\"  Quint played by Robert Shaw was casted perfectly because you could tell he wanted to stay out and kill the shark shown when he broke the radio and i think ran the motor out purposely to be stranded and fight the great white one on one.  Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper looked just as perfect with that young and scholarly.  Although they had trouble filming with the shark it still looked real and very scary. JAWS is a great thriller and adventure story that we don't see very often anymore. Its one that i own and will cherish for years to come even though i have seen it over 20 times i still enjoy it every time i watch it. By all means avoid the sequels except the second one which is decent but the other 2 are bad.  Let me leave with this JAWS is a brilliant story told well and shouldn't be passed by.Rating **** out of **** (10/10)",

I wish 10 minutes were taken from the shark hunt and dedicated to wrapping up other pieces of the plot.",

Although Mayor Larry Vaughn would like to keep the whole thing quiet--he doesn't want to ruin the summer tourist season--the brutal attacks soon cannot be ignored, so Police Chief Martin Brody, marine biologist Matt Hooper, and grizzled old fisherman Quint go after the monstrous creature, winding up in a desperate fight for their lives.Now, everybody into the water!",

One of my favourite Steven Spielberg's films were Jurassic Park (with dinosaurs),Jaws,and perhaps some other ones (perhaps). Steven Spielberg is a genius.If you are under 16, you shouldn't see the film. Perhaps a little bit stupid of me,(I said PERHAPS)but I am fourteen and I saw the bloody scary movie. I saw it three times in total and I still like it! BE CAREFUL: it contains a lot of blood and like I said in the review:you are not obliged to see it if it scares you a lot. Actually I am not really sure, because, even if you are under-age for a certain kind of film, perhaps you could still watch it (if doesn't scarre you, of course) but I am really not sure.Don't ask me any more questions about it.

            "content": "Of course I agree that Jaws is one of the greatest movies ever made. I first saw it age 15 in a local cinema in my native Germany (dubbed of course but as is the standard in Germany - top quality)and I was blown away. I never saw anything with that natural acting approach and grandeur before that.Now after way over a quarter of a century I have seen this movie again on DVD in its original English version and here is what I have to say>This is one hell of a movie but not without some minor flaws.I mean who am I to judge Steven Spielberg... This man has got the talent for grandeur but in order to achieve this he goes for overacting in all his movies. Just watch Laura Dern in Jurassic Park or even the great John Malkovitch in Empire of the Sun. The master director undoubtedly goes for, or allows for, overacting. I personally find it annoying and distracting from Spielberg's otherwise impeccable production values. The same can already clearly be seen in Jaws. All actors are overacting. I mean all. Let's watch and judge this true classic from a 2004 point of view and we can clearly see it. What saves the movie and makes it a classic is the casting. Some actors can overact and still be great or they simply never overact no matter what the director might scream into the megaphone.Richard Dreyfuss is overacting but he is a brilliant actor so it doesn't hurt.Lorraine Gary is way overacting bordering on cheesy but we can forgive her placing her in the big picture.Roy Scheider definitely is the center point, our identification figure. Any movie with Roy Scheider in it can't go wrong. He is a wonderful actor and he just won't overact. Robert Shaw IMHO simply IS the movie. His performance is way beyond brilliant. Spielberg's first choice for Quint's part was Lee Marvin, admittedly a great actor but most likely he would haveben a poor choice since he was and is too known from other movies before Jaws.The fact that Shaw got the part IMveryHO was what turned the movie into a classic. His performance as a \"working class hero\" as the Richard Dreyfuss character puts it is simply outstanding. Shaw has no problem showing his thinning hair or taking out a false tooth. That makes Quint all the more frightening and believable. Shaw's over the top old salt with a British accent IS the movie.The fact that Quint by coincidence was on the USS Indianapolis seems a bit contrived when the film is viewed today with knowledge of the real event on captain Mc Vay's ship, but Robert Shaw makes it seem convincing and even more - the trauma he suffered makes his character seem even more believable.God bless robert Shaw. What a great actor and what a waste to see him being cast during the late 1970s in some really bad movies probably being the effect of the success of Jaws.Bottom line> Spielberg has the sense and talent to create grandeur but he goes for overacting bordering on the cheesy in some roles even until today.As soon as he has even just one top notch actor in the cast such as Shaw who can overact as much as one can imagine and still remains to good to be true(or Jeff Goldblum or Ben Kingsley or Morgan Freman who all seem to insist on the high art of slightly underacting or to put it better, a natural talent that overrides anything a director might say)Spielberg has a home run. This director has a wonderful talent for all the rest including lighting, editing, photography and of course choice of music in form of the great John Williams - maybe the best film composer alive today.Jaws is a great movie (closing our eyes to the clumsy and definitely failed fake looking shark called Bruce) and I repeat that Robert Shaw's brilliant performance must take a great part of the credit.

John William's score does an excellent job of adding to that suspense or maybe the score makes the suspense whatever the case it works perfectly.The greatest feature of this film is the great acting and chemistry between the leads, Richard Dreyfuss (Hooper), Roy Schneider (Chief Brody), and Robert Shaw (Quint).

I think I pooped my pants and had bitten off every button on my shirt from pure fear. I never have been that scared my entire life.Now I am older, but still love this movie. I know the shark kinda looks dumb with today's computer special effects. But it looked plenty real enough to a 9 year old with no buttons on his shirt.The movie was an introduction to Spielberg. It had great acting, storytelling, character development and was brilliantly directed and written. The thing we expect from him, and why I love most of his movies. My favorite scene of all time is when they are below deck and telling their scar stories, and Quinn wins with his USS Indy story. He was so horrifying telling that.I still see my friend Dwight from time to time. Over a beer we still talk about the night we watched JAWS. He gives me hell today for biting off all my buttons. But this movie was more to me then that, it piqued my intelligence. How many movies can say that. Now I got a masters in History and love studying about WWII.

Spielberg directed it pretty well (although if I'm to be really honest, I do think he did a better job with Duel overall), the performances are all good, John Williams' score is blood-curdling to this day, and the second half or so on the boat is definitely better than the first half of the film......it's just that there really isn't much to it, is there? The plot is: there's a shark. The characters are: there's a shark, let's kill it. And while you can definitely boil Duel down to this level, if not even further (there's a truck, avoid it), three things make that film better to me. One: I thought Duel was quite a bit better directed. Two: it's shorter, so it doesn't feel like it wastes any time on its simple concept, and three: most importantly, it sets up its minimal plot, and then gets on with it. It doesn't spend an hour setting up a conflict between characters I frankly don't care about before getting to the good parts.And some of that set up in Jaws is definitely effective, some of it is funny, some of it is interesting, but none of that changes the fact that to me, the plot is way too simple to justify the film being this long, and I don't care at all about the characters. If nearly the whole film had been Brody, Quint and Hooper on the boat, much like how nearly all of Duel is about David in a car, then I might have liked it just as much.But for its second half, I was thinking I would probably give it the same rating as Duel, so it's doing something right. It's just that for all it does right, there's a few things that feel...not exactly done wrong, just not bothered with all that much.That said, anyone who used to find it unbelievable that the mayor would keep the beaches open with a 20ft shark swimming around...well, it's been two years since you were proven wrong, I'm sure Spielberg is taking written apologies by now.",

            "content": "Slickly made suspense with effective attack scenes, good acting and characterisation.When viewed today, in the politically-correct 2000s, what seems bizarre in this film is the mercenary attitude of many of the characters. Few of the characters seem to experience the horror and dread that viewers of the film would probably be feeling. At worst they are in denial and are shown to be more worried about the financial effect if the beaches are closed than the actual deaths that have occurred. In all we see very little of the effects the deaths have had on others.The direction is mostly very good, with lots of great camerawork. One minor irritation is Spielberg's insistence on slotting in some brief comedy asides, and then repeating them in case we didn't get it the first time.\nSPOILER:   The jetty scene is humorous and suspenseful at the same time. Unfortunately the awkward dubbed-in repeat of the whiny \"Can I go home now?\" is not funny and sounds out of place given that the fishermen would likely be in shock (not to mention cold) after the near-death experience in the water. There are a couple of other instances of this occurring in the film.I also thought the film was let down by the ending. The final few scenes seemed a bit rushed after the huge amount of running time devoted to showing the three hunters aboard the boat in the final third of the film. It's like they filmed all these great dialogue scenes and then thought \"Oooops, we'd better end all this quickly\". After long lives spent surviving sharks, it is like everyone realises how long the film is getting and so suddenly the characters are falling over themselves to lose their footing on deck or go for a swim and become shark food. As it is the ending seems very rushed and implausible.",

In a lot of ways this is a unbelievable film (especially how the shark behaves at times). But besides this the film is very effectively shot and  the acting is more than well. The film's score by John Williams is also very effective. I think that he's one of the greatest (film-)compo- sers that exists these days.

On a summer morning, Brody is called to the beach, where the mangled body of Summer vacationer Chrissie Watkins has washed ashore. The medical examiner tells Brody that it could have been a shark that killed Watkins.Mayor Larry Vaughn, who is desperate to not lose the money that, will be brought in by 4th of July tourists, wants Brody to say Watkins's death was caused by a motorboat propeller instead of a shark, because the thought of a shark in Amity's waters would drive tourists away from Amity. It looks like Vaughn is a mayor who puts money ahead of people's lives. Shark expert Matt Hooper believes Watkins was killed by a shark. Hooper is proved right a few days later, when Alex Kintner is killed by the shark that killed Watkins.Looking for the quickest solution, Vaughn tells the entire local fishermen to let him know if they see the shark. A shark hunter named Quint offers to find the shark and kill it, but Vaughn thinks Quint's price of $10,000 is too high. When a tiger shark is killed and hauled in by a couple of boaters, Vaughn hastily says that the shark crisis is over, but Hooper says the shark that's been killing people a huge great white shark is still in Amity's waters, but Vaughn leaves the beaches opened because all he cares about is the 4th of July tourist money.On the 4th of July, Vaughn encourages people to swim at the beach, and Hooper is proved right again when the shark kills a man, biting the man's leg off. Michael, who was in the water at the time of the attack, is taken to the hospital, where he's treated for shock after watching the shark kill the guy. Brody asks Vaughn to hire Quint to find the shark. Because his own kids were at that beach too, Vaughn agrees to hire Quint to find the shark. Quint, Hooper, and Brody are sent out to sea in Quint's boat, the Orca, ready to do whatever it takes to find the shark.Ever since I was, at least five years old, Jaws has, and will always be my all time favorite movie. Going on 30 years old, there has yet to be a film that has the amount of intensity and brilliance that Jaws has throughout the picture. Jaws more or less invented the \"Summer Blockbuster\" by becoming the highest grossing film of all time. There's has yet to be a shark film that even comes close to Jaws. They all suck basically compared to Jaws.What can be said about Jaws that you don't already know? It's the original \"summer\" movie. It was the first to raise the roof with screams and then subsequently bring it down with applause. The legacy of Jaws isn't just that of a great summer movie, but of a great movie period.The popcorn flick formula, one that has been imitated for decades, was begun with this malfunctioning mechanical shark. However, unlike most of its successors, Jaws filled the pit of your stomach with more than just popcorn; you got a nice helping of fear as well. For many, even after thirty years, it's still the ultimate event movie.While it was Hitchcock who was first dubbed the \"master of suspense,\" and it was Coppola whose Godfather first shattered records, no film up until Jaws' release in the summer of 1975 had so successfully combined movie-making, mass-audience appeal, and box-office magic. A perfect movie -- a cinematic machine that is a miracle of craftsmanship.In addition to bringing a fear of the water into public consciousness, it also catapulted twenty-eight year-old director, Steven Spielberg, into super-stardom. While Spielberg's earlier independent, film, and television work was impressive, it was Jaws that made him a big name.It wasn't only Spielberg's contribution that made Jaws what it is, it was the efforts of several people, all hoping against hope that they could turn what was becoming a disaster-ridden film into something worthwhile. From the film's major screenwriter Carl Gottlieb to the ad-libs of the actors to John Williams' perfect score. Somehow everything came together to produce a movie that was greater than the sum of its parts.Perhaps the first thing that went right, other than the decision to give Spielberg the job, was the casting. The three principle actors all gave career-defining performances. Roy Scheider (playing everyman Police Chief Martin Brody) has just the right amount of heroism and cowardice for the audience to identify with.On the opposite end of the spectrum you've got Robert Shaw (as sea-hardened Quint) captaining the Orca and giving the movie a character that'll drag viewers towards the shark when all they want to do is turn back. Finally there's the bearded Richard Dreyfuss (scientist Matt Hooper) who is the brains to Quint's brawn, the reason to his madness.The idea was simple, the execution was anything but. Despite the difficulties surrounding the production, intentionally or accidentally -- but probably both -- Spielberg and company hit exactly the right beats and pushed exactly the right buttons. The result is Jaws, a movie that, to this day, is still making people scared to go in the water. Da-dummm...*****/*****",

(OK, the whole team behind him should be applauded too, for getting this together.) It still stands out, as 40 year old piece of film, and matures continuously like a fine wine. Still watching It from time to time, one can always find new angles to enjoy. Born this summer, I never saw it fresh, of course. But I can imagine the hype it represented 1975. Nevermind the fake shark's failures, or the sometimes deficient facts of the script, the luck of the casting is what really stands out. Without the grumpy Robert Shaw it would have been a complete different movie. Without Richard Dreyfuss as the logical, sensitive marine Biologist it would not be the same, too. Roy Schreider's sheriff of the Amity Island struggles with both family and the city community for keeping the people \"out of water\". You can easily find extracts of yourself in all of the three men: Stubborness, fear, insecurity, resignation and anger. That is why I like this movie so much. Watch it with Brody's eyes, next time with Quint's. The other next time with Hooper's. And another time with the Mayor's? Just never, ever buy the fact of some kind of a smart shark.

The disastrous watershed of `Star Wars' and the dumbed-down 80s lay ahead. `Jaws' marks the final flowering of the mass-market Hollywood genre movie as high art.Like the best of the Westerns, this film resonates with the myths of the Old World. It is Homeric in form: the internecine squabbling on land in the film's first half is the `Iliad'; the testing of Brody at sea in the second part, the `Odyssey'. (`Show me the way to go home', he sings in his cups.) The great shark is the monster threatening the community that, like Theseus or Oedipus, Brody must sally forth to slay, testing and discovering himself in the process. There is something of Athenian tragedy, too, in the veiled and grieving mother who curses Brody at the dockside. Every hometown in America had its Mrs Kintner during Vietnam, and the guilt of that war \u0096 barely past when `Jaws' was made \u0096 is surely the film's deeply coded subject-matter. `Amity, as you know, means friendship', intones the corrupt mayor, a small-town Nixon with a taste for horrendous polyester sports-jackets; yet its good burghers collude in the sacrifice of their children for the sake of a quiet life and an honest buck, and \u0096 as in Ibsen's `Enemy of the People' \u0096 disown the decent citizen who tries to blow the whistle. In a sense, Amity/America has conjured the predator into being. Quint's grisly yarn (scripted, it is said, by an uncredited John Milius) of the wreck of the USS `Indianapolis' \u0096 the film has a kind of out-of-body experience at this point \u0096 implies that this is Nature's revenge for the sin of Hiroshima (`Anyway, we delivered the Bomb'); as if the shark, cheated of full atonement in 1945, had followed this ancient mariner home, claiming him as a final (superbly gruesome) canape before sinking forever into the deep.The film is framed by the clanging of a bell upon the waters, first in the stillness of night, finally in the light of day. Rarely has the space immediately in front of the lens been so effectively used to create a sense of depth and subjectivity \u0096 often, a face in extreme close-up filling one edge of the Panavision frame, almost breaking forward from the plane of the screen. We watch the boat set sail, ominously framed by a shark's bleached jawbone in the window of Quint's boathouse; the camera glides forward, through the jagged O, after the departing vessel, as if reaching out to call it back; the next shot, eerily and perfectly picking up the flow of that movement, is a direct reverse \u0096 we look back from the boat, over Brody's shoulder and following his gaze, at same window, receding in the distance (our last sight of land until the credits roll), the jawbone just discernible as a tiny ghostly shape behind the pane. Far out at sea, Quint's haunting tale told, the shark attacks in the darkness before dawn; Brody scrambles onto deck, fumbling to load his revolver, his face lurching towards the camera, then turning aside in a moment of stillness while, in the sky behind, we glimpse, for a fraction of a second, the low diagonal streak of a chance meteor, a foreboding of disaster and a sign of grace.This is film-making of the very first order, effortlessly transcending its commerciality and genre, luminous with pity, fear and wonder. `Jaws' has featured in every `ten best' list this viewer has ever scribbled on a tablecloth. Time has not wearied it. See it again soon.",

While the scenes on and in the water provide the thrills, the scenes on dry land show and develop well-rounded and engaging characters that you truly want to root for. All three of the main male characters are superb in their respective roles.Robert Shaw as tough sea-dog, Quint is a fan favourite, however I find myself far more drawn to out-of-depth everyman Brody and science minded Hooper. With that said, Shaw plays the part perfectly and his delivery of the USS Indianapolis speech is chilling and one of the great moments in cinema.Of course I couldn't review Jaws without mentioning John William's brilliant music score. The Jaws theme did for swimming what Psycho did for taking showers; just those first few notes alone have the ability to strike fear into the minds of anyone who dares step into the water.",

            "content": "'JAWS' was directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. When a young woman is killed by a shark while skinny-dipping near the New England tourist town of Amity Island, police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close the beaches, but mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) overrules him, fearing that the loss of tourist revenue will cripple the town. Ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled ship captain Quint (Robert Shaw) offer to help Brody capture the killer beast, and the trio engage in an epic battle of man vs. nature.Where does one begin with this movie. It is an undisputed classic and changed cinema forever. If this film makes you fear the water, then I will say it did its job remarkably well. This may be a short review because pretty much everything can be summed up with the word 'great' but I'll at least try to praise specifics.And to begin praising, the story is as good a place as any. It's a simple plot: shark attacks people, people hunt shark. Nothing overly complex or compelling about that, right? Well that should be my opinion on it but the masterful way Gottlieb and Benchley wrote the screenplay, as well as Spielberg's flawless story telling makes it rise to so much more than a run of the mill thriller. It has the perfect setting: a claustrophobic boat set on the wide and gaping ocean, riding upon the antagonist's natural habitat. Everything falls into place with such precision and perfection that the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end and doesn't wait for no one. Flaw I can't, this masterful screenplay.Now the absolute perfect performances. Roy Scheider(not to be confused with Rob Schnieder; very different people) gives a absolutely perfect performance as Martin Brody. He nails every aspect and emotion of Brody and does so with such sincerity that it makes it go from great to amazing. Richard Dreyfuss does an excellent job as the more zany Matt Hooper and juxtaposes excellently against Scheider's more grounded performance. The clash of performances is excellent. Then we have Robert Shaw's staggering performance as Quint who also has a distinct style of performance which distinguishes himself from Scheider and Dreyfuss. A trio of excellent performances is what sets this movie apart from the rest. Supporting performances from Murray Hamilton(Mayor Vaughn) and Lorraine Garry(Ellen Brody) also help the movie and help support the characters.Speaking of the awesome characters, they are why this movie is great. You watch the movie because of the shark at first but you only love the movie(and possibly rewatch) because of those excellent characters. Brody is, at first, the no nonsense chief of police but soon evolves and mellows out. As stated prior, Hooper is the zany 'sidekick' to Brody. Hooper is our resident shark expert but is also undeniably enjoyable to watch. He has a level of energy and intelligence that makes him such a great character. And then we have Quint. A roughened shark hunter who we slowly see grow and learn to respect his colleges. This trio is undoubtedly on of the greatest series of characters put to film purely because they are so distinctly memorable and likable and all their arcs have meaning. The cinematography and editing for this movie are both awesome. It deserved it's Oscar for best editing. People laugh at the visual effects of the shark but considering it was 1975, I'd say they were god damn fantastic. Realistic? Not by today's standards but the effort put into it and the ingenious methods of how the shark was handled give it a sense of wonder. It doesn't hold a candle to what we have today but just remember it was made 42 years ago, as of the time of writing. What can I say about John Williams' iconic score that hasn't already been said. It's intense, scary, frightening, it perfectly encapsulates the movie and its tone; it is probably the best score in cinema history and I don't say that lightly. If it didn't win the Oscar, I'd have been rioting in the streets. It is so simple yet so chillingly effective; it is flawless.I highly recommend you see Jaws, it is an undisputed classic. It features excellent acting, storytelling, effects, a masterpiece of a score, great cinematography and phenomenal characters. What more could you possibly ask for in a movie? Seriously? If you haven't seen this movie, you simply must; it is awesome. I'll rate this movie a flawless 10 Bigger Boats out of 10.",

Roy Schneider Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw star as Chief Martin Brody, Matt Hooper and Quint who are on the hunt for a great white shark! This film set the standard for motion picture blockbusters today for goodness sake! Steven Spielberg is a director with one goal in mind making a really entertaining movie and he always delivers the goods in every movie he has ever directed! The scope of the movie is incredible you never feel bored despite the fact there are long stretches of time where you do not see the shark, but the tension in this movie is incredible partly due to John Williams's outstanding score and he won a Oscar for this simple theme and to think Steven Spielberg laughed when John played the theme for the first time on the piano! HA! I mean every single aspect of the entire movie is sheer perfection every frame of the movie is meticulously thought through, some of my all time greatest scenes in film are in this movie, The Indianapolis story, the Banter between Quint and Hooper, the Virginity joke that Quint says to Brody's Wife is comic genius, The Barrel Scene where Quint goes Hooper Hopper hurry up Hopper and Hooper says I'm Going in and they think they have captured the shark the music is going crazy the trumpets and horns are going at full speed and then it slows down when they know they have failed and they have to try again and who can forget the immortal line of this historic film we are going to need a bigger boat I mean come on that is the best line in film! And I have not yet mentioned the classic opening scene which you will just have to watch but people who have watched the film will know what I Am talking about and the jump scares in this film are really effective! If you have never ever seen this film buy it on DVD now you will not regret it and it is a great film to study in film studies!",

These scenes are often filmed in counter-dives that embrace the shark's point of view. Supported by John Williams' famous music, the result is even more terrifying. By not showing everything under the water, the director makes the spectator's imagination work at full speed. Shark hunting in the second part of the film remains for me the pinnacle of cinema. Some scenes are unforgettable. For example, when bait at the back of the boat, Sheriff Brody sees the face of the squale rising from the water under his nose. Sweating, he walks back to the cabin and tells the captain in a trembling voice that the boat seems too small !",

That honor officially belongs to Duel, his first silver screen movie about a truck trying to run over a guy. After just finishing a biography of Steven Spielberg by John Baxter, I found one of the most interesting things to be all the problems of shooting this film.  The shark, while not only looking terribly fake, also almost never worked in the water. For a fledgling director, this movie is remarkable.  It's got just about everything: action, suspense, good acting, and a great storyline, thanks to Peter Benchley.  I especially liked Robert Shaw as Quint, giving an almost flawless performance.  Richard Dreyfus does a good job as the young, rich Hooper and Roy Schreider plays the movie's protagonist and all-around good guy Chief Brody well. My favorite part of the movie is the first half, contrary to popular opinion.  It does a great job of setting the tone of Amity, and we can relate with the town's struggles.  The last half is great too, however, and some of the best action scenes ever filmed are in it. This is a movie you should really see.  I have no problems with it whatsoever, except it would have been nice to have more.  Bravo to Spielberg for pulling it off!",

He really is one heck of an actor, and incredibly underrated.Richard Dreyfuss over-plays his role and pulls it off very nicely. He is funny and in-your-face without ever being annoying.Robert Shaw . . . . he over-plays it and . . . well, he's like a cartoon character. I have never ever liked him. Firstly, you can't even here a word he says, and when he does say something half-audible, it's a loud of old clich\u00e9d nonsense.He is the only dodgy thing about this movie (well, apart from Bruce, of course).

Half on land, and half at sea, the film is as much from the horror genre as it is adventure. The concept of filming from water level and from the sharks POV, combined with the infamous score and spot on acting, Jaws is sealed if not fully digested into our memory banks. 35 years later the script still holds my attention and the terror returns with almost every shot of the enemy, both \"Bruce\" and \"Quint\", sans the obvious mechanics of the shark and drunken machismo of Robert Shaw. The trio is filled out by Roy Shreider Richard Dreyfus and the voices of common sense and oceanic reason and the tension between actors is only overtaken by the drama of the adventure at sea.

However, when I got older, I finally decided watch it in full. Now of course Jaws is known for being the first film to ever make over 100 million dollars, and starting the summer blockbuster. So I respect the film for that, but is it good? Yeah, I think it's pretty great.Now it's not perfect though, it isn't my favorite Steven Spielberg movie as it is for most people. For one, while I like the main trio, the rest of the cast are kind of forgettable. Brody's wife, the mayor, the kids, their all good, but the reason everyone likes this film is for the main three. You will have to stretch your suspension of disbelief a little far near the end. I can handle not being slowed down by three barrels, but jumping up onto a boat is a little silly. And the film, while still great, has defienently aged. Some of the effects are dated, and of course now we know that sharks usually won't attack people.But is this movie scary, yes it is. It succeeds in not only scaring you in the movie, but after the movie. Imagine your in water at night, all alone, and you suddenly feel something touch your leg. How scary would that be. The first scene is pretty hard to watch, and the film shows guts by killing a kid. The three main characters are great, they're funny, likable, have great chemistry, and I didn't want to see them die. Although Quint did get a little aggrivating with the whole \"no radio\" crap. And this is one of the few adabtations that is actually better than the book it is based on. Getting rid of plot points that didn't need to be there. And while I complained about some of the special effects being dated, most of them still look really good. And the fact that they don't show the shark often actually helps the movie.Jaws isn't my favorite Spielberg movie, but it's still a really great film. It's scary, funny, has a trio of great characters, and of course, started the summer blockbuster.",

It is one of those movies it is very difficult to write a review about, as so much has been written by now about the film's considerable merits.Set in the coastal island town of Amity, he film begins with a gently teasing sequence in which a skinny-dipping young girl is seized and dragged underwater by a mysterious sinister prescence.  Her remains are washed up on the shore the following day.  The local police chief Brody(Roy Scheider) registers the death as a shark attack.  Much to his frustration, the authorities refuse to acknowledge the existence of the shark.  As Amity is a tourist town, the council are afraid of the impact it might have on the summer season, the source of the town's income.  When they cannot the existence of the beast lurking off their beaches any longer, they hire the police chief, a mainland ichthyologist Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) and a salty local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) to hunt and kill the shark....It is a well-known fact by now that the technical aspects of the film came about largely through necessity and lack of the kind of technology that is easily available now.  As a result, Spielberg did not show the shark for much of the film's first act, preferring to emphasise it's prescence through POV camera shots and John Williams pounding score.  Without CGI, the producers had to build a 25-foot shark replica.  It's easy to scoff at how fake it looks, but of all the models used in the \"Jaws\" movies this is easily the most convincing.The film is well-staged and edited throughout.  The shark attack scenes are very carefully played and built up and a minimum of gore is used.  The dialogue scenes never drag, but slowly linger on certain characters allowing their flaws and idiosyncracies to show.  The final hour in particular is brilliantly staged, weaving in character development with the ever-impending threat of the shark.The script departs significantly from the Peter Benchley novel on which it's based.  This is especially true of the man vs. shark final hour, the very action-movie ending upsetting the author so much he had to be thrown off the set.  Other than that, dialogue is well-written coming naturally while simultaneously developing the characters.  A key scene in this respect is Quint's eerily told USS Indianapolis monologue.The performances are all first-rate.  Scheider is a find as the down-to-earth Everyman hero Brody, and Richard Dreyfuss gives a brilliantly nervy performance as scientist Hooper.  Stealing the film from both these two fine actors are Murray Hamilton as the town's greedy spin-doctor Mayor and Robert Shaw as likeable, but in the end embittered and bloodthirsty Quint.A standout classic film, one which it's three sequels hadn't a hope in hell of equalling.",

It is not a worthy setup for the second half, in which the film comes into its own. With the three men on their boat and the shark in the water, the tension is high, the dynamic between the men and its development under pressure is fascinating, and the shark feels genuinely mysterious and menacing, particularly with the clever minimisation of visual contact with the model. The ending doesn't quite do it justice, but on the whole the second half is a damn good yarn, and makes the film worthwhile on its own. Iconic.",

A real run of the mill movie by the time I seen it, so even though I was so young and on my own, it was ok to go in and watch it.  I ran out of the cinema and back to our apartment when I seen the head scene.  I had nightmares for weeks afterwards.  Since then I've seen this classic countless times and I enjoy it every time.  There's just something about the atmosphere in the film that I find infectious.  The casting is the most natural I've seen. Each of the main characters is so believable, different and interesting in their own way.  A tired middle aged cop from New York, a young rich scientist in love with his work, and an old weather beaten shark fisherman with scars to remember most of his encounters. I've yet to see interaction like this between 3 actors. The love\\hate atmosphere on the boat is just gripping. I bought the DVD version for my kids.  I'd rather the original because in the DVD version in the scene before they sing; `Show me the way to go home', the whale sound effect is smudged out and replaced with a more 90's politically correct whale sound.  I thought the original effect added much more to the atmosphere of the film.  But it is cool to see it digitally touched up.  And what about the Score?  Is there a more memorable score for a movie?  Space Odyssey 2001 springs to mind but even that masterpiece borrows from the classical world.  That music was not written for that film. I loved the book too, but I have to say the movie is better.  I know it's strange but it's true.  I love movies but I've yet to get the same level of enjoyment from a movie as I did from Jaws.  And that includes E.T., Close Encounters, Star Wars and so on.  Jaws is a marvel. I'm glad I was so young when I first seen it because it probably wouldn't have had the affect on me that it had had I watched it at an older age.  Ok in hindsight and if you like nitpicking you can find a few things wrong with this film.  Like the missing chair after the scene were they caught something with the fishing rod, or it wasn't really summer when the filmed it.  Big deal!  Movies like this are about imagination aren't they? These inconsistencies had to be pointed out to me before I could see them for myself.  In my opinion a good movie with no directing or editing errors is not what makes it good movie. Jaws is King and very underrated in my opinion.",

One thing in particular I like is a lot of the movie is just talking, and if you've seen the film you'll notice a lot of the seemingly meaningless throwaway lines are actually important and are some nice foreshadowing. The animatronic work is also done incredibly well for the shark and it does actually look pretty damn real. The first half you feel the uneasiness grow as the shark takes more and more victims, once it gets to the second half and it's all about chasing the shark it turns into a much more action-packed and is much more character-driven as you find out more about the Quint as well as the other two. Something I like about this film is that while Chief Brody doesn't say why he's trying to hunt the shark you can tell from earlier interactions in the movie that it's actually because of his family and wanting to keep them safe. I truly enjoyed some of the long take action camera movements and the dolly zoom on Brody at the beach is iconic. Loved seeing this one again, when I was 10 I tried watching it and I got super spooked so I turned it off 10 minutes in. The second time I watched it with my mom and I enjoyed it, coming back to it for the third time was incredibly interesting. Also, DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN oOooo~ DUN DUN DUN DUN... DUN!",

Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss are great as three very different men all going on a shark hunt.Where it kind of falls apart just a little bit for me is when they're actually on the boat. It takes up almost half of the film, and what we get is a long montage sequence of them just shooting a bunch of stuff at the shark and trying all sorts of tricks to get the shark. It's engaging and entertaining, it just kinda drags towards the end up until the climactic finale finally reels in the catch.Obviously a milestone film that comes with a recommendation from me.

The movie may be full of factual errors, but unless you are going to sit and analyze every second and write down a scientific comment, you shouldn't care. Just sit back and relax in a comfortable sofa with a bowl of well-salted popcorn and let the movie roll. That is with no doubt one of my personal Friday evening pastimes. I must have seen the movie at least something like thirty time by now, and it is just as good every time.This movie makes you laugh, makes you jump to the roof, makes you bite your nails and makes you sit on the edge of your seat with your eyes wide open. Some scenes must have been really scary to see in a cinema once it came. 'Course, I wasn't born then, but the movie holds its position still today. It will be remembered as a trend-setting horror adventure. With great direction from Mr. Spielberg, a thick and robust production from gentlemen David Brown Richard D. Zanuck, coloring script from the guy who wrote the book, Peter Benchley, and superb acting from mainly Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. Those two make their characters shine and gives them a lot of personality. They simply put their mind, soul and heart into the work. Crikey, did I forget to give credit to Roy Scheider? Well, yes. But to be honest, he don't deserve as much credit as Dreyfuss and Shaw. He is really boring and don't add anything to his character. I wouldn't be sad if they would have him replaced with somebody with a little more color. Actually, Roy Scheider is a real bore who lowers the general impression. But don't be alarmed now, the general impression is high as heavens. Not even some robot could lower it that much.This movie is a landmark, a legend, a horror classic, a masterpiece, and it will always be remembered as that.

Like a masterpiece of a painting, almost every detail is just right.Since then, I have seen the \"Making of\" videos, and I have noted some of the details that aren't quite right:  some scenes in sunlight, some in cloud, sometimes the angles don't match up just right.

I thought to myself, \"Man, I better get this movie on DVD and watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered.\" It was definitely worth it. It brought back the action and scares of back when I first saw it back in 2007. It does start out slow, but it gradually builds up to the climactic last 45-60 minutes. I'll start out with the acting. It was great. The actors worked very well with the script, and they kept the movie entertaining the first 60-75 minutes. I will say, the beginning was kind of boring, and I was just waiting for the end hour. The end all together makes up for it though. The special effects were awesome for the 70's era of movies. How they made the shark that moves and bites down and stay in the budget of 8 million dollars, I don't know. Although, money was a lot different back in the 70's. I don't know. Anyway, Everything about this movie was pretty good, especially for the 70's, when film wasn't always high-quality like this. In fact the only reason this movie gets a 9 is because it had a boring start. I don't really know what else to review. OH! How about the story? Pretty clich\u00e9'd these days, but probably original back in '75. Today, there are poopy shark movies where they can fly, walk on land, and can stay still, and everybody who knows about sharks know they can't stay still (except one species) or else they suffocate. Syfy really messed up the killer shark genre. Like Sharknado, Super Shark, Dinoshark and 2- headed Shark Attack, just to name a few. It's kind of hard to come across a decent shark movie like this one nowadays. Anyway, I still really like this movie. I give it a 90% because it is realistic for it's time, and is one of the most creative, original killer shark movies I've ever seen.9/10",

To me, it is a little sad that the \"big\" movies no longer aspire to serious themes, but instead confine themselves to the stuff of comic books.  After 1975, mainstream movies were no longer for adults, but are instead geared to teenagers, or perhaps to the child within us. People go to the movies to see fancy special effects and get cheap thrills, not necessarily to explore interesting characters and stories.That being said, the movie that started it all is still enjoyable on its own terms, particularly the second half, when it becomes a Moby Dick story of three men on a boat chasing and being chased by a big fish.

One of Nature's most feared animals is the Shark and to create a horror film around that animal, you could guess what the response should be like. It gave viewers something to actually be scared about and that was going swimming. It had the same effect on me when I watched this movie when I was 10. I could not go swimming and although I overcame it and have a passionate love of studying sharks, I still get scared every time I start swimming in deep water (even in a lake or pond). This film horrified viewers and it is no wonder why!The acting in this movie is superb. Roy Schneider portrays a devoted and frightened cop! He fears for the peoples safety when a rogue shark starts attacking and there is nothing he can do to convince the town's mayor to call off people from swimming. Richard Dreyfuss plays a very humorous scientist who is a shark expert. Robert Shaw is absolutely fantastic. He plays his character perfectly! I feel, he has some of the best intensity of any actor when he is playing his character in this movie. Put the three together and you have a great trio that is actually quite funny.Steven Spielberg does so many things to make this go right! One, is the shark. With each attack, you begin to see more and more of the shark. Not yet being exposed to the true size or shape of the shark until the right time has come. The suspense just builds up more and more which really keeps the viewer on edge! And the third attack on the beach is filmed wonderfully! One of my favorite parts. You see the lone girl screaming \"SHARK! There's a Shark in the pool!\" and you see a lone dorsal fin out in the water. Than it cuts back to Roy Schneider beginning to run and than the good part, where Spielberg shows the size of this shark perfectly without us even seeing most of it. We see the dorsal and tip of the caudal fin slowly start to sink behind Schneider's son sitting on the beach. And the spread between that thing is incredible. When I saw that scene, my jaw was on the floor and I was crapping my pants! Spielberg just does many small things like that to make the movie that much better.And than Spielberg's and the writers usage of quotes. Lines like, \"You are gonna need a bigger boat!\" never cease to fascinate me! The suspense, the action, the entertainment, the horror, the intensity, and the humor of this film are top notch. This film is not rivaled when it comes to horror movies. It tops the list and 32 years later, this film is still one of the best. It would absolutely stun me if the person reading this comment had not seen the film. You should go buy it now! Don't rent it, buy it! You will watch it again and again!

Because of Steven Spielberg and Peter Benchley (RIP), I am terrified of them. I keep on having recurring nightmares of a twenty foot long shark suddenly jumping out of the water and grabbing my foot and dragging me under violently. Grotesque, isn't it? Anyway, back to the film. I love this film. It is one of the first films Steven Spielberg directed, and it is one of his best. However, I like Raiders of the Lost Ark a bit better.A lot of people know the plot, but just in case here it is. A savage great white shark is attacking people of Amity Island. It first brutally kills a girl in a terrifying beginning. Then a young boy is killed in front of everyone on the beach. Why no one rescued him is anybody's guess. Anyway, a man named Quint offers to catch the shark, but because of his high price he can't. Then on the Fourth of July, wait that's a Holiday, the shark kills a man and almost kills Chief Martin Brody's son. Then Quint, Brody, and Marine Biologist Hooper go on Quint's boat and set out to kill the shark. Out in the ocean the shark rams the boat and it starts to sink. Quint is eaten and Hooper is nowhere in sight. Brody blows up the shark with a gun and a air-tank. Hooper then comes back and Brody and Hooper swim safely to shore.Overall, this is a fantastic film that any fan of thrillers or horror or Spielberg will enjoy. There is one really scary scene I'd like to point out. When Hooper is searching a sunken boat underwater, all of a sudden a head pops out of the boat. What makes it so terrifying is that Hooper's reaction is so shocked and the music is perfect. I'd also like to say that John William's score is one of the best scores in history. It's perfect for this film and it so simple. Anyway, I'd really recommend this film.9/10Recommended Films: Jaws Two, Open Water, and The Deep.",

The shark almost takes on a supernatural quality as he menaces the three men in their boat. Great whites grow up to 20 feet. They are killing machines despite the claims of environmentalists. Australian waters have the most shark attacks. The sequels definitely took away from the original. Hollywood needs to quit while it is ahead.",

Second, it is refreshing to be reminded that low-tech ways of creating constantly rising tension are at least as powerful as extensive views of most gory scenes. You don't need to see the monster to be scared thoughtless, and the scariest beasts live in the imagination, especially if you add just the right soundtrack.Third, there are some visually hypnotic moments, like the reflection of rapidly flipping pages in Brody's glasses that convey nicely the turmoil of his mind. Or the violent cloud of blood in the water at the very end. Beautiful.Fourth, it simply is entertaining",

            "content": "No need to bore the reader with the plot details because anyone who is the least bit familiar with this film knows what it is about. Jaws is one of those movies I never get tired of. It is still as entertaining and suspenseful now as it was when I first saw it on the big screen in the 70s. Spielberg does a wonderful job in not showing the actual shark until the latter part of the film. It really helps to build the suspense, leaving it up to the viewer's imagination as to what Amity and its people are really up against.  A masterful musical score by John Williams helps to move this along wonderfully. The score really breathes life in to the movie. The music is so recognizable today that most die-hards of the cinema are instantaneously familiar with it.  Jaws is similar to his previous film, Duel, about strife between man and leviathan, the leviathan being a truck and its faceless driver. In Jaws the leviathan is a great white.\nI feel the movie does a splendid job in showing the emotional strife that Chief Brody undergoes as the movie progresses. As the film opens, he is a sheriff who is quite happy doing his job on Amity without any real problems compared to what he once faced in his job prior to living on Amity. Then he transforms into a man under a great deal of pressure and anxiety as he encounters a problem bigger than anything he ever faced before.\nNumerous films were compared to Jaws throughout the 70s and early 80s.  It was a huge phenomenon when it came out launching a plethora of rip-offs, some good, some horrible. The movie has great dialogue, editing, music and characters that help to make this one of the classic films from the 1970s. Robert Shaw's role as Quint is one for the ages. He really brought his character to life with a memorable performance worthy of an Oscar.\nFor me, the best part of the film is when Brody, Hooper and Quint head out to sea to capture and/or kill the Great White. So many wonderful moments in the last part of the film that bring out a wide variety of emotions including laughter, tension, anxiety, sorrow and finally a sense of relief when the shark is killed. I have a friend that feels there are a lot of correlations between Jaws and Moby Dick. Bruce the Shark is to Quint what Moby Dick was to Captain Ahab. It's up to the viewer to believe whether this is the case or not. And finally, for what it's worth, all the dress jackets that Murray Hamilton (Mayor Larry Vaughn) wears in the film, including the one with the little anchors, are some of the worst I've seen in movies to date.",

            "review_title": "The film that still makes audiences afraid to go in the water",
            "content": "Never has a film had a bigger impact than the first ever blockbuster film, Jaws. The film Jaws is based off of the Peter Benchley novel of the same name (of which I have not read). The film was released in 1975 and was directed by a then widely unknown film director Steven Spielberg. This would be the film that would put Spielberg on the map. The film stars Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw, and Lorraine Gary. As stated, the film was a MASSIVE success. It performed critically well with audiences and critics and the film would perform so financially well that it became the first blockbuster film and would forever change the film industry. The film had a budget of $9 million and has made $472 million since release. The film also has music done by John Williams (which I will touch upon later).A shark has killed two people. The sheriff (Roy Scheider) of the little seaside town of Amity wants to close the beaches but the mayor does not want to so as to not lose the tourists. When another shark attack occurs, it is up to the sheriff, a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss), and a shark hunter (Robert Shaw) to hunt down the shark.Jaws is a fantastic film. Sure, I am the one who likes to not always go with the majority (where it is warranted) but the majority is right here. Jaws is how you do a film right. Without this film, you would not have big budget films that we have now and we would probably not have as many shark films either. I do not know where to begin because I would end up repeating everything that has already been said about this film. But onward I shall continue. Let's start with the acting. Everyone, and I mean everyone, does a wonderful job in each of their roles. The biggest highlight here would certainly be Robert Shaw as Quint the shark hunter. There will be scenes of him talking and I would sit there in awe and listen to every word he has to say. The characters feel human and seeing the camaraderie between our three main characters is certainly great to see. I love knowing the fact that some of this film's most famous lines were in fact improvised and that goes to show the great talent that these actors have. Next, the special effects. The big special effect is the shark (nicknamed Bruce). I hear people call out how fake it looks but I have to disagree with those. I find it fairly believable to look at. Maybe there is one occasion where you can clearly tell but it does not take one out of the film. The film here has beautiful cinematography and editing. Seeing that this is one of the first films to be completely filmed on the ocean adds a sense of realism to this film. No greenscreens, no bull crap. It is all real. Now, how could I forget the simple yet effective musical score by John Williams. The music is instantly recognizable but aside from that, it really helps build the suspense in key scenes. For the first half of the film, we do not see the shark and that is rather effective. It keeps the suspense a rollin' so when we do see the shark, it is completely worth it. This is all something that just has to be seen to be believed. I cannot say that I am 100 percent scared by this film, but that is coming from someone really desensitized by other films. When the film is not delivering suspense and terror, the film decides to help define our characters and to see the camaraderie amongst them. One thing that this film does not get enough credit for it seems, is that it accurately portrays how people in charge (of a city or town) react to some form of threat and are too numb to the real dangers.. This is somewhat relevant (especially in the days of the Coronavirus pandemic). So, yeah that was interesting to point out.Clearly as an amateur online film pundit, I cannot fully describe who great this film is. All I can easily say is that it just needs to be seen to be believed.",

His clever way of slowly introducing us to the monster (in this case a shark) is well thought-out and effective. John Williams' score is excellent, done at a time he was delivering his best work (\"Star Wars\", \"Close Encounters Of The Third Kind\") and before bombast became his standard. The cast includes Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss (at his hyperactive best) and Robert Shaw; everyone is clearly having a good time, knowing they're in the process of making a scary movie with a talented mastermind.",

I used to count this among my all time favorite movies, even quite recently.  Today I watched the movie again after awhile (9 months or so?) and it's starting to look very dated and somewhat silly to me.  The first part of the film (before the shark hunt) is really rather dull and uninspired, if you think about it... nothing very interesting happens, a few shark attacks and some resort town politics.  The scenes in the boat before the finale (particularly Robert Shaw's famous speech about the Indianapolis) are as inspired as ever, but then things get very silly and unrealistic.  The shark chases the boat, purposely attacking?  A shark intelligent enough to desire revenge...?  Please -- give me a break.Overall the movie is still fun, but either I've changed recently or the years are just increasingly unkind to this film.  It no longer looks like an inspired work of genius to me, just a decent and rather cheesy mid 70's action/adventure flick.  I wouldn't expect today's audiences to get terribly excited, and am curious what the reaction would be if \"Jaws\" were released today with nothing much changed but the special effects.  I suspect it wouldn't get a tenth as much attention as it has.",

When we finally get a look at the man-eating fish, it turns out to be a machine with unconvincing--and unnatural--dewlaps that form around the corners of its mouth during rare moments when the shark is not shown chomping into tourists.  I saw this one at a tender age.  I was glued to my seat when, in the film, a beach full of terrified swimmers race over each other after somebody spots the all to familiar dorsal fin poking out of the water.  During production, the machine-shark was dubbed \"Bruce,\" after Spielberg's lawyer.  All in all, this suspenser is worth a viewing... too bad computers in 1975 weren't sophisticated enough to erase those goofy, over-lapping hinges on 'Bruce's' mouth.",

The film is suspenseful with a spooky score by John Williams to match (if you hear the music get out of the water). Many viewers are so frightened by the film that they develop the misconception that all sharks are killers and will eat them. That is true in only 100 cases where great whites do kill humans (this is actual scientific data), but this is not entirely true. There's no need to fear sharks all the time.

Well that prize goes to a little known director named Steven Spielberg and the honour of being the first blockbuster film goes to..drum roll (queue drum roll- well at least you tap the desk) please .. It is \u2013 Jaws a film that made every resident of a small town, scared to go into the water. Yes Jaws was officially regarded as the very first film to coin the term blockbuster. It was the summer of 75, and a little known director, with just $9 million in his back pocket had a little film called Jaws that he wanted everyone to see, of course it doesn't take a genius to guess what a film with the name Jaws would be about. Would be about a killer shark? \u2013 but wait your wrong, it isn't about just your average shark, no in fact it a giant killing machine shark! Ha never saw that coming did you. Well anyway to cut a long story short, Spielberg took that little known film, and with a clever marketing campaign, we was able to turn $9 million, into $450 million and became rich and successful, then he decided to release a little known film in 77 called Close Encounters of a Third Kind, which made$340 million from $20 million, then from there he became even more rich and successful then he was already. How nice for Spielberg. But what I think made Jaws so successful and a completely chilling watch, was the fact that during the entire film, you rarely actually get to see the shark full on \u2013 which abides to the rule of all good horror film, DON'T SHOW THE MONSTER!

It proves you don't have to use loads of gratuitous violence (Halloween, Scream - good movies but reliant on the visual rather than the abstract) to get your message across.Spielberg gets the ingredients spot on in every dept - the music we already know about, never has the big JW produced a more sinister motif for a movie that stays in your consciousness years after seeing the movie than this.The Editing deserves special mention because Verna Fields knows how to play with the audience, offering us brief glimpses of the horror from the deep. That's all we need, because William's score lets us know when the shark's around.The directing also is a tribute to the Big \"S\" himself. It's a pity he didn't win an Oscar, although I supposed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (its major rival at the time) won the sympathy vote. But Spielberg really does drive the film forward with a very tight script (pruned extensively from the rather bogged down & overlong \"talky\" novel) and some keen cinematography that would serve him so well in years to come.But top honours have to go the three men on the boat. Scheider, Dreyfuss & Shaw all confessed to hating the movie during production especially Dreyfuss who felt it would damage his mainstream intellectual movie status after starring in the acclaimed Duddy Kravitz which he was publicising at the same time as making Jaws.But the end result is a perfect chemistry between  the old sea dog (Quint); the eager young know-it-all rich kid (Hooper) and the ex-New York cop wanting a quieter life in the sticks but hates water (Brody).This film is still excellent  25 years on. And I still believe it carries one of the scariest moments in all of movieland - the head in the hull of the boat had everyone in the theatre jump in unison and it still makes me whince even now.My biggest regret though was seeing the shark being blown up at the end. Afterall, the shark is only doing what it does naturally and generally doesn't bother with bathers in real life. And yet after this movie was released back in the late 70s there was an instant backlash against any shark. Sharkhunters culled them and numbers dwindled, and Jaws, initially was to blame for that.Hopefully with a more environmentally aware audience these days the re-release of Jaws will have more positive effects than before.Anyway, for those who have yet to see this glorious moment in cinema history, go see it and be scared...very..very scared.*****/*****",

Its the story of a police chief who believes a shark is responsible for a number of unexplained deaths and his fight with a local mayor, who is worried that closing the resort to protect the public will destroy the local economy. \nHowever the action with the shark seems to have overtaken the rest of the narrative in many peoples minds due to the effectiveness of the shark scenes which terrified audiences at the time. Anyone who watched this movie in the past recalls the shark attacks but the main driver of the story, which was about officials arguing about financial survival versus public safety, is less well remembered. \nMany of the sequels of Jaws seemed to focus more on the shark action than narrative, which seems to have angered many of the fans of the original to the extent they have exaggerated how bad they sequels actually were. \nThe thing is, the shark scenes, driven by the now famous score were only as effective as they were due to them having a shark which looked terrible on film. As a result its screen time was minimised which added to the air of menace. \nThe cast in this movie is iconic. However many of the deaths come as less of a shock as they do in the second movie. In some cases not everyone who dies is a sympathetic character.....\nWatching this movie in 2018, this is no longer a film which is as shocking as it would have been in 1975. Horror movies have moved on and this is now seen as more of a thriller than something that would deliver real scares. As such its viewed more in terms of being a decent quality movie with great characters but the effects etc may not scare your average cinema goer. Remember this was an A rating when it was released, it was then downgraded to a PG. It will likely still scare kids but adults not so much.\nIf you haven't already seen this movie where have you been? Its a genuine classic, just don't expect it to give you nightmares like it would have to audiences in the 70s.",

The Williams score is near perfect in adding to the suspense and is even better during the less suspenseful if not downright fun and exhilarating scenes. The film is, however, very suspenseful and the relationship story among the three lead characters and how they have to learn to tolerate and work with one another is tremendous.  Far better than any other variety of mismatched partner story lines. They all have very different motivations for doing what they are doing.  Quint: Revenge. Brody: to protect others. Hooper: to study and understand.  Yes, it's scary and largely so because Spielberg cleverly refrains from showing us too much.  What is missing from all of the comments that I have read here is that one of the things that the viewer finds himself doing is trying to figure out what the shark is thinking...  It's behavior gives it so much personality that we try to understand its motives. It's not a monster.  It's the fourth member of the cast and its motivations are not at all clear.  That's what makes it so scary.  The DTS DVD should be a treat.",

            "content": "Sometimes it's not simply that a movie is great, it's also the memories that surround the first time you watched it.  For me one of those great reminisces is when my older brother Rick took me to see `Jaws' in the summer of 1975.  This was a big deal to an eleven-year-old kid.  I doubt if he remembers, but I always will.  Just like I'll remember how I wouldn't swim in the neighborhood pool for the rest of that summer after watching this Spielberg classic.\n\tI also recall the precedence that this film set in the horror genre by opening the movie with a scene in which the monster claims a victim.  This was such a revelation that I remember telling a friend about the movie and he was totally aghast at such an iconoclastic beginning.  `You can't do that' he exclaimed, `you have to have clues leading up to creature, then something happens!'  Even at that age I realized that this was shaking things up.  Soon a slew of nature vs. man flicks inundated the market and each had a creature (be it grizzly bear, piranha, etc) start the movie off with a violent episode.\n\tOf course this is a fantastic scare-flick, but the reason it has stood the test of time (and the shame of ersatz sequels) is that is more than a frightening movie.  The dialogue is smart and the characters are interesting and very well developed.  From the central troika of Brody, Hooper and Quint to lesser characters such as the chief's wife and the mayor the players satisfy and represent what we want them to.  Not to mention the clever nuances (during the scar-comparing badinage Brody slightly lifts his shirt and glances at a scar that you can tell he wants to mention, but obviously decides not to-and this leaves the moment more fulfilling by what is not said) and the side bars (the implied conflict between Brody and his wife and their current residence, the disparity between Hooper and Quint, etc) that add verisimilitude to the work.  Also adroitly included are adumbrations such as the `Welcome to Amity' sign, and Quint sailing by with a large grin as the fisherman hang the tiger shark up thinking they have caught the beast in question (we share this irony with Quint and it's very enjoyable) as well as quick scenes (the overweight lady heading into the water) that we like as we watch the movie but don't remember when later on we try to explain why we like this film so much.",

            "content": "Confined to the mere dimensions of his poster, he's a shark rising from territorial depths, bearing an almost menacing grin as he prepares to feast on a helpless swimmer. But he's long since broken free of that frame, assuming he ever needed to. He is a harbinger of fear, that great primal substance that sent people scurrying from their televisions, from their beaches and from any signs of water in 1975, and brought them back again in their rushes of adrenaline and wonder and the masochistic human need to subject themselves to something more powerful or terrifying or that which we can't entirely understand. And he still encourages this process if not in adults then in new generations who are for the first time dipping their toes into that great foreboding water. Because whatever you believe of his cinematic credibility or enjoyment, his indomitable presence cannot be understated. In that carnivorous madness, he not only ate the limbs of unfortunate swimmers, but of last legs of the old Hollywood machine and in that bloodied wake was born the summer blockbuster. In this enduring legacy he's an icon; a symbol of change and the cinematic talent that struck the hearts of enough filmgoers to bring about that. I caught this film on the TV a few weeks ago, about 10 minutes in, and put it on not so much out of a nostalgic indulgence but out of intellectual curiosity to see how I'd immediately respond to it with a mind freshened over the years since I'd last seen it. Within about five minutes, I'd downloaded the film and began watching from the beginning. I don't know what I expected. As much as this is the kind of film that you revisit frequently, playing memory hopscotch as you jump from scene to scene registering the quirks, quoting your favourite lines and waiting for those 'big' moments, whether a scare or some catharsis or triumph of character, it's still ultimately a Spielberg film and that means there's always more to discover each and every time. Great cinema is timeless yes, but his name almost guarantees the film will have a longer life expectancy. Being in a Spielberg film, we are of course almost immediately introduced to a family, and one that will be core to which the protagonist gravitates, because of course there's more than just the audience's composure on the line in this film, there's the family unit to maintain. I like how in Spielberg's '70s families exist somewhere between a 1950s nuclear family and the Wonder Years era of freedom and discord and strife that became more apparent in the domestic environment. Introducing our timeless Chief Brody, unwitting hero, the man whom I seem to recall earned much adoration from me as a child, wakes up alongside his wife, bathed in the radiant summer glow, checks the window to ascertain the whereabouts of his kids, and trades quips with his wife and then leaves. It's fairly standard stuff, but it's great in introducing the warm domestic heart of Amity, Brody's life, and the man himself. This is what is being threatened constantly throughout the film, and we take much delight in that. Chief Brody is a perfect character with which to embark on this adventure, because he's neither particularly macho or domineering or timid and inhibited. He's played by Roy Schieder with both composure and hesitance, his glasses and his patience carry a bookish reticence to him, but he's also firm and resolute, like every good hero, and I dedicate this paragraph to him because I've always been drawn to the guy. I think as a child I had some sort of Freudian complex with his character, because to me he always emanated paternal qualities. Glasses, cigarette and black turtleneck are eminently respectable. Perhaps the wife, is a little underdeveloped, as she's really more of figure of quiet domestic life, and extension of Brody's family responsibility than much of a character herself, and maybe some of Amity itself, like the Mayor (played with shady-contempt and-a-thin-fa\u00e7ade-of -beach-front- good-guy-with-that-bloody-sports-coat-of-his by Murray Hamilton who I actually recognised from an episode of the Twilight Zone), is a little underexplored, who insists on keeping the beaches open, innumerable times, despite his children also being there, but then, Spielberg knows to keep this film focused on the actual terror driving its way through the narrative, and that all the other stuff is there to keep us involved in the world and actually care beyond visceral thrill, but not start wondering in-depth about it all. It's a tight picture, and like Aliens what is does is initially suggest at the terror, which we know is there but can't be certain of, introduce us to the characters and see their dynamics unfold naturally, all whilst the tension slowly coils up, then thrusts these characters into danger, as that tension snaps violently in our faces. People may be surprised how little Jaws is actually seen, as the film taunts us with his presence and consequence but not a physical sighting and in one case the carnivorous beast becomes a floating pier, which is simultaneously hilarious and terrifying. Of course the immortal dynamic of this film is in the troublesome trio of Brody, Hooper and Quint, the latter two played by Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. The former is an animated dramatic-exposition- unloader, played to a wonderful point where he almost seems unhinged in his love of sharks, and the latter really needs little introduction, except to say that the monologue never diminishes in power, partly because Shaw in playing such a haggard and crude man is utterly arresting when he's quiet and haunted, and the silence that hangs over that seen is so heavy, and it's both a brilliant move in humanising a character and furthering the horrific mythology and possibility of this shark, and thus the sense of dread that becomes so palpable.",

            "content": "Not only did it effectively start the career of the greatest director of the modern day, (Steven Spielberg) but it became one of the highest grossing films of all time. On a personal note, I remember i saw this when i was 4years old, and it effectively scarred me for life! I hardly ever swim in the sea, and i even tend to give the swimming pool a couple of looks before i swim! On a critical basis though, i like to look at this film as the COMPLETE film. Every component in the movie is done at a phenomenal level. The music is Oscar-worthy, one of the greatest scores of JOhn Williams illustrious career-and created the cult classic \"dum-dum-dum-dum\" indicator for the sharks imminent arrival. Editor Verna Fields, also won an Oscar for the incredible editing in this movie. The camera work is expert, as well as Spielberg's genius craft in directing.The storyline of the movie is loosely based on true events of Sharks staking its claim on one area and developing a taste for human blood.The storyline follows a fictitious community known as Amity Island, in the New England area. Local Chief of police Martin Brody locks horns with the local Mayor, whom refuses to heed the claims there is a Shark. The mayor (Murray Hamilton) wants to keep revenue for the town so to keep people swimming in the local beaches for their event in the 4th of July. IN a memorable moment, the Mayor backs up the reasoning \"...we need summer dollars... If the people can't swim here, they'll happily swim in the beaches of Cape Cod, Long Island.\" Martin retorts, \"Yea, but that doesn't mean we have to serve them up a Smorgisbord!\" the Mayor memorably then replies-\"It's all psychological, U yell Baricuda people say 'huh,' 'what?'; U yell Shark, and we have a panic on our hands on the 4th of July.\" The opening to the movie is arguably the most powerful opening to a movie ever made. A beach side party, encourages a guy to go over to a girl Chrissie Watkins, whom immediately decides to go for a midnight swim, the boy follows and passes out at the beach side due to alcohol-the girl soon realises she is alone in the water. At this point with expert milking of tension, the camera does a sharks POV beneath the girls legs, treading water. The camera gets closer, the music gets louder, then as we cut to a close up of the girls face, we see her feel the tug from below as she is dramatically and terrifyingly dragged left and right before she is finally pulled under for the final time. The primal fear of what is unknown in the water, is one of the factors that makes that scene so effective.Meanwhile as the evidence points to a shark attack, the community mayor has none of it until the next attack, an attack on a young boy on a raft -the gruesome death in front of many members of the community ensues community panic. This scene serves to heighten to the audience that if even a young boy gets killed and a dog (pippet) earlier, that truly no one is safe adding to the unpredictability and fear to the movie. Again, the attack is expertly crafted.The aspect that makes this movie beyond a simple monster movie is the interaction and characterisation in the domestic environment. We get a real sense of a small town Ameircan island community, the movie looks at all members of the community, the fishermen, council members,and island families. The character interaction is realistic and the main characters were tremendous. Chief Brody, played by the excellent actor Roy Schieder- is the typical everyman hero. His wife, Ellen (LOrraine Gary) was effective in an understated role. Brody feeling community pressure not to close the beaches for longer than 24hrs, brings in a Shark Expert, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss). AN instantly likable character creates a tremendous bond with the Chief and a humorous interaction between the two. When the Shark attacks again, during the 4th of July celebration, Brody brings in Robert Shaw as the colourful shark fishermen to kill the Shark. The 3 main characters are simply scintillating together. Even scenes which don't include the shark are fascinating. Robert Shaw is wonderful at portraying an over-the top colourful Shark fisherman and creates an immediate distrust to Hoopers upper class upbringing: \"U have city hands Mister Hooper, U've been countin money all your life!\" Hooper replies, \"Hey, i don't need this Working class hero crap.\" This brings an immediate tension when they go on the small boat. Brody terrified of boats and the water and Quint's controlling nature with Hooper being sidelined.One of the best aspects in the film is the characterisation of the Quint character, in his USS Indianapolis story. One of the most fascinating speeches in any moment in modern cinema. And we see the 3characters all bond. Probably one of the most famous jump off your seat scenes is the scene when the Shark emerges from the water unexpectedly after Brody threw chum in the water. Brody aghast staggers backwards claiming in a classic understatement \"We're gonna need a bigger boat!\" The scenes on the boat are the most fascinating examples of all elements of classic cinema techniques at its absolute best. The movie mixes adventurous, swashbuckling daring- do, to pure thriller horror. The final minutes of the movie are terrifying, Hoopers dramatic escape in the cage, to Quints gruesome demise to Brody's heroic last ditch one- on- one with the killer shark. Brody's classic \"Smile you son of a B...!\" blowing up the shark by shooting the air tank- is a rousing end to not just the greatest horror film ever made; but the greatest film ever made.",

The fact that you never actually see the shark until the final sequences heightens the sense of tension throughout the film. Also the relationships between Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss characters are enduring to watch.So I guess you'd say I liked this film, and you'd be right.

I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",

Sheriff Martin Brody(Roy Scheider) finds a severd hand of a young women on the beach. He soon suspects it was a shark. And wants to close the beach down, but is told by the stubborn mayor(Murray Hamilton) of the small town, tells him that he can't shut the beach down without proof that it was shark, and also tells him that it might have been a boat accident. But when a young boy was eaten alive the next day, Martin asks for a shark expert Matt Hooper(Richard  Dreyfuss) to help, Matt soon tells him that the shark is a great white, and will continue eat any human who goes in the water. Martin soon hires a loud mouth contractor named Quint(Robert Shaw) to kill the shark. A truly great story telling of man against nature. All the actors perform well. The first and the best.",

When I was old enough to appreciate the beauty of this film, my theater showed it on the big screen. Once again, I was shocked at how well this film was made and directed. Almost every scene was perfect. The use of suspense and the viewers imagination rather than showing the shark was a grest suspense trick. Now that the Aniversery DVD is out, I have been able to really appreciate this film even more because I got to find out how hard it was to make this film.

I think this film really is a testament to Steven Spielberg's directing talent and a true suspense thriller. The acting in this is superb and although some scenes were rather predictable it did not spoil the suspense and thrill you feel when you hear that famous music. Richard Dreyfuss is well cast as the young scientist who along with Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider save Amity Island from the killer great white shark. And although the mechanical shark may look ever so slightly dated it is also a triumph technically. I am very pleased that finally I have sat and watched Jaws and even though I know now who dies and who survives i could watch it again and again.",

            "content": "Throughout Spielberg's career he has a seemingly easy time translating novel to film like Schindler's List and Jurassic Park. As a child when I first saw the film, Jaws I was immediately frightened by the unseen terror that pulls the human psychosis to the depths of the ocean, literally. I was highly hesitant because to a young child, an attractive skinny dipper suffering to the wrath of the giant unknown mouth was the most horrifying sequence in film history at the time.One of the many joys of this film is the cast. Roy Scheider is perfect as the cop who first realises that chewed torsos washing up on the local beach may be a good reason to keep people out of the water. The film is very reminiscent of Moby Dick with the boat and the Shark/Whale and to conquer this wild beast. The sound was good with many layers adding this effect as if it was in reality and that we were there. The shot with the trombone shot was excellent and is the best I've seen. The dialogue was funny like in many of Spielberg's films. It is also probably the \"Quintessential Spielberg Film.\". It was so successful that it spawned 3 other sequels the first sequel was good but not as good as Jaws and the other two, well...... The film is highly influential with the storyline, humour, narrative structure and the technical side of things like the camera techniques and the design of the shark. Like the design of Alien in Alien this is tremendously good. I liked the POV shots of the shark. I also liked the sound when the boy was being killed as the camera was bopping up and down in the water which gave it a natural effect. People always talk about how fake the Shark looks. I think it looks better as today it would definitely be done by CGI and would look fake. This film is one of my favourites, used to like it but now being re-introduced its one of my favourites. I think that the reason why the film is still largely popular is because of its music, visuals, narrative, actors, dialogue and camera techniques. The music is obviously a strong standing point in cinema history for its irregular tone and notes in the piece. The low pitch gives a feeling of calmness but with the motion being quick giving a strange sensation that everything going to be OK but at the same time a certain element of horror. The visuals are great the settings, the way the locations look, making the shots look wonderful. I think that the idea of a shark attacking a small community effected the reason why as no ones ever seen this before, although they must of seen a murderer rampaging a bunch of tarty teenagers in a small community. This influenced a whole bunch of other not so great shark films like the most impressive film since Jaws2 which is Deep Blue Sea with some nods to the sequel to Jaws. The trombone shot is a major technique that has been used since Hitchcock's Vertigo with the sense of unreality or to suggest that a character is going into realisation. The technique is used a lot but never as well done as this, Vertigo and the Goodfellas. The dialogue is very much I feel in the genre of Comedy trying to make the horror disappear quite quickly and to reassure the audience. My favourite line is 'we're gonna need a bigger boat.' That's kind of reassuring the audience well actually isn't seeing that the shark is bigger than we expected. I definitely feel that the opening sequence is a great way to start a film off. The opening sequences have few parallel to today's cinema. Like the shower scene in Psycho they will haunt a whole nation. A lot of scene I liked and is hard to some up another scene. Spielberg builds up tension by slowly revealing the shark to audience with a few glimpses of the shark when it attacks but never actually seeing the shark up close. I think that the less we saw of it the more realistic the shark become and frightened audience with the idea of what you can't see can't hurt you well may be more like what you can't see can hurt you and probably kill you and the strains of John William's unforgettable score which was used as the mechanical shark that was used kept sinking but I feel that this made the film better and made it memorable.This is not your average fish story.",

It wasn't the first speilburg movie I saw, that title goes to Jurassic park, but it was the one that opened my eyes to the Beaty of movies and the theatre. I don't say this often but o think jaws is one of very few perfect movies. And that's funny how considering the making of this movie was far from it. Plauged with mistakes, malfunctions and plenty of problems, the shooting of jaws was a nightmare. But I, and many others believe it was all worth itNot a single moment In this movie is wasted. The story is airtight and is known far and wide. The characters are exceptionally written and our hero's are flawed and realistic which fits the story extremely well. The shark itself while not real (duh) is one of the most iconic movie villains of all time even though it doesn't show up until an hour and a half into the movie. Steven speilburg channels his Inner Hitchcock and delivers an extremely tense and suspenseful movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Robert shaws quint is one of my favorite movie characters of all time and his Indianapolis speech is astounding and the best part of the movie.I could talk about this movie for hours but unfortunately I don't have the time to do so.

It is a shame that it has been cheapened by being overplayed on TNT.Jaws is Speilberg's best film by far.  He had to push his creative genius to its edge because unlike his films now, he didn't have a bottomless pile of cash to dip into.  He made you love his characters. It's also beautifully shot.  The shot of Brody sitting on the beach as the Kittner boy is eaten with the camera dollying in and the lens being widened out is used all the time now thanks to this move.Brody, Hooper, and Quint also give us one of the most interesting mismatches of characters ever to grace the screen.  The scene at night in the boat after they've attached the first barrel is the kind of scene that all film makers should be trying to duplicate.  The USS Indianapolis monologue is the kind of speech every actor dreams that a writer could plop in their mouth.\nIn order to truly see if what I say is true, that Jaws is the best film ever,  ask yourself this one question.

Ever since it's release, people feared the ocean, and what lurks within it. I am of course talking about \"Jaws\". I first saw this movie when I found the DVD at my library (does anyone do that anymore?). Personally I wasn't scared of it. It's not the movie's fault, it's just EVERYONE talks about the major scares (I won't because I'm a nice person), so I already knew about the jump scares, and the disturbing images. It was fun to watch it with my mother, who was unaware of the scares. She screamed and jumped, and my sister, my dad, and I all laughed our butts off. It just goes to show that these effects are still scary to this day. Sure they look fake, but if they can make a person scream, then they're doing their job. Other than the scares, the characters are enjoyable too. By far, Quint is my favorite character. I love how he teases Brody and Hooper while they're on the Orca. It's like he's saying \"I'm the king of this castle, I can do what I want.\" Hooper is also a fun character, and he probably has some of the funniest lines in the movie. Brody, even though he's the main character, is probably the stick in the mud out of the trio. I'm not saying he's bad, it's just Hooper and Quint steal the show.

Watch each and every character.  Down to the extras.  You won't find a weak performance.  The deputy, the chief's kids, no matter where you look, everyone is solid. (Even Peter Benchley, in his first acting role.)The late Robert Shaw was a marvel in this piece, again, Oscar-worthy.  Roy Scheider, Richard Dryfuss, everyone was at their best. \nMr. Spielberg did an amazing job, most assuredly Oscar-worthy.  This is the only movie I've ever seen where the audience leapt to their feet and gave a standing ovation at the end.  (When the shark blew up, and AGAIN when credits rolled.)

            "review_title": "Suspenseful and Iconic",
            "content": "Jaws, now an iconic American film, was a film built around the premise of suspense. Why was the film so successful? What separated this film from other scary movies from the 70's & why are we still talking about it in 2016? To begin with, the soundtrack of the film utilizes an escalating trombone to instill tense, dramatic, and suspenseful moments in the film and counter it with silence, another tool of suspense, to build to those moments through emotion before the action starts. Throughout the film they utilize the technique of matching eye lines across cuts to form continuity and the illusion that these two separate images are looking into each other's eyes. Most notably this is seen in the opening scene with the kids on the beach. The guy is in one cut looking to the right, in the next cut the girl is looking to the left of the screen. This implies eye contact between these two characters, a method used commonly in film making nowadays. Lighting was also used effectively for continuity purposes in Jaws, using the angle of light to indicate that people are in different sides of the room in different shots, primarily in the cabin of the ship at night when the men are out hunting the shark. In fact, certain shots of individuals faces make this movie stand out because of the effect they have. In one of the first few scenes with the character of Brody the camera moves with Brody as he walks through crowds of people along the dock. We're following him because he is the main character, & the use of the camera like this shows the audience this in a subtle way. Close ups of people's faces can also do a number of things as are shown in this film. They can make you wonder what the character is thinking and bring you inside their head, or they can bring you, the viewer into the scene, creating a feeling of intensity or shock. Intensity is created when close shots are taken in the water during the shark attacks bringing you into the moment. Shock is found in the close up of the woman's face staring straight at the camera when she sees a fin in the water. Because of the close up, as a viewer, you can relate to her emotions and feel the shock for yourself. In one of the many beach scenes close ups and wide range shots are used to show our main character Brody viewing the water beyond the people who are close in the shot. A quick zoom occurs on Brody's face when he sees the shark, giving us a similar sense of realization as we watch. Techniques like this bring us viewers into the story and make it relevant to our own lives because we can relate to the emotions we are feeling on screen. Close ups aren't the only thing that make Jaws an effective and timeless film. As I had previously mentioned, lighting plays a role as well. Silhouettes and shadows lend an eerie and otherworldly, even dangerous, quality to the scenes. You're never shown everything. Shots were taken from beneath the surface of the water up at swimmers implying the perspective of a sea creature. These shots add to the suspenseful element because paired with the soundtrack of the film you start suspecting that something will come from that depth you are looking at the swimmer from. The same techniques are used in slasher movies when the camera approaches the unsuspecting victim from behind. You don't see the attacker but you know they are there. When the lights flicker and go out in the cabin of the boat near the end of the film the scene then cuts to low lit silhouettes bringing the story from the somewhat lighthearted sense of camaraderie with the men singing together to the dark realization that a shark is hunting them down (and vice versa). The shark itself is mostly portrayed through things being pulled through the water. The ominous presence of the shark can be attributed to the fact that the shark itself is not seen (at least not fully) for a large portion of the film. Its movement is implied through the dragging of these objects. The viewer doesn't need to see the shark to know it is there. When the line on the fishing boat starts being pulled, little by little, you know the shark is responsible and that something in the scene is about to happen. There is so much to discuss about Jaws and why it stands out, the scene of the nails on the chalkboard disturbing chaos and making even the audience uncomfortable, the boat setting out through the image of shark jaws to remind you what they are setting out to, or even how Hooper and Brody's reaching shore in the closing scene imply a happy ending, because honestly Jaws is filled with so many scenes and well used techniques to warrant its recognition. It is suspenseful and daring, as well as comical and overall entertaining. The film brings you in as a viewer to feel a part of the story, as any great film should be able to do.",

            "content": "Not many films have the power to keep me in suspense everytime I watch them. JAWS is one of the few that does. I've seen it countless times, and I still find myself captured by the suspenseful each time. A terrific lead cast (Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfus, Robert Shaw) highlight Spielberg's intense ride of a great white shark menacing a small East Coast island community during the Fourth of July holiday. Spielberg does a great job of capturing the small town island life before moving things to the claustrophobic setting of a lone ship at sea. Thanks to on-set mechanical problems, \"Bruce\" the shark (as he was called during filming, named after Spielberg's lawyer at the time) is kept hidden from the audience for much of the movie, making his first appearance in the film a moment that shocks not only Scheider's police chief Brody, but the audience as well.The interplay between the three lead stars is what makes the film interesting, though we end up not really knowing a whole lot about Brody and Dreyfus's Matt Hooper. Shaw's Quint, by far, delivers the most intriguing backstory, telling the two men about his time on the U.S.S. Indianapolis, a story that is both exciting and (thanks to John Williams' music) haunting at the same time. The scenes in which the men are attempting to capture the shark are exciting and suspenseful, culminating in the final attack that sees Brody as the only one left to take care of things, and he does so in a truely ingenious way.Through the whole film we're drawn in by these characters and come to connect with them. We care about what happens to them, and that's what a good movie should do. Along with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, this is my favorite Spielberg movie that I still consider one of his absolute best. And knowing all the problems they encountered in getting it made, it's really a miracle that it turned out as fantastic as it did.",

This movie's insane success supposedly jump started the type of film known as the summer blockbuster. With this film, Steven Spielberg became a household name and one of the world's most famous directors. Spielberg manages to create a Hitchcock-style thriller while putting his own unique touch on it. Indeed, just like how Hitchcock's PSYCHO made people afraid to take a shower, Spielberg made people afraid of going swimming. Spielberg doesn't show the shark on screen for a great deal of the film, which works to the film's advantage. When he does show the creature, he gives it the right amount of menace and terror to make it believable. Besides being incredibly frightening, Spielberg creates a fascinating character study. He sets the last third of the film on-board a small fishing boat, which allows the three main actors to play off of each other and create natural performances. Roy Scheider gives a natural performance as Chief Brody. Schieder makes Brody feel like Everyman, a person you'd know in real life. Robert Shaw gives an incredibly intense and raw performance as Quint, the grizzled seaman. His intensity matches the film's tone perfectly. Richard Dreyfuss has some funny moments as Hooper. What review would be complete without mentioning the music by the legendary John Williams? His main theme for the film is one of the most recognizable in film history, and right up there with Bernard Hermann's score for PSYCHO as one of the best scores for a horror film. Followed by three sequels, but the original is by far the best of the lot. Highly recommended. 10/10.",

This is my Star Wars, Star Trek, and LOTR wrapped into one. Back to the movie. The first thing to comment on is that the shark, though not real looking, still looks amazing. No shark has looked as good as Bruce. The Closest thing to compare to Bruce is the Deep Blue Sea sharks, but they are still miles behind Bruce.This movie also beats out all other shark movies as far as acting. You can't 24/7 shark attack flick with non stop action, though that would be sweet. The cast all does outstanding, especially Robert Shaw. His performance is so close to a modern day Ahab. I still get shivers whenever I hear the USS Indianapolis speech.And of course, there is John Williams brilliant score. There is the basic duh dun, but I'm going to go a little further than that. The truly great thing about the score is how the tempo matches the pace.Like I said, this is my favorite movie.

You are off on the first hill full speed ahead.\"Jaws\". humph. Jaws. Wrong title for this movie. The name of this film should be \"Mayor Larry Vaughn the B!@#$%d\". To me - what's the shark? The pinnacle of natural organic breeding that happened to spawn one of the biggest sharks on the planet. That's like anthropomorphizing a volcano and calling the film \"Lava Hands\". That mayor single-handedly murdered at least 5 poor innocent folks just to keep his little tourist town revenue stream up. But, like real life - I don't see jails for the likes of this guy. Sadly - in the end - we don't see him out on the boat, taking up arms, and dying trying to right things in the progress. Classic. Now that's real! Now, you would think these kinds of plot devices and over all story arc to not be a Spielberg trope or standby, odd - well, that's because this movie is actually based on a popular book released barely over a year prior; and after Steve processed it, add an timeless Mr. Williams - and bam. It's an instant classic movie.The pacing in this film overall, and dating still stands up well to time. It has believable characters, the actors mesh well, and it has far more than it's share of horror aspects cemented in place. Horror? This is a horror movie? Oh, bet your ass it is - when you think about it, it's actually worse. This damn thing could be out there right now, stalking swimmers - ready to \"swallow whole\" the next hapless poor soul. It's a 25+', 3 ton, hunting, stalking, never-sleeping, murder machine.. and you cant see it until it's right up on ya. Oh, and by the way, bullets loose their kinetic energy after less feet in water than you realize. So good luck.What's best overall about this film? IT IS PG. No kidding. This film had more gore than half the rated R horror films in the last 15 years, and it has legs, arms shooting off. It has people being eaten alive, bitten in half, and desperation at ridiculously stressful moments. It has FULL FRONTAL NUDITY. But - no swearing. Thank god! This might just be something you couldn't show at church. That's something I forget to mention about yesterday's film, Poltergeist... another Spielberg film - PG. No kidding there - faces ripped off, parents smoking pot with kids in the house, mom getting raped by a entity... but no swearing. Whew! This film, a first in it's series is a classic Hollywood example of starting a franchise after a clear ending - simply due to the overwhelming success.

With an opening scene (the now legendary 'First Attack') that rides high up in the ranks alongside the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho', Speilberg, like the monster Great White in the movie, has proved himself a powerful force to be reckoned with. Apart from spawning three sequels (number two was okay, three and four, well lets not get into that shall we) Jaws is the ultimate monster movie which would only have its' perfect veneer tarnished if someone was to do a remake (Gus Van Sant's Psycho anyone?). The basic plot is that Satan's goldfish is snacking on the locals of Amity Island and it could cause a few problems as it is getting very close to the summer season and the tourists will be flocking in their droves to the island. It then comes down to three guys, Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider),  Icthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a Captain Ahab style shark fisherman called Quint (Robert Shaw) to try to kill the beast. Speilberg uses the camera alongside John Williams' simple but classic haunting score to show the power of the Great White with exhilerating effect. While Quint's monologue of the events of what happened to the crew on the Indianapolis had audiences mesmerised, a couple of well positioned jolts in the movie had people leaping out of their seats with fear, Jaws has created what we have come to expect every year and that's the summer blockbuster.

It is only until the last half-hour do you see the whole shark, but Spielberg can keep the suspense running throughout the whole film.",

Thank you Jaws, you've brightened my day completely.Police Chief Martin Brody(Roy Scheider), his wife Ellen Brody(Lorraine Gary)and his sons Sean(Jay Mello)and Mike(Chris Rebello)know there is something in those waters surrounding Long Island. The chief is sure it's a shark. And darn well it is.A 25 foot Great White has been stalking the oceans and has killed 5 people already. No one wants to be in the water(swim). And the worst part.

However, the movie is so much more than that. A young Steven Spielberg creates a visually-stunning and suspenseful film; for instance, the zoom/dolly close-up of Roy Scheider on the beach has since become a popular camera technique. The acting is excellent, and Robert Shaw's performance is especially unforgettable. The script is solid, and the dialogue is strong.

It's factual, but it's certainly darning it with faint praise! (And, other than its sub-par sequels, WERE there any other `shark' movies???)That aside, Jaws is one of those films that started out fairly high in my estimation and continues to climb as years go by. I was actually a tad disappointed when I finally got to see it at the theatre as a 12-year-old. This was simply because it had been the most-hyped movie of all time, up till then. I don't know WHAT I was expecting, but certainly more than a motion picture could ever provide!Later, I admitted that it was a quite good film. After college cinema class, I had to admit that it was especially well-made. As an adult, I came to consider it one of my favorite films. Finally, today, I can look back and call it one of Hollywood's finer moments. I would rate Jaws among the best 3-4 films made since 1970, and, as a recent reviewer called it, `the grand-daddy' of the action/adventure genre. (It was also the first true summer blockbuster!)So much more than a tale of a man-eating shark, Jaws captures the small-town, tourist economy that thrives on visitors. The fictitious Amity is perfectly depicted and Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) is the perfect representative of this mindset. Not a bad guy, just a harried local official, mindful that the community's lifeblood depends on the brief beach season, he is out of his element when that same blood begins gushing up on the pristine white beaches. I won't go into deep details; others have already covered the key points. The then-unknown cast sparkles, the script is magnificent-especially the tremendous USS Indianapolis scene, which adds SO MUCH to the depth of the characters and also reinforces the peril that they are about to face, and the cinematography is outstanding. The live shark footage from Australia, combined with a few limited close-ups of `Bruce,' is a deft touch. Of course, John Williams' music helps make it what it is, too.Little human touches, like the youngest Brody boy imitating his father's every movement at the kitchen table, make the film much more than an everyday horror/adventure flick. Another favorite moment that always makes me chuckle out loud is when Michael (Chris Rebello) is in his new rowboat. Brody (Roy Schneider) harshly orders him out of the boat. Mrs. Brody (Lorraine Gary) scolds Brody for his actions (actually making him change his mind), only to see the painting in the book he was holding, of a shark ramming its snout through a wooden rowboat & scream `Did you HEAR your father? Get OUT of that boat!' :o)There's even a built-in trivia question: `What's ironic about the title?' Answer: `It's about a shark and sharks HAVE no jaws!' Food for thought\u0085er\u0085excuse me\u0085poor choice of words, there, under the circumstances! ;o)This is a must-see, if anyone has somehow missed it.",

I always thought that the black, emotionless eyes on the shark were its scariest features, aside from its huge jaws. This is my favorite Steven Spielberg movie. I liked the way that Steven Spielberg only showed the shark actually eating a person, and it was the most bloody and horrific scene in the whole movie. Spielberg's directing tactics really show in this movie, like the way you could see through the shark's point of view.I liked pretty much all of the characters in this movie, but most of all, I liked Robert Shaw as Quint. He was the best character, partly because he was so insane. He is like Captain Ahab, and Jaws is like Moby Dick. I also liked Roy Sheider as the reluctant hero, and Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper, who was basically the comedy sidekick, but still a great character. All of them made 'Jaws' not only terrifying, but also a good character development movie.\nOf course the best scenes are the very last scenes, which have gone from suspenseful to really suspenseful. My only regret is that so many God awful sequels had to be made. Those are some of the worst movies ever made. 'Jaws', though, is one of my favorite movies. I recommend this to anyone who loves a great man against nature, intense ride, because this is the best of its kind. Jaws is still a timeless classic, and it always will be. 10/10",

I have known about it for many years and finally decided to watch it since it is regarded as an excellent shark movie.I LOVE shark movies and I have ever since I watched Deep Blue sea in theaters in 1999 as a kid, which I have re-watched twice.Anyway, I think this was a good movie, but nowhere as good as Deep Blue Sea (1999). But this film was actually a very solid work and overall well-made. Steven Spielberg (my favorite director) did a great job. The CGI people did an amazing job with the shark - it was so real and it looked absolutely amazing.The plot was simple and yet effective. The plot was written in a realistic manner, which I appreciated. A realistic shark plot worked.The cast was fine. Richard Dreyfuss (Hopper) I think had the best performance.Roy Scheider (Chief Brody) had some decent performances but later only gave very flat scenes, especially at the end. Very flat and mediocre acting at the end.Robert Shaw (Quint) had a pretty average performance.The supporting cast did acceptable, although completely forgettable.Moreover, this movie had more flaws, aside from the acting issues.The triumphant orchestra music when the protagonists were haunting the shark was extremely inappropriate. The orchestra in general was so bad it knocked down 1 Star from my review. I cannot believe the orchestra music won an Oscar.Also, there were scenes in the last quarter of the film that did not have dialogue when something would happen and I thought that that was inappropriate and unrealistic. Any normal person would be swearing and verbally reacting to anything that goes wrong and talking to themselves in such a bad situation. Instead there is no dialogue. What is even worst, the acting at the end was totally inappropriate and unbelievable - I mean if you are in the water alone with a 25-foot long 6,000 lb. great white shark, it does not make sense for you to have a fearless face and not say a word? These two things cost the movie two stars. This was completely unrealistic. It is common sense. You would naturally be absolutely HORRIFIED of such a shark and mumble things to yourself, but definitely you would not be completely fearless! The actor Roy Scheider failed and the Steven Spielberg failed too. How can you forget common sense?Another issue is with the last scene - there was a missed opportunity to create absolute horror for the audience, which a shark is supposed to make anyone feel The fight should have been taken into the water - there is nothing more horrifying than knowing you are in the water with a 25-foot 6,000 lb. great white shark under you. But instead, the character is in a safe spot and to make things worst, with a completely fearless face. I, the viewer, never felt the horror that I should have felt, that the director should have made me feel. This is a failure from the director and the actor. Extremely disappointed.Conclusion: it is a good movie, but I do not think it deserves such a high reputation. Maybe it was the first shark movie done right, but it is nowhere near as good as Deep Blue Sea (1999). Nevertheless, it is still a good movie that deserves a watch since it was mostly properly made from start to finish, although with some flaws.7/10",

I was about 6 or 7 years at the time, and i remember that you only could get in to see this movie, if you were older than 18, (like in ALIEN). Anyone younger than 19 wasn\u00b4t allowed in the theater, ( i remember watching people with their ID cards, buying tickets). Each time i looked at that JAWS poster i got extremely curious, but i knew that i would be real afraid of watching it.How things change. Now we look at JAWS and i\u00b4m sure now that it\u00b4s re-released in DVD for it\u00b4s 25th aniversary, with a 15 certificate, only because it\u00b4s the politicaly correct classification, because if it wasn\u00b4t for that i bet it would get a PG certificate at the most, such is the lightness of those now famous gore scenes that seemed too creepy so many adult people back in the 70\u00b4s.I don\u00b4t know if there is anyone on this movie-planet that hasn\u00b4t seen JAWS yet, but i\u00b4m speaking for those very few of you, who are still afraid. JAWS it\u00b4s NOT an horror movie, it\u00b4s an ADVENTURE movie set at sea !JAWS has less gore than any INDIANA JONES !In fact, i remember how disappointed i got ,when i saw it for the first time. After all those horror expectations from when i was a kid, JAWS turned out to be a very regular light adventure movie instead. I even thought i watched a cutted version of the movie, because i was expecting to see people getting eaten to pieces on screen and it was nothing like that. Instead of a gore movie, i got an adventure with great, positive and funny characters. Hey, i could have watched this movie when i was a kid and not get much frightened ! :-)After my inital \"disappointment\", i watched JAWS plenty of other times, and each time it grew on me a little more. Perhaps because i love the sea and this remains one of the best sea movies of all time. Right now what i find trully amazing in JAWS is the way in which fools the viewer into thinking he has seen more violence and gore than what actualy shows. To me this is the great achievment in this picture. I read somewhere that Spielberg\u00b4s initial intention was to show lots more of the shark, but he had no budget and the rubber shark looked fake, so he decided to create suspanse instead of visuals.Thank all gods that this movie was made in the 70\u00b4s, because if it was today, i\u00b4m sure it would only become another hollywood blockbuster filled with special effects, and a big pretty computer generated shark chewing on everybody. In fact i guess Spielberg did this modern \"JAWS\", it\u00b4s called \" JURASSIC PARK\" and \"LOST WORLD\", which are a pretty good example of how lots of special effects can make a boring and empty movie, specialy if you see it more than once. I can bet, no one will release a 25th anniversary edition of JURASSIC PARK years from now.So once again it\u00b4s proved that lack of money equals imagination. JAWS looks so great because of it. If you haven\u00b4t seen it yet, you don\u00b4t know what you\u00b4re missing. Go see it, rent it, or buy the new incredible DVD 25th anniversary edition which has lots of extra stuff, including a 50 minute making off.And watch it with your kids, so they can see how chicken their parents were, for being affraid of going to see a movie that nowadays could be screened in a kids matine\u00e9. Actually,  it should be.  :-)",

It's suspenseful at times and on occasion will make you jump.When a girl is killed by a shark while swimming at a beach in a resort town, the sheriff wants to close the beach but the local town officials don't want to ruin the summer tourist season and they override him with disastrous results.  Soon a young boy is eaten by the shark and the hunt is on. \nThe sheriff (Roy Scheider), a crusty old fisherman (Robert Shaw) and a scientific type (Richard Dreyfuss) set sail in a boat called the Orca on a shark hunt and it's a battle to the finish.  Not everyone survives and I won't spoil if for you by giving that part away.The main downfall of Jaws is that it is a very unromantic movie.  The characters seem a bit shallow and are presented as nearly one dimensional. They go through the motions of their characters in a somewhat perfunctory manner.  The actors seem to do the best they can with their lines, especially Robert Shaw who does the best with making his character seem like a real person.  Richard Dreyfuss isn't too bad either and I like his sense of humor.  It almost seems to me that great attention was paid to technical aspects of the film while the story line and character detail suffered a little.Nonetheless, Jaws remains an entertaining adventure/suspense move and is interesting to watch.  I give it an 89.0/100.  I liked Jaws II better.",

It means how shocking this movie can be.Maybe in the current year, if some children see it they will not feel the big thing, but as I saw it, it was not even the year of premiere, it was almost 3 decades later, even so I was traumatized. The shark, the scariest movie of the year, the great white shark. I said those words with great emotion when I referred to Jaws as a child, not only was it a terrifying experience, I also filled with emotion and suspense, the famous and recognizable main song, that song that more of us look for as Taran ta-ran or Shark song on google. The direction of the film of course is implacable, directed by someone who does not need introduction, cinematography is excellent, with scenes as iconic as great, and special effects are something unique! Despite being 2017, I still think \"God, it looks real.\" It is something surprising that gave birth to a unique genre that was brutally exploited, that of gigantic or terrible animals.It's been many years, this movie is a jewel of terror and adventure that never disappoints, I always look at it even once a year next to my cousin or girlfriend, because we love to feel that nostalgia for what was once a advanced and frightening movie.Watch out for the sea, it's full of great movies.",

It has possibly the best combination of acting, dialogue, direction, photography, suspense, humour and plausibility that I think I have ever seen.  Some of the shots that Spielberg got when out on the water are simply superb and obviously took enormous effort to consign to film back in the mid 70's.I'm loathe to mention 'Deep Blue Sea' in the same sentence as Jaws (although it was an enjoyable film in it's own right), but there is a point that can be made here.  The advent of CGI effects means that we can now see more of the stuff that used to cost huge amounts of money, man-power and time to create on film.  However, this is exactly where Deep Blue Sea fails where Jaws so resoundingly succeeds.  We do not need to see the shark in Jaws to know it's there and the film is carried not by the appearance of the shark but by masterful acting (by the whole cast), great cinematography, genius direction and an intelligent and fit-for-the-screen take on Benchley's novel.It's nice to be able now to sit back and appreciate this film for more than just the shock value of the 'shark in the water' formula.  More than 25 years on this film still stands head and shoulders above most other movies (similar or not).",

            "content": "Spielberg, cast, and crew still say making this film was a nightmare. Problems with the mechanical shark caused the film to go over budget and way over schedule. However, the end result was worth it. There has never been anything like JAWS and there never will be. It was the film that kicked off the summer blockbuster in the summer of 1975. A great white shark stakes a claim off Amity Island, really Martha's Vineyard, and Roy Scheider's Chief Brody tries to stop it. He has the help of Richard Dreyfuss's amusing Matt Hooper, shark expert and nothing at all like Peter Benchley's handsome and pompous creation from the book. Both men are trying to prove to the stubborn town Mayor, brilliantly played by Murray Hamilton, that there is indeed a killer shark out there. There is some real suspense and terror in this film which has proudly stood the test of time. People can relate to Brody's everyman hero, enjoy Hooper's wisecracks, and become enthralled and miffed with Robert Shaw's brilliant turn as Quint, the sea captain whose seen it all. Quint's story about the U.S.S. Indianapolis is pure terror. John Williams's score is tense and frightening. Spielberg has made a career of working with this man and I can see why. Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T.,etc. Williams knows how to set the mood and to this day when I swim in the ocean I hear his score in the back of my mind. There are so many great scenes in this film. The horror of the opening scene grabs you and doesn't let go as we watch a beautiful, young woman take her final swim. Quint's introduction at the town meeting scratching the chalkboard is one of a kind. Brody and his son's mimicry at the dinner table. Just watch the camera move into Brody as he realizes a young boy is being attacked on the beach. Hooper is hilarious at the dinner table at the Brody house. Who could forget the shark's surprise appearance and Brody's reaction while he's chumming. Robert Shaw steals the film in it's final hour and you can't take your eyes off him. There's also a great number of memorable lines. Roy Scheider's improvised,\"We're gonna need a bigger boat.\" Richard Dreyfuss telling Murray Hamilton,\"Your gonna ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the a$$!\" And no one will ever forget Brody's last line to the shark. Benchley's book was excellent but the film was smart to eliminate the affair Chief Brody's wife had with Hooper. It was also wise to tone down the political angle. In the book Brody's young son is threatened and his cat's neck is broken. Also, the final three man shark hunt consisting of Brody, Hooper, and Quint was condensed into a few days rather than a series of weeks. Quint's demise in the book is also more fitting though the movie gives him a truly horrific and gory demise. The conclusion is pure Hollywood and really deviates from the book. Spielberg told Benchley,\"I got them where I want them so I can do what I want.\" He sure can and did. Jaws is still one hell of an experience.",

But weird.I feel like Jaws would have been a bad movie, actually, if it wasn't completely and utterly saved by the actors. What's so weird about Jaws is how its structured -- it's almost more like a modern, post-2010 movie with how quick, snappy, and lean scenes are. Jaws doesn't stop to set things up, it's a movie that hits the ground running and tries to give you little snippets of background in between all the shark attacks and whatever else. We don't even learn that Sheriff Brody has a phobia of water until what feels like a third of the way through the movie, when that would normally be one of the first things a director would tell you about. It's a little disarming, here.But the actors. Wow, the actors. Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss, everyone is so dang natural and believable that almost nothing else really matters. When Brody's wife leans back in her stressed husband's arms, hands him a drink, says \"Wanna get drunk and fool around?\", and he sleepily grins and replies \"Sure\", that's real.It also basically turns in to a completely different movie in the last act. That's cool, but it means the island stuff feels a little wasted. Again, it's kind of a messy movie, one that is clearly in a hurry to do everything it needs to do, and though it never makes Jaws a bad movie, it makes for a weird impression when I've been so aware of the massive legacy around Jaws for so long.But hey, it's a fun time regardless, so all this pontificating is a little worthless, I guess.",

            "content": "First off: I do love this movie. Spielberg got A LOT of help making this film from producers Zanuck and Brown to John Williams to his DP Bill Butler and editor Verna Fields. But there are two glaring character flaws with this movie that I believe have been SEVERELY overlooked.1st: It is clearly established in the town hall meeting scene that Quint is a professional fisherman with decades of experience, who clearly sees a HUGE financial opportunity to hunt and catch the shark. His motivations are purely financial, not vengeful, hateful, or obsessive. (This character is even able to laugh-off his shark injuries and share his shark-fears with his Indianapolis experience. And yet the screenwriters (even uncredited Milius and Sackler) decide to have this character lose his mind thus screwing up a perfect opportunity to create even more dread, suspense, and tension by having Quint sabotage his own boat!!! WHY? It would've been cinematically more enjoyable to keep the audience in suspense to keep them guessing during the scene where Jaws is chasing the Orca back to shore and wondering whether the boat's engine would explode or not. Total crap writing/directing decision.2. In the Alex Kintner death scene, it is clearly established that children, to include Martin Brody's oldest son, Michael, is playing in the water at the same time Kintner is attacked. And how does Brody react??? This guy doesn't even run into the water and pull the kids out to make sure the they are safe, much less his own kid!!! Yeah, it's established Brody hates the water, but c'mon, even when his own kid's life is on the line? Brody is not a real Irish-American in this depiction. LOL! (I truly feel the producers, writers, and director of Jaws 2 corrected this crappy character flaw as Brody is way more manly and virile in the sequel).3. Anyway, I still love this movie, but just like any other movie and book, it does have its flaws. IMO Spielberg's only terrific film, but it's terrific because he was young and he had a lot of help by pros with way more filmmaking experience than him. He really should've kept surrounding himself with more experienced and diversified talent behind the camera over the decades.",

            "content": "Attending film school for four years I had the opportunity to view several different kinds of films. There was always one film however that I always retreated to when it came to writing papers and class discussions, and that, is JAWS. JAWS has been my favorite film since I was a youngster, and it wasn't until NYU Film School that I learned the true significance of the film. JAWS may very well be considered the originator of what we know today as the \"high-concept\" film. In director Steven Spielberg's words, a high-concept film is one in which you can describe the whole plot and theme in less than 25 words. If you can do that, then you have a hit film. While up to this time, films generally opened in the major venues first (New York and Los Angeles), and gradually opened in more and more locations, the premiere of JAWS led to what is known as saturation opening. JAWS opened in approximately 400 theaters the weekend of July 4th, 1975. This strategy worked very well for JAWS, which grossed $7 million in its opening weekend. What also helped in the success in JAWS was the media, in TV and print form. One image dominated posters, newspapers and magazines at the time of JAWS' release, and that image featured a naked woman swimming along the surface as a huge phallic shark rises up towards her. The image was accompanied by various different tag lines, but realistically, it didn't matter what the it said-the complete image of a shark, teeth agape, rising up towards a beautiful young woman had a lasting effect on whomever saw the ad. As powerful as the print images were, music played a huge role in the promotion of JAWS. On the radio and television, composer John Williams' now-legendary \"JAWS theme\" was heard for the first time. The film ran throughout the summer of '75, breaking every box-office record and becoming the number one moneymaker of all time, only to be eventually ousted from that coveted spot by another Spielberg picture, E.T. In an age of overly-inflated movie ticket prices and multiple viewings, JAWS, the first high concept film that redefined and resurged a lagging Hollywood film industry back in the '70s, remains in the top twenty profit-making films of all time, and also this writer's favorite film. Thank you for the time.",

Robert Shaw's Quint is really not particularly believable, but he is an extremely entertaining charicature of people that you might know. The smarmy mayor does a good job of satirizing politicians, and when we are not busy being sad about the people who were eaten, we are a bit happy that he gets his comeuppance. We are also amused by the Police Chief, who in spite of the fact that he hates the water chooses to live on an island and find himself in a treacherous marine adventure.

You take away that character, and the film loses a lot.Also, although probably not true, sometimes I wonder if the fact of Robert Shaw not being an american had anything to do with his disregard as an oscar nominee in this film, for his portrayal of Quint.Without Quint, this movie wouldn't even be half of what it became.",

In a sense, I do not want to learn too much. I simply enjoy his work.I appreciate that, though his kind of film making might have undermined the making of small films, Mr. Spielberg has always been conscientious about celebrating good movies. The interplay of simply effects (or simply looking effects) such as the classic line, \"You're going to need a bigger boat.\" I am not profoundly impressed with some reviews and analysis of this film, though some ideological criticism amuses me. Again, I avoid too much analysis here. The finale of the movie with two protagonists swimming in from the sea has a lightness of tone and humour that crowns a splendid summer outing.

In the reefs, I got up to 10 feet from the 6-foot water monster and clicked up while the charter boat was blaring horns and intercoms to warn everyone to swim back immediately. A wack Taiwanese dude ripped it off from me years later.So, Great White Sharks are IN REALITY HARMLESS CREATURES. They are picked on by Orca, (who somehow managed to get their own \"Free Willy\" propaganda and Michael Jackson garbage) and have no natural advantages at all except that they are IMMORTAL SHARKS. Sharks can live centuries and do not need to reproduce, breathe, or procreate in any way. In fact, Great White Sharks' functionality of body movement limits them, greatly. If you were even being mistakenly charged at by a Great White, (because maybe you were swimming in tuna schools,) chances are you would swim very easily out of its way if you didn't exert fright (which all animals can sense.)\nSteven Spielberg ruined summers around the world, forever. Thanks guy.

            "content": "In the small tourist town of Amity Island, a woman is attacked by a shark while she is skinny-dipping. This causes many people, including the police chief, Martin Brody, to want to shut down all beaches until the problem is solved. However, the mayor, Larry Vaughn, disagrees and refuses to shut down all beaches, saying that it will cripple the tourist revenue and destroy the town. Brody, with the help of Ichthyologist Matt Hooper and ship captain Quint, embarks on an adventure to capture the beast, in an epic man vs. nature battle. The 1975 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, is an excellent horror that plays specifically on the fears of death and sharks. The cast of this film includes names like Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton, Peter Benchley, and many more.\nSteven Spielberg uses an excellent form of horror to portray how frightening this shark really is, suspense. The suspense throughout the whole movie is used in more than one way. It is used through knowing what is going to happen to people before they even know it and just waiting for it to happen and through the main point of the film, the shark. In one of the scenes towards the beginning of the film, you see the mayor, Larry Vaughn, strolling down the beach line telling every tourist he sees to go and test the water. Sending them to what is going to end up a date with a killer shark. The suspense through this part of the movie is shown perfectly throughout everyone in the scene, as a viewer, I knew exactly what was going to happen to those people, but the suspense that I felt and the horror of just waiting for the shark to make quick work of them ate me up and made me even more frightened than I should have.\nThe film also uses suspense when it comes to the main part of this film, the killer beast, the shark. While you may not think that the shark is very suspenseful because you never see it chasing something or swimming up to the boat. That is exactly why it is one of the most suspenseful parts of this film because you never do see the shark do any of those things, you hardly ever see the shark at all. While I was doing some research on why Jaws was such an effective horror movie I found a quote from Alfred Hitchcock, this quote said \"A bomb is under the table, and it explodes: That is a surprise. The bomb is under the table but it does not explode: That is suspense.\" I feel that this quote explains Spielberg's work and just shows why his work was so effective. If the shark was seen at the beginning it would have been a surprise that one time. It wouldn't be a surprise anymore after that one time because you've already seen the shark one time, you've already seen what it can do, it just gets normal at that point until the movie is over. But keeping the shark \"under the table\" builds the suspense up, not ever being able to see it, but only the carnage of what it has done puts this shark as the center of attention. This film definitely played a more effective role on people that are more frightened by psychological horror, like me, not knowing when or what is going to happen but knowing at some point, it is going to happen.\nMy overall view on this movie is that at the time, this was an excellent horror film that played on the roles of psychological horror well through suspense, and to this day, still has the same amazing effects. I recommend this movie to anybody who has a fear of sharks, oceans, or just fear of not knowing because that is one of the biggest factors in this movie. Not being able to know what is happening to people, not being able to know what the shark is doing, not being able to know when the shark is going to attack, and not being able to know when the shark is going to stop causing havoc in the oceans of this small tourist town called Amity Island. If I had to give this film a rating off of pure enjoyment, it would definitely be an A-plus. Jaws is one of my all-time favorites and I love how it always keeps me on the edge of my seat and waiting for the next crucial moment to happen. I enjoyed this movie more than many horror films that I have watched because it wasn't just jump scares, it was the psychological work that made the horror in this film so effective. Rating the film based on horror and how effective it is, I would rate it a B. I don't believe that it would be effective to all because there weren't many jump scares, at least what I would consider a jump scare. It was mainly all suspense and psychological horror, and if you don't find that effective the movie wasn't as scary or frightening as it possibly could've been for the viewer.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg said (and still say) that \"Jaws\" was the most difficult movie he ever had to make. We, poor mortal moviegoers, can't really approve this assertion, but we'll take it as true.However, if this statement is really true, then we can say if this hard-working job was rewarding or not. Fortunately for Spielberg, his shark nightmarish project became one of the most glorious movies of its kind and a landmark in Hollywood history.That kind of hellish shooting mood was also felt by Francis Ford Coppola during the making of \"Apocalypse Now\" and there again, we can see that it was rewarding. But just imagine if \"Godzilla\" makers said that their movie was a difficult one to make...\"Jaws\" is a very particular film. Not only in its story, but especially on the legacy it gives to the whole film industry. It was the first movie to break the nine-digit profit (and thus becoming the highest-grossing film ever at the time), the one that established summertime as the dominant period of the year for cinema and one of the greatest \"high concept\" films of all time.\"Jaws\" has a very simple story and relatively simple characters. But it succeeds, simply because it doesn't try to force itself to become more interesting. It stays simple and the natural flow takes on.The synopsis could be summarized with these six little words: \"A shark attacks a coastal town.\" This shark, a dangerous Great White as we learn, tries to get a meal from the local swimmers and it terrorizes the little summer town. With the profitable season rolling in and the big national holiday approaching, the mayor doesn't want to get the beaches closed but as a near-fatality involves the son of police chief Brody (Roy Scheider), things get more and more serious.This first part of the movie is good. Very good, actually. But it's only a curtain-raiser for the really interesting part which is the hunt for this devil-sent shark on the ocean.The three passengers are: Brody, oceanographer Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and experienced mariner and former WWII soldier Quint (Robert Shaw). The triangle interaction between them and the shark hunt are the only elements that we need in order to get the great show we want.Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw offer performances which are among their personal best ones. Scheider, as Chief Brody, shows that he is a skillful police officer but that he has a great fear of water. Dreyfuss is the near-nerd and he is very convincing.Shaw is perhaps the best of the three. He plays his role of fisherman with solid professionalism and his jargon can only give more credibility. But it's his two monologues which moves him above the other characters. First, he introduces himself to the other citizens in town and he sets the table for his later appearance. Second, his unforgettable speech about his dramatic experience aboard the USS Indianapolis (\"We delivered the bomb\") and the tragedies of the soldiers who died attacked by sharks is unarguably fascinating and it ranks as one of the greatest monologues ever delivered by any character in any modern movie.Other than the three major characters, \"Jaws\" impresses with its pre-ILM special effects. The mechanical shark (nicknamed \"Bruce\") looks so real that we forget its artificial nature. More impressive, we can feel its personality by its cruel attacks on weak humans and on Quint's boat and also by its empty black eyes.The underwater camera shooting of the swimmers' legs, accompanied by John Williams' Oscar-winning cello score, is already legendary. This is the kind of shot that is repetitive but surprisingly never spoils the suspense. On the contrary, watching the legs approaching from the camera with the tempo speeding up is exhilarating and frightening.I don't like that the shark be killed with a bottle of compressed air, but it provides some great elements anyway. The visual shooting of the shark 'explosion' is impeccable, but it's the music that hooked me. Instead of hearing a triumphing fanfare of trumpets, drums and flutes, we find ourselves listening to a sad succession of falling piano notes, which gives the impression that the shark's death is tearful instead of happy and resolving.At only 29, Spielberg showed what kind of path he would take with \"Jaws\" for the rest of his career and the famed shark movie remains one of its greatest thrilling rides, as well as the very definition of contemporary commercial cinema.But in a sense, even if it's a supremely good movie, there's some kind of bitterness in its legacy. \"Jaws\" showed to the world that cinema was not only an artistic mean, but also a very efficient money-making business. This is sad, because it opened the doors for a new generation of filmmakers, driven by the attract of money and totally uninterested in the artistic side of movie-making. And this reflects Spielberg's entire career.But everybody has its own opinion. This is mine and I share it. But it is still possible that commercially-successful flicks become loved gems by critics as well as spectators. \"Jaws\" is one of them. And only Spielberg's vision was good enough to support the movie's ambitions. Just look at the sequels...To finish, here's a suggestion. If you go to the beach, bring a cello. You could get much attention...",

            "content": "This movie is widely known to many people all over the world. Even though they haven't actually seen the film or seen it completely. Why is that? It is because Jaws has left an image on the cultural collective mind. It is an image of the fear of the unknown that lingers in the dark (waters) and waits to come up and swallow up man. An archaic image of fear that is buried deep inside of mankind and was portrayed by cultures at all times: giant serpents living in lakes, the spirits of ancestors in the woods with the Native Americans, demons, ghosts etc. The very first victim scene where Chrissie is attacked from under the water shows this archaic fear clearly and has become an icon for the movie itself, similar movies, commercial spots, t-shirts, etc.Most people in the Western civilization cannot jump into the ocean anymore without having at least a glimpse of JAWS in mind. The archaic fear has got a new clear image of a Great White Shark. If someone makes these sounds \"dun-dun-dun-dun\" almost everybody has immediately the same pictures in mind of a menacing shark approaching. This film is a masterpiece in making, acting and scoring.Young Spielberg may have had more luck and balls than real knowledge and life long experience in making this movie. CEOs at Universal got very angry about him but still had confidence in him. Of course he didn't invent this genre and this didn't came out of nothing. Predecessors like Creature from the Black Lagoon, Revenge of the Creature, Moby Dick, 20.000 Leagues Under the Sea have prepared this field. And Spielberg and John Williams borrowed a lot from them, especially Creature from the Black Lagoon, where we find the same musical theme \"dun-dun\" twenty years before Jaws. But in the end it is what it is and the audience decides whether they like a movie or not - for Jaws generations have considered it a masterpiece and inspiration for following directors.So why do so many new movies about sharks suck? In my opinion they do because they concentrate on the shark, not on the story or archaic fear. That's what Spielberg did, concentrate on the story and fear, having all the trouble with the mechanic shark he had no other choice either. Maybe there is an unwritten law shining through: great difficulties on set make great movies.",

This film is known for its fair amount of jump scares, good acting, and great resolutions. With 4 movies in the franchise JAWS knows how to create thrills. SHARKNADO, OPEN WATER, and THE SHALLOWS are all great examples of what JAWS has contributed to horror movies.www.chorror.com",

            "content": "I remember seeing Jaws in the summer of 1975,I thought it was amazing then and 31 years on it's still as just as good. Every time I see this film is like seeing it for the first time again.I don't know how many times I've seen Jaws,but,I'm guessing it must be in excess of 20 and I never seem to tire of it. This is one of the only film's I have ever watched were you know what's going to happen next and you don't want to fast forward or skip to the next scene.Dreyfuss,Shaw and Scheider are brilliant together. The film is witty & frightening, with a perfect balance struck between these two elements throughout. A case in point is Robert Shaws recounting of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis and the shark attacks on the survivors which is immediately followed by the trio singing a jovial version of \"Show me the way to go home\". Robert Shaws performance as a \"on the edge\" character is truly memorable and his rendition of \"Ladies of Spain\" (I don't know the real name of the song, so this description will have to do)sticks in your head for days after the film. Finally,The movies score is terrific and atmospheric and keeps you on the edge of your seat during the attack scenes.A classic movie score that will live forever. One of my all time favorites,so 10/10 for Jaws (the original), Brilliant.",

            "content": "Jaws is one of those instant classics that affect anyone who watches it in any new generation. Just watch, 20 years from now people are going to be just as scared as they were 31 years ago. The movie is what TRUE horror movies are, with the Alfred Hitchcock style of not really seeing the blood and gore during most of the movie, as well as terror and suspense at an all time high.When a young woman's remains wash up on a beach by a Long Island town named Amity, the only person who suspects something more sinister than a boating accident is the chief of police ,played by Roy Scheider. He thinks it was a shark, and the only person who believes him is a shark expert ,played by Richard Dreyfuss, who concludes that it is a Great White who is responsible.Instead of listening to the warnings to shut the beaches down, the mayor of the town continues to hold them open. After all, the next day is the Fourth of July, and they really can't shut the beaches down on the biggest tourist attraction event of the year can they? So the beaches remain open and the worst happens. A young boy is attacked by a shark and killed. After several decisions and arguments on what to do, the one thing agreed on is that an expedition needs to hunt the shark down and kill it. In enters an old mariner named Quint ,played by Robert Shaw, who leads the Sheriff and Shark Specialist in a hunt for the shark to kill it.The sequence on the boat during the second half of the movie is worth the price of the DVD alone. The three men realize that the shark is hunting them, instead of the other way around. Despite shooting at it, harpooning it, and even trying to drag it home, what happens in the end is what made people respect horror films for what real movie making is.If you haven't seen the movie you have no idea what you are missing. Just be sure to go on that beach trip BEFORE watching the film, trust me...",

            "content": "Long before Spielberg got interested in dinosaurs, extra-terrestrials, Jews etc, the most deadly predator on the planet caught his attention - The Great White Shark and thus was created one of the best thrillers in cinema History. The plot is simple - A chirpy, happy sea town named Amity which is famous for it's beach-tourism faces the deadliest challenge in the form of a man-eating great white. Three people namely the Police Chief of Amity, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), a local fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw) and a marine scientist, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) take it upon themselves to get rid of the man-eater and save Amity. Are they successful in doing so and what will be the cost they will pay defines the movie plot. The plot is simple, but Spielberg takes this weak plot to an all together different level with his direction. His efforts are supported by his special effects team without which this movie would not have been possible. The movie is not all about fear and screams, it has it's comic moments and the touchy emotional moments as well. Spielberg has mixed these emotions perfectly and the outcome is brilliant.What can I say about the acting, when the protagonist of the movie is A Great White Shark.The Shark plays hide and seek with the audience most of the times and is seen only for some minutes at the end. In between the 3 'Human' actors, Robert Shaw impressed me the most in his short role as a sturdy fisherman. In short, Jaws is a movie, any true Hollywood Fan wouldn't want to miss. Rating : 8/10",

The true entertainment of the movie is in the interaction between the three main characters.  This is one of Robert Shaw's greatest performances.  He flawlessly pulls off the scarred veteran sailor. Scheider and Dreyfuss are above average here as well, though they are pale in comparison to Shaw.  I rated this movie a 9/10, and I only failed to give it a 10 because of the horribly fake shark effects and the extremely unrealistic final \"battle\" between the shark and Scheider's character.  I have this movie on DVD and I watch it often.  Listening to the characters react to one another is all the entertainment this movie needs.",

But I'm going to deep this movie is just great fun brilliant acting 3 very fine actors to my mind Robert Shaw is especially brilliant as the mad ex sailor who has a grudge against sharks ever since he was on the USS Indianapolis which was sunk and subsequently half the crew were eaten alive not surprising, and Brody as just a sheriff who has to come to terms with the fact that horrors like this do exist ,and finally Harper who has that typical Dreyfuss brash brat attitude about him who thinks that sharks are wonderful creatures and that is what makes the film so great 3 different men three different ideals one total horror linking them",

Well we went to the beach the next day and it was packed, oh there were bikinis and people playing beach games and all that. but not one persons toe touched that water. Peter Benchley did not obviously know what kind of fright he was creating. I understand that this story is based on facts but as all good story's, he twisted a few things around to create a horror classic. And Steven Spielberg only 28 years old incredible photography what an eye that man has. And of course Robert Shaw, Rob Schnider, and last but definitely not least Richard Dryfeuss all played there parts to well.

Then he selected 27-year-old Steven Spielberg to direct, although the guy had only made a single feature film before (The Sugarland Express). The studio counted on a fairly simple shoot and aimed to have the movie ready for a Christmas premiere 1974.In the movie, a New England coastal resort is terrorized by a giant white shark. Three men head out in a small fishing boat to kill it.Unfortunately, problems arose immediately. Spielberg wanted to avoid shooting at the studio lot, and instead took the entire film crew to Martha's Vineyard on the east coast. Where there were difficulties with the unruly ocean, annoying crowds of curious tourists and the constant need to revise Peter Benchley's manuscript. But the biggest concern was caused by Bruce, the mechanical shark.Bruce (so named after Steven Spielberg's lawyer) was built in three different versions, each with its own, specialized function. The first one sank, while the second exploded. It was only with the third, automated shark that the director was able to finish his film. But by now the shoot was so far over the schedule, that the crew believed they had a real disaster on their hands.\"Jaws\" was supposed to be opening for Christmas 1974, but because of all the delays it was pushed back to the summer of the following year. Back then, that was traditionally the time when the worst movies were dumped into theaters as people typically enjoyed the outdoors instead. But Universal aggressively marketed the film as an \"event\", especially in expensive, primetime spots on TV. And it worked. \"Jaws\" became the first movie to return over $100 million to its studio. The exciting era of the \"Summer Blockbuster\" was upon us.",

            "content": "What can I say. This is one of the finest horror movies ever made. You will never look at your goldfish the same way again. And out of 187 reviews (188 after this one is put on) only four are bad (Shame on you four)I first saw it on TBS and even the edited version scared the crap out of me. Schieder is terrific as the water fearing Chief of Police. Dreyfuss is at his best as the the young shark expert. Hamilton and Gary are excellent in their supporting roles. However, I think Shaw (an often underrated actor)was the best. He actually becomes Quint. The chilling Indianapolis speech (Which he had a hand in writing) is one of the best scenes in cinematic history. Not only does it transport you to the chilly waters of 1945, it seems he isn't reading lines from a script. He narrates it like he was there. That is the gift of a true actor. What's particularly hard to believe is that he was the THIRD choice for the role of Quint. Lee Marvin was the first, and Sterling Hayden was the second. It's hard to imagine them giving the type of performance that Shaw did.This is the film that put Spielberg on the map. And gave him the most headaches. One of the main reasons the shark is only seen towards the end of the film was the fact that the shark rarely worked. However, the lack of the shark is what really gives it suspense. It gives you the chance to build up the horror for yourself before you actually see it. Another great touch is the fact that there is a humourous line just before the shark appears. And who cares if the shark is rubber? what's scarier, a rubber shark or a computer generated shark? Neither, if that's all you're worried about. Personally, I didn't think the shark looked phony. One of the more interesting things is that when it came to casting JAWS, the shark was considered the star of the show. They didn't concentrate on getting huge stars. They got ACTORS. That's what pays off. Due to the sucess, Spielberg, Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfuss became major stars(though sadly, Shaw died not long after in 1978).\nAll in all, this is definitely a must see. However, it's better to get the unedited version that to watch it on TBS or TNT. Check it out, you will not be dissapointed.10/10*****/*****",

            "content": "\"Jaws\" was Steven Spielberg's breakout film and one of the most shocking summer blockbusters to hit theaters before the turn of the century. The film centers on a young police chief and his quest (along with other character's) to find and kill a monstrous, great white shark. \"Jaws\" can be seen as one of the best horror classics ever put to celluloid, and for good reason.While the film is plot driven, John William's menacing score creates a unique mood of terror and paranoia, striking fear into anyone who watches the film. The score has become iconic (much like most of John Williams' work) and is instantly recognizable with the idea of a prowling, killer shark. Where \"Jaws\" succeeds the most has a lot to do with editing and pacing of the film. A movie with mainly dialogue scenes that promises killer sharks can have the great potential to bore. Fortunately, Verna Fields edited and paced \"Jaws\" with little to no mundane or uninteresting content. Every scene is there for a reason and even during the \"break\" periods in between the peril, we still can't take our eyes off the screen and characters.Given the modern takes on horrific shark disaster movies, it's well known that a lot can go wrong in the screen writing department. Luckily \"Jaws\" and it's script is air-shut tight with little to no gaps. The story is compelling from the first scene to the very last, and while it isn't the best looking movie in 1975, it definitely might compete for the most entertaining. Having a young director with a risky summer movie idea was bold choice, but the rest of the world has benefited from gamble. We're treated to one of the best classics available with great performances, unique direction, and one hell of an entertaining movie.",

I'll give you some points to think about it:These two films starts with a very impressive and scaring scene (Chrissie's death and the Omaha Beach sequence)They've got two main monologues, which make you move; the Indianapolis story and the Captain Miller's monologue about his life as High School Teacher.Spielberg prefers to show the impressive things using his characters, I mean, when Hendricks found Chrissie's hand, we see his face full of horror before watching the hand; in the same way, Captain Miller's slow motion sequences shows his point of view of the war horror.In Jaws, the starrings prepare a cage to hunt the shark; it's a unvoiced scene, you just hear the great William's music; in Saving Private Ryan, when the characters are in Rammel, they prepare traps for the Germans; Spielberg doesn't use any dialogue in that scene, just William's music. If you pay attention, you'll find these two scenes very similar not only as a film but as a music film.Spielberg uses a lot of graphical violence, something he hasn't used since Jaws - despite Schindler's List, that I don't find as graphical as Jaws or Saving Private Ryan.",

            "content": "***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS *****This is it! The film that launched a revolution in film making and made Steven Spielberg a household name!As we begin yet another season of summer blockbuster entries, I can't help but give credit to the movie that started the trend. I was just a little girl, growing up on Long Island, when I begged my mother to take me to see JAWS and afterward, it took me another 2 years before I would venture out into the ocean again! What I love about JAWS is that it was more than just a casual popcorn horror flick. It has good acting, drama, suspense, action and even some humor. It's hard to believe that it was filmed on a restricted budget and plagued by equipment failures and delays that extended the filming several months beyond it's schedule. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that Spielberg originally planned to release JAWS in the late summer of 1974. The countless delays caused filming to run into the fall of 74. Rather than open the film to a winter audience, Spielberg chose to wait until the height of the following summer to release JAWS where it would have the strongest impact. This proved ingenious. The summer blockbuster was born and the rest is box office history! With today's technological advancements and computerized special effects, not to mention the overblown, unoriginal, popularity of remakes, it may surprise some that nobody has ever attempted to remake JAWS. However, after seeing the film, you'll quickly realize that this is because nobody could ever match the action, horror, chilling suspense, and tension between the characters than in the original. The acting is first-rate, particularly by the late Robert Shaw. The cinematography is quite good considering the challenges the film crews faced filming out on the ocean. Even \"Bruce\", the robotic shark that was built for the film, with all of his mechanical failures, is quite convincing in his scenes. One in particular is near the climatic ending where the shark breaks into the sinking ship, opens his mouth wide, threatening Chief Brody, and you see pieces of torn flesh and blood from his previous victim in his teeth! It still gets me, even today!The bottom line is, if you want to see a really entertaining summer film, definitely rent or buy this one! You will not be disappointed!Rating: 9.5/10",

            "content": "\"Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies...\" - when I first saw Jaws, I don't even remember the crusty Robert Shaw saying those words, in fact I hardly remember any of the dialogue from the film.  What I do remember, though, was the incredibly frightening fin of the man-eating great white. How it used to glaze on up out of the water like a knife as the ominous thumping of John William's orchestra filled the air with horror.  That was the sign to bury your face into the pillow as the voices of panic began to increase in pitch and power. Needless to say, I was afraid, and still am to a degree, to go into the pool alone. The power and ferocity and terror of Jaws scared me to death when I was five years old, but now it remains on the top ten list of my all time favorite movies. Jaws was something of a problem for me when I was younger.  My parents would say they were going to watch Jaws on the T.V. just to get me out of the living room and into bed.  Now, when I actually sit down and watch the movie (for the thousandth time) it actually is a quite beautiful film.  The dialogue that goes on between Shaw, Schieder, and Dreyfuss is incredible. Shaw delivers an awesome performance - especially in his U.S.S Indianapollis speech.  Dreyfuss and Schieder are both funny and serious and terrified and don't know what to make of Shaw - and my feelings are that the audience doesn't either.  Shaw is not your typical hero, but he is a great character anyway. The real jewel to the film is the score, however.  John Williams, as in all his music, captures the audience in the deadly melody which is mesmirizing, beautiful, adventurous, deadly, bold, and simple all at the same time.  The chase music is especially fun to listen to, but the theme of the music is what everyone remembers. This is such an incredible movie and is not something that you see very often nowadays.  I give it a 10/10 and encourage all who have not experienced the magic of Jaws to get up and go rent it!",

Now saying that, you may think that I am a middle-aged man who saw this film when it came out in theaters and remembers the hype of the day. I'm not. I'm 17, was born in '89, and saw this film six years ago, and loved it ever since.Being 11 when I first saw this film, I only liked the gore and cool shark scenes. Being older and a bigger appreciator of cinema, I understand the amazingness and complexity that goes into this movie. If you are anything more than the average movie-goer, you know this movie is more than a \"Dun-dun-duh! Shark is killing everyone! Dun-dun-duh!\" The movie is about the responsibilities of the town's police chief and a marine biologist. Or, more simply, it's about characters. Without the amazingly written characters, this film would probably be nothing.The characters are what drive the plot of the movie. The characters are so amazingly written that some of the most memorable scenes in the film don't involve the shark at all. The boat night scene is one of my all-time favorite scenes in movie history. In case you can't remember, it's the scene in which Hooper and Quint share the scars they've received in shark hunting, then Quint tells his story of being on the USS Indianapolis, and the men sing \"Show me the way to go home.\" The scene provides laughs, chills, and tears. Laughs at the cracks the men make while showing scars, chills when you hear Quint's terrifying story on the sinking boat, and tears when you feel the men's desolation on the boat as they sing. And you thought this was a shark movie.But I don't say that in mockery of the movie's shark scenes. The shark is what drives the movie and it provides some of the greatest horror moments in cinematic history. The shark, nicknamed Bruce, is one of my all-time favorite horror icons. But although this movie is driven by and focused on a shark, I do not think it's right to consider this a shark movie. Again, it's about characters reacting to the shark, and how they try to live their lives with this fear of the unknown in the water. Creating a story in that context, creating a movie not about the creature, but the FEAR and the COPING of the creature...that is a challenge. Steven Spielberg, Carl Gottlieb, Peter Benchley...all the writers participated, they delivered that concept in the perfect way ever done. This movie is a triumph that will always stand the test of time.10/10. My absolute favorite horror movie.P.S. Don't see the sequels. Or just don't expect a millionth of the same brilliance.",

In fact, it was my mother's favorite and was the first movie that we ever rented as soon as they were available on the market in the early 80s. And there were two scenes that just HORRIFIED me and still produce a shock each time -- the part where the head pops out of the sunken boat and the part where the Skipper gets his. Since then the part where the guy's leg falls off into the ocean floor has pretty much rivaled that scene's scariness.However none of those were very realistic attacks. The most realistic one was the first one -- the girl in the bay. There's probably attacks like that in seaside resorts all over every whenever. And that is the part where you learn not to trick a shark into thinking you are a seal.However, in none of these were mentions of the very FACT that a shark CAN swim anywhere up to half-way down the Amazon and even into the New Jersey channel as long as the water remains, \"brackish\" -- that is, a hybrid of salt & fresh water. And my question is, \"why?\" It would seem logical. After all, Spielberg and Benchley would have you believe that a shark intentionally seeks out a human or even boat victim like it had a radar or something when that's the furthest thing from reality. One such race of shark is the bull-shark, though there are others, and I wouldn't doubt that the Great White would be among them. Yet, nowhere in the film did it even think of doing such things as has been found in real-life, supposedly.7 is the highest rating that I've gave a film so far, and I probably won't go much further than that because no film's perfect. However this one, for a mid-70s thriller, isn't bad. It's just a bit repetitive because it's over 30 and is on all the time. So I gave it that because it has never really worn out and still manages to have its moments at least. However, I had to knock off points because it too is capable of insulting my intelligence and has also been somewhat responsible for genocide of sharks worldwide. At least though, it did inspire others to learn more about them.An overall very powerful and unique film and book alike.",

It is written by Carl Gottlieb (Jaws Franchise, The Jerk) and Peter Benchley (Jaws franchise, The Deep) who also wrote the book. It stars Roy Scheider (Jaws franchise, The French Connection, 2010), Richard Dreyfuss (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, American Graffiti, Pirhana 3D) and Robert Shaw (The Sting, From Russia with Love, A Man for All Seasons).Jaws is about a small town called Amity who begins to be terrorized by a rogue shark. The sheriff (Roy Scheider) gets a crew of three including a scientist (Peter Benchley) and an odd fisherman (Robert Shaw) to go after it.What makes this film most famous is probably the incredible soundtrack by John Williams (Harry Potter franchise, Star Wars franchise) writes an incredible score that has now become famous. Just listening to the theme of this movie will make you frightened and nervous about what you know is bound to happen on screen eventually. It won best score at the Oscars and is now synonymous with anything having to do with sharks.Another aspect of this film is Robert Shaw's performance as Quint, a crazy fisherman who becomes obsessed with catching the shark. Anytime he is on screen he downright steals the scene. His performance will be looked upon as the classic crazy fisherman and will be copied until the end of time. Every time I watch him I see something new and he never seems to disappoint. While the special effects of this film might've been great for the time, sometimes they do not hold up as well as we remember. However despite that, this is an action-packed, dramatic film that will be remembered until the end of time and really brought Steven Spielberg's name to be as famous as it is now.",

I sat down and watched it excepting a typical horror movie, ala nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th. Instead i got so much more then that.  For anyone who calls themselves a movie collector who hasn't seen JAWS i advise you to get it.The opening sequence when Chrissie Watkins gets killed is cinema magic. Then shark is never shown yet it gives us an uneasy feeling of \"what if?\". What if we had of seen the shark? what gore is it unleashing on this poor girl?  If they had of showed it, there is no way that the scene would have been as scary. Instead Spielberg gives us he IMPRESSION of what is happening.Alex  Kintner's death is much the same.  We see blood although we do NOT see violence.  Our imagination is much worse then the actual truth.\nThen the Orca scenesThe bad chemistry that is going between Hooper and Quint is very obvious. Then you have Brody who is the common man.  He earns a common salary, being the police chief of a common town with a common wife and common kids.  He is US!!.  The average person.  He has fears, he has family he has a connection to us.  His flash of courage in the ending is very uncommon. When Brody breaks the style from ordinary man to extraordinary man is the key to the movie.  It ends up as a  monster battling (in the end) an ordinary man.\nThe movie of JAWS is not only a definitive point of Steven Spielberg, but the entire horror genre.  The thought of being killed when you went swimming is unimaginable... until JAWS.   After that film people are, and still are today, scared of swimming because of this movie.  If a film of this magnitude has this effect on so many people, then there is no question that you have to see it.**** 1/2",

Most of all, it really does change the way you think about the water. I, for one, can never again swim in the ocean without hearing John Williams' score in my head and imagining a dorsal fin just off to my left...ugh. But why is that so special? Whoever thought about camping the same way after Friday the 13th, who thought about answering the phone alone after Scream, and picking up strangers after The Hitcher? Yes, it makes you afraid to go into the water, but it IS a film about a killer shark, so shouldn't it do that anyways? Any director could have made you afraid of a shark, who isn't? People act like they were never afraid of anything in the ocean until they saw this movie. Like they never heard of a shark until this. Hello, it was 1975, people were swimming in the sea millions of years before the movie, and yes, they were all afraid of sharks. All Jaws did was bring your attention to it more. Personally when the shark was not eating, I was really bored. Sure, the characters were fine, but I wanted more action. What I get is the three main actors hunting the shark forever (it seemed like that long) on a boat and getting on each others' nerves. Not one of the greatest films of all time. Slow paced, dull, and downright uninteresting except when the shark attacks. I watched it once, but I wouldn't watch it again. Not unless I was really bored. WAY overrated and illogical (sharks don't feed on humans as a food source) and I can't believe it's so popular. WHAT is it about this movie?",

I remembered the shark being in this movie much more, and killing many more people, but the actual film is different. Instead, the film relies much more on suspense than on shock \u0096 you know the shark is out there, but you don't know where he is or when he will appear. It makes the time he does appear than much more powerful.There's a lesson to be learned here, filmmakers: less is more.  The anticipation of the event is much more powerful than the event itself. Hitchcock understood that; Spielberg understands it (or did back when he made `Jaws,' not too sure anymore).  A movie need not move from shock to shock, from special effect to stunt; if there is a story, it will have legs of its own.  `Jaws' works because it plays on our fear of the unknown, of being eaten alive, of the deep water and what might be down there.  It's real fear, much more personal and chilling than any werewolf or vampire because we know there are such things in the oceans.",

This film did something that is pretty hard for other movies to do when it comes to me...It made me CARE for the characters and really managed to keep me completely stiff-frozen in my seat. For those who haven't seen the movie...Quick! Get out to the next store and buy it, because this one is worth holding tightly on to!First of all. The character build-up is wonderful and the three main characters are so well portrayed that you desperately don't want anything to happen to them. Clearly the acting-formation of the three R-es (as I like to call them, Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and last but certainly not least...Richard Dreyfuss) works remarkably well!1. Roy Scheider has this extraordinary thing about him that makes you like him instantly as the character chief Martin Brody.2. Robert Shaw was just magnificent as Captain Quint, and I even go as far as saying that his speech on the boat was Oscar-worthy3. Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper is really very funny and truly a necessary, like-able character (my favorite one in the movie). His laughs are the best!Second: Director Steven Spielberg and his staff are able to make so suspenseful moments that you almost jump out of your seat in excitement! I mean...you don't even see the shark until in the second-half of the movie and although you cant't see him...He STILL scares the crap out of you! Third: The directing is, of course, top-notch (we're talking about Steven Spielberg here..so...I don't even have to mention it) and the amazing view of the ocean and scenery is also beautiful.Fourth: The story grabs your attention right away and keeps you amazed all the way through. (again...We're talking about Steven Spielberg, the master of story-telling but it is also true that it is based on a novel).Fifht: The music score is incredibly good, also given that it is one of the movie's trademark yet still to this very day, today.Sixth: It Makes you afraid of sharks after-wards! I can't imagine how uncomfortable many people must feel when they go swimming in the ocean after such a film like this!In the end, I must say that after I saw Jaws for the first time, I couldn't stop thinking about it later...and when a movie does that to you, it really means that it has something special to offer the rest of you movie-goers. Considerably, Jaws is one of the best movies I've seen in my whole life....\"You're gonna need a bigger boat\" cause Jaws is too much filled with excitement to fit in yours!",

We are perfectly in touch with the characters and their motives, and his ability to make a rubber shark 25 years ago that still scares you is simply amazing.However Spielberg has often said that JAWS would not have been half the success it was if it wasn't for the score, and he is absolutely right. John Williams had his finest moment to date when he sat down at the piano and decided to make a main theme from 3 notes. Although it would be a crime to dismiss the score as variations on a 3-note theme. The action cues are amazing, and the recently released soundtrack is a must for every film-music buff.",

The cast could hardly be better with Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw all at the top of their game. John Williams' score is just about perfect. The dialog and pacing are uniformly excellent for a top-notch thriller.So where does it fall down? First of all, the animatronic shark is somewhat anticlimactic and generally unbelievable. Fortunately, it doesn't get much screen time and what it has doesn't leave the audience too much time to think. And that brings us to the second problem. Spielberg failed to achieve the suspension of disbelief that the film requires. Although the audience doesn't have quite enough time to see the holes in the plot or the shabbiness of the FX, both are lurking in the viewers' collective subconscious.Everyone should see \"Jaws\" at some point in their lives, but I can understand those from later generations wondering what the big deal was.",

The audience's imagination is MUCH more powerful than any animatronic gadget ever could be. If it were made today, there would be millions of dollars worth of CGI shark shots and it wouldn't be scary at all. Rubber and pixels don't scare us. Ideas scare us. Just give us a visual taste of shark here and there, that's all we need to scare ourselves silly.It is the idea of the unknown and what could be lurking just out of sight that makes this movie so scary. It's all about the small boat, the big ocean, and the fact that the attack could come from anywhere. And that's what makes it continue to scare you when you go near water years later. If the shark worked and our fear was based on seeing the shark, then at the beach you'd say \"well, I don't see a big rubber shark anywhere, so I'm okay\". But when it's the fear of the unknown, you go to the beach and say \"hmmm, this looks a lot like Jaws\", and you think twice about going in the water.Great performances all around, but Robert Shaw as the semi-insane shark hunter Quint is the best and most memorable in my opinion. Every line he spoke was priceless, whether it made you laugh out loud or shiver in fear. It's too bad some of his scenes were cut.This is one of those weird movies that you can watch a hundred times and still not get tired of. It gets you creeped out right from the first scene and never really lets go. Every time it's on TV I say \"well I'll just watch 5 or 10 minutes\", and before I know it I've watched the whole thing again. A masterpiece, thanks to the broken shark!",

The shark does not look REMOTELY real at all, nor does it behave like a shark in any way. Star Wars, Planet of the apes, Jurassic park, and even Alien (albeit also awful)...all used fiction. WHY use an actual living creature and portray it as just a shark that really hates certain boats? The acting is a joke, check out the rest of their \"BIG roles\". Megalodon is more accurate than this...because it's not a real creature that people swim with in the sea daily! There is no reason a shark would ever behave this way, and clearly the question asked was \"could a shark potentially hit a boat?\"...yes? Ok movie made!

Police Chief Martin Brody fears it may be sharks but is told to keep his mouth shut. Soon the creature strikes again, and now he decides to take matters into his own hands and go find and kill what may be the largest shark the world has ever seen.Let's get the problems out of the way first, because I feel as though Jaws, while very decent, isn't as scary as people say it is. Jaws genuinely made people afraid to go out in the water..in 1975. The movie itself does not age well and doesn't hold up to a more modern audience of today, although it still manages to send a chill or two down the spine.Besides not holding up well over time, this movie tends to go too long. Running at a span over a little over two hours, there's a lot that could have been cut out to make it a smooth shark movie. Some of it was character development, and I understand that, but some of it were scenes that felt stapled on or just felt out of place. The scene where the three men sing together comes to mind. Not to mention some of them were repeats of scenes produced earlier. Mainly most of the flaws were in that second half, once Brody and crew go to find the shark.But the first half is one hell of a ride from the quiet opening scene of a teenage girl being attacked while swimming, to the less subtle but more terrifying scene of a boy being swallowed completely while on a raft in broad daylight. Plus the shot of everyone running and screaming out of the water is historic, among other things. Jason or Freddy can't make THAT many people run away from them. Well, Jason did, but it was a bunch of kids. And you could feel sympathy for the creature, it's just doing what comes natural. But they won't let you. This shark will eat you if you go into the water, it's an eating machine!This movie also made me feel for the characters involved. Whether it was the main star, who just wanted to help everyone but didn't have the respect or the support, or the shark expert, or even crazy man Quint. All characters had something about them to make you genuinely care whether or not Jaws had them for lunch or not. It built them all up solidly, even Quint who before he went after the shark didn't have much screen time. This movie, even though it was PG, managed to throw in some gore. It's a killer shark, he's not going to be clean. Gushing blood, severed arm, severed head and a guy gets chewed up. Pretty good for a PG, and quite surprising given the MPAA's strict standards, which were even stricter to horror back then.I would go as far as to say that Jaws is 2/3 of one of the greatest horror films ever made. There are some genuinely terrifying moments, a pretty good adventure story thrown in, but there is 1/3 that could have been cut and just feels unneeded. However, I strongly recommend Jaws, because it's still quite good and this is a historically important film. If you haven't seen it, crawl out from the rock you've been living under and watch it.Rating: **** of *****",

So for me, it was basically a new movie minus modern overdone special effects. The film is an excellent summer fare thriller combing two solid film genres - horror and fish tale. The movie first takes you where you want to be anyway on a hot summer day - Martha's Vineyard (called Amity Island in the movie). So you're happy to go there despite rumors of troubled water. The dark, brooding Robert Shaw was the perfect choice as the old sea salt shark hunter with unresolved issues at sea, evoking themes from Moby Dick. One's horror palate was dished up early in the movie with the requisite stomach-turning images of unleashed shark carnage. Half way through the horror film, the movie turns into a delightful fish story thriller. It's a 2-fer. Shaw sets you up for the battle with an old shark war story so horrible that you know it had to be true using shark biologist Richard Dreyfuss as the foil. What comes next is enough to satisfy anyone's worst shark nightmare. Don't ask me what happens next, watch the movie. I might add, the movie builds suspense as good as any Hitchcock movie, but I found the character development a little thin in places, as as the worries a fisherman's wife should have. The movie A Perfect Storm did a better job in this department, but that movie came decades later. Roy Schneider did a pretty good job in the movie but I would have preferred George Clooney. That said, the movie comes in a solid 10 on the strength of the other factors. Richard Dreyfuss also did what he does best - go with the flow, give the movie some credibility, and stay out of the way.",

The three male leads each play their roles brilliantly...Roy Scheider as the nervy, aquaphobic police chief of Amity....Richard Dreyfuss as the daring and off beat icthyologist drawn to the terrifying great white...and Robert Shaw in excellent form as the violent half mad, shark hunter Quint, teaching both Scheider and Dreyfuss how to be men....and leading them all into a life and death struggle with a more powerful and cunning adversary than he has ever encountered. What makes this movie so memorable is that it operates on so many different levels. It is a boy's own adventure story...it is a psychological thriller...it is a horror story about a unseen predator...it is about facing an unknown environment with terrible consequences.

I guess it is the the legendary musical score, Robert Shaw, Roy Schneider, and Richard Dreyfuss's unforgettable quotes and acting, and the thrilling shark attacks. However, nothing compares to the final assault against the boat. As Roy Schneider slings the rifle over his shoulder and climbs onto the mast of the sinking boat, nothing can tear me away from the screen.Many people complain that this movie is not scary. Well, it really isn't. What it is is exciting, thrilling, and very entertaining.\nDeep Blue Sea in no way compared to this movie. Deep Blue Sea is exceptionally entertaining, however, Jaws had a realistic plot (for a shark attack movie) good acting, direction, cinematagraphy, and music. Blue Sea had none of these.\nThe ultimate shark movie.",

A 25 foot great white shark ends up swimming around the small resort town of Amity and attacks (and eats) tourists during the around the 4th of July. The local police chief, Brody (Roy Schieder), calls in shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfus) and fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) to hunt down the shark and the three set out to the ocean to hopefully get rid of it. The performances are great. Scheider, Dreyfus and Shaw deliver perfect performances but the main character is \"Bruce\" the shark, who chomps up a woman, a little boy and another guy in some disturbing sequences. Along with other performances from Lorraine Gary (who appeared in 2 other sequels) and Murray Hamilton, Jaws is a great motion picture! Just don't watch it if you plan on going in the ocean anytime soon!",

I've both the DVD and VHS version, and it's one of the few movies I can watch over and over in the same day (along with Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark). Jaws has it all - great story, great actors, and great film-making. Roy Scheider is great as Brody, making the character the most unlikely hero. Robert Shaw is also superb as Quint, the experienced fisherman who has been through a lot in his life. Richard Dreyfuss is awesome as Hooper, the marine biologist whose high tech equipment is no match for the power of the shark. Murray Hamilton is good as the mayor in denial of the evidence of the presence of the shark, until it's too late. Lorraine Gary is also good as the mother who cares about her family. And as for the shark, unlike others, I try not to notice it's technical flaws. It was 1975. I try to enjoy the other aspects of the movie. I think Spielberg and his team did a fantastic job with this classic. ****/****",

The Jaws as the name implies, a thriller can't supersede any Shark movie. I marveled at the glimpse of the way the shark attacks it's prey. The predator reminds me of the food chain. The food chain is significant because the shark feeds on human beings. It leaves the spectator heart-broken and maybe in tears. However, then the conscious reminds us that the big fish will feed on it's inferior. This is yet another symbol that the superior will dominate over the inferior and no matter what has been said that showing others as inferior is only for the cowards, juxtaposes many beliefs. Hence, in reality the superior is really a superior. The vicious circle that the stronger will hunt for the weaker continues. I am humbled to write a review for the movie.

The movie's graceful yet powerful way of dancing between the boundaries of horror, thriller, and action are what make the film so impactive, even 40 years later. Contrary to most horror films that introduce us to dark dimensions of supernatural creatures and apocalyptic worlds, Jaws, draws us deeper into the frightening reality of everyday life. The killer shark in Jaws is both similar and different than most other horror monsters. Unlike demonic spirits and infected zombies, the monster in Jaws is much more realistic and believable. The film's ever present lurking threat is what gives the film that familiar sense of eerie that conventionalizes it as a horror film, while it's elements of ordinary set it apart. The film's endearing characteristics of an average American man trying to keep his children and community safe contrast against the frighteningly dark realities of what lies beneath the water; the idea that what we cannot control is what often haunts us. Spielberg's use of camera, often switching between shots of chaotic waves and peaceful beach houses, offers a perfectly pieced view of destructiveness versus safety. The everyday terror of the film is transcended through those shots of opposing forces, recreating the familiar fear that danger can exist even in the most beautiful places.",

Of course we originally went there to see the Disney, but my dad being \"my dad\" we ended up in the Jaws theater! From the first scene I was captivated. I was so small and the screen was so big, which of course made the ocean scenes seem so overwhelming. I think I was more in my dad's seat than my dad was. I told him,\" Now dad, tell me when the shark is going to show up.\" He'd already seen it. Dad says,\" Just listen for the scary music and you'll know the shark is coming.\" Okay. That worked for a while UNTIL Ben's head rolled into the hole opening in his submerged boat! Then there was when Sheriff Brody was chumming and JAWS pops up out of the water. I think I jumped 3 ft out of my seat. Oh, it was on then! I spent the rest of the movie peeking through my fingers which were covering my eyes! I love this movie partly because it was a memory myself and my dad shared until he died, and partly because it was the first of it's kind, and the LAST (only) good shark movie. Sharks are a real threat and Jaws is the one and only good portrayal of this FEAR.

And qualified kudos can even be given for its special effects.Nevertheless, the very best thing about Jaws is its character interaction.It is with a certain amount of chagrin that I must admit to having watched this movie literally several dozen times, but I should probably mention that the vast majority of those times were confined to watching the last half of the film--the ocean-going scenes with Brody, Hooper, and Quint that my friends and I affectionately refer to as \"The Boat Scene.\"  In my view, the beauty of Jaws is that the special effects of this film are easily overshadowed by the actors and their dialogue.  It is difficult indeed (perhaps impossible) to think of another F/X-based movie where this is the case.So strong are the dialogue and character interaction of the final half of Jaws, that they rescue the film from a number of plot devices ranging from implausible (e.g., a 35' foot shark engaged in a high-speed boat chase) to the sublimely ridiculous (e.g., a 35' foot shark leaping atop a boat to capsize it).  In my view, the F/X shark is literally a secondary consideration in this film.  Sure, you couldn't have a shark film without it, but the shark alone cannot a good (or even passable) film make . . . as is amply demonstrated by the abysmal Jaws 3D and Jaws the Revenge, as well as by the truly mediocre Jaws II.It is perhaps worth admitting that the dialogue of the \"Boat Scene\" is not the only great character interaction in the film--it is simply the best. The acting in Jaws is generally pretty good, but nothing beats the \"Boat Scene\" and the actors who comprise it.  Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss are so good in this film that they clearly elevate Roy Scheider's performance. (If only Scheider's other films starred Shaw and Dreyfuss!)For the character interaction alone, Jaws is well worth watching, and it fully deserves its place among the AFI's top 100.",

They aim to prove they can show the audience something they have never seen before. And to a great extent, they succeed. But Steven Spielberg's 1975 film adaptation of the 1974 book Jaws, prided itself on what it didn't show the audience. Although the result of mechanical difficulties, the absence of any true antagonist until the films midpoint helped catapult Jaws to cult classic status. The film remains a blueprint to thriller filmmakers, a cherished memory for some, and a source of summertime terror for many more.Jaws follows the terror a great white shark preys upon the residents of Amity Island. Roy Scheider plays Chief Martin Brody, the man charged with solving the series of watery deaths who never believed anything bad could happen in Amity. Brody enlists Quint (Robert Shaw) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to set out on the ocean with him to hunt the killer shark. Although Jaws never kept me from swimming in the ocean after I saw it as a child, I still remember it whenever I enter the Pacific. The film isolates you with its seaborne protagonists and sweeps you away like the victims of the USS Indianapolis.The film's soundtrack alone is highly memorable and includes one of the greatest uses of leitmotif ever devised. From the visual perspective, the mise en sc\u00e8ne is seldom boring and calls attention to important elements with ease. Overall, Jaws best succeeds in delivering a multifaceted story where the audience feels akin to victims and Brody alike.Jaws is a work of art and directorial determination. It will remain a hallmark of thriller classics for years to come. The infamous \"da-dum\" of an approaching shark will be the subject of childhood jokes, even by those who will never see the movie.",

And Roy Scheider gives one hell of a performance as Martin Brody, really selling and grounding the idea of a giant, hateful shark into something horrific and deadly.It has its issues, however, and I don't believe it should be put up there with timeless classics of the 70s-80s like Alien(s), Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Back to the Future, among countless other hits.I guess I had to be there, I was born over 20 years after its release, but some things haven't aged well now that it's nearly half a century later.When the shark finally shows itself it definitely looks silly, and the performance of the boat captain is hard to take seriously. It drags at times. Not to the point that it hurts the film, but it is noticeable. I know its trying to build tension, but a little trimming would have done wonders.Look at Kurosawa's movies. Most of his movies have truly stood the test of time. The dated effects increase the films value now, they don't undercut it decades later. It is difficult to argue that about Jaws.Make no mistake. This is a great movie, and easily one of the best shark thrillers ever made. Its just, ever so slightly, overrated.",

Great White sharks happen to be real and every summer they are back in the news. Maybe not Great Whites per say but sharks and shark attacks along with death and near-death experiences are synonymous.This movie had everything in it.

It shares the same qualities of Halloween (1978,John Carpenter) it has that same nostalgic terror that Micheal Myers produces.

            "content": "\"Jaws\" is one of the greatest movies ever made, in my opinion and the entire world's opinion too. It's not only the story that grabs us and has us asking for more, but it's also the characters. Characters in movies like this are usually cardboard-like and one-dimensional because it's an action/suspense/horror flick and the good actors and clever characters are in more serious dramas that usually take home the Oscar for Best Actor/Actress/Picture etc. That isn't the case with \"Jaws\". This movie has fantastic acting and interesting characters unlike any ever seen in a movie before or since. The best character in the film and probably one of the best ever is Quint, the mean shark hunter. Quint is played by Robert Shaw, a fine actor who has been in a lot of great movies such as \"The Sting\" and \"The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three\". His performance in \"Jaws\" is his greatest achievement. Everything he does from his opening scene (grabbing the city council's attention by scraping his fingers down a blackboard) to his final death scene is wonderful. I can't think of a more enjoyable character to watch in a movie. Even when Quint isn't speaking, his character is through expression. Loud and opinionated, brutal yet poetic....Quint shows us a human being obsessed with a mission and conflicted with events of the past and the modern world around him. It is a character that once existed, but few have ever encountered. Quint's sea songs fill us with pride and spirit: (\"Farewell and Adieu To You Fair Spanish Ladies....\")Quint's vulgar ocean poems (The poem about 103 year old Mary Lee) give us a feeling of comfort. Quint's brilliant orders that were planned carefully and strategically: (\"Hooper!! Starbird!\" \"Hooper!! Full Throttle!\") Quint's magnificent observations, (\"You got city hands Mr. Hooper, been counting money all your life.\") show us that he is a wise man who has been all over the world and can tell a man's profession simply by glancing at his hands. Up to this point, people think that Quint is just a loud and mean old sea salt with no compassion or character structure. They're all wrong once they see the scene where Quint calmly and quietly tells the story of how he was exposed to sharks during World War 2. It gives Quint character and Spielberg lets Quint take his time in telling the story aboard the \"Orca\" - the vessel the 3 men go on to kill the shark. By giving him time to tell the story, you are allowing him to create his character and allow the viewer to put two and two together. Now you know why Quint is like that. How ironic is it when Quint's past comes back to haunt him in his final scene? A gripping and marvelous movie....Thanks to Quint.",

            "content": "The 3rd film to be released by Mr Steven Spielberg, the king of the cinema, Jaws is arguably the best . When Jaws was released, it became a worldwide hit, bringing fear to the audience about swimming in the ocean, as shown by the tag-line 'Don't go in the water' and a poster displaying a simple image of a woman swimming on the surface of the sea and a fierce looking creature at the bottom about to eat the woman. The synopsis; on a vacational island, a number of swimmers are dragged in the ocean by an underwater monster and it falls to police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider (The French Connection)), shark expert Matthew Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss (Close Encounters Of The 3rd Kind, Always)) and working class fish hunter Sam Quint (Robert Shaw (From Russia With Love)) to destroy the creature once and for all. Unusual for the horror genre due to the summery setting, Jaws depicts a truly haunting view on vacations by the sea and the scenes with Hooper swimming underwater will shock the daylights out of every film watcher who watches the film. Jaws is also highly recommended for anybody who has not seen it, because it covers the following messages; Do not swim on your own, do not swim late at night and sharks can see colors very easily.",

The opening scene in Jaws is, hands down, the most guttural, frightening scene in the history of cinema.

Spielberg will always remain a genius because of this movie, especially for his tactic of not really showing us the \"monster\" until 2/3's into the film. Brody, Quint and Hooper's unique triangular relationship is another trademark of this entertaining film. If you are one of the few people who haven't seen this movie yet, please do yourself a favor and rent this classic, but don't watch it before you plan to go swimming.",

You had too be their early in fact the queue was so long more often than not had to wait for 2 sittings before it was anywhere near your time to get in.The banter outside was good whilst you were waiting to get in, people whispering too others how many times they had seen it and telling those willing too listen how horrific it all is. Those who had'nt seen it where craning the necks too try listen into other peoples conversations about what they were about too witness, after all it had been all over the media and the first summer blockbuster I believe.Others had bought their flask, radio so we were entertained with disco music every now and again, cars were going passed honking at us and gaping at the long queue and pointing, some kids in the queue were wanting the toilet whilst the adults insisted they hang on for fear of loosing there place.lol.Every now and then a man would walk up and down,(Usher.)wearing a burgundy hat on and gloves all very posh counting and pointing with his finger to those that were in the queue silently to himself, he never ever said anything which added to the mystery.(I was only young.)Their were people fainting mainly old ladies wearing hats it was a hot summer old ladies still wore hats in those days, well the ones in Manchester did. There were also people that appeared to faint and then somehow managing to make there way stumbling and staggering towards the front of the queue head in hand then making a miraculous recovery. (How people appeared to get better once nearer to the front of the queue I shall never know.) And still remains a mystery. lol.A few youngsters selling badges with JAWS on would saunter up and down the line \"get your JAWS badges 25p\" followed swiftly by the souvenir Brochure sellers all eager to sell there wares, cinema goers were eager to buy the Brochure eager to get a glimpse of the shark,those that couldn't afford the Brochure asked others if they could share looking at the pictures with you over your shoulder, most were happy too oblige.Once in the Cinema the lights are dimmed the music starts, (you could hear a pin drop, and we had all built ourselves up.)instantly and menacingly your thrown under water, (choking for air,)brushing passed sea plants,(I thought if that shark pops up now I will surely die.)I have never seen the sea so big and powerful like this on the screen,so green and blue, dark yet clear, rushing through seaweeds and plants I thought we were going to bump into he shark, then we're back on land,(phew! big sigh of relief from the audience a few nervous giggles here and there.) Then a soothing sounding mouth organ starts playing, everyone is sitting around the camp fire nice and cosy drinking and relaxing.The first scene of Chrissie running up the sand hill \"Where you going?\" \"Swimming\" then Chrissie shouts \"come on into the water\" (More shuffling of feet and general nervousness from the audience,a few \"Oh no's\" and peeking through fingers you could feel the dread in the air.) Back too the film where we see Chrissie's drunken boy friend she just met trying too take his boots off and falling down in the process saying, \"I can swim, I just cant walk\" (The audience erupted in laughter,Then were all thrown back into that menacing sea.) too see Chrissie splashing around, then out of nowhere the music plays up, Chrissies naked body is seen in silhouette, ) the music we were all dreading and had all heard about on the News and on the Radio, I thought, Oh my god here we go its here! it was and the rest is history as they say and I held my breath.I enjoyed it so much I went too see it 16 times I loved the audience participation inside and outside of the cinema I couldn't help it. It has to be seen on the big screen for full effect as I did at the ABC Deansgate Manchester England in 1975.",

As a new police chief in a small beach town he quickly is informed that a local woman has been killed by a shark. With the 4th of July holiday approaching the chief knows the beaches will be packed as well as the water. He tries to talk Mayor Vaughn played by Murray Hamilton into shutting down the beaches, but the Mayor has not intentions of doing such a thing. The Mayor's main concern is the amount of money the town is going to make over the weekend and doesn't want to scare any of that money away. The Mayor refuses to shut down the beach even though Chief Brody and a scientist who studies sharks Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) beg him to.The 4th of July weekend approaches and the town has all heard of the shark who has killed a local woman and no one is in the water. Mayor Vaughn encourages the people to get in the water, and they do. This ended up being a bad idea. Shortly after the people began playing and swimming in the water the shark appears, and ends up killing a local man. The Mayor then realizes something has to been done, especially with the thought that his children were in the water that day as well. So the Mayor agrees to pay a local fisherman he request amount to kill the shark, and the Chief as well as the scientist Hooper join him. This local fisherman named Sam Quint, played by Robert Shaw, seems to have a great deal of experience with sharks and definitely views them as something to be feared.This trip out to sea ends up being a shocker to them all. The first time you really get to see the shark is when Chief Brody is throwing chum in the water and the shark sneaks up and then pops out of the water. Chief Brody is in such amazement all he says is we are going to need a bigger boat. Up to this point in the movie you really don't realize how big the shark is, the buildup of size in the beginning of the film you understand the shark is larger than normal, but the first time you see it you are amazed by its size. At this point the battle is on against the shark. Along this trip you learn a lot about the people aboard the boat. One of the greatest moments of the film is when Quint gives his story about being aboard the SS Indianapolis and you learn why he has the feelings he has about sharks. The movie Jaws was released in June of 1975, which was the year I was born, but has always been one of my all time favorites. Jaws was one the first horror movies I ever saw and it really scared me. I still do not like to go into the ocean to this day because of this movie. There are several parts of the movie which give you the view of the person being attacked and puts you in their place, which is frightening. The most memorable items of the film is the music. That music is universal for a shark. When you start to hear the dun dun\u0085..dun dun\u0085.dumb dumb dumb, it just sends a feeling of fear all though your body.",

Which brings us to the shark itself. Some of the footage in the film is of an actual great white shark. The rest uses a mechanical shark patterned on the real thing. The illusion is complete. We see the shark close up, we look in its relentless eye, and it just plain feels like a shark. \"Jaws\" is a great adventure movie of the kind we don't get very often any more. It's clean-cut adventure, without the gratuitous violence of so many action pictures. It has the necessary amount of blood and guts to work -- but none extra.

My mom introduced me and my brother to this when we were young and we never stopped loving it. Even though we were obviously not even thought of when this movie came out, she told us that there were quite a number of people who lined up to see it and, as we would come to find out, were a bit skittish to go back into the water...for obvious reasons.Through reading, this was a creature feature that was only supposed to get a limited theatrical release back in 1975. Thanks to some quick thinking and the like, just about everyone and their brother went to the theater to see this and would become a box office smash in almost no time. With a vintage horror movie like this, there is not a lot of blood but enough to make a point. When it comes to this tale, you really don't need it. The book (which was pretty good) was far bloodier than the movie.Anyway, what I like about this is that you don't see the shark until almost halfway through the movie. When the shark attacks Chrissie in the very beginning, all you see is her being jerked around and then eventually pulled under. With Alex Kintner, all you see is a silhouette of the shark and then the boy being pulled under. Like \"Alien,\" it leaves you with the thought that you are certainly not alone when you go out into the unknown.And let's not forget the trademark theme. To quote Steven Spielberg to composer John Williams: \"Two notes? That's it?\" Those two notes have since gone down into movie legend. The theme has been used in other TV shows and movies, some not necessarily horror-related. It is probably one of the best movie themes to serve as a prelude for incoming danger.This is vintage movie magic, bar none. It was one of many movies that propelled Mr. Spielberg to stardom today. Without lines like \"You're going to need a bigger boat,\" \"Jaws\" just wouldn't be the same. (By the way, \"You're going to need a bigger boat\" was not in the script; it was improvised by the late Roy Scheider.) There are two production companies today that owe their names to this movie: Bad Hat Harry and A Bigger Boat. In truth, it wasn't because of \"Jaws\" that has kept me out of the water; it's just that I never formally learned how to swim. Hey, there are some people to this day who won't venture out into the open water because of \"Jaws.\" If you have never even seen or heard of this classic, please watch it. I don't know of too many people who haven't seen or heard of this. Watch it over and over. I'm 30 and I can't say how many times I've watched it since I was a little boy.",

I also like when Quint utters the line \"Stop playing with yourself Hooper\" to Richard Dreyfuss character as he plays a game of what looks like solitaire.

To tell the truth i don't remember the first time I watched it but i only remember the first time I watched it- I was a small kid and I enjoyed it for then. I hardly remembered anything of the movie until again I saw it 8 years later on AXN! Now I have the DVD with me. I liked many things about the movie- 1.) The shark's death. 2.) The excitement when Chrissie Watkins was to be going attacked by the shark. 3.) Brody's steadiness(every cop should be like him) 4.) \"Smile you sonofabitch\" 5.) \"Farewell and Adaeu\" 5.) Quint's sense of humour 6.) Hooper's great laughter 7.) Brody's Glassess(lol) 8.) Quint's upright character and sharp nose Well, I could only suggest a thing for this movie: It could at least have some features as the novel. I think I'll be writing a remake to Jaws. In it Quint would die but not kiled by the shark. It will be like this: Quint will try to attack the shark for the last time it appears. A rope would be attached to the harpoon(Quint's weapon to attack the shark) and by chance the rope would tie around him and he would be throwed down into the water and there he would drown to death. AnD in case of the shark's death it would be like this: Brody would be left alone and he would try to swim as best as he can and the shark would be rushing towards him and just then he would blow off the monster's head in the same method he did in the movie. And Hooper would be killed by the shark and he would be a villain-trying to get Brody's wife from Brody. (These above ideas is of the novel- Jaws) and I'm gonna write a great remake!(no joke)-write it down!",

It is a movie that anyone looking for a thrill should watch. To start, i am a good swimmer who has always feared water a little but has never really had a fear of sharks. After watching this film, the next time I went to the beach wasn't the same. I remember cutting my foot and not wanting to go back into the water because of the blood, I usually will go out pretty far, but this time I stayed in very shallow water. This is what the movie does to you. I can take a person who loves swimming a turn him into someone who fears going out. Anyway I may be exaggerating a bit but it did change things for me on that trip.The movie itself is very well made. There are several jump scenes but they are suspense jump scenes. The characters are all very likable and intelligent and FUNNY. The acting is great! The only thing about this movie that isn't perfect is the facts. Sharks don't attack humans or boats or hunt down people. And then there is the thing with how close the shark comes into shore. Oh well no movie is perfect. SPOILER Okay so the basic plot to the entire movie is,woman gets attacked by shark police chief Brody finds mutilated body and figures out its a shark, shark attacks more people \"blah blah blah\" fourth of July comes and the mayor won't shut down the beach \"blah blah blah\" man is killed and Brody's son goes into shock \"blah blah blah\" Mayor hires trusty sea-man Quint to hunt down shark with Brody and marine biologist Hooper. And so the hunt begins SPOILER ENDMy final words on this movie what you probably want to hear. WATCH IT its a great film. It has some scary scenes and the shark will scare young kids probably and their is language but its fine for anyone 14+. My last words are if you watch this movie and then have any uneasiness when going back into the water Steven Spielberg has done his job.",

For the first hour of this movie we aren't sure what's out there killing people; but we know that it's big and and it's not where it belongs. It also gives us three complex characters to root for: First there's Chief Brody; he's cop on an island and he hates the water. But he knows that he must do something. then there's Matt Hooper the scientist who studies sharks. He knows what's out there and tries in vain to get the Mayor to understand.(\"You are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the a**!) And then there's Quint. The hardned shark hunter who's scared of nothing and wants the shark. Speilberg does a great job into developing these characters into people you actually like.

The main characters are all variations of realistic reactions to the same situation, a brutal shark attack, even the mayor's careless reaction can be compared to other real-life reactions. The shark is probably the most terrifying non-human horror villain. The jump scares are actually scary and the of the shark's victims, submerged in blood and water, as their slowly killed are traumatizing enough. The practical effects are a bit exaggerated, but horrifyingly lifelike with blank eyes. If you want an excuse not to let your crazy uncle to take you swimming at the beach, Jaws is your scapegoat.",

Nevertheless, I was not contented with the movie.Firstly, the film was featuring as \"Super-Thriller\". However, there were only four shark attacks within 120 minutes. The scene that the first victim killed was quite thrilling while the following attacks were minor. In every attack, the movie captured the scene before the attack. There was gush of blood on the water surface and it then abruptly changed to other scene. There was no struggle between the victim and the shark and hence the intensity of excitement was very low. The film used low filming technique because the most exciting scenes not filmed. It also lowered the cost of making the movie.Secondly, the film also featured realistic special effects. I scarcely thought that it was a realistic movie. The terribly made model shark was not vivid. I doubted if the filmmaker had spent much money on special effects. Moreover, the ending of the film was ridiculous and irrational as Hooper could hide safely from the shark after it gnawed the cage.Lastly, the theme song composed by John William was undoubtedly a success, but the music did not match the film. For example, when the shark was attacking the ship, the background music was folk music. This made the atmosphere very strange: neither exciting nor relaxing, was very confusing.To summarize, I thought \"Jaws\" was not worth three Oscars nor could it enjoy such a high recognition.",

            "content": "Jaws is one of a handful of films I can watch again and again, and it gets better every time. I queued round the block to see it the first time I was allowed to the cinema on my own back in 1975; the crowds were such that I missed the beginning, not getting inside the theatre until the bit where Roy Scheider comes out of the police station and walks down the street, giving a little skip-and-a-jump when he hears the band playing. (I still love that moment.) Two hours later, when the film had finished, I discovered I'd been so hypnotised by what was on the screen I still had my coat done up.In the intervening years, I've read Carl Gottlieb's book about the making of the film countless times, and in 1998 finally made a pilgrimage to Martha's Vineyard to see the location of the fictional Amity Island for myself. (Travellers' tip: they don't like you mentioning sharks there.) I walked in Roy Scheider's footsteps down that same street in Edgartown, I crossed to Chappaquiddick on the ferry where Murray Hamilton first puts the screws on him, I cycled over the bridge across the entry to \"the pond\", I sat on *that* beach.My VHS copy was worn pretty thin when the marvellous DVD release came to my rescue, along with the excellent behind-the-scenes documentary. Of course, since missing that terrifying opening scene as a teenager, I've made up for it since - and it's probably the one scene that I still find difficult to watch, for Susan Backlinie's panic and agony as Chrissy always sound so painfully real.If I had to pick a favourite scene, I'd be hard pushed to choose between two. One is, of course, Robert Shaw's classic USS Indianapolis speech. The other is one of the most masterfully subtle pieces of directing Spielberg - or anyone else - ever pulled off. It's the scene where Brody, having been publicly humiliated by the grieving Mrs Kintner, sits that evening at the dinner table, unaware that his toddler son is mimicking his every facial expression. But this isn't quite the tension-releasing moment it appears to be. Listen to John Williams' haunting, nursery-chime-like music at this point. It's undermined by a slowly repeated, discordant bass note, reflecting Brody's mood. Then we hear Brody's wife Ellen letting in Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), who seems to be the only person on the island who knows what's on Brody's mind. \"Is your husband at home? I'd really like to talk to him,\" he says, proffering a gift of wine. \"Er, yes, so would I,\" responds Ellen tautly, showing him in. He sits and everyone looks at each other for a moment. Then Hooper asks, \"So: how was your day?\" And Brody relaxes, and grins, and says, \"Swell....\"I still get emotional every time I watch that scene. And it's partly to do with the situation and the performances, sure; but it's also because the absolute perfection with which it's constructed leaves me breathless.And, of course, we're still a long way off seeing the shark at that point. :-)",

And most memorable is the pulsating original theme score from the film, you've heard it many times as it just carries the suspense and drama of the film along so well.Based on Peter Benchley's novel(I must say a must read)\"Jaws\" is set in a New England northeastern island resort town of Amity. And all of a sudden unexpected bodies float ashore and deaths are reported. And the worst fears of the ocean have come to service a great white shark is responsible. So enter the town's sheriff stressed out Chief Brody(wonderfully played by Roy Scheider)and upon his assumptions and investigations he's meet with resistance and protest from the town mayor Mr. yes man and the politically corrupt Mayor Vaughn(well done by Murray Hamilton)as it's better to lie about shark attacks to the citizens for fear of losing money as people will not want to vacation in Amity if reports of shark attacks are true. Brody does the best to cope with it with support from wife Ellen(Lorraine Gary).Still matters need to be taken further so enter two problem solver helpers one in the form of Sam Quint(Robert Shaw)a weathered and crazy odd ball shark hunter who's methods are unorthodox and then to complete the twosome it's young hotshot educated marine scientist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss). And along the way this film turns into a suspenseful adventure of shark hunting that's helped by the wonderful and pulsating score it just keeps you on the edge of your seat, as in the end your happy to be served a big great white lunch with the death of Jaws! Overall a film classic one of the 70's better pictures and one of cinemas better suspense thrillers. Well remembered for it's strong and pulsating score which moved the drama and suspense of the film along so well. And the way the scenes were shot Spielberg made many of them hidden and suspenseful by doing them underwater proving what you can't see is most often the most dangerous just like the opening sequence of Chrissy's death. And the way that Steven shot the film even though tough and difficult by filming water scenes and moving the camera a lot on boat was well done and his working of the mechanical shark takes a big bite out of today's special effects and CGI and 3-D works. Really probably Steven Spielberg's best. \"Jaws\" is a very memorable cinema classic, one of the all time best films.",

            "content": "I never had a good relationship with \"Jaws\". I tried to like it. I mean, I really did, but I couldn't. I first watched it back in 2007, in my mid teen days. I really loathed it. I couldn't believe how boring it was. I was pretty taken aback with the exceptional extolment towards it. Film snobs have always worshipped this film. Which makes sense, because of the great Steven Spielberg, the incomparable John Williams and the main cast.So now in my 30s, I gave \"Jaws\" a rewatch. Maybe my adolescent mindset in 2007 could not comprehend the cinematic achievements of this film. So I did. But boy, was I wrong. Let's start with the pros. The score by John Williams was fantastic. The man never fails. The direction and cinematography were brilliant. The design of the shark was impeccable. The dialogue was neat. The cast was talented.Now to the cons. The huge problem was the story and how it dully progressed. The pacing was a drab. I'm not sure why it had to be a 2 hour film. The scenes with Quint, Martin and Matt in the boat in the film's third act seemed to drag and drag. A lot could have been deleted here. Worst of all, there are only four shark attacks in the film. For 1970s, this may be enough for horror movie standards, because of censorship I presume. But still, this is a suspense movie and I was eager for more taut, tense scenes, but we didn't see much of that. No, this doesn't mean I wanted gore and limbs being dismembered. But just some good old suspense.But why did people love \"Jaws\" so much? Easy. It was the first of its kind. At least the first significant ''shark movie''. I don't think there were shark attack films before it. Well, one was an unsuccessful 1950s adventure action movie (\"The Sharkfighters\") and the other was an obscure, cheap Australian horror film from the 1930s (\"White Death\"). Who even watched those? So it makes sense why \"Jaws\" was very well praised and enjoyed. It was the first shark movie made with a big production behind it. Not to mention, the nostalgia and the household names that came with the film. If this were made in the early 90s, I do not think that many people would praise it.I believe deep inside people know that this is a really average movie. Why? Well, they despise the sequels so much. Because the latter \"Jaws\" movies have a ridiculous storyline anyway - If you don't want to get killed by sharks, easy, get out of the flippin' water. The sequels -- I mean Jaws 3 and 4 -- are only just slightly worse. Jaws 2 is just slightly better, but still a mediocre movie. But movie snobs see this one as The Godfather and Jaws 2 as The Matrix Reloaded, which is amusing to me because \"Jaws\" and \"Jaws 2\" are very much alike in the story and technical department. But I digress. It is amazing what bias and favouritism does to people. To me, Jaws 2 is a slight improvement for some of its sustained sense of menace. But still, to me, all of the Jaws films are tremendously flawed, where the franchise crescendos in atrocity with Jaws The Revenge, one of the worst films of all time.",

I turned it off.Two years later...I turned it back on.A few years later...Here I am writing this comment.Jaws is a classic, the story, the acting, the now-famous soundtrack and of course- the infamous shark that kept viewers out of the water for decades to come.The plot of Jaws is the story of a New York cop who moves to an island named Amity to live with his wife and children.One morning, a teenager comes to him saying he found a body on one of the beaches on Amity, he investigates, and finds that the body is heavily mutilated.He suspects a shark attack.He suspects right, he warns the mayor of the town that a rogue shark is loose and that he should close all beaches until they are sure that the shark is dead, or has gone completely. The mayor is ignorant, and keeps the beaches open for a 4th of July vacation-party thing.Despite the security around the waters, a little boy is eaten by the shark.The situation quickly escalates...Men arrive on boats with high powered rifles to catch the shark for a reward, set out by the mayor. They fail as another victim is taken.The mayor is then pressured to hire an infamous fisher who demands a high price for the shark.Togethor, the New York cop,Martin Brody, the fisherman,Quint, and a marine biologist must travel to the outskirts of the island the capture and kill the shark.While Quint becomes more intent on killing the shark, and collecting his reward, Martin becomes more worried if they'll survive the experience...This movie is the mother of all shark films. Idiots who think this is bad because the shark effects are a bit outdated obviously have no real respect. You can't compare this to other pathetic shark films like \"Open Water\" or \"Jaws 4\". This is a classic. It will remain one of the greatest, and it will always open our imagination, and our fear, of going into the unknown, into the water.Highly, highly recommended, 9/10",

            "review_title": "Great movie, but not the social commentary of the book",
            "content": "I remember very clearly seeing the movie Jaws when it was released in the summer of 1975. I was 15 years of age and had read the book and gave a verbal report on it in the 10th grade. Having seen the movie dozens of times since, as it is permanently recorded on my DVR, it is hard to be critical of a movie and performances that I love, but in the case of Jaws, because we love it so, we must accept so of its shortfalls, and give significant deference to Peter Benchley's book Jaws, which is an entirely different animal. So, I struggle with whether it is fair to review of movie juxtaposition to the book. Moreover, I question the fairness of reviewing movies some 40 some odd years later. The answer to that question I believe is a definite yes, because often movie goers who have read the book say that the book is better. Moreover, movies and books reflect sociological issues between and within groups and are studied in colleges and universities in various curriculum. Also, readers and movie goers often look to see how closely the movie follows the book. In the case of Jaws, if you are really into writing, screenplay development, reading books and how social issues get lost in movie translation, I suggest that you first read the book. Study it actually. The clear references to class, economics, politics, race, sex and fear clearly were intentional by the writer, who knows the purpose of his metaphors, and yet whose social commentary does not make it to the big screen with the same passion or clarity. Jaws the movie is great entertainment and absolutely incredible cinematography, acting and directing. However, the movie lacks the social commentary thrust intended by the book. If you really are a fan of this movie, read the book, the cliff notes and other critical analysis of the book. Then you will be a true Jaws fan appreciating the brilliance of both the book and the movie. Books are not just books, and movies are not just movies. Both frequently contain messages and commentary. Movies that water down books by omitting, softening and re-scripting events may still be good, but a significant message gets lost, and can only lead to inaccurate reviews and assessments.",

            "content": "When this first came out in 1975 the ad campaign was overwhelming. It made me want to NOT go. But my friend wanted to see it and, heck, she was paying so why not? I spent 3/4 of the movie with my feet up on the seat. I was never much for ocean swimming in the first place; this put the nail in the coffin (tho I have gotten over it enough to snorkel in Hawaii - nice CLEAR water there that you can SEE in).This, of course, was Spielberg's first commercial film and he and his team made the most of it. The thing is, we don't really SEE the shark very often (\"The shark is not working. Repeat, the shark is not working.\") and, IMHO, that just makes it better. Makes the suspense almost unbearable. The stunt shark (Bruce), when cut together with the film shot by the \"B\" unit in Australia is pretty darn convincing when we DO see it. The cinematography is stunning and some of the shots are ground breaking; the zoom-push when Brody sees the shark attack the little boy for one. It's no wonder Spielberg became one of the most respected directors ever. And don't forget the brilliant editing.The cast is great, but the threesome on the boat are amazing. I absolutely adored Robert Shaw. I was heartbroken when he died a few years later. Schieder and Dreyfus were stellar. The scene recounting the Indianapolis' sinking gives me chills to this day. I read that Shaw did the bulk of it (his close-ups) all in one take. It wouldn't surprise me. I cannot understand why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this. One of the greatest characters in cinema history. I love his little bit about the cage; \"You go in the cage. Cage goes in the water. You go in the water. Shark's in the water. Our shark.\" Then sings, \"Farewll and adieu...\" I laugh every time. God bless him and thank goodness for film to treasure his performance. And, of course, there's Schieder's immortal \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\"As for the music... one name -- John Williams. Who else could have scored this? The chase music always send me into paroxysms of delight; even though it's a scary film, those pieces invoke the open, wild nature of the sea. If I ever get a boat, I'll have that music on a loop (just THAT, not the rest of it). Not to disregard the rest of it... the entire soundtrack is one of the best ever written. The opening is classic. If you've never even seen the film, you know where it came from. What else can I say? I will watch this movie anytime it's on even though I own the DVD. I'm like a junkie... I cannot resist. Of course, I hate the cuts they make and if I'm in the mood to WATCH it, the DVD goes in. But I'll have this on even for background. I remember taking my Grandmother to see it when it was re-released in the 80's. I warned her about the jump-out-at-you scene at Ben Gardner's boat. I told her \"This is scary if you want to hide your eyes.\" God love her, she said \"I came to see the whole movie and I'm going to watch the whole movie.\" And she did. She loved it, too. If for some reason - you think it will scare you, you don't like (fill in the blank) - Get over it and see this film! You won't regret it.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg's finest film is Jaws , which is saying something considering he's probably the greatest director that ever lived. Jaws is not simply a monster movie, it goes right in to the heart of an island community Amity Island, which is terrorised by a man -eating shark which staked its claim in the friendly waters of a New England island community. The rich characterisation of every character is sublime. The suspense is unbelievable, and the sense of fear adventure and wonderment of the open water is also evident in this film. This film made me terrified of Sharks, and the water since i was a child- thats a mark of a great movie right there. The editing in JAWS was Oscar winning, and deservedly so- it had masterful cinematography, and the score from Williams is probably his greatest even above Indiana Jones and Star Wars, and the score to Jaws the 'bah-bum-bah-bum' is possibly the most famous piece of music you will ever hear in a motion picture. All this combine to make this if not the greatest film of all time- pretty darn close to it, due to every individual element of film-making at its very best throughout this picture. The opening attack, is the most shocking beginning to a movie your likely to see...with the highly documented problems in production with the mechanical shark undoubtedly makes this film so special as Spielberg got to do what he does best. Create suspense without actually seeing the perpetrator. Think about the T-Rex in Jurassic Park we knew his arrival with the thud and the vibrations in the mud or a glass of water for instance. Spielberg does similar here, we know the shark is there with the use of an underwater camera taking the sharks POV and John Williams famous music. IN this opening scene the vulnerable girl is killed dramatically from something from below...the camera work follows her legs from the depths as the camera takes the Sharks POV and the music begins, and the camera gets closer and closer then the attack...a masterful piece of suspense film-making. The rubber shark itself isn't terrifying, but the seamless editing and Spielbergs masterful direction makes it so. One scene which deserves an in-depth look is the scene where the young boy on the raft is killed. What is great about this scene and what makes Spielberg truly great and at his height of his suspense craft is how he set up this scene. The premise is the chief Brody paranoid of another attack so he sits in his beach chair focusing obsessively on the water; the camera is focused entirely on him, as people walk past him and talk to him either off frame or in the shot, meanwhile Brody is entirely still focused on the water; Spielberg further sets various scents- the dog playing fetch; and the shrill screams in the water which we think is the shark but is a couple playing...so Spielberg throws us off the idea of an attack especially when a young boy enters the water on a raft, its basically a rule that young people don't get murdered in Hollywood movies right? No character is safe in this movie, which makes it all the more scary. Suddenly Spielberg puts us right on the scent as the dog owner can't find his dog suddenly...could it be? then the camera does does the under water cam and suddenly we realise its the shark- as it attacks the boy on the raft. What is genius is the camera pans at speed to Brody's sensitised reaction of panic, as the whole beach is in chaos. That was just one scene of many on how Spielberg sets a scene as well as any director alive. As mentioned earlier the characterisation in this movie is wonderful, whether it be the main guys or the co-actors every body has their own distinct personality which makes this movie special. Even in little moments of humour, or fear we get distinctly involved in the characters and the impact this shark has on the peoples lives. After we see the effects the Shark is having on the community 3 men the dangerously un-hinged fisherman Quint (Shaw), Dr.Hooper the rich Shark expert (Dreyfuss-probably his greatest role) and the main character, everyman chief of police Brody terrifically played by Scheider. They set off on a tiny boat on to the open seas to face this Shark once and for all...this is where the adventure element comes in and where the film truly becomes elite. The actors clearly work off each other in the intimate scenes, especially in the dinner scene where they compare injuries and Quint does the amazing story of the USS Indianapolis. Key to his characterisation. Also The music when the boat chases the shark with the barrels on him, is filled with exciting swash buckling adventure, as i said before this film has everything. Suspense, adventure,humour in the flaws of the characters- everything. Its as close to a perfectly put together movie you will likely see. The ending is rousing and exciting as Bordy conquers his fear of the water and faces down the on coming shark, as his boat is barely above water, he's alone with one bullet left to hit the tank he stuffed int he sharks mouth....\"Smile you son of a B....\" BOOM!!! This movie is the granddaddy of all suspense movies, and we can see Spielberg at his finest and craftyness creating suspense out of nowhere. You know when you've finished Jaws- you have witnessed as close to a perfect film as humanly possible, an absolute joy and terrifying to watch even 32 years later.",

Richard Dreyfuss brings a lot of fervor and energy to the role of Matt Hooper, which is key to that character's scientifically inquisitive nature -- yet he also has an amiable side, forming a friendship with Brody which forms a strong backbone for the story. Quint (Robert Shaw) is a legendary character -- a man both simple and mysterious whose fearlessness is nothing short of inspiring. His soliloquy about the USS Indianapolis is among the most spine-chilling that I have ever seen in a film before. It truly shook me to my core with trepidation and awe, which is precisely what a film like this should aim to do.What Spielberg did especially well was conceal the monster throughout the first half of the story. By not showing the face of Jaws during the first few encounters, tension was able to mount until finally the shark was glaring right at us several feet away from Brody. This was done while Brody was throwing bait into the water, and right on the heels of a joking line! Absolutely perfect timing! Plus by this time we'd become accustomed to hearing that low-pitch music whenever Jaws was around, thereby making the appearance even less expected. The element of surprise was employed masterfully by the screenwriters and cinematographer throughout Jaws -- in the early scenes on the beach I was on the edge of my seat with anxiety, just waiting for an innocent swimmer to be pulled beneath the water!I also got a kick out of Brody and Hooper's constant feuding with the mayor of the town (Murray Hamilton). That just goes to show you that politics and protection of the citizens are not always one and the same. Hooper's insistence on the tiger shark that was caught being \"a shark but not THE shark\" in the face of adversity very much drew my respect.I also saw some extra behind-the-scenes footage of the production of Jaws, and learned that when Spielberg first heard Williams play the theme music of Jaws, he laughed at its simplicity, only to later come to appreciate that aspect of it and applaud it. This is a wonderful lesson on how simple things are not always necessarily dull or clich\u00e9 -- sometimes they meet the demand perfectly, and that is the case here, as I'm sure I'm not alone in claiming I can't get that music out of my head!",

For me it really made me fear and respect sharks but then again I was pretty young when I first saw it nevertheless it is a movie with great acting. I also think it was amazing that they managed to make the movie while the fake shark didn't work until the movie was nearly done. I think you could really see that the people in the movie all wanted other things and I thought it was funny that our hero was scared of water and that he had to save the day meant facing his biggest fear. So I would recommend this movie if u haven't seen it already then.. well I can't find the words but just go and see it.",

Is an important and very special movie for me, it contains the best scariest speech in cinematic history: The story of U.SS Indianapolis that is related by Quint (Robert Shaw), this scene is an instant classic, is one of my favorite scenes of all time, but the truth is that after seen the movie, I made a presentation of various shipwrecks and one of theme was the Indianapolis, I related the story of the Indianapolis and I spoke like Robert Shaw, in a moment I thought that I was him, an iconic character for me and, of course an iconic and symbolic scene. Jaws have also memorable scary scenes, Sheyder and Dreyfuss do a great job but the hero for me is Shaw, probably his best role. Another important thing is the soundtrack, the main theme is considered an absolute classic by all. It the was the first time that a soundtrack caused so many fear and panic to people of getting in the water, that means that Spielberg did his job. Jaws is a masterpiece that you can't get tired of see it.",

John Williams orchestrated one of the most well known and referenced scores of all time. But that is not only the great thing about this movie. Often regarded as the first summer blockbuster \"Jaws\" provides a tale of horror and survival which is most notably shown during the final act. The dialogue is to the point and doesn't stretch out. The cinematography is wonderful as we are shown the white sandy beaches of Amity Island. My favorite shot is of Chief Brody looking out to the ocean after an attack on some locals. That shot embodied the vast space if ocean the Chief was about to enter. This is definitely my favorite movie with fantastic performances by our three leads: Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Schneider as Quint, Hooper and Brody. Shaw steals the movie in one particular scene where he provides a dark speech full of imagery. I don't want to spoil it. This film would not have worked without a fantastic crew, great script, actors and Mr Steven Spielberg who has gives imagination and adventure to the audience.

            "content": "JAWS by Will February 10, 2006.Summer. It's a time for people to take their families and go swimming at the beach; however, in the summer of 1975 this all changed. Half the people spent their summers in the movie theaters while the other half spent their time at home too afraid to go swimming. In one way or another, everyone was affected by Steven Spielberg's JAWS.The story takes place in Amity, a small charming island where obese New Yorker's come to spend their summer weekends at the beach. This one however, will not be so charming. The resort town has been plagued by a killer shark that plans on staying in Amity until the food source (people) is depleted. JAWS follows the story of Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider)'s attempt to rid the resort town of this monster. Martin is a sea-fearing father of two, who has recently moved to Amity from New York City.The theme of JAWS \u0096 which seems to include the importance of facing your darkest fears - is revealed through his character. When first dragged into the conflict, Martin is an observer who prefers to stay behind the water's edge. When prompted by oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to board a boat, Martin refuses and only complies after being intoxicated with several glasses of wine. Then things get more personal, after the near death of his son, Martin realizes that he must face his fear of the water and take on the monster. With the help of Matt Hooper and hardened, eccentric sea mate 'Quint' (Robert Shaw) he sets out to play a grand game of Cat-and-Mouse through the frigid waters of New England.The film is amazingly crafted in every way possible. The camera is operated beautifully, always staying at the level of the human eye, just inches above the water level, which personalizes the fear of the film. The casting is first rate, each actor fits his role well, creating realistic characters and (with the help of screenwriter Peter Benchley) realistic conversations. Director (then rookie, now famous) Steven Spielberg pulls the whole film together wonderfully and strikes terror deep inside us like no one since Alfred Hitchcock. However, with the exception of a few memorable lines, no aspect of the film is remember as much as it's music, which earned legendary composer John Williams a well deserved Academy Award for Best Original Score; furthermore, the thesis of the score can be achieved by simply hitting 2 notes on the average piano, and yet the score is arguably the most recognizable of any movie ever.The concept of the film, in it's most basic form, is simple: monster attacks man, man runs from monster, monster attacks man again, man fights back, man kills monster. Never before though, has this simple story been so well crafted, so well developed, and so well told. From this simple premise, Steven Spielberg and the other filmmakers behind JAWS have fashioned the greatest thriller of our time.",

It needs no introduction. It fulfills all the requirements of a great scary movie: a phenomenal score, a great cast, a well-written story and a frighteningly relatable premise to boot. It builds tension and dread in a flawless manner and keeps up the mystery throughout a good portion of the film. Few other movies in existence have affected the subconscious of the human population as this one has. This movie is so iconic and memorable that one literally has to hum two notes from the movie's score to evoke fear in all who hear it.Flaws? Not many. The nearly-half-century-old robotics show their age just a bit, but this is forgiveable. A few situations are a tad unbelievable at times, but at the end of the day, one simply needs to ask: \"Why hasn't anyone been able to make a good shark movie in the past three decades?\" The answer is simple: because Jaws exists. It set the expection bar at astronomical heights, heights that have not since been (and quite possibly never will be) reached.",

The latest G.I Joe movie had no intelligence either but it's over the top action made up for it. This movie has nothing of interest.

Shark attacks follow and the Mayor refuses to close the beaches because of the 4th of July Celebrations.

The U. S. S. Indianopolis speech is one of cinemas all time greats.\"Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into her side, Chief. We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte. We'd just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in 12 minutes.Didn't see the first shark for about a half-hour. Tiger. 13-footer. You know how you know that in the water, Chief? You can tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know, was that our bomb mission was so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin' by, so we formed ourselves into tight groups. It was sorta like you see in the calendars, you know the infantry squares in the old calendars like the Battle of Waterloo and the idea was the shark come to the nearest man, that man he starts poundin' and hollerin' and sometimes that shark he go away... but sometimes he wouldn't go away.Sometimes that shark looks right at ya. Right into your eyes. And the thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn't even seem to be livin'... 'til he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then... ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin'. The ocean turns red, and despite all your poundin' and your hollerin' those sharks come in and... they rip you to pieces.You know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don't know how many sharks there were, maybe a thousand. I do know how many men, they averaged six an hour. Thursday mornin', Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player. Boson's mate. I thought he was asleep. I reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up, down in the water, he was like a kinda top. Upended. Well, he'd been bitten in half below the waist.At noon on the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura swung in low and he spotted us, a young pilot, lot younger than Mr. Hooper here, anyway he spotted us and a few hours later a big ol' fat PBY come down and started to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened. Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went into the water. 316 men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945.Anyway, we delivered the bomb.\"",

            "content": "Jaws is two movies rolled into one. The first half takes place on and around Amity Island, which is inhabited by a small summer tourist community in the Atlantic, where Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) seems to serve as the entire police department. When a girl's freshly severed arm washes up onto the beach, Brody, who correctly surmises the cause to be a shark attack, attempts to close the beach, only to meet strong opposition from Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who sides with the local business owners who depend on summer dollars for their very lives. The mayor explains away the girl's death as a boating accident and orders the beach to remain open. Several attacks later, Brody finally convinces Vaughn to allow him to hire a local shark hunter, Sam Quint (Robert Shaw) to kill the shark. Chief Brody and a shark expert from the oceanographic institute, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), accompany Quint on his mission, and their hunting expedition on board the Orca constitutes the second half of the film. Across both halves, Jaws manages to cover all of the three main types of story conflict. Brody and Hooper's struggle with Mayor Vaughn and his constituents in the first half exemplifies the conflict of Man versus Man. In the second half, Man battles Nature as the crew of the Orca pursues the Great White. Both Brody and Quint fight with themselves; Brody must battle his fear of the water, and Quint, a Captain-Ahab-like figure, must deal with his tragic flaw of selfish pride in refusing help from technology or outsiders in killing the shark. The shark hunt in the second half of Jaws is an escape, as well as deliverance. The ensuing adventure on the open sea contrasts nicely with the horror/slasher/suspense piece that comes before it. It's also like a mini-vacation for Brody, who, in the first half, is inundated with annoying requests from various islanders. The three-man pursuit of the shark, though scary, provides the singular excitement of a focused objective that releases Brody from all of the scattered, petty demands of his island job. It's a joy to watch these three very different men come together towards a common goal and mutual appreciation. Spielberg and company tell Peter Benchley's story with plenty of humor, and though his score is known for the shark theme, which has become synonymous with impending danger, John Williams provides an interlude that makes Jaws a feast for the ears. The finale of the film is explosive and satisfying as it features the triumph of a common man who always gets his shark.",

OK so there's this shark and it's huge and it's terrorizing a beach community in New York. Great, so that should be scary except we never really see the shark (I know people will say that's what is scary is that we don't even see it especially for the first attack and that's supposed to somehow make it more terrifying, but the truth is they just couldn't get the shark to work so they shot around it, and I found it to be about a zero out of ten on the scary scale), and then when we do finally see the shark it's a total joke! It looks so incredibly fake and moves around almost not at all and looks very awkward and unreal. The only part that was cool at all was the captain fighting the shark to the bitter end. Richard Dreyfuss hiding at the bottom of the ocean from the shark was also stupid, just so they could avoid the sadness of seeing him die? Dumb.

He's in unfamiliar surroundings, so he calls in Matt Hooper, a scientist from the Oceanographic Institute. Together they perform autopsies, drink wine, and yell at the mayor. They have one thing in common: they are both madly in love with Ellen, Martin's wife. Martin and Ellen have two boys: Michael, a laid-back teenager who blends in well with his island peers, and Sean, who makes sand castles. One night Martin and Matt go out to sea for some one-on-one time. There is tension over Ellen, and Martin says \"It's only an island if you look at it from the water.\" Matt doesn't understand how Martin and Ellen's marriage has sustained. The mayor is excited about the 4th of July and the inherent tourism, so Martin and Matt yell at him. They meet up with Quint, a salty sea dog who doesn't care for Matt and his sophisticated means of studying sea life. Matt is defensive and senses class envy from Quint. Martin doesn't know if there's a chance for the three to forge a relationship, but he is glad they're not talking about Ellen for once. The three unlikely comrades set off to sea to relax and learn more about each other. They drink beer, throw chum in the water, play solitaire, and sing songs. At night they drink apricot brandy and compare scars. When Quint tells a war story, Matt sees something in him he hadn't seen before. Judging Quint in a new light, their friendship is forged. They swim home, on account of their boat sinking. These three buddies who went to sea as strangers came back as dear friends with respect for one another, until Quint gets eaten by a shark. Martin admits to Matt he used to hate the water. When you see \"Jaws\", you will see why when men aren't afraid to be themselves, Martin changes his tune. \"Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies\", and hello to a wonderful masterpiece you'll want to see again and again.",

To make big movie is just one ability of this great master, and he also can play around with drama, which may touch your heart, or inspire deep thoughts and always, he do this under a big movie cover.Jaws is exciting, not for its scene. The shark scenes,which were made 30 years ago, though you can't find anything wrong with it, surely couldn't compete the last movies. But there are things that would catch your eyes, and those things wouldn't go out as time go by.

            "content": "Jaws (1975) is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss. The plot of the film is very simple. A great white shark starts terrorizing people in Amity Island. After a few accidents occur, a police chief (Schieder), a shark hunter (Shaw), and a marine biologist (Dreyfuss) set out to sea to kill it. I love Jaws. Jaws is a movie that I have been watching a lot when I was younger. Watching it as an adult, I admire the the film more than ever. This movie is perfect in every aspect and I can possibly say that it has no flaws. There is a notorious back story about how much trouble and delays that this movie had went through. One of the mechanical sharks wasn't working properly and instantly drowned. Spielberg and the crew had a difficult time making the movie. Even though the movie had a difficult time being filmed, I will still say that the director made a smart choice by not showing the shark to the audiences, but you feel its presence every time the brilliant score by John Williams stars playing. That was a brilliant approach by the Spielberg, because it just added more suspense and quality to the film. The score by John Williams is one of his best. The character development and the performances were very good. Roy Schieder as Chief Brody, Robert Shaw as the shark hunter Quint, and Richard Dreyfuss as the marine biologist Hooper all do a wonderful job and have great chemistry between each other. My two most personal favorites are either Brody or the shark hunter Quint. The final battle with the shark is one of the most thrilling moments I have ever seen put on film. Jaws still holds up extremely well and it is a movie that gets better every time after each viewing. It is one of those movies you either seen it or you should have seen it. Jaws is Spielberg's first true masterpiece. It is a movie that had put him on the map and history was made. Jaws was a box office smash. It was one of the first films that gave birth to blockbusters. 2 years after this film you had Stars Wars, then Indiana Jones and cinema was changed forever. Jaws has widely been acclaimed by critics and audiences as one of the greatest and most important films made. Jaws will always be known as a film than started the blockbuster genre and changed the way how movies are being made. Its a perfect film and I highly recommend it. 10/10 stars.",

Funny cos I'd never noticed it before, and I've watched this movie hundreds of times. Like many others here, I saw this film during its original release as a 7 year old boy with my folks and sheesh! Couldn't go near water for years without thinking of Jaws. Watching it today I realised that this really is one hell of a film. The clash between Shaw and Dreyfuss characters is timeless and hugely entertaining. Although after reading the trivia on this site, I'd loved to have seen a Lee Marvin and a Sterling Hayden version.Jaws + Jaws 2 = yeah!

The actors were good, the shark looked reasonably realistic(CGI wasn't the same in 1975)the plot was good, it had its share of jokes(not the most hilarious comedy, but definitely not unfunny). I'm actually a big fan of monster movies, and i think monster movies are underrated. Hasn't anyone but me noticed that this is the only monster/horror movie on the top 250 list? Thats sad that \"The Godfather\" is first and all the horror movies are so low. \"The Godfather\" definitely isn't the worst movie of all time but COME ON! First???? The fact that its above LOTR, the matrix, kill bill, saving private Ryan, deep blue sea, deep rising, and all the bond movies just makes me sick. Anyways, jaws is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone that isn't scared of sharks.*WARNING THIS PART CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**THIS IS THE BASICALLY THE MOVIE IN WRITING* The main character is the police chief, Brody. The other important characters are Matthew, the shark studier, Quint, the shark hunter, Ellen, Brody's wife, and Martin, the governor of Amity. At the beginning, the shark eats a girl and later the police chief finds her arm on the beach. Later the shark studier looks at the arm to figure out the size of the shark. Soon, inevitably, another person is eaten. Then there becomes a huge conflict about whether to close the beaches because the government needs the money and the government reluctantly decides to but a 3000$ bounty on the shark. Quint said that he would hunt the shark and catch it but it would cost them 10000$ After all the other fishers have failures and death or near death experiences the government lets quint have 10k if he catches it. Brody and Matt want to come on quint's fishing boat and quint agrees to give them 1000$ each and let them come on his boat if they help him catch the shark. After a bunch of fishing line and barrel battles, Matthew decides to go underwater in a metal cage with a poisoned needle (i don't remember if it would put the shark to sleep or kill it) but the shark attacks the cage from behind and he drops the needle out of shock but when the shark is mauling the cage he manages to sneak out and hide under a reef before the shark sees him. After that, the shark leaps on the back of the boat and smashes it. The back of the boat starts sinking the boat is at an angle(kind of like this>ignore the bottom half of the example). Brody and Quint are hanging on for dear life. However an oxygen tank falls on Quint's hand and after a quick, desperate attempt to grab Brody's hand slides down towards the shark. After a 30 second battle the shark gets Quint and drags him underwater. Brody jams an oxygen tank in the sharks mouth and starts climbing up the mast of the boat(the only part thats more than 2ft above the water). The shark pops out of the water and Brody stabs it several time with the spear before the shark bites the spear and takes it out of Brody's hand. The shark goes underwater again, but soon surfaces about 50 ft from Brody. Brody shoots at it, and after a few shots, says a few swear words and shoots again. The bullet hit the oxygen tank and there is a huge explosion. Matthew, seeing that the shark is dead, comes back to the surface. Brody and Matthew create a raft from the wreckage and paddle to shore THE END.",

There's a lot going on in the frame (actors talking over each other and frantic extras moving around) but Spielberg manages to keep everything in perfect harmony. Unfortunately, it gets boring as things move along; the characters are not particularly interesting, and the shark effects don't always work. Spielberg pulls a few tricks at the end, but it would've worked better if the shark was more believable.",

Plot: Chrissie Watkins and boyfriend Tom Cassidy go swimming at three in the morning, Tom passes out and Chrissie goes in the water by herself, she is attacked by a great white shark, and more and more people are eaten by the shark at the beach, and many close calls. Brody must go hunt the shark down with a scientist who studies sharks, and a man who like to hang shark jaws on his boat to presumably scare sharks away. And it's with the three to convince the mayor to let them go hunt down the 25 murderous, man-eating, shark and save the town of Amity! the shark is pretty convincing, the death scenes are basically things that could happen, and with a bucket of blood this film is a film to buy of the internet or rent it from a video store.I'm glad i got the thirty anniversary edition packed with extra-extra features! 7/10 stars!",

            "review_title": "The DVD Documentary",
            "content": "When watching the hour long documentary about the making of Jaws, one begins to realize what an incredible production this film really is.\nThe main problem with the production was how to deal with the shark.  The effects people were told it could not be done and would thwart the production.  But they had their own ideas and used such skills as carpentry, science, sweat, and bringing an old effects man out of retirement to get the job done.  The documentary takes you back to when films were almost regarded as going to war where ideas and concentration consumed a 24 hour day, as well as plunging deep into one's creativity to get what they want and sometimes not what they want, which many times were welcome surprises that made the film better.You can't help but compare the creation of the shark to today's computer effects.  Where instead of hard work, solving tangible physical problems, the computer effects are done relatively simply and after the production is finished from a controlled environment.  The documentary of Jaws shows the filmmakers fighting the elements of the sea, nature, and the mechanical creation which they weren't even to sure whether or not would look real. The result is that it does look real.  Even more so than computer effects today which look nothing more than animated cartoons mixing with live elements.  With the old physical effects we get a better sense of physical interaction with all the elements on screen.  The lighting is consistant, the textures the same.  All of which subconsciously create the illusion of reality to the viewer, discerning ones anyway.  It also asks the question. Did filmmakers talents in physical effects eventually peak?  Or was it that computer effects were easier to do?Overall the documentary shows that movies are not made like this anymore, only differenty.  Which could be good or bad.  But when you hear Spielberg talking about the scene when the Kitner boy being eaten being more about the Chief's fears and concerns do you then realize the thought and concern directed to the viewer to enjoy a good story rather than to be impressed by a special effect for 2 hours.  Movies today get that backwards now. Somehow most filmmakers think we will be entertained by eye candy, rather than their suggestions of drama and horror they can put into our imaginations. Because truly the most terrifying scenes are when there are only suggestions of the shark and how John Williams score conditions us to feel at ease only to later make us jump out of our seats.This movie could be released tommorow and set all sorts of records and audiences would once again stand to cheer it.  Perhaps even go so far to thank the filmmakers on taking them on such a great journey.  Or perhaps not. In any case, truly most films are not made with such consideration as how the audience will respond.",

Jaws is certainly one of the most incredible films of all time.There are few movies that have chemistry of this magnitude.  I can't imagine anyone else in the roles played by Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss.  I think my favorite aspect of the movie was how it resembled Moby Dick in the modern era.

There are several people I know of who were afraid to swim in the ocean after watching this movie, and I myself have thoughts of sharks lingering in the back of my head anytime I go swimming.

You actually care about the characters, such as Brody is simply an ordinary father and husband thrown out of his element to give the community he's sworn to protect a summer they deserve. Hooper is a similar role, being both funny and a genuine friend to Brody. The counterpoint to both men is Quint, the old man of the sea. He's grizzled and tough, and he doesn't let anything get in his way. The shark is the thing that stands in front of them and brings them together and forces each of them to their limit, sometimes beyond it. This is what goes into creating one of the most exciting and best movies period. Such a simple story with so much more depth. This is why Jaws is at the top, for me at least. It shows depth and throws the audience, especially me, for a loop all the way through. Stunning then, stunning now.",

I have since watched it on a big TV and I have to tell you, the waves become stronger, the soundtrack becomes more ominous and Quint getting bitten in half becomes more horrific. I could almost smell the sea-salt in the room. Its no surprise that this film scared half of New York city witless in the summer of '75, its such a thrill.Jaws was really the first summer blockbuster, kicking off a trend that is still present today. A film that reminds us of the terrors of the unknown, the fear of an untamed, unleashed primeval force, capable of destroying a whole community. Amity will surely never recover (not for three sequels anyway) from the arrival of a twenty-five foot rubber shark. The fact that the shark itself is so fake looking is immaterial, the abscence of large fish merely heightens the terrible suspense felt.The performances from the three male leads is exemplary, Scheider, as the hard-bitten New York cop no longer used to dealing with such hysteria that envelopes his peaceful coastal resort,plays Martin Brody close to his chest, calm and regulated until his fear of the sea (and a big fish) overpowers him and he loses it aboard the Orca.Dreyfuss brings the essential touch of humour to the proceedings, and I doubt that without his smart observations and comical mimicry of Quint that the movie would have been so successful with the younger audience, who would have seen only a shark eating people. And Robert Shaw as Quint, salty sea-dog supreme, a master fisherman, confident in his ability to land the great white. Jaws taps into your irrational fears and brings them to the surface, it dives into your subconscious and makes you realise fears you never even knew you had. Spielbergs relentlessly uncomforting direction will leave you distressed in the ocean the same as Fat Alfred made you disturbed in the shower.",

            "content": "Jaws is a classic 1975 adventure/thriller film featuring a movie monster that would feel right at home in one of the modern Jurassic World movies. It was the first \"blockbuster,\" making $100 million in 60 days (at the time prices were about $2 per-ticket), and fundamentally changed the way Hollywood approached filmmaking. It is also a film that has had some unintended but long-lasting consequences for sharks in the real world due to the misinformation presented in the story (much like how most people still think the tyrannosaurus couldn't see movement thanks to the \"Jurassic Park\" film franchise despite this theory having being debunked by the early 1990s, except a lot of sharks are killed). The film even has a term, the \"Jaws Effect\" (coined by Dr Christoper Neff at the University of Sydney), used to describe the negative impact the movie has had on the general public's opinion on and behavior towards sharks named after it, such as the shark-hunting tournaments and indiscriminate government policies for shark-culling along beaches (even including endangered species).While an unintentional part of the film's legacy, the \"Jaws Effect\" has led people to believe that sharks intentionally and even vindictively seek out and attack humans, that these encounters are almost always fatal, and that the only way to keep people safe is eradication. Sadly, this has resulted in a rapid global decline in shark populations, across all species, leaving sharks as one of the most threatened groups of animals on the planet. To put that into numbers: humans now kill about 100 million sharks every year, cows kill about 22 humans every year, and sharks kill about 5 humans every year. A truly bewildering testament to the power pop-culture fueled misinformation can have in our society, and should serve as a warning against depicting real-world animals as monsters in film.So, back to \"Jaws.\"The plot hinges on a long-discredited theory about individual \"rogue sharks\" in which a shark can develop a taste for human flesh and so begins to intentionally hunt humans instead of their natural prey. In the film, this \"rogue shark\" adopts the coastal waters of the fictional town of Amity as its hunting grounds and proceeds to do what monsters with a craving for human flesh do. There is some back and forth between our outsider main characters, the new-ish police chief from New York and a consulting marine biologist, and a weaselly local mayor about closing the beaches during the 4th of July. Safety vs profits, they leave the beach open, a boy dies and so the adventure to kill this monster in earnest begins. This is where another bit of misinformation is implied, a bit of misinformation that is still being fought against to this day: killing sharks quickly and efficiently is going to save our children's lives.So what was the point of this monster? The film opens with a woman being punished via shark-attack for skinny dipping, mirroring the puritanical themes of many slasher-films from the 70s on through the 90s, where having sex or being nude on screen is punishable by death. Does this mean the \"shark\" a Chucky, Jason or Freddy Krueger (would that make Ellen Brody the final girl)? Or maybe the \"shark\" is a force of nature that is responding to the way human activity, under the guiding hand of capitalism, has disrupted the ocean ecosystem and the \"shark\" is the punishment for all that summertime tourism. Or maybe the \"shark\" has more in common with the monsters from old creature-feature movies like King Kong or Gill-Man (from \"The Creature from the Black Lagoon\") where the good white folk needed to protect their property, way of life, and their women from the monster, \"the other.\" The implied return to the status quo after the \"shark's\" death, to me, feels most like the last option... and thanks to the scene where the various business owners are demanding for the beaches to stay open, capitalism could be the damsel in distress.Speaking of the locals, what's up with the antagonistic islanders? It is made clear that unless you're born on the island, you'll always be an outsider, and so they demonstrate a general disrespect towards police chief Brody for being born in New York. This antagonism is also extended towards the marine biologist that Brody calls in to help with the \"shark\" problem. We see what happens when the mayor \"does what's best for the community\" and keeps the beaches open despite warnings from Brody and Hooper, but this theme is dropped once they board the Orca with a shark-hunter named Quint who's taken to killing sharks as a way of dealing with his PTSD. It feels like there should be a theme here about ignoring the warning from experts in order to continue making short-term profits... or maybe a message about how the encroachment of human activity into wild spaces is forcing conflict where there was none before... but no, the message seems to be that any force that threatens the American way of life should be immediately destroyed without a second thought or introspection. As an aside: given that we don't see any examples of the regular townsfolk siding with Brody and Hooper, and only the woman who lost her child during the July 4th attack was shown to be upset, I can't help but wonder if she wouldn't have complained at all about the beaches being left open if it had been someone else's child who took the bite.Alright, so we've got a monster who's after our women, our children, and our American capitalist way of life. Clearly it must be destroyed, but who's gonna do it? The outsiders of course. Police chief Brody is driven by his sense of duty despite being despised by the community, marine biologist Hooper is driven by his fascination with sharks and wants to study this anomalous \"animal,\" and Quint the shark-hunter with PTSD who has a Captain Ahab complex and wants to kill this great-white \"shark\" to make himself feel more powerful and in control. It should be noted that Quint outwardly suggests he's doing this for money, lots of it, but this reads more as a guise to mask his true motivations to me.Once on Quint's boat, the Orca, the theme switches from islanders vs outsiders to a measurement of manliness.Quint is a moonshine-making badass army of one, and the only one capable of getting stuff done and getting it done right. He's also the captain of this vessel, and as such he's the manliest man of the three and a person to be revered. Quint even sabotages the radio at one point because asking for help is a sign of weakness. Sheriff Brody is afraid of water due to almost drowning once, and unlike Quint's PTSD which made him a shark-murdering badass, Brody's PTSD makes him weak and therefore a lesser man. Then we have marine biologist Hooper, an educated \"rich-kid\" with \"soft hands,\" who's the target of much derision from Quint since his methods are most out of line with his. Earlier in the film Hooper, with his soft-hands, also dropped the tooth, a crucial piece of evidence that might have convinced the islanders to close the beach. Later when the three are comparing scars, Hooper earns a modicum of respect from Quint for not being afraid to put his own skin in the game.As a side note, the whimsical adventure music that kept playing between moments of tension felt very out of place to me. These three strangers who don't much care for each other are out to kill this animal and the music is suggesting it is a jovial experience. Have you ever been trapped on a boat with people you'd rather not be around? Trust me, it's not a good time.After sabotaging the radio, Quint becomes more and more like Captain Ahab as they fail to kill the \"shark.\" Eventually he challenges Hooper to do something using his own methods, and so Hooper enters into the shark cage he knows will not stand up to this \"shark's\" jaws with a plan to lethally inject it with strychnine, using a hypodermic spear. However, he winds up dropping the spear, with his soft-hands, proving his methods were inferior after all. After this he proceeds to hide on the seabed (like an unmanly coward?), while Quint gets eaten alive by his white-whale.This metaphor may be more apt than you'd initially think too, sine the white-whale from Moby Dick was based on a real sperm whale (Mocha Dick) that, presumably after having his family killed and butchered by whalers, which were hunting these creatures to extinction at the time, proceeded to target and destroy whaling vessels. Another source of inspiration for the book was the story of the whaleship Essex, which was attacked and sunk about 2,000 miles off the coast of South America in 1820. Sperm whales are highly intelligent social creatures, similar to humans in that way, and travel in pods of 15-20 creatures. I know if I were as big as a whale and watched whalers butcher my family, I'd be destroying ships too.So it's rather fitting that this indiscriminate shark-killer meets his end hunting the biggest one of all... which supports the idea that the \"shark\" is a force of nature responding to human activity... though the rest of the film, sadly, does not support this metaphor.Anyway, Sheriff Brody is on the sinking Orca when Quint dies and is the next target for the \"shark.\" Using quick thinking he lodges one of Hooper's O2 tanks (nicely set up earlier) into the \"shark's\" jaws and shoots the tank, blowing the beast apart. It is at this point that Brody becomes a \"real man,\" and despite the deeply traumatic experience he just went through, he's cured of his fear of water by the sheer power of his masculinity (he even comments to Hooper while they're swimming back to land how he used to be afraid of water). He's definitely not going to develop PTSD like Quint did, making him even manlier than the shark-hunter was.Maybe he'll have earned the respect of the islanders. We'll never know because the film ends before they get back to land. But as it stands, \"Jaws\" ends without a thematic throughline.",

The movie is supposed to be about the shark, right, and we hardly see any of it, and my brother told me that the reason for that is, that it is supposed to add to the suspense. What suspense? Before Alex gets killed, we see a bunch of kids playing with a fake fin, and there is no music. Then we hear John Williams music, and we see some of the actual shark, and then we see the Alex's leg, and you know the shark is going to kill him, so where is the suspense. There is no suspense at all, you know the shark is going in for the kill, so it's just a matter of seeing him die. The movie is very boring, and the 3 main characters give nothing to liven up the very dull, and simple plot for a \" classic.'' I know that in movies your suposed to have character devolpment, but in this movie there is too much of it. Instead of showing the shark, they show them dirnking wine, and eating dinner, and there is no point to it. They could be showing something more important to the already THIN plot, but no, instead they show people eating, and drinking.Through out the whole movie Speilberg hides the shark, and in the end, you see it's face. It's more like an unveiling, and of course we a regular shark, nothing to go WOW over, just a regular shark. Come on, people no what sharks look like, so why hid it the whole movie. The last 50 minutes of the film is nothing fancy, it's not even entertaning, it's just a matter of finding the shark, and killing it. Then we find out that they didn't know how big the shark was, and how stupid is that, and they didn't even pick a big enough boat, are they really that stupid. I also did not like the ending, I thought they could have though of something more complicated. Brody throws the air tank at the ahrk, and it happens to land in the perfect place for him to shoot. Well I just plain hated this movie, it far, far, far from a classic and even further from being a godd movie. It's nor scary, or entertaining, and Robert Shaw thinks that he knows everything about sharks, and that's the arrognace that kills him. 0/0, 1/10, thumbs way way way down, well you get the picture.",

Original music by John WilliamA beastly great white shark terrorizes a small resort town during a most profitable Fourth of July vacation, and when Police chief Martin Brody proposes shutting down the beaches, the mayor and city council starkly refuse because of profit decreases. As the shark makes his deadly threats (and lunch) a crusty old sea dog named Quint comes along and offers to kill the shark. City council and mayor Larry Vaughn decline and instead bring in Matt Hooper, a marine biologist and shark buff who quickly proves wrong the committee whenever they try to cover up the slaughter.

To aid the horror of how vicious this chunk of foam is, he also adds great emotion to the faces of characters such as in the autopsy scene where Hooper was observing what was left of the first victim. Though you never see the remains of the victim, his face contortions into many disturbed expressions, and a gallon of sweat dribbiting down his forehead clearly state that this shark is the Beelzebub of all sharks. He uses this technique throughout the whole film, and he never shows until the climax the dreaded foam shark.The film's overall idea is ridiculous, but the movie itself is great . The conflict growing inside the Chief is irkingly good because he shows in such a clever way. An entire juice glass of a heavy red wine and he downs it faster than the shark downs Quint. This shows the stress of how the town is all relying on him to solve the problem that is this menace and if he fails, what will they all do? Will there by another Kittner boy's mother, no son and hating him for it. Only he can't close the beaches because city council won't let him. This confusion helps viewers relate to the movie. Personally, I thought the movie was great. His use of music to build tension and only silhouetting the shark to hide it's overall stupidity was an absolutely brilliant maneuver, and even though the main idea sucks, the suggestion makes the move an all-time summer favorite.Kristen Stenvik",

            "content": "I was 13 years old when I first saw this film,and remembering queueing outside the old Classic cinema in Stockton-On-Tees with my dad. After seeing it,I swear at the time it was the best film I have ever seen. I saw it again with my late mother (who kept hiding her eyes at the climax,and I kept saying \"You're missing it\") and I saw it again and again. It came on television and when we got a video recording machine,we taped it and kept and finally on 5 September 2001,I got the video as part of some gift tokens for my birthday. I remember that date with some infamy. I decided to go to Middlesbrough as it represented a better selection for my tokens. I got my video and went back to my car. GONE. STOLEN. Of course six days later,another date of infamy emerged. I had seen Deep Blue Sea,which for me was a reworking of Jaws,and while I'll admit the sharks looked better in DBS,it lacked the menace and terror of Spielberg's original masterpiece. Also whilst DBS had better sharks,when one of them got Samuel L Jackson,his image being eaten resembled an inflatable dummy and not the classic image of Robert Shaw going down the great gob. Jaws had style,it had great characters,it had humour and it had everyman representation,as if the whole town became a character. Maybe a reworking of Ibsen's Enemy of the People (but who was the enemy:the shark or the money grabbing authorities) and the final phase was of Three Men In A Boat. Memorable scenes:Chrissie screaming for her life,Polly the secretary being mundane about things,the Kintner boy,Quint's intro...there is too many. The climax though is still the best of its genre. Spielberg from thereon was unstoppable and has matured to make such classics as Schindler's List,Saving Private Ryan and the recent and excellent War of The Worlds,not forgetting the Indiana Jones' films. Schindler's List is quite rightly his masterpiece,but the excellent Duel became the template for Jaws and Jaws was the seminal classic for not only the career of Spielberg,but film making in general. Recently I got the DVD for my birthday (no car stolen this time) and for my dad,we always put the subtitles on,and I am amazed of what dialogue I had not known,thinking I knew it all. My favourite film now,after I have matured myself over the years,is David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia,a film that once inspired a one young Steven Spielberg to become a movie maker and who himself had a hand in the restoration.

The characters are also fairly well written, and have a very human feel to them instead of being typical horror or action film leads that don't have much development.

JAWS was also the first movie I ever recorded on a VCR and myself and my brother watched it over and over endlessly even getting to the stage where we knew the dialogue. I agree that the shark looks really phony - yet somehow it doesn't matter - such is the brilliance of the direction, the career best work from the 3 actors and John Williams now legendry score.

Thats what separates it from the other lesser monster films and earned Spielberg the right to become one of Hollywood's most powerful directors.

You can start watching it at any time and you will get the same enjoyment. The only thing you need to know is that there is a killer shark, and these three men have set out to kill it. Its so incredibly simple, and yet perfectly elegant. And even without the plot twists that abound in other movies, this movie has so much suspense. Its Spielberg at his finest.Now, one of my favorite parts about writing reviews for the classics is to make fun of the people who didn't like it. This one was particularly interesting, since there were a few critics who had the gall to place Deep Blue Sea above this movie. Someone said the sharks in DBS had a reason to be aggressive. Right, like the therapy they were on gave them PMS or something. Get real! Yes, sharks don't usually eat people, but sometimes they take a liking to human flesh. In fact, Jaws is based off of real events, the Matowan sharks attacks of 1916. It doesn't get any more reasonable than that. Jaws is a heck of a lot more realistic than DBS. To compare the two is laughable, and murders any credibility.So, ignore that crap, and go see this movie, because it was a classic then and its a classic now.",

Lots of the passage is reminiscent of The Old Man and the Sea, a book which Jaws is frequently compared to (along with Moby-Dick), but Islands in the Stream is perhaps the better example.Jaws is all about the shark. It's a movie that can really be divided into two parts. In the first section the shark attacks, there are some bodies, the annoying mayor, and a lot of kerfuffle on Amity Island. I was actually surprised how quickly the movie's passed through it. Then the second section comes, when the characters take to the sea in the Orca, and everything seems to slow down. Like the movie just made a hurried speech and now was taking a deep breath. The second section is where Jaws really cements itself as a classic because, like Islands in the Stream, it's about one thing: catching the fish.

Again, we don't even see the shark even though we know it is a shark eating her.  The real horror is when Brody's buudy on the boat gets his midsection chompped by the shark as he slides down boat.

The audience is seeing like the shark and together with the music (the soundtrack of the film) puts a kind of anxiety of the type \"the shark is going to kill anybody?\". But later all this feeling disappears with the coldness of the image change.At minute 15 there is a tranquility which puts anxiety, the people were swimming with a probably shark? But why? This people are so dumb, and when the police want to close the beaches they come angry. Ohh, it was for your security.The people are a kind of sheep because when the shark attacks, EVERYTIME, all of these go for see the shark, sometimes risking their lives, so no comment.Speaking of \"risking their life\", all people know the shark's attacks, but they go swim anyway, what is in their mind? Ash?In conclusion I liked the word used by Hooper \"eating machine\" because I think it describes in excellent manners the shark and the story which revolves around him.Thank you for reading so far :)",

Everything is fine and dandy - until the antagonist of the film comes swimming towards her.  I can say that EVERY scene of Spielberg's \"JAWS\" has had an impact on my life.  I can't think of another film that has evoked more primal feelings out of a young kid ( I was 7 when it came out) than this one.  (I can add \"COMA\", \"WATERSHIP DOWN\", \"STAR WARS\" and \"HALLOWEEN\" to the top of my list as well).  Spielberg has, as with almost every other of his films, created a an experience to behold with this one.  I think one of the greatest elements of the film is Spielberg, and editor Fields, techique of NOT showing the shark until half-way through the film.  This creates a \"Hitchcockian\" type of suspence that so extremely effective.  It is hard to describe the impact and influence the plot, and characters had on me - I guess I was at the right age to absorb what was going on enough to formulate it in my mind and instill it in my brain.  Chief Brody and his fear of water, Quint's hatred for the shark, Hooper's know-it-all expertise, the Mayor's denial of the situation, etc.  And, of course, \"Bruce\", the hungry shark.  Bill Butler's cinematography was very good, considering the budget and locations he had to work with (this also goes for Dean Cudney's '\"Halloween\").  Benchley and Gottlieb's treatment of the film, I think, works better that if they would have stayed true to Benchley's novel.  Spielberg's approach and stylization really works.  It could have been \"shot through a cannon\", but Steven likes to be creative, and Zanuck and Brown took the chance and allowed him to. Well, motion picture history was made that summer of 1975.  And I owe all involved in making it a huge thanks.  I would have not became a filmmaker if this was not made when it was.",

This movie puts you right into the experience. The characters are all so varied and present and some you like, some you don't like, some you kind of like. And then when the movie starts heading toward the midpoint and toward the climax, when those barrels start flinging off the ship and almost hits one of our guys in the head, i actually screamed. In fact, there were many times that this movie made me cry aloud out of actual fear. This movie is the actual reason I will never go swimming in the ocean.

            "content": "Why is Jaws' titular character one of the scariest movie monsters? Ultimately, it's a common great white shark that lacks the genetic and/or supernatural enhancements expected in horror antagonists. One explanation is its hunting ground, which is a place we cannot imagine anything bad happening. Besides its safety and beautiful weather, Amity Island is perfectly evocative of childhood beach-going memories. Adding terror to this idyllic blend makes it all the more terrifying. The three leads' all-consuming relationship with the beast also explains its near-mythological status. After all, it would take some kind of monster for someone like Hooper to devote his life to studying it and a hell of an encounter for someone like Quint to devote his to turning them into trophies. As for Brody, while hardly a shark expert, his every waking thought concerns stopping a single shark from ruining paradise and harming his family. Regardless, all of these elements could still result in a monster that makes audiences laugh instead of shudder. Spielberg and company prevented this from happening in one of the most famous instances of doing more with less in movie history. Since the mechanical shark prop was too cumbersome for extended use, the director made substitutions such as showing the beast from a first-person perspective and by revealing the aftermaths of its feeding frenzies instead of the shark itself. Besides adding tension, these flourishes make it more possible to imagine the monster not as a shark, but as the stuff of nightmares killing machine that Hooper and Quint describe. John Williams' theme for the shark is another prime example of doing more with less. Its simple repeated phrase not only adds an undercurrent of dread, but also mystery as to when and where the beast will attack. In the end, Jaws proves that a monster does not need an elaborate history or otherworldly origins. With enough movie-making magic, it can simply be an animal looking for its next hot lunch.",

One scene that always grips my nerves is the heart pounding pier sequence when two fisherman attempt to catch the great fish but become prey themselves. After seeing the film, going into the water was my number one fear especially if I was lying on an air mattress. Another thing I loved about the film was not seeing the shark, just seeing the barrels pop up, letting you know the shark was there and could appear at any moment.From the moment when Chrissie is taken by the shark to the moment when the credits role while John Williams beautiful theme played, I was blown away by the film. We'll always remember that classic line that set the mood for the second half and put deep shivers down our spines \"you're gonna need a bigger boat\".",

While the 1975 film did not have the same special effects movies the likes of The Meg, it tells a simpler and honestly better story. The film is well shot and not diluted with plot points or unnecessary characters. The dialogue is sharp and shows the difference between the three main characters, growing on each other as the film continues.\nThe story is simple, three men on a boat go to hunt down a shark, a big one at that. The story connects the audience to at least one of the characters, giving them the desire to have them succeed. The slow building suspense has the audience not wanting to leave their seat to try and catch a bathroom break, because just like the crew, the shark can strike at any moment.\nThe story does a great job of establishing the point of the film, right away. You find out that the a shark is terrorizing the beach and the important, or relatively important people, have to stop it before 4th of July weekend, or the town will financially collapse. Then you meet the three men destined to save the town. Once the story is in full effect and they're faced with death, there is no longer just three characters, but four. The shark becomes the final character that the audience gets attached to, like it or not.\nFor myself, the film left me anxious and still afraid of the ocean.",

Because it came out 15 years before i was born i never saw it when it was \"just a movie\" and by the time i Finally saw it I knew what would happen. The music is so well known in society today that when you hear Duh Duh Duh Duh you know Shark! It Completely ruins the suspense of a Great movie.But otherwise if you haven't seen it see it if you don't want to, see it anyway its a classic! So stop letting be so famous and let future generations enjoy it as what it I was. Also it is way better than 2 3 and 4. I really hate when studios try to make more money by taking a classic movie and making a bunch of crappy sequels that make no sense. For the love of god if you kill a shark its Dead it ain't supernatural or immortal if a shark dies its dead! Also i have one question if amity is in new england why does it look like California? Thats all the movie is still a classic and if you haven't seen it then see it its really good. Safe swimming!",

Apart from Chief Brody who is pretty much afraid of everything.Jaws is just as comfortable attacking you in broad daylight, with the sun shining, as she is sneaking up on you and ramming your boat in the dead of night.This is probably the first horror film I ever saw, and it scared the living daylights out of me (I was probably a bit too young to be watching it!). Anyone who has seen Hooper get the fright of his life whilst examining the abandoned boat will know exactly what I'm talking about!I don't think I've ever met anyone who didn't like this film, and I'll bet most people will know at least one quote from it.

The scene where the little boy gets killed was one that haunted me when I was little even though I was in the pool. Every time I get on one of those floating devices I have a flashback to that movie. That is a brilliant movie. Who would have thought that a movie that had so many problems like it did would become a cult classic. So many movies have tried to do the shark movie but this one will always be number one. The acting was great and it absolutely draws you in from start to finish. The best line in my opinion is when Brody is about to kill the shark and says \"Smile you son of a bitch.\" Though I'm sure a shark wouldn't have exploded in the way that the one in the movie did... it really just make it one of the coolest endings.",

The new police chief (Martin Brody) of Amity, an island resort town in New England. He has wife named Ellen, and two sons named Michael and Sean. On a summer morning, Brody was called to the beach, where a mangled body was found of summer vacationers Chrissie Watkins has washed ashore. The medical examiner tells Brody that it could have been a shark that killed Watkins. Brody wanted to close the beaches to swimmers. Mayor Larry Vaughn, who is desperate to not lose money that, will be brought in by the July 4th tourists. This doesn't sit well with Mayor Larry Vaughn and several of the local businessmen. Brody backs down to his regret that weekend a young boy is killed by the predator. The dead boy's mother put out a bounty on the shark and Amity is soon swamped with amateur hunters and fisherman hoping to cash in on the reward. This movie is my all time favorite shark movie. The movie has fantastic thrilling music, great actors, great setting, and a great director. The frightening and graphic attack scenes seem so surreal. The film is full of iconic shots, when you first see Quint you know about his character because of the way he announces his arrival into the room. Deep Blue Sea is another shark movie, but if you want to see a good shark movie I prefer you to watch Jaws. Truly or more suspenseful movie was never made. Several come close, but none quite reaches the level Jaws does. No other file so effectively taps into our fear of the unknown. No other movie grips us so strongly with heart stopping suspense that we find ourselves nearly falling out our seats.",

Roy Schneider and Richard Dreyfuss, along with Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton, also captivate the viewers. Scenes such as the attack on Chrissie Watkins or the scene in which the head pops out of the ruined boat are amongst the scary and thrilling scenes Jaws has to offer, and lines such as \"I think we need a bigger boat\" ave gone down as iconic lines in film history, along with such quotes as \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\" or \"Here's Johnny! I sincerely hope rumors about a remake are false.

            "content": "Chief of Police on Amity Island, Martin Brody (played by Roy Scheider) is presented with a monumental problem one summer on the relatively peaceful island of Amity in the form of a huge, man-eating, great white shark feeding in the offshore waters. He is first alerted to the problem when the decomposing body of Christine 'Chrissy' Watkins (played by Susan Backlinie) washes up on shore and is found and reported. At first, the Mayor, Larry Vaughn (played by Murray Hamilton) gets the medical examiner to attribute her death to a simple boating accident, but, with the arrival of shark expert Matt Hooper, this verdict is questioned. Hooper contends that the cause of death could only be a large,hungry, predatorial shark. Larry, however ignores his expertise and continues to let the beaches be open. It is only with a second death,that of Alex M. Kintner (played by Jeffery Voorhees) that the townspeople are called to a meeting wherein the people continue to shortsightedly agree with Larry and call for the beaches to remain open. When the Fourth of July finally comes, business is booming and the beaches are packed, partially due to the fact that no one will go into the water. Then, after the urging of Larry, two of his friends, an old couple, venture into the water. They break the ice and cause others to join, but this only ends in disaster where another man is killed. After this final offense, the townspeople commission Quint (played by Robert Shaw), a shark hunter, to find and kill the shark for $10,000. Chief Brody and Hooper join him on this expedition upon his vessel, the Orca. They then play a suspenseful game of cat and mouse with the shark where it becomes unclear exactly who is hunting who for a while. But finally, after Quint is messily devoured, Brody kills the shark and Hooper and him swim safely back to shore. This movie was Spielberg's seventeenth, it ranks 91st on the list of the top 250 films of all time according to the International Movie Database and is one of the highest grossing films of all time. I completely agree with'lurker_from_persia's' take on the film, \"...I seriously do recommend you seeing this if you haven't, and if you have, watch it again \" When this film came out, it shocked audiences as one of the most graphic movies to come out yet and sent many moviegoers to the lobby or the bathroom in order to avoid throwing up. (Which seems unbelievable by today's standards.) But, it was light-years ahead of many of the movies filled with senseless nauseating gore that come out today. Because, in contrast to them, the plot of Jaws is both engrossing and suspenseful.Both of these characteristics are amplified by the unforgettable musical score. From the start, you feel vulnerable, since the first attack victimizes a naked woman, her nakedness makes her even more vulnerable and makes you question your own safety. Chief Brody is my favorite character from this movie, but I think that he would be incomplete without the wit of Hooper to accompany him. Both of them have many engrossing scenes such as the one where Hooper first arrives and attempts to help Chief Brody organize the 'shark hunters.' \"You know the eight guys on the fantail launch out there? Well none of them are gonna get out of the harbor alive.\" Hooper to Brody Aside from comic relief, Hooper is also by far the most intelligent character in the story. He is called to Amity to convince Mayor Larry of the danger of the situation with the shark, but is met, at every turn, with the single-minded uncooperative spirit that Mayor Larry strives to keep. \"What we are dealing with is a perfect engine, an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution. All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks, and that's all. Now, why don't you take a long look at this sign. Those proportions are correct. Hooper to Mayor Larry\"Love to prove that, wouldn't ya? Get your name into the National Geographic.\" Larry's response to Hooper\"You are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass\" Hooper to LarrySpielberg exploits people's 'hot spots' of fear in this movie and shows how ignorance can be bliss in the case of deadly creatures. \"Martin, it's all psychological. You yell barracuda, everybody says, \"Huh? What?\" You yell shark we've got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July\" Larry to Chief BrodySpielberg also shows how excitable people are in panicked situations. In the scene following one of the shark attacks, where the eldest Brody son is playing on his boat, Chief Brody's wife changes from encouraging her son to play in the boat he got for his birthday to yelling at him to get out of it when she sees a picture of a shark eating a boat. He uses his directing genius to profile different types of personalities and their reactions to stressful situations. He shows Quint, the psychotic, run-and-gun, personality taking it all in stride versus Chief Brody, the responsible parent being noticeably worried and fighting for the safety of his family. When Spielberg directed Jaws, he made a blockbuster, a classic, and revolutionary movie. The first Jaws deserves all the credit it has gained, but the later sequels also deserve the more negative credit that they have gained. Spielberg created a monster in Jaws, one that has stood the test of time much like The Mummy or other classic creeps and one that continues to scare children before their summer trip to Florida.",

To make things worse he then tries to shoot the whale and can't even get that right, and shoots the cylinder by mistake. This blows the whale's head off. WHO'S THE KILLER NOW, EH?The best bit is when the zombie comes out of the hole underneath the boat and scares the frogmen off.",

            "content": "*Spoilers will indeed follow*What a load of crap, right.  A shark starts eating the locals of an island community, putting a sheriff, who happens to be afraid of water, on the spot.  The selfish mayor opposes the sheriff in shutting down the beaches because its bad for business, and puts some tourists out for lunch. Sheriff gets mad when son almost gets chomped so he enlists the aid of a cocky oceanologist and a crazed fisherman to kill the shark.  These three go out in a rickety old fishing boat to do battle, become amazed at shark's enormous size and swimming skills, and proceed to get their rickety old fishing boat smashed up by the gilled beast.  Cocky and stupid oceanologist goes down in a shark-proof cage, and narrowly escapes with his life.  The shark, apparently feeling confident, jumps on to the back of the boat and eats the fisherman.  Sheriff then manages to blow up the shark into millions of pieces before swimming gleefully back to shore with oceanologist.Yikes!  That sounds terrible, does it not.  But what is pretty unbelievable is that I just finished decribing to you the greatest film ever made.  Now let me explain why.Jaws was the breakthrough film by a then unrealized film director named Steven Spielberg.  Very young, very talented, and still possibly naive about the film industry, he undertook the overly ambitious and utterly preposterous task of bringing this story to the big screen.  At his disposal:  the prestigious lineage of Zanuck filmmakers (lots of money), a talented cast (none of them A-list), a devoted crew (very good swimmers), and a mechanical shark.  Luckily for him that shark never worked.The shark in the film becomes an unseen evil because, due to the technical difficulties involved, Spielberg and friends were not able to show it as much as they wanted.  This makes the film less of a gimicky B-list monster movie and more of a taut suspense-horror-adventure film.  Not seeing the shark makes the viewer more uneased, not being able to know where it is and what it is going to do next.  I mean if you were swimming in the ocean, how many of you would see the shark coming anyways.  All we know is that when that thumping music starts playing, the shark is there, and its going to try to eat someone.  Actually, they should have gave a cast credit at the end with shark played by John Williams, because his simple but very effective score steals the movie from any actor or mechanical shark that appears.",

The shot selection and camerawork is great- which is a given fact as this is Steven Spielberg we speak of. The acting is great throughout and the trio of Chief Brady, Hooper and Quint have become a fixation of cinema pop culture over the years, primarily because their banter and experience aboard the Orca is what most people remember. And of course the Shark itself which is probably even more scarier than movie monsters because they actually exist.",

            "content": "If Speilberg made Jaws nowadays, when he can afford to make a movie to the cost of a small country's entire yearly budget, then the cinema would have been robbed of one of its finest moments.The main difference is that I am sure you would have seen the shark much more and that, of course, is a bad thing. The thing that scares the most is not the sight of something horrible or frightening but merely the thought. People who prefer books to films often say that books require much more imagination. Well what else is at work in the early scenes of Jaws, where you don't see the shark at all, but your imagination. Arguably the most chilling scene is the opening one when the girl gets savagely ripped apart. The only indication of a shark is the fact that nothing else could throw around a person like that but a great white.The weakest scenes, in my opinion, are near the end when the shark actively attacks the boat and we see far too much of what is a pretty average model. If Speilberg had the backing and money he had now he would have made an entirely different film and I would say an inferior one to this classic.Much of the plot and story comes from the fact that the shark cannot be seen and is being hunted down. How many great scenes would have been lost if it became a gore fest or an action adventure like so many of today's pathetic offerings ?Maybe I am not giving Speilberg enough credit. He is a great film maker and would have seen the benefit of suspense to his movie rather than outright graphic horror. It is the idea that a shark that big could be out there that put many people off swimming in the sea for a long time.\nAs we saw in the sequels even the same formula, handled in the wrong way, didn't work. Forget the sequels, Jaws is probably the best true thriller ever made made by one of the top directors and starring a perfect cast. And remember a shark the size of a bus could be out there somewhere, we don't belong in the sea !",

These problems meant that Spielberg couldn't rely on ILM to create shocks, he had to create menace out of the old reliable horror tricks of suspenseful soundtrack, horrors unseen, and unique editing.   The result is a film that holds up far better than most of his films today. It's the only one, except perhaps Schindler's List that deserves the critical accolades thrown at it.   A great movie.

Our Stephen Spielberg did a hell of a job in scaring the crap out of people, and I'll give him that.

            "content": "For me the obsession started in 1975 when I was carted off to see Jaws at the now demolished Plaza cinema in Cardiff.  I was 5 years old, I remember being there and being amazed though I was probably too young to be scared by it. Surely they wouldn't let 5 year olds see it today! This was the film that got me addicted to cinema, not Disney classics that most kids seem to love.Years later I remember watching Jaws on TV and being absolutely fascinated by it again but it was not until I bought a copy on VHS in about 1988 that I really started to watch the film in detail.  What a piece of work!  The second half of the film must be the best three-hander in film history, the casting of Shaw, Dreyfuss and Scheider has amazing chemistry.  Scheider's everyman, Martin Brody being the \"fish out of water\" against the salty Quint and Ocean Brat, Hooper's needling relationship. (Has anyone else noticed Scheider's resemblance to the shark?? - sorry Roy) Virtually every line that comes out of Quint's head is macho rhetoric that we'd all love to be able to quote verbatim when we are drunk.  He is from the same mould as Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore in Apocalypse Now.  A macho hard man impenetrable mostly but with a slightly soft centre when put under the microscope.Jaws has had an undeniable influence on our culture.  It has instilled in a generation a fear of what is under the water.  How many times have you had a moment of illogical panic whilst swimming?  For me and many I know this was put there by Jaws.  The \"scars\" scene is undeniably a Cinema classic and has been parodied and tributed many times. It is in this scene that we see a more human side to Quint emerging.  How many times have you heard people in desperate situations say \"We're gonna need a bigger boat\"? Just watch Buffy!\nSo much has been said about the film and it IS a flawed masterpiece but no one questions the fact Halliwell's rates this as two star film!  I love Halliwell's and this is the only real faux pas it contains.  Such a seminal film (the true father of summer blockbusters) and a film so well crafted, scored, acted and scripted should qualify as a four star. Technically Jaws is brilliant - temperamantal mechanical sharks aside!  All that water-level perspective camerawork is groundbreaking and was copied hugely in Robert Zemekis' Cast Away - go on take a look it's where the camera is half in the water half out.I am glad to see that other IMDB users love this film enough to put it where it is in the Top 250.  It may not be fresh in our memories and there may be better films out there from one aspect or another but when it comes to the best all-rounder of all time I don't think there's one to beat this.  It is so accessible and it preys on a fundamental human fear while using very human relationships to convey the story.Of all the films that I'd like to see a remake of this is the one, Here's your cast: Edward Norton - Brody, Seann William Scott - Hooper, William H Macy - Mayor Vaughan, Tommy Lee Jones - Quint, Brian Singer - Director.",

            "review_title": "Jaws Nature vs. Man 10 out of 10",
            "content": "(Review Contains Spoilers)\nThere is a new police chief Brody (Roy Scheider) on Amity Island and islanders are getting ready for the summer crowds. But a newcomer has decided to join the festivities, a 25-foot great white shark. In the beginning of the film, this shark kills a skinny dipper and Brody wants to close the beaches until they can hunt it down. Brody reaches out to the Oceanic Institute and they send Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to determine if there is a shark and what type it is. Together, Brody and Hooper try to convince the Amity mayor, Vaughn (Murry Hamilton), to close the beaches to protect the people. Vaughn will not listen; he puts profits from visitors ahead of their protection. After four people are killed, Brody gets Vaughn to agree to hire Quint (Robert Shaw) to hunt down the shark to make the beaches safe again. Brody, Hooper, and Quint sent out to take on one of natures apex predators and hope to be the ones to survive.Watching Jaws (1975) I learned that if you disrespect nature, bad things will likely happen. This theme plays out between the town, Brody, Hooper, Quint, and a great white shark. The town, led by mayor Vaughn, refuses to take the first three shark attacks seriously. Even as Hooper and Brody talk about Ben Gardner's boat being destroyed and Ben's death, mayor Vaughn will not budge. Vaughn and the town leaders' lack of respect for the shark lead them to open the beach on July 4th weekend. The shark attacks again leading to a fourth death. While it is not shown in the film, the mayor knows this event has destroyed the towns summer revenue and he signs a voucher for Brody to hire Quint, a local fisherman, to hunt down the shark.Quint is a survivor of the USS Indianapolis that carried the bomb used on Hiroshima in World War 2. Quint tells how 1,100 men went into the water after it got hit by two Japanese torpedoes, but only 316 men were rescued, and the sharks took the rest. Quint's character carries this theme by not respecting the shark. He is after revenge due to his experience in World War 2 and has a lot of shark jaw trophies in his house. Even after he sees the shark, he thinks he can outsmart and overpower the great fish. Just like Ahab in Moby Dick, his aggressive nature and lack of respect cost him both his boat and his life.Brody and Hooper are the only two people in the film that take the shark seriously. After the second attack, Brody starts reading books to learn as much as possible about sharks. As we see him flipping through the pages, we see a picture of a shark eating a scuba tank which plays a major role in the last five minutes of the film. Hooper is an oceanographer and has loved and studied sharks since he was a boy. These two men have a rough time fighting the shark, but their respect for the animal gives them the edge which allows them to survive at the end.This theme plays out also in the movie Twister (1996), where we follow two teams of scientists chasing tornados. One team is led by Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes), but he is doing it for notoriety and not for the science. The other team is led by D. Jo Harding (Helen Hunt) and Bill Harding (Bill Paxton) who are doing this research to learn as much as possible about tornadoes to help save lives. Jonas is killed due to having a lack of respect for an F5 tornado which ends up killing him. Jo and Bill, on the other hand, are rewarded as they use their knowledge and understanding of tornados to survive the last scene.Music in this film is critical to its success and helps carry the theme. The music for the shark uses a lot of low-end tones making it powerful. We do not even see the shark for the first half of the film, but whenever you hear that music you know the shark is coming. It gives you the appreciation of the power of a great white shark and makes you think twice about getting into the ocean. In the final showdown between Brody and the shark, the music flips back and forth as the two battle. When showing the shark, it is the typical Jaws theme creating suspense. As Brody grabs his gun, the music switches over to a lighthearted music giving us a sense of hope for him. As the shark does his final run at Brody, the music is playing both low end and high-end tones. The music stops as Brody fires his final shot which hits the air tank and blows up the shark. Brody ends up defeating the shark using what he saw in the book and knowing that the air tank was highly pressurized and would explode if punctured. The music goes into a light beat as the shark's body sinks.Jaws takes advantage of various cinematic points of view as well to carry the theme. Director's interpretive point of view is used brilliantly at the opening of the movie. We are literally looking out of the eyes of the shark with the Jaws theme playing in the background. We get similar views when the shark attacks the skinny dipper and the little boy. We are looking out of the eyes of the shark to the unsuspecting victims. The audience would love to warn them, but they know it would do no good. The shark has a significant advantage over the people in the water, and we get a feel for that in these shots.Objective views are used in multiple shots to show just how big and powerful the shark is compared to those it is attacking. When a man is killed in the pond area, the shot is from overhead looking down on that man desperately trying to get back into his boat after being knocked out. We see the shark come up from underneath and grab the man and drag him down into the water. This is the first time we really see the shark and it is terrifying. Objective view is also used as Quint, Brody, and Hooper head out in the Orca to hunt down the shark. In this scene, we are viewing from Quint's house through a window. In front of the window is a shark's jaw full of teeth. The Orca is in the middle of the shark's mouth foreshadowing that the shark is likely going to win against the boat.When Quint is killed, there are multiple cinematic points of views used. Objective view starts off the scene as we see the Orca from the side and the shark jumps out of the water and comes crashing down on the back of the boat. Then we have a subjective view from behind Quint. In this view we see the shark hanging off the back of the boat while Quint struggles to keep from sliding to the shark. There are multiple shots after this in an objective view as we watch Brody and Quint struggle. Quint cannot hold on and as he is sliding towards the shark, the camera switches to a director's interpretive point of view from Quint's perspective. We see from Quint's eyes as his legs slide toward the waiting shark. After the shark bites down on Quint, we go to an indirect-subjective point of view looking right at Quint's face as he screams in pain and terror. The scene ends in a subjective point of view from behind Brody and we see the shark drag Quint's dead body below water.Between the great music, great cinematography, acting and story, we are taking on an adventure as those that disrespect the shark lose out and those that take the time to learn and respect the shark survive and are victorious.",

(it wasn't even planed) Robert, Roy, and Richard are all fabulous. Murray is great too. some people don't understand why there was more attention on the people rather than the shark. the big fight over what to do about the shark and saving the town's money shows just how arrogant and selfish people can be in that situation. i don't know what it's like to own a business, but if i was in their position i would gladly close the beach for a few days instead of promoting it, just so people can be attack then have no business at all. and the struggles between the three main characters are very realistic. poor Brody is the new police chief and has to deal with EVERYONES problems and fights to do what's in everybody's best interest. Mat Hooper, the scientist, is treated like S*** because he's richer and educated and they don't want to admit that he's right. Quinn does have that captain Abraham from Moby Dick going on but it isn't the same. he suffered a major shark attack during the war and wants revenge. the best element in the movie is the score. chills you right to the bone. who needs to see the shark when they start to play that music. i do consider this a classic because i have to watch it a few times a year at least. only classics do that to you.",

You get close to the 3 main characters- Brody, Quint and Hooper thereby understanding what type of characters they are and how they'd react in certain situations so this shows how well Spielberg presents his interesting cast to the audience.We care about these characters and their goals to put an end to the monster's life so this makes it all the more tragic when it doesn't go to plan. Out of the three I can relate most to Hooper, who isn't used to a fisher man's life and seems to be content on focusing on the academic side of things.There are a lot of hilarious moments when Quint and Hooper verbally fight and the sarcastic and dark nature of Hooper's humour provides that light hearted side to this Horror film.The tension building up to the ending does indeed pay off, it would be a sin if Hollywood were to remake this classic as they'd never capture the great personalities of the characters or the suspenseful moments that this film brings. I give this film a 8.4/10 -highly recommended!",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg has always been a great filmmaker. He does an excellent job at making a film a lot of fun, a way of making a film exciting. Though he does have many \"artistic\" films like Schindler's List, he is mainly known for his exciting, fun, adventure films like \"Jurassic Park,\" \"E.T.,\" \"Indiana Jones,\" and ultimately this film, he also does make some artistic films like \"Schindler's List.\" Jaws falls in the earlier category, and although it is a mindless film that has a basic plot, Spielberg was able to pull off a true masterpiece, a fun, thrilling, suspenseful film.Spielberg's directing as always was incredible. Though he doesn't take many intellectually inclined film routes (though he does) he is able to make a film important and memorable. The acting is also a very high point in this film. The acting by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss was incredible. They portray a great team, and have a lot of chemistry on the set. They feel like real people and a real group.Cinematography is basic. Not much to talk about here.Music is brilliant. John Williams produced a basic, yet tense theme song that reminds me of a shark's tail waving and pushing itself through the water. Though the theme is tense, most of the music in this film is cheery in a tropical way, nearly sounding like pirate music. This is an excellent film that is requirement for any movie watcher to check out. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to have not seen this movie. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on a crucial part of film history and will be missing out on an intensely fun experience.",

            "content": "The movie Jaws marks a turning point in movies around the world. Not only is it thought of as one of the greatest movies of all time, but it also strikes fear in all swimmers around the globe. The magic man, Steven Spielberg did an amazing job directing a spectacular film. Jaws truly evolved movies and created summer block busters, a legacy that still runs today. Writers in Peter Benchley, Carl Gottlieb, and Howard Sackler created a style of horror that has never been seen before. What they made so scary about it was, it could happen, and has happened. In the 1916 shark attacks, these writers bring back to life the horror of what happened on that day in 1916. Although it wasn't too scary it was really an adventure of three different characters. They come together to hunt a great white shark that is terrorizing a small island of Amity. All the actors were fantastic from Roy Schieder as Police Chief Brody to Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper the oceanographic institute shark expert brought in Brody to point out the key factors about the shark. Then to Murray Hamilton as the fulsome mayor that it being 4th of July only sees money throughout the situation not any public safety. And now to the churlishness of Quint, with his discordant voice, to his larger-than-life personality. He dominates every scene he's in. '' Ill find him for three but ill catch him for ten'' this is an iconic quote from Quint thatsets a tone in the movie that foreshadows that the shark will be almost impossible to catch. Another great quote comes from chief Brody and Matt Hopper, Brody: ''I used to hate the water,'' Hooper: ''I can't imagine why!'' Cleary being a sarcastic comment, since there was just a 25-foot man eating shark that killed 7 people in a span of a day, and that nearly killed them too. Sadly, now getting to the end of the movie Quint sadly gets eaten by the shark. But he doesn't go out without telling u a good tale of when he was on the USS Indianapolis explaining this only to Brody and Hooper that the ship was hit by 2 Japanese torpedoes and sunk in 12 minutes, it was right after they were going to drop the bomb on Hiroshima. There mission was so top secret that no one even knew that there were 700 men stranded in the water but then something happened. One by one men were pulled under water, they collaborated to make small pods to keep warmth and to keep the sharks away from them. 700 men went on that boat 300 came off.",

Jaws was the first summer blockbuster- the film that heralded the start of an amazing career of young Steven Spielberg and the one film that single handedly caused beaches to close down that summer.

More concerned with the economic bottom line than with the possibility of someone being injured, Vaughn muzzles Martin, allowing further deaths to occur. While Martin battles Vaughn and his puppets on the town council, the shark lurks in the background, ready to take over the role of antagonist when the mayor gives way. The second half of the film is the classic man against beast, with Jaws representing the rarest of movie monsters - something that exists in the depths of the ocean (albeit typically in smaller dimensions). This, of course, is the clash for which people watch the movie, and it is handled with great skill.",

It wasn't all fear though 'cos i also remember feeling thrilled and excited by the high sea chase ***SPOILER*** and the joy I felt when Chief Brody destroyed the beast with the oh-so-cool kiss off line ...When I watch the movie now, I still get the same feelings I had then because the film was always my favourite and it still has the power and magic to take me back to those innocent, summer days of childhood. Watching 'Jaws' as an adult makes me appreciate the movie on a whole different level...I recognise Speilberg's daring direction (It is still his best film), I see the brilliant chemistry between the 3 lead actors (Shaw should have got an oscar for his 'indianapolis' speech alone) and I basically see the hardship that went into making this movie possible (after watching the dvd and reading Carl Gottliebs brillant 'Jaws Log')...Jaws is simply a near perfect film that will stay with me forever...Great action, Thrilling adventure,  Superb acting and even 'Bruce' doesn't bother me (come on, he doesn't look that bad - compare him to his 'look' in part 4 and you'll see what i mean).

            "review_title": "Definitely not overrated!",
            "content": "Jaws, a thrilling horror film, is set on the fictitious Amity Island in the mid-seventies. The film focuses on a series of shark attacks and a subsequent shark hunt. Jaws is based on a bestselling novel by Peter Bentley, who also wrote the screenplay for the film. The groundbreaking 1975 film has won Academy Awards for Film Editing, Music, and Sound. Its cast is full of talented actors, including Roy Schneider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss.The acting seen in this film is phenomenal. Roy Schneider perfectly depicts the paranoid police officer from New York, Martin Brody, who is terrified of water. Schneider plays the part so well that the viewer can almost feel Brody's terror throughout the film, especially whenever he is anywhere near water. Robert Shaw is very convincing as Quint, a mad fisherman obsessed with shark hunting. Shaw's believable persona reminds me of Ahab, the crazed captain who devoted his life to the hunt for Moby Dick. Richard Dreyfuss portrays the geeky, shark-savvy \"college boy\" exceptionally well, adding comic relief to the otherwise morbid film with his dark sense of humor.Although Jaws was released over thirty years ago, its special effects are extremely believable. The first two shark attacks seen in the film are frightening, but not because viewers can see the actual shark; in fact, Jaws is only implied in these scenes. These shark attacks are chilling to watch because the viewer can sense the fear and pain and agony of the victim; he or she can see the water turning from blue-gray to red; the viewer can hear the shrill, desperate cries for help. The last shark attack of the film, however, is disturbing on a different level. In this scene, both the victim and Jaws are visible. It's graphic and realistic. In addition, the cadavers seen in the film aren't false-looking; the twisted remains of Jaws' victims are grisly and grotesque.I first saw Jaws in my English class when I was a junior in high school. I was expecting it to be incredibly lame, but I was pleasantly surprised. Jaws is a great movie. It's suspenseful, scary, interesting, and funny. The acting and special effects are believable. The score succeeds in \"setting the scene\" throughout the film. The screenplay is well-written. Steven Spielberg does a fantastic job as the director; he's very good at capturing emotion, especially fear and panic. Jaws is definitely worth seeing, even if you've never seen it before or you think it's overrated. You should give it a shot. I doubt you'll regret it.",

            "content": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** (spoilers) When Steven Spielberg was only 27 years old, a young-and-coming director, he read Peter Benchley's best-selling novel, JAWS. He read it over and over again, and finally came to the conclusion that a good movie could be made about this suspenseful book.The words \"Good movie\" in that sentence could be the understatement of the decade. Spielberg's 1975 suspense thriller, JAWS, is respected as one of the best movies of its genre ever to be made. It boasts a great cast, with Roy Scheider as Amity Police Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper, a young ichthyologist who comes to help out Amity with the shark problems it has, and Robert Shaw as Quint, a crazy old sailor who has been in one battle too many. Lorraine Gary co-stars as Brody's worrier wife Ellen, and Murray Hamilton as Amity's mayor who seems to  care more about the economy of the summer resort more than the safety of the citizens.JAWS starts out simple enough. A young woman is killed in the water one morning, and Chief Brody reluctantly accepts Mayor Larry Vaughn's decision to keep the beaches open. But then the tables turn on him. When there is another attack, drastic measures are taken as the beaches are reluctantly closed by Vaughn, and many fisherman are sent to kill the shark. The fisherman do catch a man-eating tiger shark, but Matt Hooper declares that it is not the shark and proves it when he and Brody do an autopsy and find no remains of the second victim, who would still be in the shark's stomach even after a day or so. When Hooper finds a great white shark tooth in the hull of a wrecked fishing boat (then drops it when he finds something else in the hull of the boat), he declares that a Great White Shark is living off the shore of Amity Island. Mayor Vaughn won't hear of it, however, and states that the beaches will be open for the fourth of July. When there is yet another attack, Brody decides to take matters into his own hands and pay a fisherman named Quint $10,000 to catch and kill the shark. Quint decides to take Brody and Hooper along for the ride.Then comes the second half of JAWS, which takes place entirely on Quint's vessel, the ORCA. When a feeble attempt at catching the shark on hook and line fails, Quint decides to take on a different tactic. When he sees that the shark is 25 feet long and over 6,000 pounds, he decides to stick a barrel in the shark to wear him down and bring him to the surface. After one barrel, though, the shark goes under the water, and the three-man crew settle down for dinner.The next scene includes one of the longest, most memorable speeches in movie history, as Quint tells Brody and Hooper about his days on the U.S.S Indianapolis. He decribes that 1,100 soliders went into the water, but only 316 came out, as the rest either drowned or were killed by sharks, and he the crew were only rescued sfter five long days of waiting in the water. The speech tells the audience how Quint became a crazy old fisherman and why he hunts sharks for a living.After Quint's speech, the shark attacks the ORCA, which leads to the engines being slightly damaged, lights going out, and water getting everywhere. The next morning, Quint and Hooper see that the barrel is up, and try to snag it, but then the shark runs away as Brody tries to make a distress phone call to the Coast Guard. Quint stops him, however, and he then puts another two barrels into the shark. When the barrels surface, the shark gets revenge by filling the ORCA's engines even more with salt water, though Quint manages to get a third barrel into it. But as the ORCA starts to sink, everything seems hopeless.However, Hooper propses a strategy to Quint; getting into his \"anti-shark cage\" and trying to stab the shark with a poisonous pole in the water. To Hooper's dismay, however, he loses the pole and flees from the cage for his life as the shark rips it apart.As the shark surfaces and sinks the stern of the ORCA, Quint accidently slides down the deck and is bitten in half in a horrifying scene that shows the shark coming back to finish the job from his Indianapolis days thirty years eariler.The only person left to possibly be able to fight the shark is Brody, who is able to throw one of Hooper's \"explodable\" oxygen tanks into the shark's mouth, then grab Quint's M-1 rifle and take shots at the shark's mouth from the mast, trying to hit the tank. On his sixth shot, he penetrates the steel tank and blows up the shark in a scene that many people in theaters cheered on. When Hooper surfaces, he and Brody kick their way toward Amity and safely arrive, with the shark dead.It's a great story, and was also very powerfully acted. Shaw, who actually also wrote the Indianapolis speech, was easily the best actor in the movie, and I think he should have won Best Actor even over the likes of Jack Nicholson in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. Not to be counted out, Scheider filled in the slot of Chief Brody admirably, and the final scene where he kills the shark is amazing.I did find two flaws in JAWS, however. First off is the big one: the shark itself. Spielberg did a great job to edit out most of the scenes with the shark in it, but there were still some scenes that showed the shark as not being very good. It actually kind of looks like it's made out of rubber, and I'm not kidding. In the scene where it launches itself onto the stern of the ORCA, it looks like one of those bathtub sharks that a 3-year-old plays with, so I think the shark could have been better, even though it was only 1975, and they didn't have great special effects back then.The last flaw isn't nearly as big, and only really bad movie critics would point it out, but I thought I had to anyway. When Brody kills the shark, he shoots an oxygen tank that is lodged in its mouth, and it explodes. That isn't very realistic-though if that situation really did occur, shooting the tank MIGHT kill the shark anyway. But there wouldn't be an explosion. Quoting Spielberg, \"People have believed what I've done for the past two hours. I think they'll believe what I'll show them in the last five minutes\".Despite these minor flaws, JAWS was a great movie, easily one of the best of the 1970s, and it deserves to be recognized as it is today. Oh, and as for the Oscars: ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST was good and all, but give JAWS a break; it deserved at least one of the five major Oscar Awards.",

Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) the sheriff of the island, Quint (Robert Shaw) an army veteran with an astonishing shark killing career, and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) an oceanographer with great knowledge on sharks form a crew and head with a ship to hunt the beast down. It gets more complicated than what they thought it would be and face many difficulties during their hunt.The well known Jaws soundtrack when the shark approaches the victim is one of the golden attributes of the movie, and the thing that probably even the new generations well know. But other than that little detail, the whole movie is just brilliant. The actors really give us a heartwarming feeling while on the boat, they express their passion for their jobs really well, and they really look like they are putting an effort into catching the great white.Being a 20th century movie, i was thrilled every time the shark got to show itself on the camera, which is something hard to accomplish with the technology they had at the time. I think that if the movie would have come out at the present time it would have the same success as it had back in they day, being a masterpiece in all aspects.I would recommend the movie to all the movie-lovers that wish to see the \u0084old-timers\" and that don't mind seeing the screen in a retro way. Definitely still the best shark movie out there.",

This film has entered pop culture lexicon and is just about a great movie that everyone has at least heard of. The fine thing about Jaws is that the shark isn't really the villain- the bureaucracies of the small town, the mayor- the human elements are the true villainous element which Speilberg so adroitly makes us ponder about, at least in the first half. Of course there is a shark and the chase by three men is the highlight filled with great monologues and fantastic sequences. If you haven't yet (shockingly) please see Jaws.",

I'd also go as far to say that Jaws is as much a perfect movie as you will ever see. Acting, Story, Score, Direction.\nThis one's got it all. People who complain that it's not believable should ask themselves why they go to the movies in the first place. Why bother to watch Star Wars or Indiana Jones or the Matrix. Because those movies allow you to escape the real world for a few hours and take you to another place where you don't ask if it's plausible or not. Jaws does the same thing. And in my opinion it does it better than any other movie I have yet seen. So many movies touch you, makeyou cry, scare you, make you laugh. But Jaws not only scares you it scars you for the rest of your life. I'm 28 years old now, I first saw Jaws when I was seven or eight, and I will never ever forget it. Now I jump out of planes as a skydiver, I jump off buildings as a bungee jumper, I race cars in my free time, but not a million horses will get me into the open sea again.

A real shark wouldn't do the things that mechanical shark did, and I simply wasn't able to suspend my disbelief for two hours so I could enjoy this film.Like most modern films, this one has only one simple idea. Spielberg proceeds to beat you over the head with this idea: There is a big killer shark in that water! And as the film goes on, it gets bigger and bigger.

            "content": "We all remember the first time we saw JAWS. It is a strange quirk that a film so scary is committed to the earliest memories of so many of us.\nWe all remember being taunted by the score. We remember the fear and admiration when Hooper goes down in the cage, and we remember the absolute horror of Ben Gardners eyeless head screaming out at us.From its earliest screenings on TV, through the video boom and beyond, JAWS has somehow been left to wallow towards the 'family' end of the film listings. Perhaps it is Speilbergs subsequent output, or maybe it is the increasingly bad sequels that have given JAWS this peculiar 'spin'.\nI would argue that the well documented production problems encountered by speilberg and his crew, not only contributed to the films success, but also helped to create this unusual positioning of the film within the public psyche. Speilberg was unable to use as much footage of the mechanical shark as he had hoped. Salt water, and the sheer ambition of the animatronics involved conspired to hold up production and force re-write after re-write. It was during this process that the films ebb and flow (apologies), evolved.\nIt was here that the lack of shark would manifest itself as the prolonged sense of foreboding within the film. What developed was a real sense of the fear of the unknown, and this is where much of the films success lies. It tapped into the fear of what might be in the closet, or under the bed. The monster that we know is there even if we cannot see it.It would be interesting to see if our memories of how old we were when we first watched JAWS are correct, or whether it is in re-living the real childhood experience of the hidden monster that makes us believe that we were younger than we were.It is certainly true that Speilbergs youthful brilliance, and Williams unforgettable musical motif carry what could have been an enjoyable B-movie on to a much higher cinematic plane.",

            "content": "The ultimate adventure film, Jaws will almost certainly remain the leading title in its genre. The single founded criticism of the film, which will only increase in severity with each passing year, will be the quality of appearance of the villain. Undoubtedly, for the twenty-first century viewer, the image of the shark would do little to frighten. However, and remarkably so, the quality of the model shark has little influence on just how frightening it, and the movie, is. Why? Because it is not the thought of the shark's appearance that is most frightening, but rather the thought of what the shark will do. Too often thriller/horror films, featuring non- human antagonists rely on the image of the creature to form the climax of the film. Spillberg, instead relies on the Shark's actions to frighten the audience, and a more effective frightening of an audience has never before, or since, been seen. The film, in the words of the producers and director is a straight a-z action film, with little interruption of the realisation of the conflict and the solving of it. Thus, Jaws is a very real candidate for a superficial action film, one which as time ages it's effects, it's quality wains. Yet the performance of the cast is so incredible, that the film's depth exceeds that beyond the waters which the rouge Shark circles. Scheider plays a plagued straight man brilliantly, Dreyfus is everything a good character shouldn't be, a know it all, spoiled, arrogant, condescending, and yet this is precisely why his character is so endearing. Most of all, Shaw's outstanding performance is beyond criticism or comparison. His every scene is a highlight of the film, and his final meeting with the film's antagonist, leads the audience to question just who they're cheering for, albeit momentarily. In watching Jaws, one views perhaps one of the greatest ever cinematic artist's first true critical and commercial smash-hits. It's not his most well-rounded film. The filming is raw, the score confronting and confusing at times, the characters seem ill-developed, and scenes without the villain are spent waiting and hoping for his emergence. And yet, it is these characteristics, or more accurately these qualities, which make Jaws such an incredible film. If seeking to be entertained, watch Jaws. If seeking to be scared, watch Jaws. If seeking to see powerful acting performances, watch Jaws. If seeking to view a film alone, watch Jaws. If seeking to view a film with friends, watch Jaws. If seeking to see a frightening, confronting or grotesque monster, don't watch Jaws. If the purpose of a film is to entertain, then Jaws is the definition of a cinematic success.",

The special effects when we finally see the shark... could have been better. The shark actually probably looked better in later movies, but they just weren't any good here. That said, the technology at the time taken into consideration, I guess it's not bad. And i still prefer animatronic over CGI in some Cases. CGI just looks so fake when it's not done well.This movie was so good, that at the time it made people afraid to go in the water.

It's the start of Spielberg's glittering career and tells the tale of a New York cop (Brody) who has become the chief of police on small island hoping for a quiet life with his wife, Ellen and two kids (here's where the book, written by Peter Benchley, and the film differ greatly). A great white shark decides it quite likes the cuisine served up by Amity Island and it becomes Brody's job to stop it. For a cop that hates the water, it's his biggest challenge ever.

Local Deputy of Chief Police, Martin Brody (played by Roy Scheider), struggles to get the Mayor to understand that the beaches must be closed to prevent any more deaths. Unfortunately, Mayor Larry Vaughn fears the opposite; closing the beaches will ruin Amity Island's summer tourist season, the town's primary income source for the year.It's not long into the film before we and the terrified people of Amity Island discover that this creature of the sea is not one to be messed with. Unseen for the majority of the film (mainly the first half) Steven Spielberg creates a fear of the unknown. And who doesn't fear the unknown? Clever use of the camera and iconic musical score hints that danger is nearby but for the poor guy on screen, they have no idea what's lurking underneath them. It captures the feeling of helplessness I have every time I swim in the ocean, or even when I was younger just in the local swimming pool. Maybe it was Jaws that made me feel this in the first place!Throughout the film, floating objects are used to portray the sharks sense of direction. One scene in particular shows an old wooden dock being snapped out of place and dragged out to sea by the shark before turning and charging back to a panicking swimmer. By using the wooden dock not only can we see the unknown but also register it's sheer strength. It's a monster.I had to wonder who the 'villain' of this film really is. The man-eating killer shark doing what it can to get by or the 'putting everyone's life in stake for profit' Mayor. One shocking scene halfway through the film shows a crowded beach with nobody in the water. The Mayor walks over to a friend, a father with his family, and forces them to get in. They do so unwillingly, their faces read pure fear but eventually it leads to a sea filled buffet for the shark (I don't refer to the shark as Jaws because that's just the name of the film, not the shark itself). It may be shocking but it was a shockingly great way to make the Mayor even more of a douche.Martin Brody soon teams up with shark enthusiast Matt Hooper and shark hunter Quint. There's some tension between them which is escalated with the fact they are alone on a small boat out in the ocean. It creates exciting chemistry when they are risking their lives trying to catch this beast. Despite having more camera time in this part of the movie, the shark looks and moves incredibly well for a film from the 70\u2032s. It definitely still holds up today.It's been almost 40 years since it's release and still Jaws remains as one of the best suspense/thriller film ever released. If you haven't seen this film for whatever reason you need to check it out. If you've already seen it before, maybe it's time to watch it again.",

The pacing is nearly perfect, the story is strong, still fairly frightening (really, after 37 times?) and the acting is good. Many of Spielberg's trademarks grace the film. Solid cinematography all around, some of which has since been taken for granted. Viewed against \"Duel\", its easy to see why he felt he could pull this one off, despite obvious limitations. Knowing the history of \"Jaws\" and seeing it again, it is hard to believe that it was as difficult to make as everybody working on the film has since stated. It feels very natural. I would speculate that it's status in film history would arguably be the same if some of the bumps along the way were apparent in the film. In retrospect, I do see moments in the film where one might suggest its hit a rough patch, but the story itself isn't perfect so I find it difficult to tell. At the same time, I don't feel that I'm doing the film justice by thinking about it heavily. Spielberg later made plenty of those, \"Jaws\" not being one of them. Still, it doesn't leave you brain-dead like the standard popcorn flick (i.e. \"The Lost World\"). This is still very much a cut above most anything like it that followed and only a bit better than \"Duel\", both of which are very close to my film-going heart. Spielberg has not since given us such a shock or such a fright, but almost certainly better films and better stories. I'm giving \"Jaws\" a 9 because it's really a sum of it's parts, and it still works on many levels.",

A brilliant cast and a brilliant story, based on Peter Benchley's terrifying novel of 1974.From the opening scene to its final scene, this film is packed with brilliant dialogue, brilliant characterisations, and a fantastic score by John Williams.Duh, duh, duh, duh!I loved the making of the film too, and hearing that due to the shark not working very well during production, the storyline had to be changed somewhat. It actually provided the film with its numerous scares, which, although granted, probably not as shocking in today's cinema, were really effective.This was a MONSTER hit which put Steven Spielberg on the map and showed what films could do when released as the Summer blockbuster. It was the first film ever to achieve $100 million at the box office.Martha's Vineyard was such a good location to set the film and also contributed to the drama.If you've never seen it before, enjoy!!10/10 for me.",

The thing that makes Jaws so good is that it doesn't just focus on the Shark and them hunting it in the water for 2 hours. The movie has a great script from Peter Benchley (also author of Jaws). Which does focus on other things such as having the protagonist be a man fearing the water setting sail onto a boat to kill a man eating shark. And the characters are all well rounded. They have many faces shown by the actors especially in Richard Dreyfuss's potrail of Hooper. The pacing of this film keeps its suspense going throughout the movie using the classic score by John Williams to inform or surprise use when not being used. And not showing the shark until 3/4s through the movie added more suspense. The film is very well directed and acted which is its major strong points. In my opinion for what the film is trying to achieve it is perfect in every way.",

Then there's the most famous line of the film 'WE're gonna need a bigger boat'. Eventually some very well dragged out I-don't-even-want-to-know-how-long minutes the shark swims around and they watch it as it swims around with a yellow barrel on it.

Surely the fact that the shark has killed yet another person would lend weight to his opinion yet he says nothing about it.

It can't be replicated because we have become so jaded by Jurassic Park, etc., we don't appreciate the subtleties in movie-making. We need to be hit over the head w/it anymore.

            "review_title": "Jaws: Smiling for the Camera",
            "content": "Being scary often means going outside the bounds of concrete reality. It means making something mysterious or otherworldly to attack the irrational corners of the audience's primitive instincts. Michael Meyers, Leatherface, and Pyramid Head are all excellent examples of humans or humanoid creatures that frighten us with their ambiguity. However, there is one movie that manages to truly communicate horror of the unknown in a way unlike any other. That movie is Jaws.Jaws is often considered the first modern summer blockbuster and the first mainstream shark movie. Due to that awful legacy, it's easy to forget what an impressive movie Jaws really is. There's a lot to go over, so here's the basics.The story centers around a New England summer resort town that suffers several vicious shark attacks within days of each other. And during tourist season, no less! After a community panic, an oceanographer, a blue-collar seafarer, and a yuppie police chief all board a small boat to hunt and kill the great white shark terrorising their town. Also, for simplicity's sake, I'll mostly be calling the shark \"Bruce\" from now on.One thing you'll need to know for viewing is that this movie is a slow burn. Most of it is the conflict between Police Chief Brody trying to shut the beach down and the mayor and his committee members trying their best to keep the beaches open for their revenue. But when the action does kick in, it doesn't disappoint. In small bursts during the first half and for most of the second, Bruce becomes the star of the show. So much so that the music and camera work starts to act as an extension of him.The iconic soundtrack by John Williams is an unforgettable part of the experience. When the shark comes around, the soundtrack comes alive as if it were its own character. Whether it be suspenseful, fearful, or even whimsical, the soundtrack is very expressive. The cinematography is the same. Aside from the iconic shots from Bruce's point of view underwater, the camerawork comes alive when he's about to strike.I think you're starting to sense a pattern. The action only really cranks up when Bruce is on the prowl. That's true, but that doesn't mean the quieter parts of the movie don't work just as well. The main trio of characters are Brody, Ichthyologist (essentially a shark-ologist) Matt Hooper, and fisherman Quint. They're a joy to watch, both as a group and on their own merits. Brody is your everyman. He's the blandest at the start, but makes up for it by going through the most change. I'll get to that later, but just know I like him. Hooper is an interesting character. His archetype is the college-educated white kid that's a bit childish despite his intelligence. He often shows an almost child-like happiness in sharing his knowledge on sharks and makes passive-aggressive remarks or funny faces at people after arguing with them. He constantly butts heads with Quint, our final part of the trio. He's a working-class fisherman with a huge sense of pride. He often makes fun of Hooper for his educated approach to things as well as his apparent softness from a cushy life \"counting money.\" His pride also extends to the shark itself. After realizing Bruce is far too big and dangerous for the three of them, Brody attempts to contact their police force by radio. Not wanting to share his glory with anyone else, Quint destroys the radio transmitter, effectively stranding them out at sea with Bruce.Between the killings and the chaotic trio, there's a lot of tense moments in this film. I'll get to that stuff, but the sweeter moments are just as important. Early on, Brody is waiting for Hooper to come over for dinner. He's stressed with his head in his hands. He notices his son copying him, and Brody keeps shifting his hands and watching his son copy his movements. After that, he leans in and asks his son for a kiss on the cheek. When his son asks why, Brody simply says, \"Because I need it.\" His son obliges, and Brody sends him off to bed as Hooper arrives. Ellen, Brody's wife, watches all of this with a surprised look on her face. Almost as if she's surprised that someone made Brody feel a little better. Moments like these always involve Brody. Whether it be with his family or his two crewmates, moments like this are sprinkled throughout the movie. I may just be a sucker, but giving Brody such tender moments with those around him feels very important to his character. Giving a character moments to reflect gives them room to further their arc. Valleys are just as important as peaks in storytelling.Speaking of peaks, the tension I mentioned earlier. There's a lot of it, obviously. A lot of people might like to think of Jaws as a horror movie since it's the first shark movie and those are usually straight-up horror movies. However, Jaws doesn't fit cleanly into a single category. The sheer horror of Bruce tearing apart people is a big part, yes. But I'd argue that the suspense of what he'll do is more important than the actual blood and gore itself. Seeing the viewpoint of Bruce as he closes in on a target is genuinely upsetting. Seeing him toy with Brody and the boys out at sea is exciting and scary. But tension doesn't just begin and end with the monster. There's a lot of drama in the town when Brody wants the beach closed but the mayor and various locals fight him at every turn. Even when out at sea, there's usually no harmony; With a few exceptions, the trio are constantly butting heads when Bruce isn't around to unite them behind a cause. Hell, sometimes the shark isn't enough to keep them from arguing.To be fair, Bruce seems to be an otherworldly horror, so I doubt most people wouldn't panic. But that's something interesting about Bruce. It doesn't act anything like a real shark would. It has an insatiable lust for human blood when sharks don't think humans taste that good; it is intelligent enough to lead the crew out to sea and go under the boat to evade danger; it's strong enough to drag the entire boat at an incredible speed. A lot of people see this film as the origin of our fear of sharks, but that's really only half true. While the movie most likely did popularize the idea that sharks are dangerous killing machines, our brains are why we're so susceptible to believing that when that isn't true. There's nothing cute or appealing about sharks to humans. They're giant, dead-eyed, toothy creatures. So, the caveman side of our mind immediately goes, \"Oh, that's a scary thing. Scary things are dangerous to Grug. It must be a violent monster.\" I think the filmmakers understood the uniquely terrifying look of sharks. However, I don't think they believed that sharks really acted like the one in the movie.I think Bruce is supposed to be a demon in the form of the shark. It even makes a demonic sound after it's head is blown off and begins sinking to the ocean floor. It's meant to symbolize what Chief Brody fears most throughout the movie: the sea and it's untamed danger.The only potential technical flaw in the movie is that the shark isn't anatomically accurate. There's a part late in the movie when Hooper goes into an underwater cage to lure in and drug the shark. When he sees it in the distance, there's pre recorded footage of an actual shark that looks nothing like the animatronic. The animatoric is wider, less graceful, and much squarer. I decided to mention it here because I feel it works for the film. It's almost as if a supernatural force was toying with Hooper. Making him think he was looking at a regular shark only to terrorize him with it's true form. And the differences aren't only visual. It doesn't even eat or attack like a shark would. It acts more like a T-800 unit from The Terminator, bluntly attacking anything that remotely pisses it off but with a disturbing amount of intelligence. The shark isn't an animal. It is the incarnate of the chaotic violence of the sea personified into an intelligent being. A shark just happens to be a fittingly scary animal to take the vague form of.Only when Brody gets over his fear and outsmarts the creature can he and Hooper return home (yeah, Quint is eaten by the shark and it's genuinely upsetting to watch). The whole movie is a metaphor for Brody conquering his fear of the sea by killing one of its most horrifying inhabitants. Personally, I identify with that journey a lot. I hate the ocean for the same reason Brody does. It's big, mysterious, violent, and unpredictable. All you need to do is shrink it down, give it dead eyes and a load or jagged teeth and you have Bruce.ConclusionJaws is one of the most uniquely marvelous movies I've ever seen. Not a single cast member feels out of place, the presentation is beautiful, and the tension is well-managed. People criticize Bruce for being unrealistic. But I don't think the point of Bruce was for it to be like a real shark. Even if that was the intention, the idea that Bruce is a kind of evil spirit taking on a shark's form is much more satisfying. The strange feeling of watching a shark act so human-like and malicious add to the movie's unique strengths. People may be desensitized by the many violent and terrifying horror movies to come out since, but I think most people will still find intrigue in Bruce's unsettling behavior.Aside from that, I appreciate the softer moments between Brody and the other characters. Overall, I think this movie is great at being emotionally powerful in both a sentimental and frightening way. That's all thanks to the atmosphere the crew helped craft. This is an easy recommendation to anyone, diehard film buff or no.",

If you haven't seen this movie, which is odd, you have to. There will never be another shark movie that beats Jaws. Deep Blue Sea was cool, using both digital and animatronic sharks but it just didn't reach better than Jaws in my head. The second Jaws installments was okay but not as good as number one. Number 3-D was the worst-second to worst movie I ever saw. Jaws the Revenge, had a more realistic shark but acting could have been better.

By simply being part of society one has heard a lot about it without watching it: the string orchestra, the fact that it invented the \"anticipation\"-scariness, and some conspiracy theories surrounding the movie.I avoided watching it due to the fear, that it might be 2 full hours of humans not being able to kill a shark - which in my mind seemed like a boring and unrealistic premise. On the other hand, it is a classic that I had to watch at one point in my life. With that in mind, my girlfriend and I started watching the movie in late 2020.The opening scene was good and it set the tone for the main narrative: watch out, shark dangerous. Obviously, nobody in the town would believe that it was a shark or that a shark was a real threat. After a lot of denial by smug businessman and an incompetent mayor, it is decided that the beach opens for main season. Resulting in massive head-shaking from the viewer: \"The movie is only halfway, this is a bad idea\".Long story short. One crazy old guy believes that the shark is not gone. Shark comes back and starts dining with a beach-view. The town people, not so keen on dipping anymore, change their minds and send the main character out on a boat with the crazy old guy to hunt the shark. The hunt is successful but surprisingly catchy and gripping. In the end, the good people win and the main storyline is solved.Overall, this movie contains a lot of known stereotypes: the smart nerd, the overwhelmed police, the smug businessman, the traumatized veteran, and the ignorant public. However, most of them were probably coined by \"Jaws\" in the first place. If you want something fresh, this movie should not be for you. If you want to admire a classic, please go for it. Despite the Hollywood-quality production and a lot of legendary shots, my initial concerns about the storyline held somewhat true.",

It has lots of quotable lines and many great characters . However, it seems funny that you have a shark expert with a State of the art boat with all of the latest technology and gear yet you hire a crusty fisherman with an old boat for the job. And it doesn't make sense that on the busiest weekend of the year the chief of police who has no experience fishing and hates being out on the water would go help catch the shark, especially when you have an island full of well seasoned fisherman but that being said, it still works so well and is such a great film! This is the only one for me. Jaws 2,3,4,3D are no comparison to the first film .",

Sat in the dark with the sound blasting out of my Denon 7.1 system (first time I think I have actually noticed how good the Dolby Digital mix is on the disc) and got to admit it I'm totally in love with the movie all over again.From the opening scenes of Chrissie taking her fatal skinny dip to the survivors paddling the makeshift raft to shore and end credits you are hooked. Yes the shark has aged badly but you will never see a more well rounded and balanced main cast, with whom you find yourself empathising and caring about.With out doubt it's the cast, the music (John Williams at his finest - the music actually becoming the shark at times, as the special effects did not always work) and the scripting that make this such a great movie.Shaw's USS Indianapolis speech (his own words by the way) is as powerful today as it was back in 1975, letting you into the mind set of Quint and his need to avenge his fallen shipmates by hunting sharks. Schneider (best role of his career by some margin) excels as the hydrophobic Brody struggling with and eventually over coming his childhood demons and Drayfus is totally compelling as the rich, eccentric marine biologist Hooper driven by his quest to understand the creatures he as worshiped since childhood.Rumour control is awash with re-make noises; please people leave it alone - because yes it's just that good.",

The shark itself looks pretty fake, but you rarely actually see the whole shark, so it doesn't take you out of the movie. The horror/thrills comes from suspense and tension, so it's still an effective horror movie today (although not as gory as more recent films). Some scenes were so tense my eyes started stinging because I was too focused to remember to blink. Many things about the film are dated, but again, it doesn't take you out of the experience. Also, I've been told one the best thing about Jaws is the characters, and I agree. The three main characters are flawed but likeable, it's very satisfying to watch them work together as a team. This is truly a testament to Spielburg's talent; it's very easy to see how in a lesser director's hands, this film wouldn't be worth watching today. Overall, it's obvious why Jaws was America's first blockbuster, and it's definitely worth watching. I wanted to re-watch it almost as soon as I finished it the first time, and for me, that's really saying something.",

I guess this movie to me defined what a true Blockbuster movie should be, I'm not going to give a full review of the movie as it has had already ample of reviews and votes etc.I will say my favourite scene in the movie has to be the speech given by Quint (Robert Shaw) to chief Brody (Roy Scheider) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss)on board the Orca in search of the Great White. Starting of with comparing scars to Quints recollection of his time on board the USS Indianapolis and how him and his fellow crew were subjected to shark attacks when there ship sank. I found this a fascinating story and didn't realise that this in fact actually happened and the author of Jaws had incorporated it into his novel then into the movie. I will leave a link for anyone interested in having a look http://www.ussindianapolis.org/.I will finish by saying that anyone who has not seen this SHOULD as they don't make blockbusters like this anymore, try and get the 25th Anniversary edition as its packed with lots of extras.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg is a known name in the film industry, though it wasn't until after 1975 and the release of Jaws, was he a house-hold name. The intensity of the film is kept up through the entire length, until the very end. The homely town of Amity, which means friendship, is a summer town that survives off the tourists who come and enjoy their beautiful beaches until late September. To create such a horrific film, the director had to establish great exposition for the story, and the homelier the family, the better. Mr. and Mrs. Sheriff Brody, and their two boys are new to town, helping celebrate their first summer in such an attractive area. Establishing the main characters are outsiders, helps the audience understand the severity of the attacks and the danger that can come from not acting sensibly during this high- traffic season. The mystery of the shark is what keeps the senses high, even the shark expert is astounded at the discovery. Spielberg's use of open space, and overcrowding shows the chaos thoroughly through the film. The crowded beaches, give a sense of entrapment, while the open water gives a space for the unknown to strike fear within the citizens of Amity. Each characters plays an important role, the supportive wife of the Sheriff who is only doing his job, but trying to save as many as he can. The role of the mayor is important, because of his defiance, but near the end, he realizes his kids play on those beaches too, leading to a change of heart. Hooper's intelligence on the subject leads him to be one of the most reliable characters, spouting facts and threats, left and right. His certainty and his own fear creates the atmosphere Spielberg's audience is waiting for. This film is a masterpiece before, and after it's time.",

A movie like this is so good because the audience can really transport themselves into it and become lost in it, maximizing the entertainment value of the movie. I completely lose it whenever I watch Quint's speech about the USS Indianapolis, because Shaw is so convincing in conveying the pain his character feels when recounting the horrific ordeal of the ship's crew. He immediately becomes humanized, rather than just being \"that crazy old Ahab-type fellow.\"True, the book was a great work of literature, and there were quite a few liberties taken in the transition from page to screen, but that was necessary. Anyone who has read the book will tell you that there were things that needed to be omitted, and things that had to be altered. Hey, even Peter Benchley himself felt things needed to be changed for the adaptation, so he took the task himself.

This could actually happen in real life, which is what makes the movie so terrifying. I am a huge horror fan and have watched all sorts of horror movies, it seems to be a trend these days to capture maximum amounts of blood and suffering on camera to equate to a decent horror movie. This annoys me as a horror fan, as I feel that true horror is built through the unknown, suspense and the feeling of impending doom. Jaws captures all of these components with ease, hence why I would call it the scariest movie I have ever seen. The opening scene is the most horrific scene I have ever seen, yet you don't actually see any blood or what is killing the girl. Then you barely see the shark until the end of the movie, which is a stroke of genius from Spielberg. Too many movies force feed the audience these days, and require little to no mental effort from the viewer to imagine things or to try to analyse exactly what is going on. Jaws engages your imagination right from the beginning and makes you actually think about what is going on, what will happen next and you have an emotional link to the characters. You care about them and can feel their fear and suffering through the screen.\nA must see movie.

And because of this it was a lot more scary because you new that the shark was their but you couldn't see it so it provided suspense. The idea of using a mechanical shark in the ocean seemed easy to do at first but it failed so many times but with the expertise of Steven, he made the movie look awesome. Last but not least Quints Indianapolis speech was the best speech in movie history and Brody's line \"We're gonna need a bigger boat\" is the most iconic line in the movie and second best line out of all the movies next to Darth Vader's line \"I am you're father\".

I was wondering why it was such a classic. Well, I saw it on HBO a few years ago and damn, was I wrong.I watched it when I was probably 13 or 14. I easily scare but this one really got to me. I never thought that a movie about a shark terrorizing people would be so scary. My heart was pounding while watching the movie. Heck, I even had a nightmare the night after watching it. It was so horrible that I woke up with tears in my eyes. That had never happened to me so it was a real shocker. Definitely recommend this movie to all thrill-seekers.",

            "content": "Straight out the gate , I must admit that I love this Movie!! Ever since I first saw it at the age of 3 when it was premiered on TV. I have watched Jaws more times than any other film, and I have seen a lot. This film has everything you could want from a movie, thrills, chills and excitement, as well as a great story and some damn fine acting from three of the best of they're times. The scenery, Camera- work and pacing are all top notch, but then again would you expect anything less from a Master Film Maker like Spielberg?As i mentioned previously, the actors in this movie are all excellent, especially the three main characters Brody, Hooper and the excellent Quint. Roy Scheider is great as the put upon town sheriff Martin Brody, and a Young Richard Dreyfuss has just enough smart ass knowledge to be likable as Matt Hooper, But undoubtedly the greatest role went to Robert Shaw who plays the hard drinking, abrasively salty sea Captain Samuel Quint, the movies own take on Captain Ahab!Other standout roles are Lorraine Gary as Brody's long suffering Wife Ellen and Murray Hamilton as the weasel like Town Mayor Larry Vaughne.Then of course we must mention Bruce.... The name given to the much maligned mechanical shark that was used in this movie by Spielberg is also the name of his Lawyer. Much has been written about the nightmare the crew had filming out at sea with a shark that didn't want to stop sinking etc, but in the end great craftsmanship made it all work out for the better.I hold this movie in very high regard and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good time with a few scares here and there along the way.10/10",

Robert Shaw could not have been better. Roy Sheider and Richard Dryfuss were equally outstanding. They just don't make em' like this anymore. No movie has ever equalled the downright hysteria that this 'Jaws' created back in the Summer of 75'.....If a bigger blockbuster comes along---I hope I'm around to see it.

It all starts when Crissie Watkins goes out for a late night swim and is killed by a shark. The mayor keeps the beaches open, and as a result, a young boy is killed next. Next comes a frenzy of people wanting to kill the shark for a reward and they kill the wrong shark. On Independence Day, a prank by two boys takes a scary turn when the shark gets into the estuary and eats a man and almost kills 3 boys, knocking one unconscious. Police Chief Martin Brody, Oceanologist Matt Hooper and Grizzled Fisherman Quint go on a dangerous mission to kill the shark. The shark is revealed to be a twenty five footer and as the men attempt to kill it, many things go wrong and its a fight for survival. This is horror at its best. Whoever says it isn't horror is pure stupid because this movie is possibly the scariest I have ever seen. I wouldn't watch the sequels, as they aren't that good, but Jaws 1 is a great Summer blockbuster that will frighten many generations to come.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg's Jaws is certainly unlike any film I have seen before. Though I have seen it before viewing it in this class, it was a refresher on how ahead of its time it really was. With everything from the special effects to the sound effects to the believable props, it convinces the audience they should be on the lookout for sharks the next time they are in the ocean (even though it rarely happens in real life). Though this film is classified as adventure, drama, and thriller, I think it should be classified as more of a thriller than anything else. I say this purely because of the scenes where people are swimming in the ocean and have no idea there is a shark creeping up on them. This causes the audience to feel \"thrilled\" and scared for the victim but they cannot do anything about it. These scenes kind of reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Even though the plots are completely different, both films portray the fact that the worst things can happen to us when we are most vulnerable. Whether it is in the shower, when we are sleeping, or trying to enjoy vacation, these films make some of us afraid to go through with every day tasks even though we should not be. Aside from the plot, I am impressed with how the film took off. For example, I cannot imagine going to a public pool and not hearing a kid sneak up on his/her friend while humming the Jaws \"first victim\" tune. To this day, people are still making Jaws references and that truly shows how big of an impact it made on history.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg's \"Jaws\" is such a great classic for many reasons. It is more than just a an over dramatized shark film, it has substance and cinematic elements that make it a truly great and lasting classic. What makes \"Jaws\" so engaging is the fact that it is packed full of suspense.The film starts off strong with it's opening scene and first attack. The audience already knows something bad is going to happen to the skinny dipping woman due to the film's initial focus, however, the most wonderful part of it all is that the shark is not shown at all in this scene. The feeling of suspense was solely gained from the terrifying silence, the vast openness of the dark ocean, and the incredibly vulnerable shots of the girls legs dangling from underneath the water. The fact that the monster is not shown right away builds suspense in the film to such a high level, providing a fear of the unknown that affects the viewers for much of the film. Another huge factor of Jaws that provides suspense is the theme song. Each scene that shark was in the theme song was also present, which forces the viewers to correlate the song with danger. The song itself builds up by starting slower and increasing in speed, which creates a sense of suspense along with the other elements within a given scene. Overall, Jaws is such a classic film due to its innovation in the creation of suspense in film. Spielberg did an amazing job creating suspense for the viewers through several elements including sound and visuals.",

Considering this is one of his first films is incredible. I can only imagine how audiences reacted in 1975 when this film first came out. Additionally John Williams score is one of the best and most suspenseful ever. The way the film blends with the music with the visuals is very smooth and gives off a greater sense of dread whenever the shark is lurking in the waters below. The performances in this film are also sensational all around especially from Robert Shaw as quint, a crusty old sailor who was my personal favourite character in the movie. The only issues I have with this film are little nitpicks that I wont spoil for you. Besides that this film is exceptional and I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves movies as much as I do.

Robert Shaw was awesome portraying the character of Quint. It is also neat to see a young Richard Dreyfuss play the geeky marine biologist. Roy Scheiner was good in both Jaws and Jaws 2. A scary scene for me in this movie is when Quint tells his story of the sailors on the U.S.S. Independence being eaten by sharks. Another scary scene is when Jaws raises the boat up and Quint slides into his mouth. This is a movie that I have seen over twenty times and every time it comes on TV I still watch it.

Personally, I would classify it as a suspense thriller,  because of the reality factor of a great white shark that has got to be exterminated.  A horror involves inconceivable creatures from beyond like FREDDY in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or DRACULA.JAWS awakens a fear in all of us that is familiar ( perhaps that explains the popularity of the film) which is further accentuated by that spine-chilling musical score when the shark is about to attack. Perhaps this is only my imagination,  but you won't see smiles on people's faces when they see JAWS,  because they recognise the familiar fear of standing waist-deep in water or paddling with a surfboard without really knowing the territory beneath them.This is of course where DEEP BLUE SEA fails terribly.  People actually laugh at DBS, because they know they are in for something like:   Shark meets Frankenstein versus Alien on the set of THE ABYSS with crappy computer graphics.SPOILER WARNINGIf  I'm forced to find something wrong with JAWS  then there would be this one scene where the shark leaps out of the water and actually bumps against the backside of Quint's  boat with its stomach.  It is a very short scene in the last 20 minutes of the film,  but the `mechanical man-made' shark is very clear in this scene.Quint was also a tough character,  but why did the shark had to devour him? In my opinion he should have lived.SPOILER ENDNevertheless,  JAWS is the Classic shark horror of all times!9 out of 10.",

It is scary without showing too much, and it has excellent payoff when there is the reveal at the end. The characters in this movie all feel like real people and are all enjoyable to spend time with. The three main characters (Brody, Quint, and Hooper) have amazing chemistry together and are just as interesting as the shark. The dialogue is perfect. I cannot fault the script at all. The score is absolutely iconic, you can't find anyone who doesn't know the Jaws theme. The ending of the movie is intense and perfect, and is really just a great end to a perfect movie.

Acting is only good from my perspective.But what made me rate it 3/10 is how evil this film created not only for the species of the matter, but for the whole ocean ecosystem. This is the single piece of media created a whole panic in the population around sharks. Lots and lots of specimens have been slaughtered just \"for sports\" because it became cool and manly to be a shark killer.The lack of commitment to the true behavior of the species made it look diabolic. Sharks are not man eaters, they don't even appreciate human flesh. We lack fat and meat for them. They don't carry the feeling of anger, they don't kill for fun, they don't eat wood, boat parts, license plates. And they're not as huge as the movie portraits.It's ok, film industry needs a villain. But today we see the film industry can also be the villain for a whole species. The amount of shark species under threat of extinction or already extinct is uncountable.Thank you mr. Spielberg.",

Robert Shaw produces the performance of his life. Over the top - perhaps but he pulls it off and it is impossible to take your eyes off him.

Let's face it every other shark movie since Jaws has been a dud (with the exception of Jaws 2).Quint as the iconic captain of the ship, Chief Brody as the police chief, and Hooper as the scientist all find themselves fighting for their lives from the shark known to the cast and crew as \"Bruce.\" Jaws basically coined the phrase, \"We're going to need a bigger boat\u0085\" Spielberg, frustrated by the mechanical shark's ongoing mechanical failures relied on using the camera as the point of view of the shark. This added an element of suspense that was topped by no other movie.Spielberg somehow found a way to make this movie work and created a film that gave all viewers a fascination with sharks. I will always remember watching this movie with my parents on VHS (yeah\u0085VHS!) and having to close my eyes every time I heard \"dun dun..dun dun\u0085.\"",

Okay, so you may not be as frightened as you may have been as a kid, but as adults, we can all appreciate Steven's Spielberg's talent.The tension, the suspense, the fear, all of the aspects from the book are here, but the director has also borough photography, music, and superb acting to the movie / film. There is no need to write a long review, just watch the film yourself, and be amazed. Then, read the book, and watch the film all over again. I give the film 9/10, one point being deducted for a pretty rubbish shark. I think we should not have seen the shark until the very end, but that's just my opinion.Simply a masterpiece, every bit of it...",

Basically, a great white shark begins attacking beach-goers on the small town of Amity Island. As more and more people die, a fisherman (Quint), the chief of police (Brody), and an oceanic expert (Hooper) set out to catch the beast. It ends with Quint being eaten alive by the shark and Hooper goes into a shark cage to try to poison the shark but the shark attacks him and he merely escapes. Finally, Brody kills the shark by putting a compressed air tank into the shark's mouth and shooting it so it blows up in a slow-motion, bloody explosion of epic proportions! This is my favorite movie of all time, and if you've seen this movie, you'd know exactly why. If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and go see it! It's worth it!

Although it was noted that the production costs were going over budget and there seemed to be many malfunctions with the robotic sharks, there would be a big surplus. The editing done to capture the camera work between the great white shark and people being terrorized was unique during the time this film was released. It is considered a classic also for the soundtrack to create tension for viewers watching the film and anticipating what will happen for the survival of the characters after encountering a shark. Overall Jaws had the highest grossing film of all time until other well-recognized films would top this. It is difficult for the audience to miss the camera work of extreme close-ups between the characters in the film and the close up of the sharks as the suspense is built throughout. Steven Spielberg took this creativity of the staging for this film and worked with the elements of water. Spielberg generally avoided low-key lighting during the film so viewers could clearly see the distance of the shark and it's victims. He took this film to the next level of shocking viewers using a soundtrack that keeps the audience on its toes for what will happen next as the camera zooms in to the shark. Actors, Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss worked incredibly well together that will have the audience anticipate what will happen as they encounter the great white shark.",

From the film's dynamic soundtrack to the blood-tinged beach, Jaws set the standard for shark thrillers and created a genre that recognized the appeal of this predator bound to the ocean. The soundtrack alone is recognized within two notes. When John Williams created the iconic score, it set hearts pounding and determined the arrival of the man-eating Great White. The audience sees themselves in Chief Brody, a man who strives to protect his family, his community, and the unsuspecting public from the predatory shark lurking in the shallows. Spielberg allows the audience to experience the turmoil in Brody's mind as he faces opposition from city council members. We feel Brody's terror with each shark attack and how powerless he feels against it. We sense his desperation as he hires Quint, the strange fisherman with a tragic past, to slay the beast ravaging the island. As Brody sets aside his fear of the ocean, the audience joins his quest to comb the ocean for the killer with a determination that has us on the edge of our seats. With every close call, near miss, and shot fired, the audience is drawn deeper and deeper into the hunt for Jaws. From the opening credits, Williams builds our suspense with each note, as Spielberg constructs each shot to create a seamless narrative and a cinematic experience that is not easily forgotten.",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERTJaws is a great movie for its time. Stephen Spielberg builds suspense in a way like no other. Given the tile of the movie and trailers you pretty much know what the movie is about. In the beginning of the movie there is an underscore of suspenseful music and underwater shots that move threw people's legs as they are swimming in the ocean implying that there is shark coming to attack, though the shark is never revealed. Not only does the music build suspense but not revealing the shark does as well. There are two incidences where the shark attacks but is not seen. That keep the audience on their toes wanting to see the shark making the reveal of the shark epic. The music isn't the only thing that built up the suspense. The use of shot reverse shot between the chief and the ocean made you worry that shark was going to strike again. Also, in the second half of the movie, where the tree guys were hunting the shark, silence and the openness of the big ocean and the one boat was the key to the suspense of the film. The audience knows the shark would show up but not when because of the silence. This movie also shows character development. The chief for example hated the water in the beginning of the movie but is the one to defeat the shark in the end. After being on the boat together for a while, the three guys developed a relationship. Hooper and Broddy already had a friendship going, but weren't too fond of Quint. It was nice to see the relationship and trust eventually grow over time. This suspenseful movie is fun to watch not just because it keeps the audience on their toes, but because of the beauty of the beach and water and the great special effects of the shark.",

Two very popular things that are still going on in today's world. Almost every decision in business today revolves around that and we saw the Chief want to look out for the betterment of the people whereas his counterpart the mayor was concerned with money and greed. It leaves the audience to pick a side, which many of us do throughout the film and stick to it. We root for one or the other and hope their way goes right. Spielberg, keeps the audience guessing until the very end, while the events are unfolding we do not know until the end how this story will play out is the mark of a good film. In many of today's films we see the men vs. nature conflict- this is one of the films that broke into the scene and really hit a home run with it. Almost every major film deals with a monster, animal, or some creature and this is a true Dave vs. Goliath story.

            "content": "When you hear the name Steven Spielberg, a few excellent films come to mind: Saving Private Ryan, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, and last but most definitely not least Jaws. Jaws has been captivating audiences since it's release in 1975, the film has survived the test of time for a few reasons; for instance the structure of a strong cast. The film is lead by Roy Scheider who does a spectacular job of telling the story of lead character Chief Martin Brody, he is able to use his emotion in the film to tell the audience that there is more than what meets the eye of Chief Brody. The other shining light acting wise in this film is the star Richard Dreyfuss and his portrayal of Matt Hooper; Dreyfuss truly establishes himself as a top tier actor in this film even though it isn't a film where he has the lead role. Dreyfuss exhibits something that is truly difficult to show, and that is believable body language throughout the film, which is what separates high-caliber acting from just average acting. The acting itself isn't the only thing to carry this film into greatness, the score of this film is what truly brings this film into fruition. The score by John Williams is iconic in a way itself.The score for Jaws is a score that will live on in film history as it is the perfect culmination of story telling and emotion inducing. Everyone recognizes the suspenseful music that goes on throughout the film, and it tells two stories one of the story of the main character, the Shark, and then one of the victims; it portrays the shark as an unstoppable force and it creates an atmosphere which is overpowering to us humans that aren't so relentless. What makes this film truly stand out is the subject manner in the film. Jaws brings out the wrath of one of mother nature's children and causes the fear that is generated from this film to be real; it does something many films have tried to do and some films are still trying to do and it creates a real fear using real-world monsters. Jaws is and will continue to be a contributing factor in the history of film for all these reasons and solidifies the thriller genre as a very important one.",

The Effects are excellent with a shark that looked realistic enough for me! Some people have criticised it and said that it would be better if done by CG but as in the case of Spielberg's other masterpiece E.T sometimes creating the actual model itself brings the best out of actors. But for me what was personally responsible for most of the film's success was the chilling score which becomes the voice and character of the shark. A well deserved Oscar for John Williams.",

I'm 35 years old today....5 at the time of the release of the movie. Even though the movie was quite a scare for me in the younger years...it brings back good memories of growing up near the water with my little brother...the good ones. I love the beach, the water and boating and fishing.This movie did change the way many people look at the ocean now and how much time they spend at the beaches actually \"swimming\".

The characters are all quite enjoyable and Chief Brody, Matt Hooper, and Quint are all unique characters with varying personalities creating a lot of funny banter and relationships that are thoroughly built throughout the film. Amity is also a very beautiful place and the environment and beach setting is quite nice paired with the fantastic camerawork. The cinematography is truly phenomenal and the pacing and editing create a lot of suspenseful and intense moments. The movie allows the viewer to watch as the camera pans from different characters and slowly moving back and forth, which allows the viewer to question who the Sharks next victim is. The tension building and sheer nerve racking moments are done perfectly and the Shark itself is a terrifying menace especially when It lurks under the water mostly out of sight and even out of the water the animatronic doesn't look terrible. The drama aspect of the also adds a lot and the perils of the characters are all conveyed quite early but are believable and relatable goals. The humanity and building up of the characters is when Spielberg is at his best however and there are a couple endearing moments. The final act is also a very adventurous and intense climax to an already amazingly well structured film. The writing is top notch perfection providing us with many classic lines and who could forget John Williams incredible score for the film.

There was a court martial because the Navy had to blame SOMEONE -- protocol was to zig zag to avoid torpedoes and the Indianapolis was not zig zagging. The captain of the Japanese sub that sank the ship said it wouldn't have made a difference, he STILL would have destroyed the ship.

            "content": "Robert Shaw's fingernails on the chalk board at the town meeting was the perfect way of introducing Amity's potential savior. What he might not have known about rogue shark mentality and territorial behavior is provided by Richard Dreyfuss' character, derided by Captain Quint as a mere college boy, but with enough sea smarts to know that this could be the big one. Boy, was it!I forgot about the dead sailor in the hull of the boat discovered by Hooper (Dreyfuss). It's still one of those unexpected 'oh s---' moments in movies that works even after the gimmick has been played out countless times since. What's remarkable about the film is it's ability to convey unspeakable horror in a way that doesn't get in your face. The opening scene is a perfect example, but how about when that patrolman's leg gets lopped off in the water and slowly floats down to the sea floor - the stuff nightmares are made of.Filmed in the vicinity of Martha's Vineyard in the fictional town of Amity, the picture also explores the crass commercialism of summer tourism winning out over safety concerns. Murray Hamilton's Mayor Vaughn is a master of the spin machine that successfully lures the crowds to the beach on the Fourth of July, right before the fireworks break loose. The beach reporter on the scene is none other than Peter Benchley, who wrote the novel and screenplay.When I saw this movie when it first came out, I recall doing an 'aw c'mon' when Brody shoots the cylinder in the shark's mouth sending it to fish heaven. But you know what, it might have been luck, but it certainly wasn't for lack of trying. It took Brody six shots before connecting with the big bang; just in time too since he was going down with the ship. Did anyone else besides me forget about Hooper in all the excitement until he surfaced to hook up with Brody after the fish fry?",

            "content": "\"Jaws\" is, quite simply, my favourite movie, of any genre, of all time.  A true blockbuster, it brought a new kind of fear to the movie-goer, and director Steven Spielberg holds us spellbound with masterly sleight of hand throughout the glorious two hours.My own feelings are that \"Jaws\" should have been a pure-and-simple one-off. After all, how do you top a classic like that?  It was questionable, at best, to bring out the first sequel in 1978, although it passes as watchable.  The third in the series in 1983 was poor, and the last, in 1987, was quite laughable.  I cannot make my mind up as to whether these sequels devalue the classic original, or merely serve to remind us of the first film's greatness.  But there is no doubt that after 1975, the series had lost its bite (pun most definitely intended).Finally, I can thoroughly recommend watching the film on DVD.  If you haven't experienced this, do yourself a big favour and invest in one. Then, to add to the effect, use headphones, darken the room and enjoy the brilliant combination of John Williams' superb score and Spielberg's chilling opening scene.  I have been watching this movie for 27 years and still love it every time.",

            "content": "\"Jaws\" may be considered one of the best thrillers of all time. From a best selling book, to the big screen in (1975) that changed summer hits forever, Seven Spielberg's brilliant approach to an average book puts him on the map of directors forever. \"Jaws\" is about the small town of Amity and how a great white shark becomes a menace while Sam Quint (Robert Shaw), Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), and Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) attempt to stop the kayos. The overall theme of the movie is simple, respect the sharks and always take a bigger boat. \"Jaws\" starts with a young girl being killed by a shark which sends panic through the small town of Amity. With the island depending on tourism the Mayor wants the beaches open despite the incident. Brody, the town's chief of police, is against the idea but opens the beaches anyway. With a $3000 reward put up by a mother who just lost her son, the town goes into a frenzy to catch the shark and claim the prize. A shark is caught but it is quickly learned that it was the wrong shark. Brody decides to take Shaw who is a veteran shark hunter and Hooper who is a scientist out to see to catch the shark. The shark is smarter than the three think. After being hunted the shark ends up on the back of the boat and almost eating one of the men. Some how Brody is able to lodge an air tank in the sharks mouth and it is detonated sending the shark to the bottom of the ocean. \"Deep Blue Sea\" is similar to \"Jaws with the theme of respect the shark. \"Deep Blue Sea\" may not have been as big of a block buster but the movie shows that sharks are smart and they should be respected. The lighting in \"Jaws\" was brilliant for its time. With the movie being filmed outside most of the time, the use of glares and other forms of lighting was brilliant for its time. Viewing the Anniversary Collector's Edition in widescreen is better than the original. It is much clearer and the screen being wider gives the viewer more to see. \"Jaws\" is a movie that changed how we watch movies forever. We are forever reminded to not only respect the sharks but always take a bigger boat.",

            "content": "Jaws The movie Jaws is a suspenseful thriller about a gargantuan, man-eating, great white shark that is using the beaches off Amity Island as its own personal hunting ground. The local islanders of Amity Island refuse to close the beaches, because they do not want to loose money produced from tourism. Therefore, the killer shark continues to attack and kill whoever goes into the water. Hence, the local sheriff takes matters into his own hands and gets the mayor to agree to hunt down the shark and kill it before anyone else turns up dead.The movie was produced in 1975 and was directed by Steven Spielberg. Robert Shaw, played Mr. Quint, the crazed, psychotic shark hunter. Matt Hooper , played by Richard Dreyfuss, was the eccentric oceanographer brought in to study and educate the town about the shark. Martin Brody, played by Roy Scheider, played Amity Island's Chief of Police who suffered from aqua-phobia. This film shows the true-life terror of the situation we put ourselves into once entering the ocean's waters. We become the prey at the bottom of the ocean's food chain.This film was acted out brilliantly and brings the viewer to edge of their seat. Steven Spielberg uses special effects in the movie that sends chills down your spine as the killer shark (a mechanical shark) lunges out of the water and attacks the unsuspecting swimmers. The shark with its dead, piercing eyes and enormous layers of razor sharp teeth grabs its prey and begins to feast in front of our very eyes. The shark reminds the audience of the real life possibility of this situation happening to them at any time they enter the ocean. The movie The Deep also uses these same scenario to alarm its audience, as abandoned divers are being feasted upon in shark invested waters.Furthermore, Spielberg uses light to bring out the terror of the true life situation. The demonic, killer shark is a nocturnal hunter; therefore, during the most intense scenes in the movie the screen is dark and a shot of light is shone right at a crucial moment in the film. This technique makes these horrifying scenes even more intense. For example, Matt Hooper dives into the water to investigate an abandoned boat owned by one of the local islanders. The scene is shot at night and the whole screen is dark except for a beam of light from his flashlight. As he investigates the boat, he shines his light on a huge chunk that has been bitten out of the side of the boat. He realizes there is a gigantic shark tooth still stuck in the boat. As he moves in to investigate the tooth further, his beam of light lands on a decapitated head as it flows out towards him. Once again, the audience is jarred with the terrifying reality of the situation.This movie was intensely thrilling and it is a true reminder of the chance we take once we enter into the domain of these gigantic, carnivorous creatures that don't mind eating us for dinner!",

Even the 30th Anniversary edition has the deleted scenes not back in the movie but outside of the movie in a series of clips. If it was good enough to make it the big screen, it should be good enough to be in the home video versions. Steven Spielberg should be ashamed!Anyone purchasing this movie will therefore get a chopped up version of the original. That is a disgrace to the movie and a way to rip consumers off. It is extremely cheesy to remove scenes after the movie leaves the theater. If the movie is longer that way, who cares.

            "content": "\"Jaws\" was a movie that set standards for current movies and for a film that is more than thirty-five years old, it is still popular today. Based on the motif of a shark that has gotten hungry and now it must find a place to feed. While getting ready to feed is the other thing this film is responsible for, which is the simple yet very well known little two note sound that signifies terror is coming. Set on an island in the north east that depends on the summer season to draw tourists to their beaches. This very way of life is about to be impacted by a very large predator.Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) finds the remains of a victim attacked by this shark and in the interest of public safety is trying to close the beaches until the shark can be taken care of. He is meeting great opposition from the mayor, and the mother who puts up a ransom for the shark also creates great chaos amongst the townspeople. Quint (Robert Shaw) is a shark hunter who comes into town and offers to kill the share, for a price of course. Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) was a young scientist who was interested in studying sharks.Quint, Hooper and Brody all take to the sea on-board the motor vessel Orca, owned by Quint. While on-board, the team starts their hunt and fairly quickly are finding themselves face to face with the largest Great White shark any have ever seen. Lighting is very important in this film and is effectively used while on the boat. Night has fallen and the only noises left are the waves slapping against the hull, a dim flickering light casts shadows among the men as they sit telling stories, building the mood and then, the sound. The team tries many ideas in an attempt to capture and kill the shark. Many of these methods prove to be unsuccessful leading them to try another. Finally, Hooper ends up in a cage trying to stick dart into the shark when the cage is attacked and torn apart. Hooper drops out of the cage, and disappeared for awhile. Quint and Brody continue to battle with the shark that is continuing to tear apart the very boat they are on. Camera angles play a very important role in this scene building anticipation and showing the distress on Quint's face as the shark pulls the transom off of the boat.The boat cannot operate normally without the stern so it starts listing to severely which creates a steep slope. Quint starts sliding down this slope until he meets his end, leaving Brody all on his own. Some quick thinking and remembering something Hooper said finally saved Brody's life soon followed by the surfacing of Hooper.",

            "content": "The acting in Jaws overall is very good. Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody quite well. He plays the character very serious and very dedicated. Though Roy in my opinion doesn't always show his emotions clearly. Something would happen like a shark attack and his face would just stay in the same image with words being spoke seriously. I mean sometimes its cardboard.In one of the scenes i did spot Roy laughing at a boating crew that were going to die.That felt very out of character,But overall he did play Brody quite well.Robert shaw as Quint was very good. The character was quite weird.He laughs at things that aren't really funny,he sings in tense moments,and he talks very loud but yet his face stays calm.I loved Quin.Richard Dreyfuss played hooper and for me was the best actor in this along with Robert Shaw. These two characters Hooper and Quin,sometimes they get along with each other and other times they hate each other for no real reason. Hooper is a shark lover and knows it all about them.Towards the end of the film he becomes a brave character that can be scared in a calm way.The plot in my opinion was not that bad as people make it out to be. Yes,it could have been better like a stranded situation for the whole of the movie,but it did build up.A shark terrorises a beach at Amity Island,and Chief Brody Wants the beach to be shut,but the mayor wants tourists so he doesn't close it. Quin,Hooper and Brody go out to sea to hunt down the shark.I know it wasn't a very detailed description but I'm trying to keep it short and simple to follow.The score was excellent.John Williams was the composer.The opening music was slow,but got faster as this creature under the water was getting closer to its victim.Very chilling.But,sometimes it was a bit corny but it did capture the mood in someways.This dates back to 1975,so yes,it does look a little bit outdated.Overall the movie makes you jump a fair couple of times and it is a really enjoyable film which should be experienced. Though at times is slow and boring.",

            "content": "After so many years, Jaws is probably on my list as one of my five favorite films of all time. I never get tired of watching this movie. It's just got one of those feelings that Hollywood will never, ever be able to reproduce. I doubt there is anything I could say about this movie that would do it justice and that others haven't already said better than I, so I'll just mention a few of the things that make me keep on coming back for more.So many to chose from... well, there is the shark, of coarse. Brilliant move by Spielberg in not showing it until the third act. In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, \"We're gonna need a bigger boat\", \"This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propeller, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark\", \"Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!\", and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has received it has earned.I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a \"making of\", deleted scenes and outtakes. Definitely money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The \"making of\" feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it.Don't go in the water!!",
