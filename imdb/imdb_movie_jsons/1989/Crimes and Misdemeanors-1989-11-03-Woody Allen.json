            "content": "\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" (1989)- is Woody Allen's masterpiece and my favorite film. It is urban and sophisticated, subtle and cruel. It is darker than dark and self-ironic. It is profound and touchingly poignant. It is deadly serious and in the same time it is incredibly funny. Its humor is razor sharp and sparkling and the best and funniest Woody's one-liners and comic performances belong here. As always in his best films, Allen had created a clever and elegant film out of his own weaknesses and insecurities and it shines. How much was Allen able to meditate on life, death, God, religion, morality, crimes and the responsibility, love and lust, happiness and the price one pays for it, and among those eternal subjects - how much fun it is to skip work or school and to sneak to the movies. It is universal. It has the references to many Artists and cultures - Chekhov, Dostoyevsky, and Bergman among the others but it is so undeniably and uniquely Allen. It could not have been made by any other director.It is the movie Allen will be remembered for.",

            "content": "Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) offers perhaps the most complex study of the relationship between film and reality in all of Woody Allen's work, not excepting the lighter treatment of the theme in The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985). In Crimes and Misdemeanors, film and reality interact on multiple levels ranging from the commercial to the philosophical. They also interact through a blend of genres that includes the noir crime drama, romantic comedy, social satire, and the documentary. Along the way the film enthusiast is treated to a dazzling variety of interwoven film clips from Hollywood genre films, darkly humorous newsreel footage of a blustering Mussolini, and arresting talking head interviews with fictional philosopher Louis Levy (played by Martin S. Bergmann, the renowned clinical psychologist and author of The Anatomy of Loving). Allen uses these film-within-film conceits to dramatize a central Dostoevskian (and 20th century) theme: the consequences of a god- absent universe. A crucial film/reality intersection occurs in the final sequence, a first meeting between the central characters of the paralleled \"crime\" and \"misdemeanor\" plots: Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau), a highly successful late middle-aged ophthalmologist and Cliff Stern (Woody Allen), an obscure documentary filmmaker whose one claim to fame is an \"Honorable Mention\" at the Cincinnati Film Festival. Aware that Cliff is a director of sorts, Judah pitches him a murder mystery plot based on recent experiences in his \"real life.\" Ironically, Cliff rejects Judah's plot as too implausible, shapeless, and amoral to work as a movie even though it is a large part of the movie that Woody Allen as director has just presented, a twist familiar to viewers of Robert Altman's The Player (as well as to readers of Borges, Nabokov, and a slew of lesser post-modern fiction writers). The meeting between Judah and Cliff takes place at a wedding celebration for the daughter of Ben (Sam Watterston), a rabbi who is Judah's long-time friend and Cliff's brother-in-law. Previously, the only link between the two plots comes from Ben's repeated visits to Judah's office for monitoring of a progressive eye-disease. In an early scene in the doctor's darkened examination room, Ben listens to Judah's confession of marital infidelity, financial indiscretion, and fears of exposure from his unstable mistress, Dolores (Angelica Huston), who refuses to be dumped after a several year relationship. What Judah does not confess is the means he uses to resolve his dilemma: the murder of Dolores by a hit man hired by Judah's underworld-connected businessman brother, Jack. For a time, like Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov, Judah suffers agonies of guilt for initiating the taking of a human life, but eventually he \"awakens as if from a dream\" to find that rather than being punished he continues to prosper, a perverse irony that seems to belie his religious father's conviction that \"the eyes of God are always watching us\" and that \"whether in the Old Testament or Shakespeare \u0096 'murder will out.'\" The Woody Allen character, Cliff, is an unsung and largely uncompensated maker of intellectual documentaries. An obsessive film buff, he prefers to spend most afternoons at the movies with his niece and most evenings in his low-budget cutting room rather than face the reality of his unhappy marriage and nowhere career. Alan Alda plays Cliff's other brother-in-law and nemesis, Lester, a thoroughly obnoxious but prominent writer and producer of TV sitcoms. The antagonism between these two characters is sharpened when Lester, as a favor to his sister, hires Cliff to shoot a TV documentary about Lester himself for a \"Creative Minds\" PBS-style series. The show's Associate Producer, Halley (Mia Farrow), becomes the object of a courtship rivalry between Cliff and Lester. Since Cliff is married and Lester is an obvious philanderer, this romantic triangle forms the \"misdemeanor\" segment of the film's plot - adultery and licentiousness having long been stricken from the contemporary urban world's list of cardinal sins.Cliff's work on the Lester documentary allows Allen to satirize the TV-centered culture that lionizes a figure like Lester but offers scant recognition or reward to the subject of his documentary work-in-progress, Professor Levy (or, by extension, to Cliff himself). Although he has some moments, Lester is an easily deflated buffoon - a self-satisfied font of reductive and repeated bombast (\"if it bends it's funny; if it breaks it's not funny.\") Unfortunately, he can only be deflated in art. In \"real life\" Lester not only has the power to keep filling the airwaves with pap, but to fire Cliff and - most depressingly - to seduce and marry his dream girl, Halley. If Judah finds the absence of moral order comforting, Cliff is totally nonplussed by reality's harsh artlessness, but then, as Judah advises him: \"If you want a happy ending, you should go see a Hollywood movie.\" Despite its plot resolution, Crimes and Misdemeanors is rescued from utter nihilism by its ritual comic ending and by its final shot of the now completely blind Ben dancing happily with his daughter. Despite the literal place of darkness he has entered, the rabbi embodies the affirmative element in Professor Levy's vision, eloquently expressed in these words: \"Events unfold so unpredictably, so unfairly, human happiness does not seem to be included in the design of creation. It is only we, with our capacity to love that give meaning to the indifferent universe. And yet, most human beings seem to have the ability to keep trying and even try to find joy from simple things, like their family, their work, and from the hope that future generations might understand more.\" Alas, the uplifting imagery of the film's ending is counterbalanced, though not thoroughly undercut, by the recollection of Professor Levy's personal response to \"the indifferent universe\": he exits it via self-defenestration, leaving only a suicide note that reads \"I've gone out the window.\"Crimes and Misdemeanors is as close to pure tragicomedy as Woody Allen gets anywhere in his work, and it is one of his most essential and finest films.",

            "content": "This film seizes on something that would fascinate any ordinary person. The idea of knocking off someone by contract. And not just anybody, but a mentally unstable mistress who is demanding that ophthalmologist Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau) leave his wife and come to her or else she will expose the affair to his friends and family anyways, along with certain financial discrepancies that occurred in his business. Judah is well thought of in the community, and in lots of ways an everyman who we can identify with. Judah is depicted as going through the same stages of conscience that any ordinary person in this situation might do. In noirs or stark gangster pictures, it's a common occurrence and no one frets about it : but here is a \"regular\" type guy actually goes through with the crime in all of its stages, no I can't; well, maybe; caves in; guilt --- going through the same things that I or you might go through. After all, for me at least, doing something like that is out of the question. And yet Woody makes us identify with doing just that in a real-world, not a romanticized one. His ability to take an idea like that and make is so alive is just one of his many gifts. And that's only a part of the movie, which mainly deals with the unfairness and lack of justice of the universe.One of Landau's patients is a very moral rabbi who is going blind - there is nothing that will stop it - and worse, he will be blind by the time his daughter gets married, so he won't even get to see that event. So part of Landau's inner torment is why would he get to keep his profession, his reputation, and his family at the expense of somebody else's life when a moral man like his patient and friend the rabbi has such an unjust fate?This was one of if not the the best of Woody's films. How does it end? Let's just say Woody Allen would have been very frustrated by the old production code.",

Few would call \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" Woody Allen's best film as writer/director, but the more I watch it, the more I realize that it's not only my favorite, but in many ways the film Allen was working towards for the entirety of his career as a writer prior to this.In \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" Allen revisits a recurring theme in many of his films, adultery. It would be a simplistic and narrow-minded view of this film to say that it was simply about adultery because it is really far more complex than that, and essentially a film about all varieties of human nature and relationships, and one could even argue- the relationship between reality and film as explored through the lens of genre- romantic comedy, Film-Noir, and documentary, and what parts of this film are- satire.\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is one of Allen's best scripts. Any screenplay attempting to accomplish as much as this one does could easily fall apart, and Allen has had less convincing attempts than this one with similar ambitions, but everything works beautifully here. This film practically defines the 'tragicomedy' sub-genre, with neither overpowering the other and much of the humor is dark humor originating in tragedy, something that is acknowledged by Allen through the character of Lester (played to perfection by Alan Alda), who comments that comedy is nothing more than \"tragedy plus time\". He also mentions that comedy has to have an ending, and that's one of the best things about this movie- Allen allows dramatic scenes to succeed at being dramatic and emotional, then throws a hilarious punchline at you, which has an effect that is both entertaining and somewhat unsettling. This is an expertly-written movie.\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is the culmination of a decade of consistently brilliant, evocative, original, and fascinating films from Woody Allen, whose 80's output I would personally consider to be his best. His 70's work is far more popular, but his 80's work contains some of the most unique and memorable films ever made: \"Stardust Memories\", \"Zelig\", \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\", and \"Hannah and Her Sisters\", as well as numerous overlooked and generally forgotten films that can only be called excellent, such as: \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy\", \"Broadway Danny Rose\", \"Radio Days\", \"September\", and \"Another Woman\". On top of all these memorable films is \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\", which is simply my favorite Woody Allen film and almost certainly his best and most focused effort.10/10",

            "review_title": "Brilliant, probably Woody's best and most focused",
            "content": "\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" (1989) was the masterful culmination of Woody Allen's dramatic period in the 80's, in which he made brilliant movies like \"Hannah and Her Sisters\", \"Another Woman\" or \"September\". In these movies he tried his best to play with Ingmar Bergman's narrative and aesthetic preoccupations, which are incidentally also Allen's. He has also always been successful at incorporating wit and comedy into the dramatic arc. In \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" he confronts two philosophies of life with each other. And once the two story lines are set into motion, almost every scene plays off the theme of the movie. We meet Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau), a successful and beloved doctor. Coming home with his family from a gala, he finds a letter from his mistress Dolores (Angelica Huston); addressed to his wife. Judah meets Dolores in her apartment, where she explains her deep dissatisfaction with the current situation. She wants Judah on her own, whereas he feels that this affair is getting out of hand and wants to end it. Consecutively Dolores begins to threaten him with uncovering a fund theft he was involved in and with admitting their affair to his wife. Judah cannot see out of this predicament and calls up his Mafioso brother (Jerry Orbach) to help him getting rid of her. Cliff Stern (Woody Allen) on the other hand is a struggling documentary filmmaker, married to a woman who stopped having sex with him a year ago and who would rather see him work than not. So Cliff goes against his principles and takes the job kindly given to him by his wife's brother Lester (Alan Alda), a millionaire TV producer. Cliff has to follow Lester around New York to document his visions for a TV program. On the job he meets Halley Reed (Mia Farrow), an associate producer, who gets interested in his work of passion, a documentary about a Jewish philosopher. At the same time Cliff begins to take interest in Halley.Cliff is portrayed by Allen as a humble, wise and cynical man, who never managed to connect his aspirations to the demands of the real world. He has nothing to offer except his love and knowledge. This enables him to be a mentor to his young niece, but does not profit him in his relationship with Halley. The little girl also works as a stand-in for Cliff's conversations with his conscience. This device is made clearer in Rosenthal's segments, where he confides himself to a rabbi.So we have a dual storyline, where one section is morally repugnant and the other one is idealistic. The rabbi tells Rosenthal that their conversations are always about two views of life. One believes in a harsh world, empty of values and with a pitiless moral structure, while the other sees meaning and forgiveness and a higher power. Rosenthal has heard similar things before, since he was raised very religiously. \"The eyes of God are on us always\", advised his father. And when it came to the question of God's existence he would add: \"In case of doubt I will always choose God over truth.\" But Judah cannot let God interfere when he plans to kill his lover. He feels guilt, alright, but people get used to circumstances. We deny and try to forget.When in Cliff's segment the Jewish professor commits suicide, it comes as a shock. Suddenly a philosophical system has been taken away. Isn't that one of the things we fear the most? To realize that our beliefs are incomplete and wrong. This understanding only tightens as the movie progresses. The rabbi is going blind, morality has lost. In the end the film is a sobering account of how immorality, deceit and its more harmless companions prevail.I feel Allen had to let the downbeat ending happen, to express a fear of his. In the 90's he would often return to lighter themes. This expresses his curiosity in all aspects of existence. Light and darkness coexist. Tonally \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is not a dark movie. Allen repeatedly breaks up an emotional scene with a punch-line. But Allen is always consistent in his tone, whatever subjects or periods he chooses. He is a tough worker, who has made 33 movies since 1969, which amounts to roughly one movie a year. \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is the clearest in its vision and among his very best.",

            "content": "When I registered with the IMDb, one of the survey questions asked what my favorite film was. I listed Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors. I don't know if this is always true, but for the most part I feel fairly confident regarding my choice. Allen's story here works, like most well written literature, on many levels. It is funny (Woody's lessons), symbolic (the Rabbi going blind), ironic (the good suffer and the evil go unpunished), deep (faith and suicide), and is a film that leaves you with something to identify with and learn from. Even Hally Reed's (Mia Farrow) surprising revelation at the end of the film, which I won't reveal of course, shows us a bit about the dangers of prejudging others. Woody shows us that we shouldn't judge on the surface, but must look deeper into the individual value of people. Do we trust Hally, or do we stick to what we see as the truth about Lester (Alan Alda)? This is a lesson that Woody's character, Cliff, doesn't even fully grasp at the end of the film, but Allen gives us the insight, even though what Hally reveals about Lester goes against what we've seen of him.Crimes and Misdemeanors is certainly not for all tastes. It's not exactly a film that people would watch for pure escapism. This is a film to be treasured, revisited and held up with some of the greatest films of all time. Not for how it looks or sounds, but for what it says. This is a film aimed at both the heart and the mind and succeeds in capturing both.",

            "content": "Woody Allen is not everybody's cup of tea, with me while his body of work is not always consistent(but that is true with a lot of directors) much of it is wittily written and insightful as seen with his masterpiece Annie Hall. Crimes and Misdemeanours has everything that is so good about the best of his work. With the subject matter and how the comedy and seriousness is blended Crimes and Misdemeanours is one of Allen's most ambitious, and along with the likes of Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters, Husbands and Wives and Manhattan it's one of his best too. The look of the film is elegant and hauntingly dark, while the score is jazzy and seductive. The story has some key themes(good and evil and life and death as examples) that are very clearly addressed and dealt with with adroitness and truth. The concept is not an innovative one as such but it's challenging and hugely compelling. And the writing is to thank for that, the humour is wonderfully ironic and very characteristic of the distinctive wise-cracking Allen style, there are references and observations that are sharp and insightful(always one of Allen's strong points as a writer) and they is blended well with a serious tone that is dark and appropriately troubling, the shifts between comedy and drama didn't jar to me. The acting is very good, often outstanding. Woody Allen acts as well as directs and writes and there are no obvious problems with his performance(or his directing), not a likable character by all means but that was the intent. Anjelica Huston doesn't disappoint, nor does Jerry Orbach before his Law and Order days, Sam Waterson and Claire Bloom. Mia Farrow is affecting as well. But the acting honours go to Alan Alda and especially Martin Landau, Alda plays an absolute weasel to perfection while Landau gives a performance that has not only only been matched by his Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's Ed Wood but also one of the greatest performances of any Woody Allen film. All in all, a Woody Allen classic, an example of ambitious done brilliantly. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) was written and directed by Woody Allen. The film stars Allen as a documentary filmmaker, who makes documentaries that no one would want to see.The structure of the film is unusual. It's really two movies with a fragile link that connects them.In one plot, Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau) is a prominent ophthalmologist and philanthropist. He's married to Miriam (Claire Bloom), but he's had an affair with Dolores, played by Anjelica Huston. Any movie that contains these three great actors will be a pleasure to watch.The second plot concerns Cliff Stern (Woody) who's married to Wendy (Joanna Gleason) but is in love with Halley (Mia Farrow).The link between the two plots is that Wendy's brother Ben (Sam Waterston) has a degenerative eye disease. Ben is being treated for this disease by Judah. Because Ben is a rabbi, Judah confides in him about the love triangle in which he finds himself.Allen is a brilliant writer and director, and his strengths are in getting dialog right and carefully portraying the milieu in which his characters live and work. Granted, \"the Woody Allen part\" is predictable and hard to watch. (He's still writing that part, although he's too old now to play it. Just watch \"Midnight in Paris\" and you'll see the same character in a script written over 20 years after \"Crimes and Misdemeanors.\")This is a film I enjoyed and recommend. In my opinion, almost everything Woody Allen directs is worth seeing. \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is one of Allen's best, and is definitely worth seeking out.

I think \"Crimes And Misdemeaors\" (and also \"Hannah And Her Sisters\", to speak only of his 1980s movies) is what he was always really getting at; this movie is basically a drama, and yet it contains some lines funnier and cleverer than anything in, say, \"To Rome With Love\". It is about moral dilemmas, yet it is amoral; it is deep, yet accessible; it is relaxed and easygoing, yet self-assured and carefully planned out. The entire cast is good, but Martin Landau in particular gives a superlative performance. And Allen's choice of music is, as usual, spot-on. *** out of 4.",

            "content": "Woody Allen is Woody Allen. He always has some very thought provoking subjects to write and ultimately film about. Crimes and Misdemeanors in a lot of ways, in my opinion, is his most thought provoking film to date. What really brings the movie together is the ending where Martin Landau's character is talking to Woody Allen's character. I won't get into the whole movie here, but what Landau's character talks about to Allen's character is the fact that if you kill someone or had someone killed, you feel bad at first about it, but you ultimately move on with your life, and as time goes by, the killing becomes further away in your thoughts, like the phrase, 'This too shall pass.' Allen's character talks about how if a person kills someone and/or had someone killed that they would ultimately confess to the police from feeling to guilty about it. Landau's character says, to the likes of, 'at first you feel guilty, but that's movie stuff confessing, no you get through it and move on with your life.'(again he didn't say this verbatim, but to the likes of he did). Very interesting thoughts come at the movie viewer like fireworks bursting into the sky at this point such as- Is it truly only about survival and do we move on and adapt no matter what? Do we get through the lulls of life and learn to adapt, live and survive in this world the that way we like to no matter what? Do we learn to live with life, as it was, whether it be Crimes(something horrible as in we killed someone) and/or Misdemeanors(Cheating on your girlfriend or wife or both-for the polyamorous)? Another thought provoking subject that comes up is of what's 'real'(that has concretely happened, been seen in the world) and what 'isn't real or what hasn't and/or can't be seen'(God; Faith; all of this according to what the movie is stating). Allen really makes you think in this film, and he's one of the best for this kind of writing. The answer is really simple since there isn't a solid black or white answer, which there never is anyway(And I believe ultimately, that's Woody Allen's point), it's pretty much to the individual. The funny thing is both Landau's character and Allen's character are both right. There are some people in this world that would think like Landau and go on living their lives after killing someone and then there are some people in this world that make Allen's argument right, where they would breakdown and confess about their crime of killing someone, and that's real life, not a movie, it goes both ways, depending on the person. It comes down to 'What is Truth?' as Pontius Pilate said(Pronounced Pawnchuss Pilot). Truth is to the eye of the beholder, it's different for everyone. Some people's truth would be on the side of Landau's character and some on the side of Allen's character. Some people are realists and see the truth as only what they can see and only what has happened, and some people's truth is what you can see but also what you can't see too, God and Faith in particular. What can't be seen is sometimes as real as what can be seen. There are things that happen in life through events of faith and worship and other ordeals that come to a fruition in the here and the now, and the realists wouldn't have believed it when it wasn't seen, but when it became seen, then they believed it. A very crafty movie by an absolute brilliant man in Woody Allen. It's a must see for the deep thinkers.",

Martin Landau is incredible in this portrayal of a man who is beset by his past indiscretions. He is blackmailed by his mistress who is getting tired of waiting for Landau to leave his wife. He has her murdered and then goes through all the real anguish one would have. He falls back into his religious beliefs and has to carry them around for a time. There is a second plot having to do with a documentary being made. Allan Alda does a superb job as an unlikable dilettante who is just in it for the money. The twists and turns that ensue and the incredible tension, especially as they relate to Landau, keep us on the edge of our seats. This is a \"real\" movie where Allen has thoroughly invaded his characters' psyches and taken them on a ride. This could be so badly done under other heavy handed directions. There is none of this.

Is guilt the same as remorse? How does a \"good\" person come to terms with his sins? The blind Rabbi: Is God unseeing? The Holocaust survivor philosopher who challenges survival (that's all I can say without spoiling): is there any real redemption?The movie has flaws but I give it a \"10\" for daring to ask serious questions.

I think it's just so revelatory about the man himself. The theme carries through in this picture quite obviously, and in it's own way, applies to both of the principal characters, Stern and opthamologist Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau). A moral quandary is addressed by Judah after he submissively accepts his brother Jack's (Jerry Orbach) solution to an infidelity threatening to ruin his life. Questions of life and death, guilt and innocence, and the ongoing conflict of human relationships all play a part in the story, and Allen has shown himself to be a past master of dealing with all of it. The one bit of certainty that emanates form the picture is the fact that it could not have been made or released during film's Production Code era from the Thirties through the Sixties, as Landau's character gets away with murder and rationalizes that he'll feel less guilty over time about it. As for the supporting cast, Alan Alda's Lester is insufferable while I don't think I've ever seen Mia Farrow look better. \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" bears watching, and after having done so, watch it again.

            "content": "This movie is two separate stories made into one via just three devices: 1) a relatively minor, albeit symbolic character (a blind Rabbi), 2) a brief meeting of the two main protagonists, and 3) a philosopher's narration at the closing (or it would seem so, anyway). The first section - the \"crime\", and the good part - tells the story of an eye doctor (very nicely played by Martin Landau) who has it all: a wonderful wife and family, a successful career, a beautiful home, and a neurotic mistress (Anjelica Huston), the last of which threatens to spill the beans and destroy everything in his life. Landau is a respectable, decent guy who finds himself unable to cope with the enormity of these circumstances, and he goes to an extreme by enlisting the help of his mob-connected brother (Jerry Orbach), who has the mistress killed. There follows some interesting scenes in which we see Landau going to an emotional edge over what he has done, and searching his past and present for some answers. It is a well-done, believable story that raises a lot of interesting philosophical questions. The second section - a much lighter story than the first - stars Allen in his typical genre in which he plays a filmmaker doing a portrait of his brother-in-law TV producer (Alan Alda), and whom he greatly despises. This story is further complicated by a love triangle with a television documentary maker, played by Mia Farrow. There are a few amusing lines in this section, and it wraps up into a somewhat ironic ending. But what is the connection here? The first time I saw this film, I kept asking myself: \"What do the Landau and Allen stories have to do with each other?\". I found myself asking the same exact question the second, third, and fourth times I saw it as well.Then I saw an interview with Allen. He said that the Landau segment is a statement of his belief that there is no God or divinely-inspired morality - not much of a surprise there. The second part of the film, says Allen, was trying to tell us that intentions do not matter, but rather it is success that counts in this world; that even though his character truly cared for the Farrow character, it was the vain, shallow, unworthy, but nevertheless rich and successful Alda character that eventually won her heart. OK, I guess that point comes through as well. But once again, we are back to the same question: What do these two stories have to do with each other? Not much, from what I can see. What is the \"crime\" or even the \"misdemeanor\" committed in the Allen segment? If you can connect these two stories, you might also have some success in connecting \"Sleeper\" with \"Gone With The Wind\" - the stories really don't mesh. To put it bluntly, it almost appears as if Allen had two separate scripts, neither of which were meaty enough for a full-length film, so his solution was to combine them into one movie. Am I correct? Someone please explain to me why I am not.",

Certainly, the focus of the film is at the end where the primary character proposes making this film to Woody, who has played a filmmaker. This directly self-referential device is bold, and could have been part of a fine web, as several other filmmakers have created.But the problem is that we're given pretty thin broth up until that point. Woody tries to be as honestly raw as Chekhov and as deeply symbolic as Kafka. Instead we get a sophomoric effort.God's eyes are mentioned a dozen times. And the protagonist is an eye doctor who is treating a rabbi who goes blind. `Get it?' Woody shouts. To set up the self-referential last scene, we are treated to Woody playing an unappreciated filmmaker making a film inspired by a Jewish philosopher who seems happy but is not. `Get it?' Woody nudge nudges. To underscore that in the theater, we are the eyes of God, Woody bluntly demonstrates by inserting his own viewing of films and philosophizing about film.\nThis is not intelligent filmmaking, my friends. It is the clumsiness of someone smart enough to see what art is, but not clever enough to create it. Maybe he thinks 90% of creating art is showing up.Along the way, we get an interesting performance from Alda. But it is all too obvious that every character's dialog is Woody's and they are acting just as Woody has demonstrated to them. Check out their mannerisms. Maybe his comedies will be better.

            "content": "Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors ranks with the very best of his work in the 1980s, as it provides serious subject matter for its audience without being (overall) preachy, and acts as a terrific precursor to other Woody films (ie Deconstructing Harry, Melinda & Melinda, and Match Point to an extent). The side that is more dramatic sometimes merges very well with the side that's meant to be more of the real \"Woody\" movie with touches of real wit and truly laugh-out-loud moments. This is done by giving a kind of balance between the dilemmas of both of the characters. Both the doctor and the filmmaker deal with the issues of faith and infidelity and love, both on levels that will end up affecting them (or not) by the end of the picture. That it ends up being a little too 'pointed', if that's the word, by the end of the film, with quick images from before going by over the philosopher's main message, doesn't put down the strengths. It's one of Allen's more successful 'serious' films by tracking the existential quandaries of both of the leads, and what ends up being or not being important for them becomes what draws in the audience (or not).One of the strengths is the acting, of which Allen has assembled one of his very best ensembles. Landau is in a role where he has trouble facing realities as they are, and when he does it begins to bring him to doubt everything that he was raised to believe and think was right or wrong. His character is as if it was out of one of those Russian works of the late 19th, early 20th century- bourgeois to the point of no complaints, but with an emotional side that is crumbling. At this Landau makes Dr. Rosenthal one of his most memorable performances- even as there could have been even MORE scenes with him &/or his wife- as his often stone-cold, detached look tells more than anything. Anjelica Huston, while working sort of on a limited basis as the 'sensible' mistress, is also very good. But best is seeing Alan Alda as a harmless but undeniably hokey and laughable (to laugh at not with) comedian, who is never better at playing these kinds of roles. Other actors like Jerry Orbach, and Caroline Aaron (in one of the funniest scenes describing a date), are also great supporting players.If maybe the film isn't a flat out masterpiece, it might be because it leaves things a little too 'this is how it is' at the end, despite the good points made in the narration. It takes the reality on both sides, the neurotic but smart documentary filmmaker played by Allen and the pragmatic and flawed Doctor Landau plays, and fleshes them out so as to not be too convoluted or entirely unsympathetic. Many scenes, particularly those showing the religious nature of the film, also work better than expected. Basically, any little quibbles I had with Crimes and Misdemeanors can be overlooked for all of the interesting bits, which out-rank those of practically any given drama or comedy released in that time. 9.5/10",

            "review_title": "A look at the worst kind of blindness: of the one who refuses to look",
            "content": "On our daily full routines sometimes we overlook something here and there, regardless of consequences, just going ahead with our passions and desires, interests and achievements. But life knows how to makes us pay the price for not looking at those things more carefully. And not looking at all of this is a crime, a misdemeanor, and to that there's punishment as well. Maybe not to everyone involved but to a vast majority. At times leading its story with a dramatic seriousness and other times with a sharp humor, Woody Allen divides this film in two segments (serious/funny), often intertwining both stories with one common theme: the worst blindness of all, of the one who doesn't want to see.The stories: ophthalmologist Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau) is living the life of his dreams with a perfect family, a great job and being a respectable man but there's one thing bothering this man: his mistress, the flight attendant Dolores (Anjelica Huston) got tired of being on the second plan of his life and she wants to live with Judah, without caring about his family and reputation as an honored citizen. The final ultimatum she gives to him (tell you're wife about me or I'll tell her about us and your lies), makes him take a unexpected and drastic measure that might haunt him for life: he hires someone to kill Dolores. On a less serious take there's the story of Clifford (Woody Allen), an filmmaker in a low point of his career trying to make the project of his life when he's approached by his brother-in-law Lester (Alan Alda), a guy he despises with all of his force, to make an documentary about him. While making this project in which he's not so thrilled about it he'll meet the special Halley (Mia Farrow), for whom he falls in love but she seems looking at other direction, and to another person, Lester. The constant fight Clifford will have is with himself trying to figure out a way to understand why such thing is happening with him and trying to caught Halley's attention. Allen analyzes all kinds of blinds and different types of blindness here. The ophthalmologist, and that's not an accident, he's the one who prevents eye problems and he's the most significant of the blinded characters of the film. He's blind for never realizing he has everything he needed: a family, money, respect from his colleagues and friends. No, he's jeopardizing everything in trade of some adventurous love affair he doesn't know how to end it; his mistress can't see he's never gonna leave his family and risk his reputation for her, therefore, she's blinded as well; the filmmaker had its vision of reality obscured by failing to notice that life isn't like movies where showing your deeply affects to someone might be returned, no matter how much he tries to conquer the woman of his dreams, she'll always turn her back on him, preferring his egocentric rival on business; Halley is blind for not seeing how much Clifford loves her, instead concentrating her thoughts on Lester; the latter is blind to his own egocentrism, refusing to be seen as someone cynical, unfunny and not so bright, he's too focused on himself although he pays a certain attention to Halley; and at last we have a real blind person but this one seems to see more than any of this character altogether. The Rabbi Ben (Sam Waterston) gives profound advises to Judah, his friend and doctor, of what to do with the whole affair problem. Little by little, we get saddened by his loss of eyesight throughout the story but he always has the right word to say. Conclusion: with the exception of Ben, all of them can see (physically) but they refuse to do so (spiritually/morally) and at the end they're caught in their own silly entrapment.\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is an exceptional story about life consequences, love, human relations at its good and bad times, guilt, the things which determines failure and success on everything, and the often mentioned blindness of all kinds, particularly the worst kind of it. This is Woody's great response to the happy endings he gave to his characters in the magnificent \"Hannah and Her Sisters\". Here, the stories taste bittersweet with an incredible and implacable reality. Also exceptional are the performances by the extraordinary casting, most notably Landau and Huston playing the complicated couple of the ongoing tragedy. It is on scenes where Landau doesn't speak at all where we see how great he is, displaying a enormous guilty conscience, the sense of fear present all the time when he's driving his car, Schubert playing in the background, his glad flashbacks of how he met Dolores but he's always worried about what to do next.Few times in our lives we were able to see the truth behind the lies greatly presented like in this movie. Allen in its geniality took the blindfold of our eyes and it's not every time something like this happen. Please, don't be like the worst of all blind, who can see but refuses to do so and go watch this film right away. 10/10",

In it, a prominent doctor arranges to have his mistress murdered to prevent her from exposing his affair and financial irregularities; meanwhile an unsuccessful film director makes a documentary about his TV producer brother-in-law, a man he despises.The film is divided into two strands, the funny one and the serious one. They have very different tones but explore similar themes. Both are tragic but for opposite reasons \u2013 the doctor's crime goes unpunished and he prospers, while the director loses on all fronts. The message of the movie is pessimistic but very true, and that is that there is no moral law in reality and bad deeds often benefit the perpetrators, while life doesn't have inbuilt happy endings. Similar to Hannah and Her Sisters, the funny and serious plot strands only briefly overlap here. They both dovetail together at the end in a brilliant scene where the two protagonists meet in a back room at a party.Like all Allen films from the period, this one is very well written and acted. Martin Landau is the most prominent presence in the role of the doctor. His is a complex character full of very contrasting characteristics. Alan Alda plays the TV producer and provides many of the funniest moments.

Complimenting the isolated tracking shots,Allen gives the outside scenes a stylish chilly appearance,which shows the cold routes that Judah and Stern find themselves travelling upon.Despite recent events making it appear that the only time she will work with him again will be when hell freezes over,Mia Farrow gives a charmingly kooky performance as Halley Reed,with Farrow showing Reed to have a natural off-beat warmth that Stern finds irresistible.Keeping away from any sense of warm,Anjelica Huston gives a delightfully chaotic performance as Dolores Paley thanks to Huston showing Paley to be unwilling to run away from the fire that is burning her relationship with Judah to the ground.Spending most of the title fighting to get his dream project made,Woody Allen gives an excellent performance as Cliff Stern,with Allen showing Stern to have an uncompromising one track mind,which leads to Stern completely ignoring the commercial opportunities that could help his Avant-Garde project at last get off the ground.Giving the title a bleak Film Noir heart,Martin Landau delivers a tremendous performance as Judah Rosenthal,with Landau showing horror on Judah's face,as he realize to his horror that the only way he can get off his darken path is to commit some deadly crimes and misdemeanors.",

In this film, its main concern is the struggle within, the general moral conscience Vs. the guilt or the sin, and out of left field, it is the latter eventually prevails, with the trappings of a comfortable life, the murder becomes a petty snippet in his memory and time can put everything back into an equilibrium, it is beyond any religion's absolution. Landau delivers one of his best performances in his lengthy career, an outright leading role (again, shamefully the category fraud push him into supporting group in the Oscar race), a hypocrite sleekly justifies his selfish and heinous behaviors with superfluous paddings, a despicable person so full of life with mocking caricature and a tint of self-reflection, everyone has his or her own unsurmountable hurdle in reality, luckily the preponderance is able to rein the yardstick. Anjelica Huston breaks her lofty stereotype, to overplay an unreasonable mistress who is too desperate to shore up her wanting sense of security, as vexing and halfwitted as she is, her denouement is too much a punishment. As for Allen's romantic entwinement with Farrow and his doomed marriage, it brims with casual wisecracks and addicted cinema-goings, but the scene-stealer is Alda, whose character is blatantly based on the late writer Larry Gelbart, utters bon mots like, comedy is tragedy plus time; or if it bends, it's funny, if it breaks, it isn't. He is snobbish and lewd to everyone's eyes, yet he walks off with Allen's soul mate. Woody Allen is rehashing the same old self, and Mia Farrow refrains herself as an out-of-his-league dame, who speaks highly about her unrealized ambition in order to reject a man trapped in a dead wedlock, yet subservient to the mogul's courtship, it all boils down to the point of a woman's self-deceptive blindness towards material needs, with a collateral damage to her unsuccessful suitor. So in both stories, the female characters are less glamorous and adorable here, not to mention Allen's sister's icky sex encounter in the bedroom. The film is mostly brisk under the accompany of a jazzy score, and its debate on moral structure is a cogent one and could be a reference to all the contemporary marital or relationship mishaps, even the religious mumble-jumble has an epiphany on those non-believers.",

            "content": "Imagine if everything you were ever taught about moral, ethics and karma turns out not to be true? \u00ab\u00a0You get what you give\u00a0\u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0Good things come to good people\u00a0\u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0Instant karma is gonna get you!\u00a0\u00bb. We hear and often repeat these phrases, try to live well with ourselves and with others, be good citizens, do good. Many of us believe that this is not only the good way to go about life, but also expect to be rewarded because of our good behavior, to get what we want, to grow in life, have a great job, meet a nice partner, live well, prosper.This is, however, a Woody Allen story, and it may as well be his masterpiece. The story can be roughly divided in two, and centers on the lives of two very different men. One is Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau), a married and successful ophthalmologist who suddenly starts facing problems with his lover (in a good performance by Anjelica Huston). The other man is the idealist and broke moviemaker Cliff Stern (played by Allen himself), facing family problems, a broken marriage and a work crisis. The stark difference between these two men turn the movie into a would-be duel between idealism and superficiality.Themes like our roles in society, religion, morals, existentialism, the final judgment and philosophy are thoroughly discussed in the movie, both directly in conversation but also reflectively through the actions of the different characters, without ever compromising the development of the story, nor the viewer's interest in it. Balanced in the comic paranoia of Allen's writing and acting, the story finds a meeting point between drama, irreverence and meaningful topics. Pertinent reflections and dialogues drive characters to often funny, often heavy situations, and many times both.\u00ab\u00a0Crimes and Misdemeanors\u00a0\u00bb represented a return of Woody Allen to comedy, after flirting with more psychologically driven stories, clearly influenced by Ingmar Bergman, as shown in previous works like \u00ab\u00a0Another Woman\u00a0\u00bb and \u00ab\u00a0September\u00a0\u00bb. Still, comedy here exists and at the same time does not, as the deeper reflections proposed by the movie can push the viewer into a different direction.Rosenthal's tale shows a man initially consumed by anguish over the decisions he needs to take. Whatever path he chooses will certainly leave a long-lasting and deep scar in his life. Humor is absent here, and Sven Nyqvist's cinematography (the same that often worked with Bergman) is dark and somber, reflecting the state of mind of the central character. Cliff's journey, however, is lighter and more comical, a typical portrait of Allen's characters played by himself. The different stories balance each other out perfectly: they offer the light after the darkness, the calm after the storm.Finally, and only towards the end of the movie, the two men meet and talk about the crimes and sins of real life, and what can their real consequences be. The encounter of these two seemingly so different characters, but who then suddenly realize that perhaps what they were always taught about life and morals could be wrong, could be considered an anagnorisis of Aristotle, a final realization, a critical discovery of things as they show themselves to be, not as we had constructed them in our imaginary. Are we indeed the sum of our choices?",

            "content": "Among the things I learned from the Coen brothers' 2009 masterpiece \"A Serious Man\" is that you can be a serious husband, teacher, father, a man of total moral probity, yet never be \"serious\" from the Jewish community's perspective, if you lack weight or aura as a worker, adviser or donor. Larry Gopnik was a born-schmuck but Judah Rosenthal, the central figure of Woody Allen's \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\", played by a wonderful Martin Landau, is the quintessential 'Serious' man.He's an eye doctor in his late fifties or early sixties, married to a loving wife (Claire Bloom) with grown children, living in three acres in Connecticut, and he's an established figure of the Jewish community. When we meet him, he's getting a special award for all his 'contributions'. Judah is at the pinnacle of his career and can settle down for its twilight with serene happiness\u0085 if it wasn't for a pebble in his shoe, one named Dolores (Anjelica Huston), a flight attendant with whom he lived a last roar of passion. When wisdom commanded to end the relationship, it was too late, she was already pulling an Alex Forrest on him. Judah obviously underestimated Dolores' liability to turn into a pain-in-the-ass.Indeed, Judah intercepts a letter sent to his wife where Dolores reveals their affair and she ends up threatening to reveal some unsound financial decision, hence compromising not only his marital but social status as well, everything he built for years. That, he wouldn't allow. And while we slowly slide into the darkest side of his soul, there's a parallel story involving Woody Allen as Cliff Stern, a jobless documentary director, sickly jealous of Lester. Indeed, Cliff is baffled that a millionaire TV sitcom producer with the looks of Alan Alda is doing well, while the answers to his puzzlement are in the puzzlement itself. But Lister is the brother of his wife Wendy (Joanna Gleason) and she begged him to let Cliff direct a documentary about his life. Cliff reluctantly accepts.Tired of serving as a foil for his brother-in-law's ego, Cliff shares his feelings with the Assistant Producer Halley (Mia Farrow) and something just clicks. The relationship between Cliff and Halley is quite interesting, for the first time in his life, he finds a receptive ear to his humor, constant kvetching and even his odd cinematic tastes. When he shows her footage of Louis Levy, a philosopher who's more worthy of a documentary , she's fascinated and Cliff is fascinated by her fascination. Yet their relationship never moves forward, maybe because Cliff is incapable to make any further move or maybe because she's more interested in Lester, a man who can help her in her career, who has money and looks. Again, Cliff is incapable to face the facts that life functions on the most basic Darwinian level, and guys like Cliff aren't the fittest. But one who's born to survive this world is certainly Judah Rosenthal.As the movie swings back and forth between the two stories, we also have glimpses on Judah's background; he was raised by a devoted Jewish father, who taught him among other things, that God had eyes on him. This is the kind of stuff we also had to hear as kids, so we could repress some mean-spirited impulses. The eye is an interesting leitmotif in the film, Judah has the competence to detect the limits of people's vision, including his, and one of his friends played by Sam Waterston is a Rabbi who's progressively losing his sight, it doesn't take a Louis Levy to guess the symbolism when the man who lives in the \"mountains of God\" loses his vision. And a pivotal flashback during a Shabbat ceremony when the father's prayer is interrupted by her sister, she dares to call it mambo-jambo.A discussion ensues and some relatives start to share their doubts over their faith, using the ultimate example of the 6 million Jews who died in WWII, aggravated by the fact that Hitler 'got away' with it. This is a point that has seldom been raised in movies and I applaud Allen for allowing the skeptical voice to be raised, naturally, the sister is deemed as cynical, but we all know she's not. She's just realistic and it seems that Judah's brother Jack (Jerry Orbach) inherited that view on life because he lives in the real world, not in some Connecticut ivory tower, and he's the one who promises to take care of his brothers' 'problem'. At first, Judah is shocked, but then something happens, that can be summarized by that extraordinary quote from \"Chinatown\": \"Most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place, they're capable of ANYTHING.\" While Martin Landau in \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" oozes integrity and respectability, he was driven into a corner where the only 'solution' was to kill a person. And he managed to overcome the guilt, to tame it until being relieved from it, as if the very shock, sadness and recognition of the amorality of his act were enough to redeem him. And he got away with it, indirectly forcing us to question our own conscience. To which extent is it more valuable than our comfort, or our comfort more than someone's life? Ethically, Judah is the worst but from his standpoint, he remains a serious, respectable man, if God's judgment doesn't count, why should ours do? So, it's a 'happy' ending for Judah and a sad one for Cliff and in the epilogue, their stories connect in the way they contradict the conclusion of \"Manhattan\" that \"brain is the most overrated organ\". In \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\", there's no heart, even the crime isn't a crime of passion, but of reason and calculation, and maybe Halley truly loved Cliff but she still made the reasonable choice. Reason or Heart, Allen seemed to have picked his side in this masterpiece of dark comedy.",

            "content": "Judah Rosenthal is a very successful ophthalmologist who has a wife and two grown children but has been having an affair for many years with Delores Paley. However she is threatening to expose their relationship as well as other financial dealings he was involved in. With no options left Judah confronts the ethical and moral issues and reaches out to his criminal brother to help him out with a permanent solution. Meanwhile documentary filmmaker Cliff Stern agrees to take the money and direct a fly-on-the-wall documentary about the brother in law he hates \u0096 Emmy award winning TV producer Lester. He takes the money even though he hates the work and gets to know the producer of the film, Halley Reed and falls for her despite him being married.For all its many flaws, this is still a good film with a constantly interesting idea behind it and reasonable ambitions. The narrative is split into two threads that only temporarily come together at the very end of the film and this is part of the problem with the film \u0096 it doesn't hang together as a story or a film terribly well. The plot is more of a look at morals and ethics in terms of where we get them, what they mean and the destruction of the idea that 'good will out'. For that reason the two plots are not so much stories as nails for Woody to hang his points upon and this may annoy many looking for a better structure. However, once I got what he was doing I understood why it was this way and I focused on the ideas behind it. In that regard the film is still flawed but it is consistently interesting in it's arguments and debate \u0096 the film is structured well enough so that we aren't sure what it's conclusions will be. Those who criticise the film for it's conclusions are either very lucky or horribly na\u00efve \u0096 the ending may be pessimist but it is one that many of us see supported in our lives and the lives of those around us.The mix of material in the film is as flawed as the plots themselves. Judah's thread is necessarily dark and Cliff's is more comic; while both qualities work in their respective stories it is the uneasy and uneven mix between the two that doesn't quite work. However, as I've said, I still found this to be interesting enough in its content and ambitious enough in its aims to be more than worth watching. Of course many people will not give Woody Allen films a chance and will just assume he was trying to be funny but failed, or trying for a crime story but failed but then those people will just stick to multiplex action movies and rarely wander into the work of other American filmmakers (god forbid any non-US work). This is not to say that those that dislike this film are wrong, no, in fact I salute them for trying something that may not be their cup of tea; I just think it a shame that a film such as this will be dismissed by so many without them even watching it.Anyway, ramble over. The cast are all pretty good. Allen plays his usual character but his real work here is as director and writer. He gives himself a handful of good lines and he does well to deliver his lighter side of the film even if he fails to mix the two threads. Landau is excellent as he carries the core of the debate throughout. It may be a Woody Allen film but the heart of it is with Landau and he delivers it really well with tangible moral complexities. Outside of these two the support cast are mainly good by having good actors in the cast as opposed to the 'star of the month' complex that he has had recently. Alda, Huston, Waterson, Farrow, Orbach and Victor Argo are all good additions even if they didn't all have a great deal to do.Overall this is a good film even if it is one that is filled with flaws. The plots don't totally satisfy and hang together however it is hard to ignore that it is consistently interesting and serves as an interesting look at morals and ethics. Sure it isn't Allen's funniest film, nor his most serious, nor his most intelligent, nor his best structured but it is interesting, thought-provoking and well worth a watch.",

            "content": "\"I have been young, and now am not too old; And I have seen the righteous forsaken, His health, his honour and his quality taken. This is not what we were formerly told\". This is how the English poet Edmund Blunden addressed the philosophical question of why bad things happen to good people (and vice versa). \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" represents Woody Allen's attempt to tackle the same issue. Like this year's \"Melinda and Melinda\" it combines humorous and serious stories, but is a far better work. \"Melinda and Melinda\" suffers because its related plot lines are artificially forced into the trite and over-schematic framework of a debate over dinner between two playwrights as to whether life is comic or tragic. Moreover, the supposedly \"tragic\" story seemed insufficiently serious to merit that description. \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" has two plot lines; one, which may be thought of as \"Crimes\" tragic, the other, which may be thought of as \"Misdemeanors\", tragi-comic. The first concerns Judah Rosenthal, a successful New York ophthalmologist. Judah (brilliantly played by Martin Landau) is well-respected and regarded as a pillar of the community, but his private life is a mess. Unknown to his wife and family, Judah has been having an affair with Dolores, an air hostess. Dolores wants him to leave his wife for her; when he refuses to do so, Dolores threatens not only to inform his wife but also to reveal certain financial irregularities in his practice which could ruin his reputation. In order to silence Dolores, Judah turns to his brother Jack, a gangster with underworld connections, who offers to have her murdered. The other plot line concerns Clifford Stern, an idealistic but unsuccessful director of documentary films. Clifford is offered the job of directing the filmed biography of his own brother-in-law Lester, a successful producer. Under pressure from his wife, Clifford accepts, but only reluctantly as he despises the shallow, conceited and Philistine Lester. Clifford's own marriage is in trouble and during the making of the film he meets, and begins an affair with, Halley, Lester's assistant. Halley shares Clifford's idealism and they plan to make a documentary about Louis Levy, a philosopher whose work Clifford admires. This is one of Woody's darkest films, both physically and morally. Most of the action takes place in darkened interiors, and the predominant tones- browns, greys and dull yellows and oranges- are sombre. Morally, the film seems (at least at first sight) to reflect a world in which evil triumphs over good. Judah, after agreeing to Jack's suggestion that they should have Dolores murdered, is initially plagued by feelings of guilt, but as time passes and he realises that the police do not suspect him of involvement in the crime, these feelings fade away and he resumes his old life. Louis Levy commits suicide, which causes Clifford to doubt the optimistic, life-affirming philosophy he had taught. On a less serious level, Clifford is sacked from his job by the odious Lester, who even manages to seduce Halley away from him. The mood is lightened by occasional touches of characteristic Allen humour, mostly from Woody himself as Clifford, but much of this is of a dark, cynical nature, more so even than in most of his movies. (\"I don't know from suicide, y'know. Where I grew up in Brooklyn we were too unhappy to commit suicide\".) Yet the film is not, in my view, dominated by pessimism to the utter exclusion of all else. It is that rare thing, a Woody Allen film that takes a positive view of religion. Elsewhere, his attitude has generally been one of religious scepticism, such as in \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" where Woody's character, suffering from a crisis of existential angst, adopts several religions only to reject them all in favour of a \"live for today\" philosophy. Here, however, religious and secular views of life are contrasted, and not always to the detriment of the former. Woody has often used his Jewishness for comic effect; here he raises some more serious points about Jewish identity, as the religion-versus-secularism debate takes place in the context of Judaism rather than Christianity. Judah was brought up as an Orthodox Jew, but has rejected his religious faith in favour of a bleak, nihilistic world-view, unable to accept his father's idea that the eyes of God see everything. (Images of the eye and of sight are important in this film). Some of the most important scenes in the film are the conversations between Judah and one of his patients, a Rabbi named Ben. Although Ben (another very good performance from Sam Waterstone) is slowly losing his sight, his religious faith enables him to bear the prospect of blindness with stoicism and he never loses his belief in a higher power or in an essential moral order in the universe. He may lose his sight in a physical sense, but in a moral sense he can see more clearly than any other character in the film. This is not a religious film in the sense that, say, \"The Passion of the Christ\" is a religious film. Woody is always too much of a pessimist ever to echo Blunden's conclusion that \"Over there are faith, love, virtue in the sun\". Nevertheless, it is a film which (like two other great Woody films of the late eighties, \"Hannah\" and \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\") discusses themes of philosophical and theological import and one that acknowledges the power of faith in peoples' lives. What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul? It is those who have succeeded in worldly terms, Judah and Lester, who have, metaphorically if not literally, lost their souls, whereas Ben and Clifford, less blessed by worldly success, have retained their integrity. 9/10",

The result is an interesting film. Like all Allen products, a film of ideas.Allen likes to tackles cosmic questions, philosophical conundrums, the absurdities of conventional wisdom. Here he intertwines these meditations with the mundane--one of his greatest talents.Faced with disheartening circumstances or life-shattering decisions, Allen's characters behave like humans. Allen plays Clifford Stern, a documentary film maker in an unhappy marriage. But he does not seem extremely unhappy. He finds humor in the universe and happiness in the things he loves.Through all the real-world machinations of its plot, this film keeps returning to the universal view, looking for absolute answers to the eternal questions. In this film, Allen tells us that humor helps us survive the stark realities of existence. And that love gives (us) meaning to an indifferent universe. On the other hand, his search for a universal definition of justice goes unresolved--a tricky concept that few agree on.",

Martin Landau is having an affair but his paramour threatens to lower the boom on him by telling Landau's wife. Landau arranges to have his love murdered but is stunned by what he has gone, haunted by moral lessons learned from a rabbi when he was a child, and ends the movie thoroughly chastened but not in jail. He gives a subtle performance too.That's what is know as \"the A story.\" The \"B story\" has Woody Allen as a documentary film maker in love with Mia Farrow, who is in love with Allan Alda, an egotistical, famous, rich nincompoop. The egotistical, famous, rich nincompoop gets the girl, while Allan's marriage dissolves, leaving him forlorn.Well, okay. It's not King Lear. But it's enjoyable and at times slyly thought provoking. (Is it really necessary to believe in God and an afterlife of punishment in order to feel guilt?) A rabbi, done to a turn by Sam Waterston, represents God and has gone blind. The symbolism is clear but the meaning is nebulous. The scenes of Jewish rituals are semi-real and heartwarming, like low-key versions of John Ford's weddings and dances.Allen's job is making a documentary film about Allan Alda, whom he loathes. Alda is foolish and, furthermore, he's got first dibs on the girl Allen loves. So the documentary, which is supposed to make a public icon out of Alda, turns out to be a disaster -- scenes of Alda shouting and bragging, intercut with shots of Mussolini on his balcony haranguing his fascist supporters, Alda copping a feel in a dark hallway. During the viewing of the film, we see Woody Allen seated in the theater and chuckling at his own cruel wit. Alda sits there aghast, his mouth open, and then fires Allen on the spot.Of course, the film is necessarily cluttered with Woody Allen's conversational tropes. \"How AHHH you?\" And, \"I just feel, I don't know, unsettled. Y'know?\" And Allen's compulsive wisecracks are up to par: \"The last time I was inside a woman was when I visited the Statue of Liberty.\" Lots of dinner parties with guests, a wedding, a sentimental dance. The conversations are incredibly middle-class and banal -- the virtues of acupuncture and the center piece at Rockefeller Center. But the pace is deliberate, and the staging precise, as befits a tragedy.I preferred the B story to the A story. They weren't seamlessly blended. Yet it's watchable and diverting, and odd to see Woody Allen so seriously probing a concept like guilt.",

            "review_title": "Crime and No Punishment: Allen on Dostoevsky, Part I",
            "content": "\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is the first of three Woody Allen films (thus far, at least) that have been considered critiques, or repudiations, really, of novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky's philosophy. (The others are \"Match Point\" (2005) and \"Irrational Man\" (2015).) This one may be the most devoted to the Russian's book, including a title that's a play on his \"Crime and Punishment,\" although the film also takes some inspiration from his final novel, \"The Brothers Karamazov.\" The \"Crime and Punishment\" connection is specifically what brought me to review this picture, as I've been seeking out a bunch of cinematic adaptations since reading it. While not an adaptation, per se, \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is its antithesis.There's the simple story of murder and guilt, of course, but Allen clearly has a deeper understanding of the prose, which, among other things, is about duality. Thus, \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" has two narratives (and one that is more comedic Allen; the other dramatic, to boot) and two protagonists (Allen's character and that of Martin Landau), two marriages, two extramarital affairs (or, at least, Allen's Cliff tries to have one with Mia Farrow's Halley), two siblings, two Jewish thinkers, two killings, and Cliff is even making two films. In \"Crime and Punishment,\" the protagonist Raskolnikov wrote an essay containing his philosophy, for which the novel begins as an expression of that inner literary piece and which later contributes to his undoing. Allen wisely replaces that mise-en-abyme with a visual one of motion pictures, an inherently dualistic art form, which also express the beliefs of Cliff and contribute to his undoing; he loses his job over one and his positive philosophy from the other. In the much remarked-upon ending, Landau pitches the story of this very film, \"Crimes and Misdemeanors,\" to its maker, Allen. Thus, there are also two authors of the film itself.Every other filmmaker (and I've seen 20 \"Crime and Punishment\" pictures not including Allen's, and, in the spirit of Cliff, I've refused to see the TV versions) fails to fully transmute Dostoevsky's orthodox conservatism. Most of the adaptations end with Raskolnikov's confession--a simplistic morality tale of bad guy getting his comeuppance--a Hollywood ending. Barely any of them touch the book's epilogue of Raskolnikov's religious conversion and abandonment of his prior nihilistic radicalism. I'm impressed, then, when Allen is the only one to so comprehend the narrative's meaning. Of course, he does so only to reject it. Although Landau's murderer, Judah, initially is consumed with guilt, like Raskolnikov, he overcomes it without being punished, legally or morally, by others or self-imposed. And while he doesn't initially share Raskolnikov's belief in his own superiority, his pitch to Cliff suggests he considers himself extraordinary in the end, which effectively reverses the trajectory of the novel. Cliff, on the other hand, faces a metaphorical prison sentence after he is turned down by a woman--whereas Judah got rid of a woman pursuing him. Moreover, Halley ends up with another more successful and insincere man (played by a hilarious Alan Alda) than Cliff. Even the others' siblings are more successful than Cliff's sister, who is literally defecated on.Meanwhile, despite the protagonists' religiously Jewish upbringings and all of the film's talk of \"God's eyes see all,\" the Rabbi goes blind and the Jewish professor, and subject of one of Allen's films-within-the-film, who spouts a positive philosophy of life, regardless, kills himself. Landau's murderous ophthalmologist--responsible for one's viewing, while Cliff creates what is viewed--on the other hand, sees no souls in the eyes he examines. The only conversion Allen offers here is a nihilistic, or at least atheistic, one, where even hopeful existentialism is doubted. The only one seeing all is the movie spectator--like Cliff, as our surrogate, who spends much of his days watching old films in theatres or at home, and like us spectators of this film. Besides being thoroughly antithetical of Dostoevsky's philosophy, this repurposing of \"God's eyes\" is also a nifty transmutation of the third-person omniscient narration of the book that did \"see all.\"",

I will only say that the situation, psychological development, and actions of one of the main characters irresistibly remind me of Raskolnikov, the protagonist of \"Crime and Punishment\" by Fyodor Dostoevsky, who, judging by the title, was probably the inspiration for this film.When it comes to Woody Allen, I think, you either like him or you don't, there's no middle ground.

As he became a household name thanks to some of the most hilarious comedies of the 1970s, Allen moved away from playing the clown and into more serious territory. The comedy was still there, but as a fan of Ingmar Bergman and Marcel Ophuls, he was always eager to explore the darkness rooted in our souls. One of his most sobering works is also one of his best. Released in 1989, Crimes and Misdemeanors asked the question posed by many a philosopher: Can you live with yourself after committing a murder or will the shame gradually eat away your soul?The man at the centre of the story, Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau), seems to have it all. He's a respected doctor with a loving family and a group of adoring friends, and the film opens with a lavish dinner held in his honour. On the surface, Judah is a happily married man, but he holds a dark secret. Over the past few months, he has indulged in an affair with flight attendant Dolores Paley (Anjelica Huston), enjoying short breaks away and taking long walks on the beach. Only now Dolores is threatening to reveal his secret, sending a letter to Judah's wife which he manages to intercept at the last minute, and calling from the gas station down the road with ideas of turning up at the family's door. When she refuses to listen to Judah's pleas, the doctor turns to his brother Jack (Jerry Orbach), who has connections to the mob, for help. Jack has a simple answer: He will hire someone to murder Dolores and Judah won't have to lift a finger.While all of this is going on, struggling documentary filmmaker Cliff Stern (Allen) is thrown a gig by his brother-in-law - the obnoxious, self-obsessed sitcom writer Lester (Alan Alda) - and meets cute associate producer Halley Reed (Mia Farrow) on the job. Unhappy in his own marriage, Cliff can't help but fall in love, but Lester has her in his sights also. It took me a while to figure out why these two seemingly unconnected stories were unravelling side-by-side, but it soon becomes clear that this is a film about the absurdity of guilt. Judah and Jack had it drilled into them from a young age by their rabbi father, but now they appear to be literally getting away with murder. Cliff may want to cheat on his berating wife, but he is ultimately a 'good' guy, yet life doesn't seem to want to throw him any luck. There's also a key character in Ben (Sam Waterston), a rabbi who still maintains a lust for life despite his deteriorating eyesight. It plays like a thriller, but it's also very funny. There's a depressing theme constantly at play, but Allen ensures that the story remains insightful, engrossing and occasionally heartbreaking. One of Allen's shrewdest and most humanistic pictures to date, assisted by a flawless ensemble.",

            "content": "In one candid moment of the hugely successful Lester's life, he is given a rather rousing and instructive speech to a room full of colleagues, who listen intently, and the camera pans across until it finally reveals Cliff, aiming a different camera at the proceedings. Woody, and therefore Cliff, shoots this way because for him, there is no difference between Lester's real and documentary life; they are both shallow, worthless and rubbish. This is a departure from the usual Woody character - still neurotic, still high-minded and cultured, but this particular one is rather needy, somewhat pathetic. He prides himself on staying away from the Hollywood-esque success that Lester has garnered, and prefers more personal, meaningful works. One he is working on about an elderly philosopher who spouts vague truths about love and life blows up embarrassingly in his face when this wise man commits suicide. Lester openly insults his career by admitting he is only asking him as a favour to his sister, Cliff's wife. At the end of the film, Cliff feels like he deserves the love of Halley, another like-minded, smart and attractive individual (and he has been vicariously substituting this hollow in his life, in the wake of his waning marriage, with his young niece), and cannot even think why she would choose Lester over him (who reminds him of Mussolini). And so it haunts him endlessly. Dually, there is another closely linked with the family who is being haunted. Judah's affair is catching up with him, threatening both his personal and financial life, and there remains no choice. Landau is the best of the cast, and shows it here; watch how he tries to convince himself that the idea of the murder is not his idea, watch how he rambles endlessly about morality but cannot seem to remember why he called his brother for assistance. But for a crime of this magnitude, four months later he is seemingly at peace, while Cliff mourns newly. Crimes and Misdemeanors is not about how he got away with it - this is irrelevant and happens with ease - but how he deals with the fact he got away with it.Allen employs a few significant techniques to both these characters in moments of strife. The first is the silence, save for maybe the hum of a car engine or the crackling of a telephone, as the character's mind wanders incessantly on their troubles. This makes the music so much more dreadful when it finally cues in; in a particularly creepy sequence which follows the murderer, the previous lovers who found themselves together in Schubert now become confronted with death with his String Quartet 15, a moment of wonderful agitation without ever showing any action or violence. Another is the slow zoom in to a character's face as they are hit with horrible news, which is frequently coupled with the use of visual flashbacks which contrast the now cold and frightening reality. Levey's suicide, the murder of Paley...In one case Judah even consciously argues at length about morality with his memories of a Jewish dinner (this scene is very Allen) and this represents his full conscious awareness of his sin, and his desperation to justify it. Meanwhile, in a blow of cruel symbolism, the rabbi, the one moral centre, is blind by the end of the film, while the ophthalmologist is seeing clearer than ever. Another theme is the blurring of the boundaries between fiction and reality. We saw this first with Cliff shooting Lester, and also in the many cuts from reality straight into a movie that Cliff might be watching, which closely mirror the events of the story. Allen manages to conjure some of his humour from this tale; the hilarious way in which Mussolini is compared to Lester, the voyeuristic and aggressive manner that he films Lester flirting with the women in the workplace, and in one scene, the darkness of Judah's story almost invades into Cliff's. His sister is recounting a horrifying date incident, and we curl up in revulsion, waiting for that fateful word, before it is suddenly replaced with another. If it was rape Cliff might react with a subtle horror and rage, but in this case he flies off the handles and reacts with much more indignation than necessary, and it is very funny. Allen seems to readily announce that this is not a Hollywood movie. The ending is entirely pessimistic; the rich and successful Judah discovers the shakiness of the construct of humanity, and God's eye no longer plagues him, much less no longer exists in his mind. Cliff has let love slip away (then again, I think he deserves it, being wholly unoriginal, having his pet projects fail and even plagiarising a declaration of love from James Joyce's Ulysses). At times it feels like two completely separate films that have been combined as per title. But when they come together, and seem to exhibit the opposite reactions that we would normally expect, Levey's message rings true. But I don't think Cliff ever seems to realise it.",

            "review_title": "Movie in relation to Kant and Mill",
            "content": "Crimes and Misdemeanors is a film about two men who are unhappy in their marriages and the different choices they make to change their situation. Judah is a rich, successful orthopedic doctor who began having an affair two years previous with a woman named Delores; it was not because he had a bad marriage, he was merely bored and wanted some hot new \"tail.\" Clifford is a nerdy, struggling filmmaker whose marriage has been on a steady decline for the past year; he begins work on a new project and meets his co-worker Nancy, who he immediately begins to fall for despite still being marred. Judah's lover Delores starts to become very emotionally unstable and begins to threaten and blackmail Judah because he won't tell his wife about his mistress. She makes attempts to contact the wife herself and starts calling his house all the time. Judah realizes what an ass he's been and how he's jeopardized his whole life and career by having this affair; he goes to his brother Jack for advise, and he suggests Judah have Delores murdered. Initially Judah is appalled by this notion and refuses the thought altogether; however, after some time of having Delores get bolder and more desperate, Judah seriously considers it and finally decides to go through with the murder. Meanwhile, Clifford continues courting his co-worker and begins to believe he is in love with her. He eventually tells her and ends up having a few sexual discrepancies. Not long after he tells Nancy his feelings for her, she tells Clifford that she has taken a job in Paris and will be gone for a few months. Clifford is shattered but decides to wait for her and get a divorce in the meantime. Around six months or so later Clifford sees Nancy at a party on the arm of a man he despises, and overhears that they got married while in Paris. He is devastated and is now single, miserable, and poor. The film ends with Judah and Clifford talking at the party, and Judah is telling Clifford how his life has totally turned around and he is incredibly happy now. He ends up with his wife in a better relationship than they had before and is still a successful doctor. Clifford mulls over the idea of murder and if he had killed the man before, Nancy would never have married him. Ultimately we see that Judah did the wrong thing and ended up happier than before, while Clifford made the better choices and ended up miserable and alone for the rest of his life.According to Mill and the Utilitarian viewpoint, Judah's choice to murder his mistress was the correct moral decision. Utilitarian's believe that the final consequences are all that matter, and that the moral decision brings about the happiness of the most people involved. They do not care that Delores had her life snuffed out for no real good reason, or that she was completely innocent of anything that would deserve such a harsh punishment. But by her death many other people remained happy; Judah was able to sweep his discrepancies under the rug, so to speak, and return to his old life as if nothing happened. He gained a deeper appreciation for his wife and family and thus was happier, by Delores' death the family remained in the dark about Judah's affair and they were all happy. None of his clients found out about his shady money transactions, and everyone in his life either remained as happy as before, or became happier.Kant would have said that Judah was immoral because of the categorical imperative, which states that one should not act in such a way that they would not want others to act and thus be a universal law. If Judah believed in the categorical imperative, then by killing Delores he would essentially be saying that it would be okay if someone killed him for being a nuisance or for unethically messing around with his clients' money. I believe it is pretty obvious that Judah would not have wanted this at all since he couldn't even bare the thought that he would have to suffer the consequences for his wrong actions; not to mention having to pay for them with his own life. Clifford's case is a little more difficult for me; I believe Mill and Kant would have said that Clifford was being moral by not following through with his murderous thoughts. Clifford divorced his wife and she met someone new, so she was happier; his lover Nancy ended up getting married to a man that she seemed to truly love, so both she and her new husband were happy also. Clifford was the only one who seemed to come out at a loss when everything was said and done, so Mill would have said the net gain was in happiness. Kant would have also said Clifford did the right thing, because he would not want it to be a universal law that people can kill each other out of jealousy. In total, this film had quite a few things going on and different themes underneath the surface. The ending seemed to suggest to the audience that the person who does what is immoral but can get away with it is happier than the person who does what is right.",

            "review_title": "Fatal flaw in premise of otherwise excellent movie on microcosm of NY",
            "content": "This is a deftly made movie with parallel stories and portrayal of the world of Jewish New Yorkers. The angst over whether there is a true morality from an omnipotent God makes the film thought-provoking and, to some, disturbing. Allen has grappled now twice with this idea of getting away with murder and whether one can go on to live a good life without fear of retribution. He explored it in this film, and then again in Matchpoint. In Crimes and Misdemeanors, the issue was whether God was watching and if the guilty character could live well with his conscience. In Matchpoint, retribution is a matter of random luck.The conclusions of both films can seem brilliant to some, but quite troubling to others. The reason this is so, is because Allen's main question, \"Can the murderer get away with it?\" hinges on one important assumption: that all rewards and punishments occur in this life...and that moral behavior is subject to rewards and punishments. This is in fact a very Jewish point of view (hence the family debate in their Midwood, Brooklyn, home). Jews do not believe in Heaven or Hell, so all has to be achieved in this life. Within the logic that emerges from the above question is inevitably a morally confused universe and cynical point of view. What's worse is that the movie assumes the rewards are things like wealth, career success, love.If murderers do not get found out and do not suffer punishment, does that mean there is no moral God watching over us? No, their crime or misdemeanor is still wrong, because it caused harm to someone. If they have no conscience and they are not caught, it is still wrong. If there is not a God meting out rewards and punishments in this life or the afterlife, what makes it wrong? Does it not matter if one decides to murder for personal gain? Is not the rule to follow simply dog eat dog and every man for himself? Allen has not progressed in questioning the assumption, whether material rewards are the appropriate measure of morality.To get past his ongoing conundrum, the next time Allen takes on this theme, he needs to consider how society as a whole would break down if no one subscribed to any code of morality. There would not be anything to get away with, since everyone would subscribe to the law of the jungle: who ever eats, wins. Without a common code of morals, we would be reduced to a primitive state.Allen is very literary, but to address moral issues, he needs to go beyond the individual and consider social systems as a whole. Morality is a matter of relationships to our fellow human beings, not of individual success in life. One might argue that societies have a long history of sanctioning, through the law, behaviors we find abhorrent today, so morality is still all relative and there is no moral absolute. I think, rather, that human societies evolve as we learn from our mistakes, and we find out these mistakes because indeed there is a moral absolute that reveals them to be wrong: gradually it becomes recognized that it is not okay for women to be an underclass to men; that racism violates the rights of people; that lying, cheating, stealing, and murdering result in a breakdown of the trust required to engage in transactions and the economic health of a society; that crime is a symptom of a lot of social ills, from economic inequities to mental illness to social pressures that sway the individual's moral compass. Obviously, there are sociopaths and criminals who have no empathy for their victims and no conscience about gaining at the expense of others, including murder -- we now have clinical terms for them, and even can link aberrant, deficient behaviors to parts of the brain. Judah's brother is such a one with no twinges of conscience. Judah enjoys the trappings of success very much because those around subscribe to a moral code to which he must pretend.Criminals are put in jail to punish them, to protect society from them, and to reform them. Society's sense of morality evolves in the effort to achieve some social order that is sustainable. If someone gets away with murder, the goal of the law is that society does not implode with everyone doing the same as some norm of behavior. One does not need a God to tell us what works or not. Our different beliefs in God or not, meanwhile, color how we codify our morals in social conduct and the law.Good movie, within its narrowly defined universe, but Allen needs to expand beyond that small universe to truly answer the question of moral absolutes. I hope he reads my review somehow, as I get the sense that his is indeed a very troubled man.P.S. To those who analyze the film in terms of Utilitarianism and Kant, my above take based on human relationships draws from Asian philosophy and Confucianism, and the concept of societies as complex systems.",

            "content": "Crimes and Misdemeanors is the second film that Woody Allen collaborated with Sven Nykvist, but the first one that I have seen. Seeing Nykvist's name appear on screen as the Director of Photography on a Woody Allen film knowing how great a fan he was of Ingmar Bergman nearly made my heart explode. I can only imagine the glee Allen must have experience working with the man responsible for so many of the best shots in Bergman films. I have pretty diverse interests in life so it's not often that favorites of mine intersect so I suppose I lived a bit vicariously through Allen in the moment in which I read Nykvist's name. The 1989 feature of Woody Allen grapples with morality, serious questioning of religion, and the idea of damnation through exploring the life of an ophthalmologist who carried on an affair with a woman who threatened to tell his wife about his misdeeds. Struggling to regain control of his life, one man must determine which version of reality works for him.Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau) is an outstanding member of the community. An ophthalmologist by trade, Judah is always hosting lavish parties in his home and honored by the community. What no one would expect from Judah would be the idea that he would carry on an extra- marital affair. He and his wife seem to be happily married, nevertheless, Judah has been carrying on an affair for two years with a flight attendant he met on one of his business trips. As their affair lingers his mistress, Dolores Paley (Anjelica Huston) is of the belief that he will leave his wife and begin a life with her. When Judah denies that he ever indicated that he would leave his wife, Dolores becomes despondent and threatens to tell Judah's wife about everything that has happened between them. His brother Jack suggests that the only way to continue leading his picturesque life is by having Dolores murdered, and Jack has the means to make this happen. Suddenly struck with a bought of morals Judah is stressed over which option to choose. He admits that he doesn't love Dolores but he struggles with the idea of being responsible for ending the life of another human being. Judah also believes that his life will come crashing down if he were to tell his wife, as he feels she would be unable to forgive him. In the other moral story of the film the audience meets Cliff (Woody Allen) a man who is living in a marriage that's seemed to have lost its spark, in the bedroom anyway. Cliff is struggling, he wants to be a filmmaker but he refuses to succumb to the type of filming that is devoid of purpose and only exists to please an audience. Although he strays away from the type of work his wife's husband Lester does (Alan Alda), he takes a job wth the pompous, egotistical, philandering man to please his wife who is desperate for him to work for an income again. While shooting the documentary with Leser, Cliff meets Halley Reed (Mia Farrow) a divorc\u00e9e who claims to have sworn off men. The pair's mutual disdain of Lester brings them together initially, but as they spend more time together Cliff falls in love and contemplates having an affair with Halley. Culminating in a party whereby the two stories converge, each man involved in their struggle must determine what level of morality they wish to exercise and what they allow to be their guiding set of principles. --I'm not going to write about how incredible the opening speech praising Judah while he reminisces about the affair he's been having with for two years at establishing how highly looked upon Judah is in the community while he simultaneously grapples with a universally detestable act.-- It's funny what you start to notice when you watch several features of one artist's work. For instance, in the Woody Allen films I've watched recently, I'm noticing that the homes filmed have glorious built-in bookshelves that I am eternally jealous of. The image of Woody Allen sitting in a cinema with a film reflecting off his glasses may actually be all I need in life, or you know, a picture of that hanging in my home. Crimes and Misdemeanors was, surprisingly to me, one of Woody's more deliberative films. We even see Judah going back to his childhood home and reliving portions of his life in order to better decipher his moral compass. Equally as contemplative is Woody Allen's character questioning whether or not to engage in an affair only to discover the woman of his affection become engaged to his most sincere enemy. The look of betrayal and heartbreak on Allen's face when he sees Lester and Halley together celebrating their engagement is agonizing. Crimes and Misdemeanors is another Woody Allen film I don't hear talked about nearly enough as one of his best, and in a way I'm happy to keep stumbling upon these surprises.",

            "content": "In CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, Woody Allen plays a documentary filmmaker named Cliff Stern who is working on a film about a philosopher who is also a Holocaust survivor. As Cliff shows a sample of his incomplete film to Halley Reed, played by Mia Farrow, the old philosopher drones away in the background discussing rather elementary questions of morality. Obviously oblivious to the sad fact that the old man's rambling discourse is tedious and banal, Allen and Farrow rave about his insights and brilliance.Meanwhile, Cliff is also making a TV documentary -- strictly for the money, about a crass Norman Lear-like television producer, played by Alan Alda. Lester, Alda's character, also happens to be Cliff's brother-in-law, and Cliff hates the man; supposedly because he is a crude and pretentious showman, but most probably because Lester is a financially successful crude and pretentious showman. Throughout CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, Allen holds up Lester to a degree of ridicule that is equal to the degree of awe he reserves for the droning philosopher.It doesn't take a genius to see the parallel that this situation has for the way Woody has come to approach his film-making. He has this misbegotten desire to be taken serious as a dramatist and an insightful philosopher that clashes with the reality that what he does best is to create comedy, particularly comedy that mocks the very pontificating, overwritten gobbledygook that passes for deep philosophical ponderings.CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS is roughly divided into two barely related stories. The \"misdemeanor\" of the title is a variation of the standard Woody Allen love story. Allen's Cliff is unhappily married and he lusts after Farrow's Halley, who in turn has caught the eye of Lester. There is a nothing terribly new or original in this tale, but it does give Allen a chance to hurl his usual sardonic barbs at the male/female condition and the sorry state of the world in general.However, most of CRIMES focuses on the \"serious\" story, the \"crime.\" Martin Landau plays Judah Rosenthal, a prominent and highly respected eye specialist. However, Judah's perfect world is threatened when his unstable mistress, Dolores (Anjelica Huston), gets tired of being taken for granted and demands that he leave his wife or suffer the consequences. Not wishing to have his well-ordered life shaken up, he arranges for his shady brother, Jack (Jerry Orbach), to \"take care of\" Dolores, while Judah moans and groans endlessly about how awful the whole situation makes him feel. Allen's point in CRIMES is that while Cliff's life is ruined -- or at least messed up -- by his petty sin of coveting, Judah's only gets better and better after his involvement in a murder. Allen's question seems to be how can such an injustice happen if there is, indeed, a just and honorable God? Allen's point is well taken; unfortunately, his film is hard to take. As a filmmaker, his style can become stilted, arch and cynical. When he puts these qualities into his comedy, it produces wryly sophisticated humor. When applied to his attempts at drama, the result is too often sterile, dispassionate and unappealing. His literate comedy turns into painful preaching and posturing.Allen is obviously most concerned with the story of Judah, a study of a basically good man who can commit and prosper from evil deeds. And perhaps the viewer could sympathize with Allen's queries if Woody hadn't inadvertently stacked the deck so that we sympathize to some degree with Judah's actions, by giving us a Dolores who is a belligerent shrew and a blackmailer. We aren't given a lot of reason to feel sorry for Delores, and even though Judah comes off as a transparently insincere hypocrite in his response to the killing, we are given every reason to believe that he has otherwise led a superior and moral life. Could it be that Judah can get away with a bad deed because he has worked hard to build up so much good karma in the first place? Woody won't raise that question.Woody, meanwhile, tries to give us Cliff as the noble \"little man\" who suffers unfairly in the shadow of a rich and powerful sinner like Judah -- and, for that matter, Lester. But Cliff is not a very nice person. Beyond being a potential philanderer, Cliff comes off as a mean and petty little man, who seems to blame others for all his failures. When Cliff finds himself down and almost out at the end, it's his fault, not God's.CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS is for the most part a parable, with the moral being \"Life is not fair;\" whether the crime is big or small, moral justice is an illusion. As obvious as it seems, it is also a self-serving moral that just doesn't ring particularly true, since neither Judah nor Cliff are all bad or all good and, most importantly, the story only examines fragments of their entire lives. Just as Cliff's film on Lester shows only parts that make him look bad, Allen is selective in how he reveals who Judah and Cliff are. It just may be that God has a broader view of what constitutes justice than Allen might embrace.Certainly Woody seems to be far more judgmental than God, especially when it comes to judging God. Indeed, perhaps the true moral of CRIMES -- and much of his other work -- is that \"It is all God's fault, or it would be if God existed -- but he doesn't, so let's blame God for not existing in the first place.\" For an atheist, Allen certainly places a lot of blame on an entity that he doesn't even believe in. In Woody's world, God just can't win.",

It's humorously and touchingly real.The events Martin Landau's character goes through are compelling and wholly devastating. The handling of a man wracked with guilt and the way his mind works through it is brilliantly done and the way his story and Allen's reflect one another and culminate into a thought provoking, mind opening point is incomparable.I won't give anything specific away and I HOPE there are no spoilers in what I've said, just watch the film if you haven't, and if you have but think this film should be only about Landau's character that's fine, but look back and appreciate the film as a whole.",

            "content": "Truly brilliant. This film has it all, starting with its themes from Dostoevsky and Bergman, and honestly - though I revere both of those men, it's on a par with their work. In addition to the existential pondering of the meaning of it all, the pathos in our little lives, and crushing feelings of guilt, Woody Allen mixes in comedy, romance, old Hollywood references, and a great soundtrack on top of it all. The film has no wasted moments and is incredibly focused in its development of the two parallel story lines, each of which is fantastic.In one of the stories, a middle-aged man (Martin Landau) having an affair reaches a crisis point when his lover (Anjelica Huston) threatens to expose him after he tries to break it off. In the other, a married man (Woody Allen) who is frustrated both personally and professionally falls for a woman (Mia Farrow) but watches in horror as she's attracted to his celebrity brother-in-law (Alan Alda), a shallow guy he envies as much as he detests.Some of the most powerful scenes in the film are when Landau interacts with people in his mind, including a Seder gathering from the past. There we see arguments for and against faith laid out beautifully, and I loved the strength and cynicism in the character of Aunt May (Anna Berger). It's in moments like these that Allen channels Bergman the most, and I thought it was pretty cool that he also had Bergman's legendary cinematographer, Sven Nykvist, for this film. At the same time, he makes it his own, with fine humor in the one-liners and hilarious facial reactions to distressing situations.*** Spoiler Alert ***One of the things I really appreciated about the film is that while it's playful, there is real darkness in how the stories play out. The guy who is a complete phony gets the girl, and the guy who had a murder committed gets off scot-free once he gets over his guilt. Raskolnikov he is not. Meanwhile the guy just trying to make honest indie films loses both the girl and his wife, the rabbi with the positive worldview (Sam Waterston) is going blind, and the intelligent professor (Martin S. Bergmann) who makes such profound observations about the human condition commits suicide. How can such injustice exist? The film wisely does not try to answer this question, nor does it sugarcoat reality. It's profound and artistically nearly perfect, and I felt waves of goosebumps when it finished.Quotes, all from the character of the professor:\nOn meaning; I absolutely love that last bit about the hope for future generations:\n\"We are all faced throughout our lives with agonizing decisions. Moral choices. Some are on a grand scale. Most of these choices are on lesser points. But we define ourselves by the choices we have made. We are in fact the sum total of our choices. Events unfold so unpredictably, so unfairly, human happiness does not seem to have been included, in the design of creation. It is only we, with our capacity to love, that give meaning to the indifferent universe. And yet, most human beings seem to have the ability to keep trying, and even to find joy from simple things like their family, their work, and from the hope that future generations might understand more.\"On love:\n\"You will notice that what we are aiming at when we fall in love is a very strange paradox. The paradox consists of the fact that, when we fall in love, we are seeking to re-find all or some of the people to whom we were attached as children. On the other hand, we ask our beloved to correct all of the wrongs that these early parents or siblings inflicted upon us. So that love contains in it the contradiction: The attempt to return to the past and the attempt to undo the past.\"On God (and man):\n\"The unique thing that happened to the early Israelites was that they conceived a God that cares. He cares, but, at the same time, he also demands that you behave morally. But, here comes the paradox: what's one of the first things that God asks? That God asks Abraham to sacrifice his only son, his beloved son, to him. In other words, in spite of millennia of efforts, we have not succeeded to create a really and entirely loving image of God. This was beyond our capacity to imagine.\"",

            "content": "Crimes and Misdemeanors is probably the most stable and focused Woody Allen film I have yet to see, but definitely the most thought-provoking and philosophical, questioning its viewer if they could potentially go on to live with themselves if they, theoretically, \"got away with murder?\" Allen takes the camera and the pen to write a film that cleanly intertwines two stories heavily built on moral and ethically questionable situations, with one character committing infidelity with his mistress, and another trying to stay afloat with life never giving him a reasonable break.The first man we are introduced to is the respected, successful ophthalmologist named Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau) who has a marriage of twenty-five years on one hand and a stable affair going on the other. The affair is with a flight attendant named Dolores Paley (Anjelica Huston), who is beginning to go off the break end, as she feels cheated and strung along by the man who promised to end his marriage with his wife for her. She writes a letter to Judah's wife, which he barely intercepts as it sits openly on the kitchen table, and on numerous occasions tries to reason and rationalize with her to no avail.Judah then gets a bright idea; his brother named Jack (Jerry Orbach) has mob connections and could potentially have Dolores whacked and get away with it all the more. With that in mind, all he has to do is visit his ethics and see if he could live with such a thing on his conscious. Turns out he can, and here's where the \"crime\" comes in.The second story is of Clifford Stern, an unhappy, unsuccessful film director with a marriage quickly souring and a career with no calling. In efforts to show his wife that he still is a functioning human, he takes the job of directing and producing a documentary on her brother Lester (Alan Alda) and his career as a comedian. Lester is an unbearably arrogant man who Cliff can barely tolerate because of his increasing narcissism and belittling conversations, but finds the job somewhat more tolerable upon meeting Halley Reed (Mia Farrow), an associate producer on the project, and the two begin a minor little venture into infidelity. I guess you could call this the \"misdemeanor.\" What connects these two stories is Sam Waterston's Ben, a rabbi both look to for advice, who is growing increasingly blind. Ben is so devoted to his beliefs in the system of karmic revenge and religion that it seems to be the only thing keeping him going. This character gives us unprecedented depth into screenwriter Allen's possible beliefs in the world, which he ping pongs and explores in an even-handed fashion. The first is the morally devout system of Ben, where all evil deeds are eventually punished in some way, shape, or form. This system invites a little transcendentalism ideology I wasn't expecting from this kind of a story.The other system is one that is held by Judah's brother Jack, who believes that the only punishments one could pay for sinning is a practical, realistic consequence, which in this case would likely jail time. There's no spirituality involved and the punishments at the individual's expense will be entirely served during his lifetime. This isn't necessarily an atheistic outlook, but one of lesser spiritual devotion. A more pragmatic believer, if you will. We take a look at how his family believed in a vividly detailed flashback late in the film, showing the issue of morality and punishment coming up at a conversation over dinner, with Jack's similar attitude in play.Crimes and Misdemeanors is blackly funny, richly detailed, smartly and deeply written, and functions as a terrific entry in Allen's never-ending filmography. Two huge chunks contributing to why this is stems from the immense amount of thought and consideration given to the material at hand (IE: the two belief systems and the idea of getting away with something), and the fact that the film oscillates smoothly between these two stories, one of them a sincere and darkly told drama, the other, a romantic story, lacking in things romanticism and mimicking the farcical elements and one-liners Allen erected in his early features such as Bananas and Sleeper. This isn't an uplifting film by any stretch of imagination; we see deeply flawed characters get away with traitorous acts of infidelity, and we see good-natured, competent humans be rewarded with the ricochet effects from their back-stabbing friends and family. This is a hard slice of life, and it takes a capable director to give us this sort of blunt, honest realism in a film.Starring: Martin Landau, Woody Allen, Anjelica Huston, Mia Farrow, Alan Alda, Jerry Orbach, and Joanna Gleason.

The whole murder plot was put together great and all of the characters put in a great performance. It isn't a whodunit, like Manhattan Murder Mystery, but it shows how a simple affair can turn horribly wrong. Woody Allen didn't have to include the love affair between him and Mia Farrow, but it does lighten the movie, even though it doesn't end to well for his character. It does feel like two completely different movies in one, which is why the title fits the film perfectly. Watchable!Round-Up: Martin Landau was brilliant in this film. He brought intensity and emotion to his role which made the whole situation between him and Huston believable. Alan Ada and Mia Farrow act the same in all of Woody Allen's movies so there performances wasn't that surprising, and I much preferred the toned down version of Woody Allen's acting which made the film bearable. Anyway, this is a watchable movie which shows that Woody Allen can write and direct other genres except for comedy.Budget: $19million Worldwide Gross: $18.2millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about a man who tries to break an affair and a struggling director who falls in love with a co-worker. 6/10",

Thankfully he didnt, because \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" mixes crime and comedy as perfectly as I have ever seen it. Add to this mix a very melancholic and tragic romance and you have the wonderfully bright ingredients of this Woody Allen classic.The storyline: a secret affair turns sour because the mistress threatens to reveal everything to his wife.The man panics and starts pondering of ways to get rid of her. This storyline is the backdrop for a moral question: can one get away with crime WITHOUT punishment? The many (humorous and serious) ways in which Woody Allen wrestles with this question is what makes \"Crimes and Misdemeanours\" so beautiful and endearing.I could go on and on about this movie which is so dear to me, but I want to end with a quote from the brilliant Professor Louis Levy, who survived the concentration camps in World War II. Louis Levy is the personification of many moral questions in this movie. And those questions are being posed without humor and in all earnest. In the end Levy asks himself what \"love\" is:\"...when we fall in love, we are seeking to re-find all or some of the people to whom we were attached as children. We ask our beloved to correct all of the wrongs that these early parents or siblings inflicted upon us. So that love contains in it the contradiction: The attempt to return to the past and the attempt to undo the past...\" Louis Levy.",

            "content": "\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is probably Woody Allen's darkest film, or at least it was until his British crime thriller duo of \"Match Point\" and \"Cassandra's Dream\" from the last couple of years.In fact, \"Match Point\" borrows heavily from \"Crimes\" and both borrow from Dreiser's \"An American Tragedy.\" Martin Landau plays a prominent doctor who pays to have his unhinged mistress (Anjelica Huston) bumped off when she threatens to make things unpleasant for him and his accepted social standing as an upright citizen. The guilt he experiences is worse than the shame he would have endured had the mistress lived to tell what she knew. In a parallel story, Woody Allen plays a man in an unhappy marriage who is making a documentary for a regular T.V. show about a pompous T.V. exec (Alan Alda) while falling for one of the show's producers (Mia Farrow). The two stories don't seem to be related, aside from the common thread of infidelity that runs through them, until the very end, when Allen's and Landau's characters meet at a wedding and Landau \"confesses\" his crimes.The big question Allen explores in \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is the inherent nature of the universe: is there a moral structure or is the universe essentially chaotic and cruel? If there is a moral code, is it dictated to us by a higher power or is mankind itself inherently moral? These are interesting questions, much more interesting than the \"what is the point of existence?\" questions Allen frequently addresses and which he borrowed wholesale from Ingmar Bergman. This film ends on an essentially optimistic note, but not before it gives us a rather nasty and chilling twist -- Landau's character finds that his conscience gradually eases on its own, and finds that the guilty aren't necessarily punished, and are sometimes even rewarded.A highlight in Woody Allen's canon.Grade: A",

            "content": "A good example of why the screenplay is so great is the character of Dolores Paley, played by Anjelica Huston. She is a minor character; in essence serving as the 'in' to Judah Rosenthal, but Allen does not skimp. She is a fully realized character. Look at the scene where she is recalling her past with Judah, and we then see her soberly staring off into the ether. The door bell rings, she runs to it, and embraces Judah. We get the memory, which is positive, her reflection, which makes her seem to rue it, her desperation in running to the door, and then her blackmail threat. In a minute or so we get a complex arc of a character. But, while fully developed, she is also used as a device to get the viewer to sympathize with the amoral Judah. Her whininess, pettiness, self-importance, self-deceits, threats to Judah and his family, all make us dislike her, well rounded or not, and subtly make us actually want Judah to off her. Thus we are subliminally made to feel what Judah feels, and thus a small sense of complicity and guilt is rooted in most viewers. Yet, Allen does not settle for the easy out of having us totally on Judah's anti-heroic side, either. He is not Godzilla, and we do not totally want him to step on and/pr fry the scurrying little Japs that flee from his rampage. Instead, we see that he is a hypocrite and coward, unwilling (until the film's end) to accept his amorality. I earlier mentioned the scene where he invites his brother up to his home, just so he can pawn off the first mention of murder on Jack (who, in a great moment, exasperates that Judah was never comfortable playing 'hardball' in life), and this act is almost as repulsive as the act of murder he finances, and Judah is an even more despicable character than his brother, for he has the means to avoid such actions, and chooses not to.Yet, the screenplay's excellence is not out of tricks, even there, for we then get the film's resolution, which clearly rewards and glorifies those people (unethical or not) who are strong and bold, and crushes those who are equivocal and weak. Amongst the lot of 'winners' are the Rosenthal brothers (especially Judah), Wendy Stern, Lester, and Barbara's date. Amongst the 'losers' are Cliff Stern, Dolores Paley, Professor Levy, Barbara, and Ben the rabbi. About the only exception to the rule is the equivocal Halley, yet she is 'won' by Lester. All of the winners are decisive and create their own lives, whereas Cliff and his sister indulge in romantic fantasies (he's an unemployed, married filmmaker, short and not handsome, and he really thinks Halley will choose him over the rich, single, and handsome Lester?). By contrast, the winners cut their losses, and look askance at the worst possible outcomes they could suffer. And they succeed.Unusually, the critical reception of the film was almost wholly positive. The lone exception was the Chicago Reader's ridiculously bad Jonathan Rosenbaum who wrote:The first \"serious\" Woody Allen film with Jewish characters (1989) might seem like an improvement after the pseudoprofundities of Interiors et al, but it can't be said to dig any deeper. Martin Landau plays a wealthy ophthalmologist who plots the murder of his mistress (Anjelica Huston) when she threatens to expose his adultery and embezzlement. In quasi-comic counterpoint is the plight of an unsuccessful documentary filmmaker (Allen) who's stuck in an unhappy marriage, goes to work for his obnoxious brother-in-law (Alan Alda), a successful producer of TV sitcoms, and falls in love with one of his assistants (Mia Farrow). The overall \"philosophical\" thrust\u2014that good guys finish last and that crime does pay\u2014is designed to make the audience feel very wise, but none of the characters or ideas is allowed to develop beyond its cardboard profile (though Alda has a ball with his part). With Claire Bloom and Sam Waterston (as the perfect all-purpose symbolic Allen character\u2014a rabbi going blind).Cardboard characters? Does not dig deeper? What film was Rosenbaum watching? I mean, he's known for being both a poor critic and writer, but this is like claiming 2001: A Space Odyssey had bad special effects. It's simply not tenable, whether or not he subjectively 'liked' the film.No, Rosenbaum is as wrong as one can be, and Judah Rosenthal and Crimes And Misdemeanors are artistic creations on par with two of Akira Kurosawa's greatest meditations on evil: the evil and victorious vice president in The Bad Sleep Well and the realism of the kidnapper in High And Low. The former film show the triumph of evil and the latter a realistic depiction of evil's randomness, which contrasts with Allen's film. And compared with two lesser takes of his own, on the same theme, Match Point and Cassandra's Dream, this film digs deeper and ends far better. Those two films have potential, but drop the ball, in the end. Judah Rosenthal didn't. He played the game, and won, and the next time he ever needs to really 'win' in such a game of life, there will be no self-doubt nor flinching. He learned his lesson; that power and influence can let one cheat and kill with impunity. That's why he's real. That's why he's scary. That's why he's one of the greatest villains in not only film history, but the annals of human fiction. Because there are no supernatural Freddy Kruegers nor superhuman Hannibal Lecters in reality, only in Hollywood films; no matter how outrageous the tales are that come out about the latest serial killer du jour. But there really are Judah Rosenthals out there. They are life's 'winners.' And they simply do not care about you or me. And, as the film shows and argues, why should they?",

Loosely connected main narratives elegantly associate, one of a serious, cold-blooded crime with Martin Landau's beloved opthalmologist and family man Judah Rosenthal at the center, another of everyday indiscretions, rejection and romantic envy between Woody Allen's struggling documentarian Clifford and Alan Alda's insufferable TV producer Lester, together with the trouble of lofty moral aim. Other strands annotate these main two from the higher plane of theological ruminations. The deeply affecting outcome offers that the universe must be apathetic towards any impression of morality, because it sanctions the ethically dubious and downright despicable to ascend in prestige and affluence and disciplines the decent.Various statements and turns of events in Crimes and Misdemeanors offer precious outlook on the notion that in lieu of a moral, benevolent God, the individual should take responsibility for life. If there's no inherent judicial framework to existence, why should the choice of life be worth any more than that of death? If there were no true goal, absolution, some sort of higher power, unlike what Judah's Rabbi Ben, played by Sam Waterston, believes, why shouldn't one just see, past our capricious predictions of the cosmos, our bold affirmations of life, the frigid eyes of apathy that we assume are actually there? Allen provides no comfortable Crime Doesn't Pay ways out, nor any transparent baptismal scenes or flares of light shone upon his characters. He undertakes many of life's mysteries, offers few answers. Isn't that what life's all about: More question marks than periods? Like Spike Lee's masterpiece Do the Right Thing, it's intended to arouse discourse more than resolve issues. That's why the kind of suspense it creates is arguably the best kind, because it's not about what will happen to people, but about what choices they'll make.Simple, honest acting is the biggest risk, because being honest means actors must use themselves, make their work personal. More truly means less to really good performers like Martin Landau, Alan Alda, Mia Farrow, Anjelica Huston, Woody Allen. They get simpler, more elemental, they stop \"acting.\" They play characters seamlessly, but they listen, react as themselves. While each scene feels so simplistically, naturally executed, each is a multidimensional creation. There are very unassuming symbols that elicit meaning without having to be explained, adding subtle touches of texture. There are agendas, emotional baggage, painful secrets, unconscious motivations.Akin to Hannah and Her Sisters in its hyperlink composition and The Purple Rose of Cairo in its sulky premise going hand-in-hand with humor and nostalgia, the movie's surreptitious power, indeed its composition, comes from the candor of the exacting fine points through which it lands at its own poignantly relatable overview. The film arrives at what seems like a dual understanding, really two counterpoints of the same single one. Firstly, we hear the voice of Clifford's documentary subject, who logically emphasizes the senselessness of existence, where all too often the good suffer while the evil flourish. Perhaps in order to find genuine love and happiness it's necessary to have the Rabbi's blind faith that the universe is itself an innately loving place. Can we believe the ultimate image of Judah? We're more apt to believe his adulterous lover Huston's insight into the superficiality of his supposed contentment.Lester and Judah are viewed and thought by most as good people, whereas Clifford's thought to be a poor loser, yet this is of profound ignorance. But while Judah deeply and thoroughly deliberates his wrongdoings, Lester's unconscious, invisible to himself while remaining visible to everyone else. Lester's the poster boy for self-assurance, accomplishment, bliss. By being very enterprising, he's become a successful filmmaker boasting \"a closet full of Emmys,\" loved and regarded by virtually everyone. Humoring his opinions and work ethic, to them he's big-hearted and benevolent. Clifford, his brother-in-law, is one of the few odd ones out who see through the veneer of his image: Lester manipulates colleagues and relatives, womanizes, mispronounces common words, pontificates on the art of comedy. Don't miss Clifford's hilarious rough cut of Lester's documentary profile.",

            "content": "Look we all know Woody Allen is a neurotic Jewish New Yorker. In this film, he plays an unsuccessful Jewish New York film director of documentaries. He finally gets a job working for Alan Alda's character who has an enormous ego and thinks the world of his own comedy. The cast is first rate with Woody Allen writing and directing this superior work, Mia Farrow who was his life partner, the divine Claire Bloom who should have been made Dame by now, Martin Landau who plays the guilt stricken husband, Angelica Huston as his unstable mistress, Jerry Orbach who was Mr. New York as Landau's brother in the film, Joanna Gleason who plays the unhappy wife with Woody Allen in this film while he pursues Mia's character Hally Reed. There is also Caroline Aaron who plays Woody's sister. She is a remarkable character actress who goes unnoticed. There are so many wonderful characters who are real but self-centered in some way. They are all with problems but not financially. You wonder how Woody's character who barely worked in years survives a Manhattan rent? Of course, you can't forget that it's really about Jewish American life in New York City as well. Woody has not forgotten his Jewish roots in his films. Regardless, this film is always worth watching for the first rate cast, writing, and directing. When Woody shoots a film about New York, it's done in New York City and you feel the difference. Of course, Woody is a genius with lots of problems but I think that's the price you pay with being brilliant and gifted. I think he uses his films to sort out his problem.",

            "content": "After watching 'Match Point (2005),' I can remember reading a few reviews comparing it, not always favourably, to Allen's earlier 'Crimes and Misdemeanours (1989).' The similarities are certainly there: Martin Landau's subplot, of a husband having to dispose of a troublesome mistress, is in 'Match Point' expanded to feature-length, and stripped of Allen's comedy relief. Also present in both films is the sense that Woody Allen is upending genre conventions, via last-minute plot turns that actively avoid the narrative closure to which audiences have become accustomed. In this film, Judah Rosenthal (Landau) agonises at length over his sins, which are great, before departing the film with family and reputation intact. There's even the suggestion that he'll eventually overcome his guilt and learn to live with it. Meanwhile, small-time filmmaker Cliff Stern (Allen) covets a woman who isn't his wife (a moral \"misdemeanour\" at worst), and loses everything he cares about. It's a heartbreaking ending for a character whose story, until then, had been relatively lightweight.Religion lies at the forefront of the film. We know this because rain disrupted Allen's shooting schedule, to which the director is said to have remarked, \"Maybe it's too realistic, or it's too atheistic - and probably it turns out there is a God, who doesn't want this picture made.\" I did get the sense of atheism. In movies, there IS an omniscient being who observes everything and demands moral closure; that is, the viewer. In real life, Allen posits, there is no such guiding force, and crime doesn't always get punished. While I did appreciate this style of cinematic revisionism, I think I prefer the blunter 'Match Point,' in which the noirish crime story was the main attraction. You can't really fault anyone's efforts here, though. Allen, Landau, and Alan Alda \u2013 as an amusingly egotistical television producer \u2013 are all excellent, the jazz and classical soundtrack is a lot of fun, and the photography of Sven Nykvist (favourite of Ingmar Bergman) is nicely low-key and subdued.",

Every time I watch it I end up pondering my own sense of morality, my questions about whether there is truly justice in the world, and the extent to which good people do bad things. And yet, along with all those heavy ideas, this is also entertaining, witty, and occasionally very tense story-telling of the first order.For me it's second only to 'Annie Hall' amongst Allen's huge body of work, and stands as one of the few truly great films of the 1980s.",

Make no mistake, there's plenty to laugh at, with Allen himself in fine form playing a struggling documentary filmmaker doing a reluctant portrait of his fluff TV producer brother-in-law (scene-stealing Alan Alda). But the comedian's trademark neurotic humor seems to have been added almost as an afterthought, to counterpoint (and provide some much needed comic relief from) the heavier companion plot, in which agnostic ophthalmologist Martin Landau finds himself unable to avoid the all-seeing eyes of God after taking drastic measures to escape his insecure, possessive mistress. Altogether it's a peculiar but memorable blend of pessimism and hope, with the darker dramatic elements overshadowing the one-liners. The ensemble cast is (for once in a Woody Allen feature) more than just a parade of familiar faces, and ace cinematographer Sven Nykvist provides the luminous sunset hues which, depending on the particular scene, can appear either romantic or chilling.",

It had all the elements that I look for in a movie and there isn't another Woody Allen movie that I really have ever thought that highly of truth be told.I will say that while there were some priceless comedic moments to this, it was awfully hard to watch at times as well, particularly the matter of fact way the possibility of the murder is discussed. Somehow I had a harder time watching that element probably because it was a supposed \"average everyday guy\" who was planning it. For me seeing psychos do crazy things on film maybe easier then someone who could be a friend or neighbor next door. But that is also why this was so good. It was a character study that's so real because the movie feels like it's really happening. There's nothing implausible about it, even though I had a hard time, as mentioned with parts of it.I really want to see this again to see if I like it as much a second time.

            "content": "A Woody Allen comedy/drama. One story is drama, the other typical Woody Allen stuff. The drama part is seriously hampered by that nepotist monster Angelica Houston; not only is she as ugly as ever, but her acting is very unconvincing and therefore in stark contrast to Martin Landau's, whose lover she plays. Fortunately, Landau's character's brother arranges to have her bumped off, so the viewer is spared the ugly sight of her for the second half of the picture.More about this: 1) she met Landau while working as a stewardess. A stewardess?! Her? Give me a break. What kind of an airline was this; \"Monster Airlines\"? 2) Landau's character would actually cheat on his wife, played by Claire Bloom - a good-looking woman, with whom he has a great marriage on top of that? He'd cheat with Huston??!!! \"I'm getting a little bored with Claire Bloom, so I think I'll start an affair with one of those lame-looking \"Monster Airlines\" stewardesses.\" I don't think so.The other nepotist factor that made me unsure about watching this film is Alan Alda, who plays a talkative, egocentric-but-friendly TV producer in the comedy half of the movie. Now, unlike Angelica Houston Alda doesn't screw up the acting part, and is sure as hell better-looking than her (which shouldn't be difficult for ANY person, regardless of sex). Nevertheless, it has to be mentioned that the only reason why Alda doesn't screw up is because his role was a well-written one and one which was obviously fun to do. Also, another actor would have stolen the show with that role; someone like Steve Martin, Bill Murray, John Turturro, Dustin Hoffman or Jack Nicholson. Any of these guys would have made a great part out of that role.Woody Allen ought to pick out his cast a little less out of the talentless pool of nepotism and more from the pool of real actors. This has particularly been a problem in his movies since the 90s. Otherwise the film is interesting, with funny moments - though not as many as in some other of his films (this one's more drama anyway) - and with the usual accurate and consistent characterization typical of Woody Allen's movies. Allen's jealousy and resentment of and towards Alda is very cleverly scripted and played out.",

Basically this film sees two main characters and their stories set in New York City, that of successful ophthalmologist and respectable family man Judah Rosenthal (Oscar nominated Martin Landau) who is having an affair, and small-time filmmaker Clifford 'Cliff' Stern (Woody Allen) who is trying to make a feature documentary. Judah has been having an affair with flight attendant Dolores Paley (BAFTA nominated Anjelica Huston), but he does not want to leave his wife Miriam (Claire Bloom) or end the marriage, and his mistress is threatening to reveal the affair to his wife if he doesn't do something soon, she even writes a letter for the wife that he manages to find and burn. Cliff has been hired by successful television producer, and his pompous brother-in-law Lester (MASH's BAFTA nominated Alan Alda) to make a documentary on his life, despite the fact that Cliff despises him, but he does continue with it because he falls in love with Halley Reed (Mia Farrow),Lester's associate producer. Judah does get some advice from rabbi patient Ben (Sam Waterston), who is losing his eye sight, about talking to his wife about the affair, and his financial problems, but he does not want to go with this option, so he turns his brother Jack (Jerry Orbach) for a solution, and he gives him the option to hire a hit-man to kill Dolores. For a while he is reluctant at the idea of hiring someone to murder his mistress, but he does go with this plan, and he quickly retrieves incriminating things from her corpse before it is found by the authorities to cover his tracks, but slowly over time his guilty conscience overtakes him, and he grows to believe God is watching him. Cliff is trying to continue his marriage to Lester's sister Wendy (Joanna Gleason), but it is obvious that any passion between them has faded, and to woo Halley he shows his documentary about philosopher Professor Louis Levy (Martin S. Bergmann), which he is continuing to try and finish, and he admits he is only helping Lester for the money so he can finish his own work. Cliff's dislike for Lester is made obvious when the film he has made includes the producer being aggressive, but he then finds out that Professor Levy has committed suicide, and worse is when Halley says she is not ready for a romance with him and she leaves for London, and when she returns he is devastated that she and Lester are engaged. The final scene sees Judah and Cliff coincidentally meet the wedding of rabbi Ben's daughter, Cliff's brother-in-law and Judah's patient, the ophthalmologist has got over his guilt with the murder being blamed on a drifter, and the small-time filmmaker agrees that any crisis will pass over time. Also starring Broken Flowers' Frances Conroy as House Owner, Nora Ephron as Wedding Guest and Daryl Hannah as Lisa Crosley. Landau gives a great performance as the man who will do almost anything to keep his life in order but develops high worries after his actions, Allen as usual makes most of the laughs with his whiny voice, sarcastic remarks and cynical opinions on life, and supporting members of the cast all add something, the script is wonderfully punchy and has all the ingredients to make you laugh, but also intrigue you, it is definitely a must see comedy drama. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. Very good!",

            "content": "Woody Allen is the proverbial pessimistic of the last fifty years, constantly making films that challenge and question many of the basic ideas and foundations we live by through tragedy and humor. In this film, he brings the two elements together, creating two similar story lines that come together and paint a viciously sardonic, dark and mostly realistic portrayal of life as a human being.In the tragic plot, Martin Landau is brilliant as Judah, a well-respected and successful ophthalmologist whose life is threatened by his volatile mistress (Angelica Huston) and considers the ultimate and worst option. Meanwhile, Allen plays Cliff Stern, a documentary filmmaker infatuated with one of his producers (Mia Farrow) and trying to keep her from the brother-in-law he so envies (Alan Alda). Each story has moments that make you perk up and pay attention and Allen uses his skill as a writer to entice and bring the audience into the world in which he has created; a world where everything is questioned and there are no clear, definite answers.There are many who dislike this film and all of Woody Allen even because of the constant pessimism. Yet, could it be that it is really pure observation? Allen has always had a dark streak to his comedy, even in something as zany and ludicrous as Sleeper or Love and Death. Here, he disguises much of the downbeat material with sophistication, wit and intelligence as well as some flat-out funny lines only he could produce. The film has many references to great artists such as Bergman and Chekov, but Allen still makes it his own style and vision. This is such a remarkable and intellectual film that at first glance it may penetrate too close to home for some and simply go over the heads of others.Whatever your initial reaction is, don't simply write it off as Woody Allen complaining about life. Sure there are problems, but there is also much to be admired. The acting, writing, cinematography and direction are all top-notch and there is always a penetrating question deep-down that maybe, perhaps life is not as jolly, optimistic or clear-cut as we would like or hope it would be.",

The second tale is a bittersweet and funny love story about a man (Woody Allen) unhappily married who is forced to do a documentary on an egotistical star (Alan Alda!). While doing it he meets a sweet woman (Mia Farrow) and falls for her--but so does Alda.I vaguely remember seeing this in 1989 and being severely depressed. It's still depressing now--and not very good. The shifts in tone from dead serious drama to comedy are jarring throughout. They don't mix together well at all. To make matters worse there's nothing new or interesting here. These stories and their outcomes have been done before...and better. The irony in these stories is applied with sledgehammer subtlety and gets annoying real quick. Allen was still trying to be Ingmar Bergman when he did this and it doesn't work.On the plus side it is very well-acted. No one is real bad but Landau is superb in his role (and was Oscar nominated) and Jerry Orbach shines in a small part.

Judah is a seemingly happily married doctor who faces a dark dilemma after his mistress(Anjelica Huston) threatens to tell his wife of their affair.I started off ify about the film, do to it's similarity to Match Point. But as it continued, I kept falling for it. The performance from Martin Landau really steals the show here. You're not sure whether to care about him or not, and thats sort of what lures the viewer to keep watching him. Like Match Point, C and M goes down a road that you definitely don't expect... or do you? I sort of saw it coming because I suppose that is the way Allen's imagination works in both this and that. But I was still hooked. Especially in the last twenty minutes.Crimes and Misdemeanors is light and dark, funny and thrilling, and just another great Woody Allen movie. He works wonders with Crimes and Misdemeanors like you've seen him work wonders with Annie Hall, Hannah and her sisters, and just endless films.Allen always teaches us lessons, and he always gives the characters the justice they deserve. Crimes and Misdemeanors is flat out one of Woody's best films. It's up there with Match Point, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Sweet and lowdown, and The Purple Rose of Cairo. Allen is timeless. And so is Crimes and Misdemeanors.A",

            "content": "CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS is a Woody Allen film I resisted seeing (not a big Allen fan) until now, but I found it thoroughly absorbing and full of interesting performances, structurally different because it tells two separate stories which become even more interesting when the two worlds collide. The one brought three Oscar nominations, no wins, but it was a commercial success.Not surprisingly Allen deals with moral ambiguities--a happily married man (MARTIN LANDAU) has to cope with an overly emotional, unstable and vindictive mistress (ANGELICA HUSTON), while trying to keep his marriage to CLAIRE BLOOM intact.WOODY ALLEN has to deal with an obnoxious brother-in-law (ALAN ALDA) with lots of money and an outsized ego, who offers him the job of producing a video biography of his day to day activities, a job Allen is reluctant to take.Allen has more success in developing the comedy aspects with the Alan Alda sequences than he does with the bitter exchanges between Landau and Huston, who is downright annoying in her role as a clinging ex-lover. \"I like mental stimulation,\" Alda tells MIA FARROW. \"Have you tried shock therapy?\" she shoots back.How Allen will cope with his crumbling marriage and Landau will solve the problem of a nagging mistress--including a confidential talk with his gangster brother JERRY ORBACH who can only offer one solution--is the gist of the story. \"Are you suggesting I get rid of her?\" he asks his brother incredulously.The uneven mixture of two stories--one serious, the other funny--doesn't always mesh the way Allen intended them to. Basically, the story is a serious examination of the inner conflicts of owning up to one's sins.While all the performances are beyond reproach, there's something ultimately unsatisfying about the whole piece. \"God is a luxury I can't afford,\" says Landau at one point. \"I will not be destroyed by this neurotic woman.\" Whatever, it's Allen's own philosophy of life that he puts on screen through his oddly interesting characters. Some will find a lot of self-revelation in the scenes he has with MIA FARROW, with whom he shares a passion for attending afternoon movies while munching on candy.Summing up: Despite the themes, don't expect anything deep or too heavy. It moves at a reasonable clip but is certainly not one of Allen's best relationship comedy/dramas. The friction between Landau and Huston seems too forced at times to be natural, overplayed as it is.",

            "content": "Crimes and Misdemeanors was a film that took a little while to get going for me, but it's turned out to be a true grower. Not only did I feel it got better as it went along, but as I reflect on it I find myself admiring it more and more. At first I greatly disliked all of the characters and I didn't think there was anything going on interesting enough to get past that. I thought that the stories of Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau) and Cliff Stern (Woody Allen) were too loosely connected and too different in tone, and it drew me out of the experience whenever we crossed paths, along with finding myself much more interested in Judah's story than I was Cliff's.However, as things progressed and the two became more closely connected, I found myself much more fascinated by how things were turning out. Allen does an interesting thing in his writing here; most writers would have the two characters meet and connect the stories that way, but instead he connects them thematically and I think it works brilliantly. Cliff finds himself focusing on trying to make a documentary about a professor, and in watching clips of this man speaking, the themes of life and love that are presented in Cliff's story add another layer to what is going on in Judah's. The storyline with Judah is surely the emphasis of the film (Allen himself has even admitted that he wished he hadn't written the story with his character), but I think these insightful moments with Cliff add a lot more weight to everything going on with Judah.I always find myself having a hard time caring about adulterers and that was true at the beginning of this film, but as Judah was fleshed out more I found myself caring for him in an interesting way. I credit this almost entirely to Landau's performance, which is one of my favorites of any Woody Allen film. His work here is internal and deeply emotive, without finding the need to shed a tear or exaggerate any emotion. You can just feel in his brilliantly written dialogue the weight of guilt and remorse that consumes this character.In classic Allen fashion, there's never a need to turn things into theatrical displays of emotion, but instead he relies solely on Landau's ability to portray these feelings and it pays off completely. A lot of the themes of the piece rely on Landau's performance here and he carries it all without a hitch. There's a scene with him sitting in front of his fireplace and just running through a monologue with himself that really floored me. I was a little shaky on this at first, but it brought itself together in such a fantastic way that made it all worthwhile.",

            "content": "Though most Woody-philes consider ANNIE HALL to be his masterpiece, I have to go with CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, the caustic and brilliant 1989 comedy drama about the ambiguity of the moral choices we has humans must make and the consequences of said choices. This beautifully mounted films tells two different stories that initially seem to have nothing to do with each other.but Woody's genius as a writer does eventually bring the two stories together. One story stars Martin Landau as a wealthy opthamologist who finds his comfortable life threatened when his mistress of his two years (Anjelica Huston) begins making loud noises about going to his wife (the lovely Claire Bloom) about their affair and some financial misdeeds she also has knowledge of. Feeling he has no other choice, Landau turns to his mob-connected brother (the late Jerry Orbach) for assistance in handling the problem. The other story finds Woody as a financially strapped documentary filmmaker who agrees to shoot a sort of \"cinema verite'\" about his brother-in-law, an obnoxious, egomaniacal television star/producer(Alan Alda, in one of his best performances) while, in the process, falls for one of Alda's producers (Mia Farrow). The story fascinates as we watch the effect the choices these characters make and how the consequences of said choices slap them in the face. The only physical linking between the two stories is the character of a rabbi with failing eyesight, played by Sam Waterston, who is Woody's other brother-in-law and Landau's best friend and moral barometer. Allen won Oscars for his screenplays for ANNIE HALL and HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, but I think his work here trumps both of those scripts...an incisive and funny story with smart and haunting dialogue. The performances are superb right down the line with standout work from Landau, who received a richly deserved Oscar nomination for his tortured Judah, the man haunted by his choices and Alda, playing one of the most unlikeable characters I've seen in films in quite awhile. Anjelica Huston seems a little too mature and intelligent a presence for her role, but she somehow makes the character vulnerable and believable. Mention should also be made of Joanna Gleason and Caroline Aaron who appear as Woody's wife and sister, respectively. In a word, a masterpiece that is a must for budding Woody-philes and for anyone studying the art of screen writing.",

Allen insinuates here what is to come: To Farrow: ...\"I want to film conversation, nothing funny just reality\"... .Looking back, he was not given enough credit for his insight. I have always loved \"Annie Hall\", \"Hannah and Her Sisters\", and his early 80's films. This deserves a second look. It is timely and perceptive without being trite.What is interesting about Allen is that he, above all, creates real people in film. Farrow becomes the frustrated film-maker ex-lawyer; Landau really is the NY doctor, successful but dubious; Sam Waterston really seems to be the Rabbi, losing his sight.There are few films today which have this resonance. Only a decent movie can make a critic remember it; a brilliant film maker can record insights which are memorable 15 years later. Speaking as a critic who sees many films, I can state that I have seen this film three times; the first was over 15 yrs ago, and I still remember the audience, and the positive comments it received. 10/10.",

            "review_title": "Allen's dark, \"Bergman-like\" character study.",
            "content": "Despite what another commentator has said, it remains untrue that Allen only discovered Bergman after the \"early funny ones\" and thus, flippantly decided to be profound. Long-term aficionados of the director will know that he was indulging in homage to the likes of Bergman, Godard and Fellini as far back as Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, Sleeper, and Love & Death. However, whereas those films took certain elements from European cinema and turned them into satire, Allen would eventually begin to explore his own serious side with films like Interiors, Stardust Memories, Another Woman and September, before finally perfected his new found style with this glorious and morally oblique modern-masterpiece.Crimes and Misdemeanours is a film that manages to move gracefully between two very different (though ultimately, very serious) stories, whilst simultaneously juggling a tone that is both light and humours, but also bleak and profound. By focusing on two different characters, Allen is able to bring us into the film slowly... it is to his credit as a filmmaker that he is able to pull off the subtle shifts in style, creating a mood in one scene that is vague and philosophical, before cutting to something that seems much more frivolous. The serious moments never seem pretentious and the lighter moments are never forced, with Allen making great use of his persona as the slightly neurotic lovable loser at odds with the world around him, as he's hired by his brother-in-law (a pompous TV producer) to direct a flattering documentary portrait of the man and his work. The second arc of the story, the one that really presents the moral centre of the film, focuses on a wealthy ophthalmologist (brilliantly played by Martin Landau), faced with some serious questions of faith, as well as various ethical decisions, when a spurned lover begins to make his life very complicated.Allen juggles between the stories perfectly, having each disparate tale somehow reflect subtly on the other one, creating in the process, an effortless back and forth. As well as the subtle foreshadowing's there are also more intelligent cinematic devices being used, as Allen creates a subplot in which his character Cliff is also working on a documentary about an ailing professor who, on occasion, can be glimpsed in the background on Cliff's editing monitor discussing the broader philosophical aspects of life, love and death. These snippets of philosophical discourse also, subtly, pass comment on the actions depicted in the film, creating a further layer of self-reference that can also be seen in the films that Allen's character watches during his down-time. Once again, Allen doesn't allow these devices to overwhelm the story or push things into the realms of overt-intellectual masturbation, but instead, merely compliments the two stories, adding further layers for the audience to pick through and also giving further emotional and psychological weight to that fantastically low-key ending.As great as the writing and the performances are, it is in his role as filmmaker in which Allen truly impresses with this film... managing to take his fondness for Bergman and, for once, develop it into his own personal style of film-making. Therefore, it's less self-conscious than Another Woman, and even with the influence of Bergman evident in his use of legendary Swedish cinematographer Sven Nyvist, this still feels like a Woody Allen film, even managing to prefigure the style of Husbands and Wives and Bullets Over Broadway. Every nuance of the film, from the casting, to the lighting and composition, the editing and the choice of music is perfect, with Allen managing to create a great atmosphere of loss and isolation for his characters to fall into.Though it is Allen and Landau that represent the moral centre of the film, there are also some impeccably nuanced performances from supporting players. Alan Alda, as Cliff's self-important brother-in-law Lester offers great comic-support, whilst Mia Farrow gives her second best performance in a Woody Allen film, following her great turn in the similarly brilliant Purple Rose of Cairo. There's also further support offered by Sam Waterston as the man of faith slowly loosing his sight, Jerry Orbach as Landau's mobster brother, Joanna Gleason as Cliff's long-suffering wife (and Lester's favourite sister) Wendy, and Angelica Huston as the woman scorned. If I had to pick out one flaw with this film, I'd say that Huston's character is a little annoying, falling into the occasional Allen trap of being far too needy and obnoxious (the same can be said about Farrow's character in the later Husbands and Wives, or Dianne Keaton's role in Manhattan). This really is a mild criticism, though, with Huston trying her best to overcome her character's (admittedly quite necessary) shortcomings to give a strong and affecting performance.However, the film belongs to Landau and Allen, with the former giving perhaps the best performance of his career and the latter proving himself to be (once and for all) the greatest American filmmaker of his generation. Crimes and Misdemeanours is really a perfect film (for me), and along with Love and Death, Annie Hall, Purple Rose of Cairo and Bullets Over Broadway, gives further proof of Allen's cinematic genius.",

            "content": "Its only competition, IMO, are Annie Hall and the underrated Husbands and Wives. Crimes and Misdemeanors is most notable for its rather original narrative structure: there are two plots that have only the most tenuous connections. The first has Martin Landau as a prominent ophthamologist trying to break off an affair without harming his rather happy marital relationship. The woman, played by Anjelica Huston, is desperately in love with him and threatens him when he tries to leave. The other story involves a documentary filmmaker (Woody Allen) falling in love with his producer (Mia Farrow) while he is making a film about his rich-as-hell, television producer brother-in-law (Alan Alda). The first plot is a melodrama, the second a comedy. Allen has made plenty of films in both sections, but here he mixes them in a perfect balance. We get one chapter of the Landau story, one of Woody's, and then on and on until they meet (for the first time) in a final setpiece. The structure isn't 100% unique, though - I'm almost positive Woody got it from the William Faulkner novel Wild Palms (aka If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem). The themes of the film are the ever-present ones of Woody's career, but, as always, they're fascinating. The film is entirely dramatically effective. It blew me away, quite frankly.\nMINOR SPOILERThere are also a ton of great lines, as is usual for a Woody Allen movie.

            "content": "If one is going to merge two short films together, one should at least establish stronger links between them (a tenuous one in the form of a blind Rabbi simply does not suffice). Yet Woody Allen is evidently content with the near-terminal drudgery of his screenplay as he directs his duel tale of existentialist infidelity and Jewish despondency.To give you a brief overview of these stories, half of the film follows the catastrophic developments of affluent ophthalmologist Judah Rosenthal's (Martin Landau) affair with emotionally volatile stewardess Dolores Paley (Angelica Huston). Dolores wants Judah to annul his marriage to the blissfully ignorant Miriam (Claire Bloom), but Judah is not too keen on the prospect. Unfortunately, Paley is not too keen either on the prospect of Judah just discarding her like a Mark Twain novel and decides to put pressure on her lover. This proves to be an unacuminous move on her part as Judah recruits his brother to annul her metabolic processes. It works, but Judah ends up having moral reservations over the murder. The other half of the film depicts the HI-larious trials and tribulations of frustrated filmmaker Clifford Stern (Woody Allen) as he is forced by his disenchanted wife (Joanna Gleason) to direct a documentary about his successful and impossibly obnoxious brother-in-law Lester (a very amusing Alan Alda). However, Clifford is bewitched by one of the film's producers, a woman named Halley Reed (Mia Farrow).The film, of course, ends with the separate protagonists meeting by happenstance at a wedding reception and engaging in a pseudo- philosophical discussion about the nature of guilt and the unfairness of the universe. And, Allen, of course, has to telegraph his nihilistic leanings by having amoral cad Judah 'walk off into the sunset', as it were, and Lilliputian moralist Clifford look morosely into the camera. An Oscar nominated script, people!It just defies believe that the screenplay for this film was actually nominated for an Academy Award. How exactly can great Gordian farces like 'Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)', 'Kind Hearts and Coronets', 'Nuns on the Run', 'The Dinner Game', and 'Burn After Reading' be snubbed whilst blunderous trite like this gets a top mention? Now, I have always tried to respect the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their encouragement of higher technological and intellectual content in films, but really, the Academy is not doing themselves any favours by blindly bestowing Oscar nominations on venerated screenwriters just because they are venerated. It was bad enough that 'Raging Bull' lost to 'Ordinary People' for Best Picture in 1981 and that 'Miller's Crossing' was all but entirely snubbed during the 1991 Oscars.Thankfully, Woody Allen's sophisticated and intermittently acerbic wit prevents the task of viewing this film from falling into a level of internal haemorrhage inducement. The acting is generally passable, too. And, to Allen's credit, he did make a penance for his sins with 2005's 'Match Point', a true Hitchcockian triumph whose screenplay was deservingly nominated for an Oscar.",

He is faced with a debilitating dilemma ... he has been having an affair with a younger woman for the past couple of years (Anjelica Huston), and now he is wanting to end the relationship, but the devastated woman will have none of it and constantly threatens to tell his wife and botch up the perfect lifestyle Landau has made for himself. He has a crooked brother (Jerry Orbach) who is in the business of taking cash to arrange \"quick solutions\" to such situations, and Landau has to decide whether or not he can resort to having his lover murdered to get himself out of a jam.There is a second parallel story featuring Woody Allen as a filmmaker who's stuck in a meaningless marriage, and who is pushed by his wife into making a cheesy documentary about his self-serving brother-in-law (Alan Alda), who happens to be a successful and stuck-up jerk that Allen cannot stomach. Mia Farrow plays an assistant on the project who Woody falls in love with and would like to leave his wife for, but Alda's wealth and fame also threatens to sway Farrow away from him.Without hesitation I consider this one of the greatest movies Woody Allen has made. Martin Landau takes chief acting honors, but all the other players are also good in their parts, and Allen himself is less of a paranoid nerd than we're accustomed to, which also works well. There isn't that much comedy in this film, but what little there is of it works well and is funny (Allen's repulsed reaction to what happens to his sister, and some funny lines from Woody which are among his better ones). Both stories hold our interest throughout, though it's a compliment in this viewer's eyes to say that the Landau story is even more interesting than the Allen one, though both sort of come together in a satisfactory end. This is a deeply themed examination of people's faiths, their religious convictions, and what type of sins a person can commit yet still face themselves in the mirror the next morning.

            "content": "As a big fan of Dostojewskij I found this movie very appealing. The stories main plot has many analogical elements to the novel \"Crime and Punishment\". Both deal with the topic of murder and the terror it inflicts on the mind. In both cases the murderer (direct/indirect, does not really matter)believe that they own the right to get rid of their victim. In the book the murderer kills twice the second woman only because she appeared at the scene of the first crime. That probably added to the amount of terror and might give an explanation why Allen's character who only killed once and through a killer might be able to live on without any punishment. In both cases the denial of god or any moral structure leads to their action. Both are haunted by terror afterwords and it seems their minds wont be able to rest unless they turn them in or inflict any other sort of punishment on themselves. As I already mentioned in the movies case time eventually releases some of the terror and the protagonist appears to be able to live on. But the end is left open, it is not unlikely to assume that Judas terror might return. Nevertheless the ending offered by Allen to me is even more negative than what is happening in the novel. Allen suggests that people can commit that sort of crime and at some stage go back to their old lives. Judas escape into the comforts of a god or heavenly system seem a rather pathetic move to me. To me there is no way that Juda believes in god. He idealizes the idea of forgiveness and is completely oblivious to the moral duty one carries at the same time. We recognize that he feels some sort of moral responsibility but it is weak enough for him to evade it. That such thing is possible and I don't doubt that it is possible is a truly depressing thought indeed. The other plot does not offer much consolation either. The plastic character of Laster \"wins\" in the end by getting Halley, instead of his \"opponent\" Cliff. That suggests that what really matters to become happy is not seeking for any kind of truth or a better understanding of the human condition but to leave all this as it is and make the best of it. Thus money, success, huge confidence, the ability to deny, greed, beauty on the surface and hedonism wins over respect for ones neighbor, deep love, recognizing predicaments, being aware of death, melancholy and many other things. These are only categories to illustrate I know there is many other things that conflict with one another. The story is a true tragedy but it was built in wonderful manner. To me it is Allen's second best movie, after \"Annie Hall\" which I prefer because it offers a more optimistic idea of life and love and because Diane Keaton is in it:) The humorist elements in the film made me laugh harder than in most of his other movies because they come up in a very problematic context. They sometimes open up the possibility that we are dealing with the comedy but to me it is clearly something like a tragedy. I am still undecided about the film's ending. My first reaction was a little disappointment because it appeared to be too corny. A movie that denies morals ends with a sort of moral statement? I reflected it and it gained more favor:) The voice over is basically just telling us whats going on in the reality suggested by the movie. Even though many people live without a judge and it is basically all a big contest most people seem to enjoy life in one form or the other. People achieve/find happiness and realize that is only momentarily but seek again and deliberately accept the depressing moments happiness is followed by. I don't really see why the voice over puts faith or hope in future generations. To me it is a rather cynical statement by the director",

            "content": "Woody Allen's \u0091Crimes and Misdemeanors' is a brilliant movie, which explores deep into our very existence. Its characters were cleverly designed and distinctively show us what their morals really are. The title of this film was ingeniously thought up by Allen and will make you ponder such questions as: What are the consequences of my actions? How far would I go to commit murder? Or is admitting to my \u0091misdemeanors' a more sensible line of reasoning? Judah Rosenthal is a respected, wealthy Eye doctor whose world begins to crumble around him when his mistress, Dolores Paley, threatens him with blackmail. Desperate and confused, he must decide whether he can face getting rid of her- permanently! As a comical balance to this chilling tragedy, Cliff Stern is an insecure film-maker who is about to tackle the hardest job of his life, filming a glowing tribute to the man he hates the most in the world \u0096 his famous, pompous, pretentious and slimy brother-in-law, Lester.  \u0091Crimes and Misdemeanors' is a cinematic masterpiece of Woody Allen's. He wrote a wonderful and inventive script, which is up-beat and interesting. Then for him to be able to star and direct the film, makes his efforts all the more astounding. Allen's attention to detail is excellent, with the story being funny, thrilling and suspenseful at various times. I like the many elements Allen has interweaved in it. One is the use of \u0091eyes', as many of its characters have glasses, feel like they are \u0091being watched', its main star is an \u0091Ophthalmologist', with another going blind. I feel Allen is trying to say that there is someone looking over us, in a bleak world. Many scenes also show the use of the Telephone. This part of the film is talking about communication. Some characters complain that they cannot get there message through, which is a lack of communication. This film also has many parts which show its characters to be either black or white, with some showing shades of grey. This proves that there are some good and bad characters in the film showing that have elements of both. Finally the use of \u0091a movie within a movie' is quite obvious here. We see a film being made or watched by Cliff many times.There are some fascinating characters in this film. Martin Landau received an academy award nomination for his most difficult role of Judah, which he performed beautifully. I like how he is torn by the guilt of living in two different worlds. His \u0091Crimes and Misdemeanors' certainly make him very uncomfortable. Yet on the surface Judah does not seem like such a bad guy. However his brother Jack (Jerry Orbach) is a cold man, who has a much better sense of reality, and does not suffer from any sort guilt via his actions. Judah's Mistress is the flight attendant Dolores Paley (Angelica Houston). The struggle that she has to go through for the man she loves is a very strong part of the film.Then you have Allen's sorry character of Cliff, whose life is so depressing, that you really feel sorry for him. I love his line of \u0091The last time I was inside a woman was when I visited the statue of liberty'. He hates his brother in law, Lester (Alan Alda), whose part in this movie was great. Cliff is falling deeply in love with the attractive production assistant Halley Reed (Mia Farrow). Another important character is the Rabbi Ben (Sam Waterston). With him going blind being of great significance to the story, as it shows how blind the other cast members really are. He says to Judah in reference to murder, \u0091could you sleep with that?'There are some great scenes in \u0091Crimes and Misdemeanors'. I like how the movie starts, showing how great a person Judah Rosenthal is. Then the clever use of flashbacks is a great way to show what the story is all about. We see how far Judah will go to stop his wife from finding out that he is being unfaithful. I also like the flashback which shows Judah and Dolores on the beach. They are talking very sweetly, she even hears hints of marriage. The scene showing Judah returning to his childhood home is brilliant, as he realises that he has done a terrible thing. All of the scenes involving Lester are very humorous. I like how we see the final cut of his \u0091documentary', as Cliff gets his revenge on his brother-in-law, in very funny way. The final scenes, between Cliff and Judah at the wedding reception are of the finest quality. When Cliff says \u0091I am plotting a murder', you can see how these two characters lives seem almost the same. It is the perfect conclusion to a great movie.Although \u0091Crimes and Misdemeanors' might not be a \u0091big-budget' production, with dazzling special effects, it is a film which shows us just why we watch movies, with an intricate story, subtle uses of comedy and impressive cast. However, it also gives its audience a chance to understand themselves just a little bit more. It is a film which is very much about choice. I think its message is \u0091it is how we handle the outcome of our choices, which determines what sort of person we turn out to be.' I like it for other reasons as well. It distinctively shows us how bad our \u0091sinful' nature can be. My family has gone through a similar crisis as what Judah's family could have. While I found it hard to accept that one of my parents could be unfaithful to the other or their family, I feel lucky that we did not have to go through the nonsense that Judah did. I know when I am in a loving relationship, I will be careful not to fall into the trap of being \u0091deceitful' to my partner, like many people have and still continue to do.CMRS gives \u0091Crimes and Misdemeanors': 5 (Brilliant Film)",

            "content": "I've been in love with Woody Allen for a long time. When I was 13, I watched Annie Hall because I simply had to see the film that beat out my beloved Star Wars for Best Picture in 1977. It absolutely blew me away - it was funny, very funny, and also a little dark. The following year, Bullets Over Broadway came out and I was hooked.I've seen most of Allen's work and find most of it fantastic. Initially, though, I didn't like Crimes and Misdemeanors. This probably occurred because I saw it as a 10 year old, shortly afterit came out. It bored me. Why not? It was incredibly dark and really not like any comedies I'd ever seen. So, I never returned to it. This fall, I saw it in my local library and thought I'd take it out. My friends, J&J, had very different opinions on the film. One J called it awful, the other his favorite Allen film. I watched and agreed with the second J, for, I will always consider Crimes and Misdemeanors one of my two favorite Woody Allen films (depending on where the wind's blowing, I might respond with Manhattan when asked for my favorite of his films). Be warned, though, it's a dark masterpiece and misanthropic too. While Deconstructing Harry reveled in Allen's self-contempt, Crimes chronicles his disgust with humanity. It's one of the few films I know to end on such a down note, nary a glimmer of sun light to be found. Yet, in its own misanthropist, the film becomes funny. It's so dark, so rife with pessimism, that that single-mindedness is humorous. Was that the intention of Woody? Who knows or cares.The acting is also brilliant on all levels. Woody is great, as are Mia Farrow and Alan Alda (so slimy). Best of all, though, is Martin Landau who lends humanity to an otherwise horrible man. Though not as good as his representation of Lugosi in Ed Wood, Landau is brilliant here as well. I find this a fantastic film and recommend it to those who like dark humor and Deconstructing Harry (those who reviled that film may want to steer clear of this one as well). Woody-philes, though, should not avoid it simply because it's more serious than his other work; it should in fact re-affirm your faith in the man, allowing you to realize he has more talent than he sometimes lets on.",

Most of it is the same piece over and over again.  But C&M is a great movie that has some truly interesting things to say about life.  The most interesting element of the film is the irony that is painted when the good are punished and the wicked seem to be rewarded.  That is good writing, especially coming from Allen.What is also amazing about the film is Martin Landau.  He carries the film. He is basically a good man with one small weakness..... that will be left up to you the viewer to find out what that is.All in all this is a terrific effort from Allen, it's too bad he has to make crap most of the time because this film proves he is a talent.",

This was reportedly one of his darker, more serious films, so I decided to try it. The film tells the stories of Cliff (Woody Allen) and Judah (Martin Landau); the stories don't really intertwine, except thematically, but for a meeting between Cliff and Judah at the finale. The film was clearly constructed by Allen to explore the nature of ethics, especially religion versus existentialism. These issues are most provocatively explored in Judah's plot, anchored by Martin Landau's superb performance (it's easy to see that Oscar nomination being earned). Cliff's plot is more tragicomic in nature, providing a bit of light amidst the dark. The film's conclusions are particularly nihilist; Judah knowingly comments that people wanting a happy ending should see a Hollywood movie. I don't particularly agree with Allen's conclusions, but it's a lot to contemplate. The cast is superb, with Allen regulars like Mia Farrow and Alan Alda (and Allen himself), and talents like Landau, Joanna Gleason, Sam Waterson, and Jerry Orbach (RIP, Jerry; you will be missed). I give \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" a 10/10.",

THEN go back and see some of the others you've ignored, such as \"Deconstructing Harry\", \"Husbands and Wives\" and \"Interiors\". \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" has a great, flip-flop structure that bounces between the humorous and the humorless, the silly and the pathetic, the shallow and the profound. Acting by all is wonderful, the photography (by Sven Nykvist) is innovative, interesting, and voyeuristic. This is a film about Choices, and living with them.

Or maybe I should say \"semi-serious\", because it's actually built like a mix of two movies - one is totally serious and \"heavy\" and the other one is very funny, but both deal with very serious issues. Like in \"Husbands and Wives\", Allen gives very interesting and sincere views over life and the relations between people. I especially like Cliff's relation with his niece (which, if you wondered, is totally non-sexual - as oppose to the relation with Rain in \"Husbands\"). And the tense relation between Judah and his brother is \"brutally\" honest. This is probably Martin Landau's best performance after \"Ed Wood\", and the rest of the cast is full of excellent actors: Allen himself, Anjelica Huston, Mia Farrow, Alan Alda, Caroline Aaron, Jerry Orbach, Martin Bergmann (as Professor Levy) and more.

Woody Allen, in one of his comic gravedigger roles, plays an unsuccessful man whose longing for tranquility in the bedroom is ultimately resolved only by his child-like love of movies. Plot and subplot -- reality and fantasy -- neatly cross and veer in opposite directions.Allen the scriptwriter here is outstanding even if, by 1989, Allen the on screen nebbish had become something of an outlier in his own movies. The ensemble Allen directs in Crimes and Misdemeanors is equally outstanding, especially Landau and Mia Farrow. The allusions to other movies and to music will keep cinephiles busy.

He can either come clean to his wife and jeopardize everything he has worked his entire life to accomplish or kill Dolores to rid himself of the problem. After several attempts to reason with her, he decides to make arrangements to have her killed. Was his cruel action morally justified? According to John Stuart Mill, morality is determined by the greatest happiness principle. In order words, morality is solely dependent on a simple arithmetic equation of net happiness. By killing Dolores and putting an end to her happiness, he was able to ensure the happiness of his entire family. The act of murder could be considered moral is this context. However, there is an alternative way to view Judah's action. Putting her to death riddled him with guilt, and therefore took away his happiness. Furthermore, due to his guilt, he was a shell of the man he once was. This also sacrificed the happiness of his family, because they could no longer enjoy his company and were constantly concerned with what caused his dramatic change in behavior. Even though he seemed to have dealt with his guilt at the end of the movie, it was ambiguous whether or not he was truly happy.Immanuel Kant proposes an alternative concept of morality. According to Kant, morality has nothing to do with the consequences of an action. The key principle of Kant's argument is the categorical imperative. This states that one should never act in a way that he/she would not will to be a universal law. Therefore, Dr. Judah's decision to have Dolores put to death was in no way moral, regardless of the consequences. He should not kill, because he does will murder to be a universal law.",

            "content": "This movie asks important ethical questions about the duties of citizens living in a community. From a Utilitarian perspective the actions of Dr. Rosenthal were permissible and perhaps even obligatory. He protected his family from the consequences of his affair and managed to secure and even promote their own happiness. His daughter was getting married soon, and his marriage was doing quite well. But even he questioned the morality of his own actions, and we instinctively condemn him as acting in a purely selfish manner. What does this say about the credibility of Utilitarianism and its ability to answer moral questions if it seems at odds with our common sense and instinct to protect human life? Kant would argue using the categorical imperative that his actions were morally and unequivocally wrong. Which is much closer to our own instinctual reaction. If everyone were free to kill another (or even obliged in some cases) in order to protect oneself from the consequences of our previous choices then there wouldn't be much of a society left. But perhaps many of us would do anything to protect our families, especially from our own morally questionable choices. Ultimately he is not held responsible for his affair, instead he commits another in order to cover it up, and he gets away with it as well. While he initially struggles to live with us actions he manages to rationalize it to himself. Perhaps he will be held responsible by a higher power, but he still sees his actions as necessary and not morally wrong. He's torn between his conscious and his life, including his daughter and marriage. Overall a very enjoyable movie. I do recommend you watch it.",

Ironically, in view what has been revealed of Allen's amoral lifestyle, this is a drop-dead serious investigation of the weightiest moral issues. Is there a moral order? Is there divine justice? Is earthly justice attainable? Is God all-seeing, just, &/or uncaring? Is there meaning in life and history, or is it all pointless? Deeply layered, and with many instances of ironic contrast and rich symbolism, primarily revolving around sight and vision, the movie reveals itself at deeper and deeper levels with successive viewings. The contrasts:  Rosenthal's desire to cease his philandery and preserve his marriage against Cliff's desire to start an affair and break off his marriage; the rabbi going blind while maintaining his clear moral vision, while the ophtalmologist goes \"morally blind\"; the aged moral philosopher Dr. Levy, beloved subject of Cliff's film footage, committing suicide, while the execrable Lester, Cliff's other subject, flourishes, even winning the object of Cliff's desires. The absolutely bereft, stricken expression on Cliff's face as, at the ending party, he sees Lester with Halley gives the lie to the conventional wisdom that Allen can't act: the look wordlessly conveys his devastation. Martin Landau's superb performance reinforces his stature as one of our finest actors. Alan Alda is convincingly reptilian as Lester. My only criticism might be that the deadly serious tone of the Rosenthal half of the story does not lend itself to the comic embellishment of the contrasting Cliff story.

The performances by other cast members are perfect, although Mia Farrow doesn't do anything new here and Claire Bloom is underutilized.  Some of the symbolism is pretty heavy-handed, for a Woody Allen film (having the good rabbi go blind being the most obvious), but the film requires multiple viewings, just like his earlier masterworks.

There is so much that is wrong with this movie, and that is consistently wrong with Allen's attempts to pass himself off as a film artist.Most of the characters sound like Woody Allen.  With a few exceptions, he's not that good at writing dialog for varied voices.He doesn't know how to direct overlapping dialog.His music selections don't resonate; they sound gratuitous.*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***He wields weighty symbols like a baby scribbling in a book of poetry.  He fails to properly midwife those symbols and metaphors, and in that failure can't be excused for inconsistencies in the plot and story structure. Examples of the latter:  Judah pays to have his problem \"taken care of\", and probably pays a bit of a premium.  If that's the case, then why does he have to mop up after the job, his evidence-destroying session thinly veiled as an exercise in \"closure\"?  He should have asked for a discount!  The plot twist wherein Cliff Stern creates a total media lampoon of Lester while on payroll is so stupendously implausible that any humor payload is jettisoned.  It winds up feeling like \"poorly sublimated aggression\" (Freud)--an audio-visual hotfoot--which shouldn't sit well with sensitive viewers.  It's probably even a bit galling for viewers who sense that Woody is lampooning real-world success when he would appear to be a sort of beneficiary of undeserved real-world success.I was looking forward to seeing Claire Bloom act; she was utterly wasted.It's watchable, which is a miracle considering the fact that it was half-rewritten during production.  There's some interesting ensemble work, and a few zippy one-liners.  Professor Levy is well-written, well-directed, and well-acted.

Martin Landau plays a doctor with his own secrets, he engages in an affair and then attempts to take care of the problem. His brother is a mafioso who has one of the most memorable roles in any woody Allen film and has a great line that basically sums up this film. \"I can't afford to live in this world of mansions and pools, I live in the real world\" All in all, one of Allen's best films to date, complex, thought provoking and insightful",

            "content": "An elegantly balanced, probing film The story focuses on two men who are quite different, aside from the fact that they are both dissatisfied with their marriages. One is a successful ophthalmologist (Martin Landau), whose moral integrity is compromised when his mistress (Angelica Huston) threatens to disclose his marital and financial indiscretions. The other is a frustrated documentarian (Woody Allen), whose artistic integrity is compromised when he must make a documentary about his smug brother-in-law (Alan Alda) in order to finance another documentary about his favorite philosopher. The film grapples with a lot of big questions on the purpose of life, morality, and religion, but without the self-serving defensiveness of Manhattan or the sloppy \"Eh, whattaya gonna do\" attitude of Whatever Works. What makes it all work is the delicate balance established by the characters. Landau's self-control turns out to be the perfect antidote to Allen's jitteriness, and just when a scene feels too heavy we snap to a funny, lively scene with Allen. The unflinching realism of Landau's brother, played by Jerry Orbach, is countered by the unflinching optimism of a Rabbi and mutual acquaintance of the two leads, played Sam Waterston. Alda as a television producer who is perpetually pleased with himself\u0085well, first of all, he's just great. A recognizable character we can laugh at and love to hate. His amusing shallowness is relieved by the insightfulness of Professor Levy, whom Allen worships. There are other noteworthy characters as well, for the film is essentially a panorama of human lives, all New Yorkers who aren't quite sure what to make of life. What's the point of being good? Is there any value in religion? Is there anything worth pursuing besides money and success? Although conscious of film history \u2013 Allen's character is a film buff, and it brought to my mind Strangers on a Train \u2013 Crimes and Misdemeanors approaches these questions with a sense of un-Hollywood realism and befuddlement.",

While I enjoyed the fantasy sequences with Landau conversing with his deceased father, the final twenty minutes of this film had me laughing and crying at the same time...Lester's reactions to Cliff's \"documentary\" are priceless, and the closing dance to \"I'll Be Seeing You\" would leave a lump in anybody's throat. By the way, let's not forget the underrated performance of Jerry Orbach as the black sheep of the family--Orbach deserved an Oscar nomination as well.

But outside of that is only a very small faction that are \"Woody-ites\" who can delight in his style. I have never been one of them.Allen's approach of breezy conversation, small chuckles, and statements on life have never really done much to keep me awake. But lo and behold, stop them presses...somehow here he managed to appeal to the casual Woody viewer, and create at least one half of a tolerable movie. Who knew Woody could do \"Law & Order\" (with two of its stars in tow)??After much hem-hawing at the keyboard, I've decided to start with the good. That aspect focuses on a 50-something eye doctor who has found himself in an extra-marital situation he can't extract himself from. He can't reason with his paramour, but he also can't confess to his society wife. What options remain? Yep, he's ready to dial \"M\", with the aid of his brother (Orbach, in his usually reliable, understated form). Landau's inner tug-of-war and some pretty good criminal tension permeate the story very nicely.What this is intermingled with doesn't work as well. Woody writes himself yet another waify loser who hasn't had sex in a year with his doornail wife. Who comes to his heartstring's rescue yet again? Yep, Mia Farrow, always depicted as his (and all other men in the cast) be-all, end-all of available women in the mecca of New York. Here, he battles an enjoyable Alan Alda for her affections.Though I admired the obtuse storyline of mixing humor with homicide, that becomes the film's problem. We're so pulled in by Landau's situation, that when Allen cuts away from it, we could care less about the stale romance being played out on the other end. And again, Woody's idea of \"jokes\" to the average film goer only net titters and smiles.He does incorporate a few solid touches camera-wise, such as Landau actually interacting with a flashback from his past, and using push-ins only when necessary. And despite his slight side of the story, Woody manages to finish it with a little bit of a surprise as to who Farrow chooses.Even with enjoying his darker side of the film, it was odd to see him borrow from the mainstream, as the Landau/Huston side of the film is basically a take on \"Fatal Attraction\". Just minus the x-rated sex and bloody finale.So, take whatever you can from this Woody effort, possibly on a Sunday afternoon when nothing else is on. Or who knows, maybe you'll join \"the legion\".",

            "content": "This film is second only to Deconstructing Harry in the Allen canon, making it one of the most proficient films ever made by any director. The story of a man who finds that he has no choice but to kill his mistress is frighteningly convincing. It is as compulsively motivated as a Shakespeare play and the parallel with Othello is clear. The main inspiration, however, must have been Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. Allen indicates this with the title, just as he did with Love and Death, which was his version of War and Peace. In Dostoevsky's novel, Raskolnikov commits the perfect crime and then is so racked by his own guilt that he confesses to the policeman investigating the case. In Allen's version the murderer does not quite confess to the policeman and eventually gets away with the crime but the character played by Allen nods in the direction of Dostoevsky's ending Allen goes for his biggest themes yet in discussing the nature of right and wrong and whether or not there is a moral order to the universe. The Woody Allen sub-plot serves like the sub-plot of a Shakespearean drama to give light relief to the relentless drive of the main story. The two stories dovetail together beautifully in the final scene, where Judah and Cliff's paths cross for the first and only time.Perhaps it needs to be pointed out, in view of the above discussion that the film is also extremely funny, but it is Allen's darkest comedy ever. However it does contain one of his best one liners, the sexually frustrated Cliff complaining that the last time he was in a woman was when he visited the statue of libertyThis is one of the last films that Allen plays opposite his erstwhile partner Mia Farrow The usual Allen repertory company perform well with Angelica Houston very convincing as the woman that any man would have to kill. Only Claire Bloom looks uncomfortable, sleepwalking her way through an underwritten part as Judah's Stepford Wife.",

Recently, it has become our problem in the United States because we need to make more money to drive our own cars. No money, no drive! In the movie, the gas price is not a problem at all. The problem is that the protagonist and director (Woody Allen) searched for the meaning of righteousness and failed to find it. They thought it was too complex to explain the righteousness of God. Or they too easily simplified the meaning.Why does Ben suffer from eye problems and get blind later? He is a good person. Why does Jack seem to live a normal life even though he and his friend killed Dolores? That's the question I hear from people every day. And that's the problem I face every day. Why is God so quiet when I am in trouble? Why doesn't he look upon my needs? Even though we put God at the center of our lives, we face trouble, maybe more trouble after we become believers.The solution is not to kick the problems out of the world, but to endure and grow from the suffering experiences is the solution. I think that's why Ben didn't lose his faith after he lost his sight. Whether Allen intended it or not, I liked the fact that Ben was still faithful to God.Allen wants to show his view that people are not always punished for their evil deeds, but I think that there will be judgment when we face God during our life's journey or at the end of it. Judah and Jack will pay the price for what they have done. And I will pay the price for what I have done wrong.Like Allen, I search for the meaning of righteousness and life. I don't have a firm and concrete answer for it. But I have a firm belief that the Infinite has the answer.The high price of gasoline is a little problem I face. My job is not that I try to solve the problem, but it's that I get closer to the Infinite who has the true solution.",

Even though I don't really care for \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" the movie has moments of great insight such as the scene where Sam Waterston, Carrie Fisher and Dianne Wiest have to decide who gets dropped off first after their tour of the architecture of New York.  Then there's \"September\" and \"Another Woman\", two of his most least seen but underrated films, especially \"September\".But his crowning achievement is \"Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"  It nearly accomplishes all of his ideas and concepts of life, death and the meaning of it all with a nearly perfect balance between comedy and drama.  I say nearly because, like all great art, it's not a perfect movie.  Taken as a whole, it's a remarkably consistent, mature work.Sadly, nothing in the 90's or in the 00's has even come close and Mr. Allen is nearly on the verge of being irrelevant.I think that Ms. Farrow may have had something to do with Allen's great work during this period.  She appears to be a warm and generous person (albeit a little kooky and odd) and she may have provided him with some measure of comfort and stability which enabled or freed him to grow as an artist.Interestingly, since the debacle of his failed relationship with Farrow and the ensuing one with Ms. Previn, his work as faltered greatly.",

            "review_title": "Well Crafted",
            "content": "Possible minor spoilers, but not likely.Woody Allen displays an excellent narrative in this bilateral story.  The movie is about the problems which two separated characters experience in their life. Martin Landau is a wealthy, popular doctor, well liked by all, including his wife.  His character flaw resides in the fact that he has a mistress (Anjelica Huston), who is scheming to tell his wife of her husband's infidelity if their marriage is not broken up, as he had promised to her (Huston).  Landau's story deals with morality.  Not just the morality of having a mistress, but also the morality of his proposed way to quell the problems which she presents, followed by morality in the eyes of religion. This story is the brunt of the film, and Landau does a fantastic job acting.The second story is funnier than the first story, which has no comedy. Although not as dark as the Landau part, this story is the sadder of the two.  It involves Allen as a practically out of work documentary director/producer.  His wife's brother is a hot-shot TV producer (Alan Alda) who enlists Allen as his personal film-biographer.  Allen then falls for Mia Farrow, who somehow works with Alda.  She is a producer as well, or some colleague on the production side of the media.  However, Alda is also lusting for her, although Allen sees it as just lust, not love, and fears that she will choose Alda over him because of the former's looks, money, and power. Aside from a companion-less and love-lacking sister, Allen's biggest love is for his niece.  He provides a father and brother role for her.  This subplot was probably added in order to give his character some dimension. Allen's story is a complimentary opposite of Landau's dilemma.  He wants Farrow to love him with the same intense love which he has for her.  He realizes her passion for movies, which he also has, and her interest in a piece Allen is working on about a Jewish professor.  Allen and Farrow watch clips of this professor, which feature relevant discussions on morality, life, and death.The two stories intercede late in the film.  Landau's dark story meets Allen's sad story.  Yet in the end, both walk away with opposite reactions. Allen is downtrodden over failure, and his saddened and lonely future. The adage \"Better to have love and lost than to have never loved at all\" is thrashed.  Landau has an inner demon which seems to be dying weaker and weaker everyday, with the possibility of happiness in the future. However, happiness in this sense is an interesting condition.  Landau at the end of the film is happy.  He admits it.  However, his religion says that he should not be happy, and will not be happy.  For eternity.  Here, the proverb used in the movie \"The eyes of God are on us always\" is thrown to the floor, to be stepped on by Landau.The movie is very interesting.  These comments may be better read after seeing the movie, simply due to the inability for one to write down what happens on screen.  Allen crafted this movie fantastically.  The ending is its weakest part, albeit surprising, but it is how Allen wanted it. Originally, while editing, Allen wasn't happy with what he had, and put one third of what he had shot onto the cutting room floor.  He then proceeded to shoot more footage, and the result is the final product.This movie is very heavy, but is entertaining.  It can be taken in upon first viewing, but a second viewing a few weeks after the initial may well better serve the curious and intellectual viewer.  An interesting part is that there are no real noticeable flaws.  Allen's sister's problems may be the closest thing to one, simply because these don't carry the story, change it, or accelerate it.The film is a must for any movie enthusiast.  To miss this is to miss a fascinating look at modern morality (and also a scene which is pure homage to Bergman).  The subjects and themes in the movie aren't easy to write about, and Allen hit a bullseye with the screen play.  There may be a happy ending, and there may not.  And that goes for both protagonists.",

The characters are all pursuing happiness, but the way in which they do this differs dramatically. Dr. Judah Rosenthal has been having an affair with Dolores and she has decided to come clean to Miriam, Dr. Rosenthal's wife. When Dr. Rosenthal finds the confession letter written by Dolores, he wants to end the affair, but Dolores has high hopes that Judah will leave his wife and family on behalf of her. Now Judah is faced with the conflict of whether to come clean to his wife or just get rid of Dolores to make it seem as if the affair never happened. Because Judah was raised in a religious family, he knows what he has done is wrong but knows he could ask forgiveness of his family, even though they will be hurt. Jack, Judah's brother, says he can \"get rid\" of Dolores if Judah pays him. Judah sees more happiness in his life with his wife and children and provides the funds for his brother to kill Dolores, but is instantly wrought with guilt when the deed is done. Judah considers turning himself in because he is sickened by his guilt, but Jack reminds him that turning himself in would also be turning his own brother in.Cliff is living the married life, but does not find happiness in it anymore. While filming a documentary on his brother-in-law Lester, Cliff meets Hallie who he instantly becomes fond of. Cliff sees how happy he can be with Hallie, which makes him more inclined to end his marriage. Cliff wants to do what will make him happy and confesses his love to Hallie, but she says she is not ready and is going away for four months. The movie picks up four months later at a wedding. Dr. Rosenthal is living a happy life with his family and has put his guilt in the back of his mind because he did not get caught. Cliff is separated from his wife and when he finally sees Hallie, she is with Lester and Cliff is heartbroken. This movie juxtaposes the life of a man who lives immorally yet ends up happy and the life of a man who lives more morally yet ends up sad. From a utilitarian perspective, Judah made his decision based on the fact that his family would be destroyed if they knew of the affair; therefore making it seem as if it never existed was for the good of a greater amount of people. Because Cliff was looking out for his own self-interest, he ended up hurt because he did not consider the happiness of others, like Hallie's happiness. From the Kantian view, Judah was acting immorally because he lied and he was only acting in accordance of the advantage of himself and his family. Kant does not see happiness as the end, while Mill does. Kant would probably not consider Judah or Cliff to be acting morally because neither of them acted in accordance to duty, but rather in relation to their own happiness and the consequences that they thought would follow.",

The rest of the cast are all excellent but it is the scenes between Landau and Orbach, the two brothers so different from each other, which really show that dramatic material without nervous glib references to French cafes, is within Allen's grasp as a writer.The lighter, secondary, story gives the audience a breather.

The inner meaning is some what shocking to the viewer, even thought it is true. It is a concept that is not popular in religion and the mainstream films. You are not really punished you're your crimes. The movie is contrary to Hollywood that wants a happy ending, so the viewer can escape and to have the viewer escape to the movies is a social event. That is why people are going to the movies wanting to escape the reality for about two hours. It is like taking a trip. For example, rainy days, cold days and snowy days are the movie theaters biggest sale days for patrons to escape the weather. And this movie Woody Allen does is contradicting to these views. But the movie still works, being entertaining and gain knowledge of human morals. Another point Woody Allen makes using the character, Lester, is that comedy is murder plus time. Killing your audience with laughter. This point is the basis for the movie Judah kills the mistress and over time it is now a whimsical story. Throughout the movie Clifford the viewer is continually seeing contradictions to moral beliefs. And this is confusing to Clifford. These actions are not constant to his ideology and the cinematic structure. Like Lester, who is contradicting to Clifford's view about Lester, seduces Halley that he is a womanizer. Another good contradiction is the only good person in the movie is Ben, a good man that is stricken with blindness by the end of the movie. Clifford's sister is tied up and defecated on, to try and Clifford is also forced to understand how one can do that to another person. But to be vulnerable enough to let a complete stranger tie her up first of all, the reply from her sister is that it is so lonely. Which leads me to Professor Levy, that commits suicide. He surprises everyone, because it was everything he was against and was talking about it in the documentary movie that Clifford was filming. But in the end Professor Levy was lonely and depressed which lead him to suicide. Throughout the movie, Woody Allen questions the morality of people's morals. And he constructs the reality of people's actual lives and the ways they live. Judah and Jack are conspiring to murder the mistress (Dolores) that is threatening to expose the affair and his financial impropriates that has been going on for to two years. At the end of the movie, Clifford and Judah meet, Judah meeting Clifford for the first time. He finds out he is a filmmaker and discusses the Hollywood ideals of a happy ending. Then Judah begins to tell his story of a murder with a twist that is unconventional from Hollywood. Which is the good guy has a happy ending, and wrong doers are always punished. But intern the good guy is stricken with blindness and the suffering to follow. The man responsible for the murder then realizes that the inevitable punishment is haunting him, that justice is served, which is the whole basis of religion. But the twist is after a few weeks it begins to fade and his life is completely normal again. Clifford quickly dismisses the idea and Judah leave but then Clifford and the viewer is suddenly left to reflect on the idea. Bad thing happen to us, but it passes and in time, it all fades away. In reflection this essential element is what make a good movie better and inner meaning, something to have the viewer ponder on. It is also made in1989 and this movie today dome of the morals like defecation fetishes, suicide or adultery is more commonly heard about than when the movie opened.",

However, having tonight watched the movie again i think it could well be Allen's masterpiece.The performances are all excellent, the plot thought provoking, the dialogue funny ('the last woman i was inside was the statue of liberty') and the music, editing and cinematography are all superb. Whilst presenting us seemingly with a deeply nihilistic overall message - the film at the death presents us with a positive ending full of hope and warmth that doesn't overwrite or simplify all that has gone before.I hope that as time goes by this film will be rediscovered and seen by the audience it deserves. In a decade of dross, 'Crimes & Misdemeanors' stands out for me as one of the finest American movies of the 80's. To anyone jaded with modern Hollywood spectacles check this one out and see what a real film maker can achieve and for all his many cinematic failures Allen remains - a true American original.",

Crimes and Misdemeanors is one such movie. The movie revolves around 2 characters mainly. Both vastly different with their own sense of how the world ought to function. The doctor and the film-maker. There are a few other auxiliary characters who represent different point of views in different contexts. Woody's genius works like magic with the whole gambit of ideas coming together, with each character trying to juxtapose his morality against social norms and his own sense of well being. A tragedy of sorts about the assumptions and principles we work upon, being true to them, and their test in life. A must watch.",

The film has two different stories developing at the same time. The first one is a drama about an opthalmologist (Martin Landau), whose mistress (Anjelica Huston) wants to tell to his wife about their affair, otherwise she threatens to reveal that he is a corrupted man. The second one is a romantic comedy about a TV writer (Woody Allen) who falls in love with a woman (Mia Farrow) with whom he works, while he deals with his successful brother-in-law.First of all, Woody Allen is the same guy as always. The same character, with the same profession, dealing with the same erotic problems, with the same way of thinking, with the same cynicism. I understand that this is him, but at least he could change some things on the character.Second, I barely see a connection between the two stories. I waited to see where the two stories are heading to, to find out the two main characters make a conversation about life. I just don't see a reason why there should be two different stories. Each one is good enough to be a single movie, the first a crime drama and the second a typical Woody Allen romantic comedy.Still, I liked the ideas about life that come out of the stories, especially the first one. About how time makes us forget and forgive and how the first impression of someone or something could be totally wrong.The soundtrack was good and so was the acting, although many characters were useless as they only served the connection between the stories, like the rabbi.Not a good effort to make a complex film. I wouldn't recommend it as there are far better films to watch. I give it 4/10",

            "content": "If I had to pick the movie that best pinpointed Woody Allen and his concerns, this would be it. Crime and Misdemeanours, his most accomplished work (though not my favourite - see list below), is a great balancing act of comedy and drama, far more so than the crude demarcations of Melinda and Melinda. Allen draws uniformly elegant performances from the most unlikely sources. Alan Alda steals the film as the hotshot producer; Jerry Orbach is wonderfully sinister as the brother Martin Landau manipulates and is trapped by; Landau himself ranks as one of the best Allen stand-ins, channelling the director's concerns whilst never impersonating, but becoming a believable, empathetic Everyman; Sam Waterston is touching as the cruelly myopic rabbi; and even Allen himself reaches new boundaries, testing our faith in him constantly. Sven Nyqvist's cinematography is captivating, aptly Bergmanesque in it's shifting moods and tones. But what really sets this project apart from all of Allen's others is it's steadfast refusal to compromise. When the elliptical denouement comes, we really don't know , but would desperately like to know, where the two interlocutors, Landau and Allen, are going to. This ambiguous, compelling drama is Allen's best movie of the '80s. As for his best:-10) Small Time Crooks - slightly too restrained, but good for many stretches, esp. the faux-documentary 9)Everyone Says I Love You - would be higher, but for Drew Barrymore's tin earred singing! 8)The Purple Rose of Cairo - little too whimsical for me, but a treat. 7) Sweet and Lowdown - almost made me like Sean Penn 6)Hannah and her Sisters - great direction of the women, and another great ensemble piece. And you thought only Altman made those! 5) Sleeper - wonderful riposte to Kubrick's bloated output 4) Manhattan - Michael Murphy's finest hour (criminally underrated, he is), and a beautiful poem to the Big Apple. That opening just makes me shiver.3) Love and Death - if only for this line: \"My brother was bayonetted to death by a Polish conscientious objector. It's hysterical in context. 2) Crimes and Misdemeanours - see above 1) Annie Hall - luminous, uplifting, sad, beat Star Wars at the Oscars - all you could want form a movie!Thanks for your time.",

Meanwhile, Woody is living in a lifeless, platonic marriage to Joanna Gleason while daydreaming about the associate producer on his latest documentary project (Mia Farrow).

All of Woody Allen's characters are pathetic, because they face moral issues in some of the most basic scenarios. Crimes and Misdemeanors has a very excellent cast which includes: Woody Allen, Alan Alda (M*A*S*H), Mia Farrow (Rosemary's Baby) and Claire Bloom (The Haunting). Those are just some of the many stars in this film. The plot is fairly simple, to separate men attempt to make a like changing decision, one tries to decide how he can get a woman to fall in love with him (might I mention this man is married) the other must decided whether or not to have the woman he had an affair with killed.Crimes and Misdemeanor is excellent fun with great acting. 8/10",

Of course I had heard of it but I never show too much interest in seeing it. I deeply regret it now since I consider it to be one of his best. \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" follows two main characters: Judah Rosenthal (Landau), a successful ophthalmologist, and Cliff Stern (Allen), a struggling documentary filmmaker. Both of them are confronted with moral crises. On the one hand, Judah's crisis concerns his affair with a flight attendant Dolores Paley (Huston). After it becomes clear to her that Judah will not end his marriage, Dolores attempts to inform his wife of their affair. On the other hand, Cliff has been hired by his pompous brother-in-law, Lester (Alda), a successful television producer to make a documentary celebrating Lester, whom Cliff grows to actively despise. While filming, he falls in love with Halley Reed (Farrow), Lester's associate producer. Of course that Allen's story is funnier than Landau's, which does not mean that is comic because actually is really sad, but they both talk about the same. This film is another aspect of Allen's view of life. As always, he shows us its misery, loneliness, suffering and sadness but, in this case, he emphasizes the injustices we all go through, he highlights the inequitable human behavior that makes many people's life miserable totally criticizing the concept of \"karma\". A movie that leads us to a deep reflection upon ethic matters. Ten out of ten.",

Q&A: is G-D simply not paying close enough attention, or is 'Judah' actually off-the-hook?Based on your own personal and religious beliefs, you will probably have differing interpretations of this movie's inherent message..... but the one thing for sure is that Martin Landau gave us an indelible-performance filled with deepest introspection and insightful-reflection (both the good & ill in near equal measure)......",

And who would disagree with the bearded scholarly veteren Maltin? He's only seen like every movie ever! (except for Nightmare in Badham County and Nature of the Beast, which are suspiciously absent from the 2000 edition of Lenny's book, the most recent edition I have--perhaps I should invest in the most updated one) Crimes and Misdeamenors is Woodys all time best combination of comedy and drama ever. It centers around Judah, a \"middle aged man\" torn between risking his marriage because of  chatty, unstable mistress Delores (a very unmistress like Angelica Huston) and affecting his successful optomology practice. Then theres the Woody subplot. He's Cliff--an unhappily married failure of a documentary film maker who has the hots for Halley, the new woman assigned on his latest film project (played by who else, Mia Farrow) His latest project was set up by his sympathetic/fed up wife about her brother, rich, womanizing, successful documentary film maker Lester, who represents everything the envious and snippy Cliff wants to be. The verbal quips between the unenthusiastic Cliff and the arrogant Lester are very funny, and Woody is in top form. The two plots intertwine in the finale, and what follows is absolutely heartbreaking and tragic. The film is full of visual symbolism regarding religion and love, and only the true film buff will pick up on the Bergmanesque references. Look carefully for Frances Conroy, the actress who plays the mother on Six Feet Under. 10 out of 10",

Of course, mention that the film was written and directed by Woody Allen, and it suddenly doesn't seem so unusual after all.Although, Woody Allen hasn't explored issues of religion all that often in his films.  He frequently meditates on cultural issues involved in being Jewish (Annie Hall, Deconstructing Harry), and God pops up in lots of his movies in some way or another.  But I haven't seen any other his films which even come close to the level of legitimate theological thesis as \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\".  The set-up is pure Woody Allen.  There are a bunch of characters, a couple of different plots (major and minor), great performances from familiar faces, and humor, all tied together in some central thematic idea.  The idea of this film is God's justice.  If God is always watching, and God punishes the wicked and rewards the good, it shouldn't be hard to see evidence of this in the world around us.  This film follows various characters, some good, some mostly good, and some horribly wicked, and examines their fortunes.  If God really is how he is described, the good characters should do well.The good characters do very badly.  The wicked characters end up quite well off.  What's the point Woody is making by this?  That there is no God?  Or that, if there is, he doesn't particularly care whether you're good or wicked? Maybe.  But whatever Woody was trying to get across, it's certainly food for thought, and it's totally deliberate.  The same set-up of plots and characters could have been resolved very differently.  Judah could have gone to jail and Lester could have ended up lonely, alone, and infected with the clap.  From the writing standpoint, Woody could have taken this film either way.  That he chose to go the way he did is significant.  It's also more intellectually honest.  Woody is pointing out a problem that should be of concern to all people who have a similar conception of God as the supreme arbiter of justice.  The simple fact is that the world is not just, and the wicked do not always pay.  This could be a major challenge to certain religious points-of-view.As for me, I'm an atheist.  I just like the jokes.  That's not entirely true.  Even an atheist can enjoy, as an intellectual exercise, a good discussion of theology.  But, I also do enjoy the jokes. \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is basically a straight drama, like \"Interiors\" or \"Another Woman\".  Only this time, there is a character with a great sense of humor played by Woody Allen.  Almost all of the humor of this film comes from the character of Clifford Stern.  Stern is a funny guy who says funny things, and his being in this movie makes it funny.  His documentary on his brother-in-law (wonderfully realized by Alan Alda) is a particular highpoint.  What makes this film great, though, is its script.  I think \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" may be Allen's greatest achievement as a writer.  Everything fits together in a way that is so simple, elegant, compelling, and true. This characters are real people, and the issues they raise are real issues.",

But few directors even make one, and this film deserves to be seen again and again. One part, the less substantial, though at times amusing, story with which Allen aficionados will be familiar concerns an unfocused and not unattractively self-absorbed individual   (Allen) who is given a job by his thrusting and even more self-absorbed brother-in-law (Sam Waterstone). The job is to produce a cinematic hagiography, but Allen has his own ideas, and his appreciation of his brother-in-law's qualities lead him to produce a less than flattering portrait of a man he despises, but who in the end if not exactly harmless is certainly not dangerous. The other story concerns a mature Jewish eye-surgeon (Martin Landau), a pillar of the community who in the interests of his marriage seeks to terminate an affair he has been having, but finds that the object of his desires (Angelica Huston) is not so keen to be brushed aside and threatens to reveal the affair to his wife, a prospect which fills Landau with enormous foreboding as it threatens his life as he has known it. As he contemplates the future, his options seem ominously to close-in on him, leading him to consider the prospect of murder. The dramatic irony underpinning the family scenes in which he acts the part of community patriarch is underpinned by the fact that he is a representative of a culture which has traditionally recoiled at violence as a solution to personal problems. His dilemma and his responses to it are powerfully evoked by Landau who gives perhaps the performance of his career.Those who look to Allen to perform his usual role of neurotic New-Yorker will not be disappointed, but neither will those who look to more serious themes in cinema, for this is a Woody Allen film like no other.",

This is one of the dilemmas Woody Allen faces with his film Crimes and Misdemeanors. Let's take a look at the main hero of the film. Here is a man, Judah, in an unhappy marriage caring on with another woman for over two years who decides it's time to kill her off before she releases his secret to his wife.How can such a man be presented as likable? Well, Woody Allen's best decision is to make him an everyman. A man caught up in the situation in which he must face his demons head on. He has made a mistake and he must deal with the consequences of such mistake. In an ordinary Hollywood film, this would mean him being caught and forced to pay for the crime that he has committed. Such is not the case here. Sure he has some regret but, by facing and admitting to what he has done, he is able to move on with his life. One of the great strengths of this film is that it doesn't shy away from what Judah has done. It doesn't make light of it and it doesn't deny that it has happen.He is simply a man who has made this mistake and is forced to go on with his life carrying this horrible mistake. Should he have gone to jail? You bet. Should he have told his wife about his adultery? Of course. But, that is not how life works. We live in a world where we don't always get what is coming to us. Great things happen to bad people everyday and vice versa. I don't believe this makes a bad guy, just a realistic one. By crafting a movie with a central character with real flaws, Woody Allen has created a movie of uncommon power. Four days after seeing it, I still can't get it out of my head. What a great film.",

Much like Judah's (Martin Landau) Aunt May (Anna Berger) who got Judah's religious father to choose God over the loaded question \"God over truth?\" Why are the good punished (like Woody's rabbi brother-in-law Ben played by Sam Waterston),while the wicked thrive? This seems to be the movie's question and Woody generously answers it for us... Nonetheless, I find \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" to be a great movie even though I did not agree with it's manipulative conclusions. I found it compelling to ponder these very popular atheistic ideologies, and the message that I found in this specific thought process (though I'm certain Woody intended it differently), was that it is easier to live with one's sins if we convince ourselves that God is dead. I know this is getting a little deep, but this movie claims to be deep, \"...a film about humanity.\" This might explain why Woody Allen accepts this philosophy of convenience for himself, for his own lack of moral behavior with his step-daughter...I know...a cheap shot, but this does explain it to me.All the performances were astounding! Landau, Alda, Farrow, Huston, Orbach, and even Woody himself were powerfully persuasive at their roles. The cinematography and editing were also nearly perfect.My only fault with this film was it's obvious one-sidedness. This movie mentioned and bashed the Bible a lot, but never quoted it. If Judah's father was as knowledgeable as he was religious he might have quoted Psalm 73 to Aunt May... The Psalm of Asaph which is all about the prosperity of the wicked, and understanding their end! I would only be lying if I said that I wasn't fascinated by this film...I gave it a 9.",

            "content": "Crimes and Misdemeanors is one of Woody Allen's darkest films but also one of his best. The movie has a lot of humor in it as well, but the overall message in this film is quite bleak. Crimes and Misdemeanors is about winners and losers and how life unfairly determines which is which.The film strongly suggests that God is blind. Eyes play a big part in this film. There are the mythical eyes of 'God', that are preached and referenced in the film, but never seem to manifest. There are the bleak cold eyes of victims, there are the eyes of a preacher that fade throughout the film and through it all, the main antagonist is an optometrist.\nEvery main character has a contrasting counterpart. The successful, upper-class Doctor admired by society, has a low-brow, sleazy brother that even his family no longer respects. The penniless 'artist' who makes documentaries for their social commentary, is contrasted by a rich New York producer, who literally records his own ego at every waking opportunity, with a mini-tape recorder. The actions of each character and the rewards for those actions also have sharp contrasts.There is the poor desperate sister, eager for real love and is rewarded with sexual assault. There is the candid and lonely independent film maker that is rewarded with divorce and rejection. There is a kind faithful Rabbi, who is rewarded by not being able to physically see his own daughter on her wedding day. There is the sterile and cold wife, that is rewarded with a new love interest. Most of all there is the Doctor, who cheats his business, his wife and his mistress and prospers through all of it.Woody Allen's main statement in this film is that the vain, the greedy even those commit murder can prosper and succeed. Meanwhile, God is either absent or blind to it all. It's a film that makes this rather dark statement, with a lot of humor and some clever contrasts, which is why its such an outstanding movie to watch.",

The film chills us, it warms us, it chastises us, it comforts us.  It is a love letter, it is a warning, and it is a cry for help.  It is disturbing, dark, funny, scathing, quiet, grave and beautiful, all at the same time.I really love the way Allen presents it in essentially two plots, the funny one with Allen and Alda and Farrow, and the Shakespearean one with Landau and Orbach and Huston.  And all the family connections between characters are so well laid out.Each time I see it I admire the singularly brilliant stroke of casting Orbach and Landau as brothers.  They are so, so much the same flesh, the same blood -- bad apples falling from the same tree, but with deceivingly different lives.  A pair of brothers just made for film posterity.And the funny plot is so romantic.  When I first saw the part where Allen's film lampoons Alda's character, I was beside myself with laughter.  Alda IS that character (another casting coup).A film people should see one or two hundred years from now.",

The script was magnificent, acting was terrific, and the overall message is thought-provoking and brilliantly represented.

Judea was populated by the two remaining tribes, The tribe of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin. Later, based on a false rumor, the tribe of Judah exterminated the tribe of Benjamin. I have restated part of the Old Testament, a part which Mr. Allen appears to be very familiar with. To me, the real story of C&M, is about the tribe Judah, as represented by Landau and Orbach, and the tribe Benjamin, represented by Alda and Waterston. Now, as was then, the audience finds that Judah still has blood on its hands. This time, its a paramour, Ms Paley, also a Jew. So its still a matter of Jew killing Jew. Say what you want about Lester, but he has not killed anyone. Lester is pompous, but his deeds are good. He finds love, he gives Woody a job, he pays for a lavish wedding. Deeds over words. What you do, is more important than what you say, that is Mr. Allen's ultimate message. Woody's character is punished in more ways than one, for sabotaging the job Lester has given him. That leaves the question of why Judah goes free, and Benjamin goes blind. I believe both can live with their fates, because of their beliefs, or lack thereof. The more obvious metaphor is the extinguishing of light, in lieu of a dark act, successfully completed. So Mr. Allen's message is morality exists within ourselves, for those who choose it. One other thing I applaud Mr. Allen for, is for casting, whenever possible, Jewish actors for Jewish roles. Mr. Allen talks the talk, and walks the walk, even if he is a professed atheist, In old Hollywood, and even in today's Hollywood, in the main, gentile actors are hired to portray Jews in films. So you see, to my way of thinking, Woody Allen is a Mensch! My only wish is, that I could tell him so in person!",

Serious subjects have been brought up before in Woody's films (\"Interiors,\" \"September\") but never as successfully as in this film. The mixture of comedy and drama work so effectively that this has to be one of Woody's best films, on par with \"Annie Hall\" and \"Hannah and her Sisters.\"Woody plays Clifford Stern, an independent filmmaker whose marriage is crumbling. In order to make more money and gain recognition, he is offered to make a documentary about his filthy rich, lowbrow, narcissistic TV producer brother-in-law (wonderfully played by Alan Alda). Cliff goes into the project half-heartedly, and his only solace is a doomed relationship with one of the show's producers (played by Mia Farrow).\nMeanwhile, Martin Landau plays Judah Ronsenthal, an eye doctor whose mistress (played by Anjelica Huston) is threatening to expose the relationship. Judah considers having her \"rubbed out\" using the sordid connections of his brother (Jerry Orbach). Wracked by guilt over even thinking such a thing, Judah enlists the spiritual aid of one of his patients, a rabbi whose vision is slowly deteriorating (played by Sam Waterston). The rabbi character, incidentally, is the brother of the Alan Alda character. That's where the stories connect, even though they will continue to cross paths later in the film.All the performances are brilliantly executed, particularly those of Alda, Waterston, Allen and Landau (who was nominated for an Academy Award). The film is a perfect combination of seriousness and hilarity. Among the funniest scenes are when Woody screens a less-than-flattering rough cut of his documentary to a flabbergasted Alda, and the scene where Woody's sister (played by Caroline Aaron) tells Woody about her disastrous blind date.\nIf you're a Woody Allen fan, you won't be disappointed. If you aren't familiar with his films, this would be a good place to start.",

I own the DVD and have been able to view it a few more times and it never disappoints and Landau's performance has not lost any of its luster. Although he is really the lead actor of this film, he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. It still think he should have had a Best Actor nomination for his performance.

And then the rabbi suddenly commits suicide. 'If it bends, it's funny, if it breaks, it isn't funny,' says Lester. Maybe the opposite is true, I found the suicide scene very funny. It showed that all the rabbi's wise words weren't powerful enough to ward off his terrible fate, it showed that in the end he had to resign himself to God's decrees. His act of suicide didn't turn him into a phone, it made him more credible and more like us and made it easier to empathize with him. Cliff Stern who thought the world of him probably lacked in empathy and therefore failed to help him; maybe if he hadn't admired him so much he would have done something to prevent him from killing himself. But he probably cared more about his documentary on the rabbi than about the rabbi himself anyway: When he hears the bad news of the rabbi's death, his main concern seems to be how to continue with the documentary. Maybe Cliff's biggest fault was that he either worshiped or despised other adults but never empathized with them and that made him so vulnerable and nasty, the only kind Cliff was Cliff the uncle taking his little niece out to the pictures.",

I have a cherished love for Dostoevskii- and Woody Allen does as well- this movie is a wonderful update of Crime and Punishment.  Instead of the christian ideal of forgiveness that is central to Dostoevskii, Woody Allen has selected the jewish ideal of the judgment of the powerful and almighty Old Testament God. I am not jewish, yet it seems that Mr Allen is examining the faults of the jewish religion.  Martin Landau's character comes to grip with his childhood jewish instruction, that God is judging ones every action, and that as one of the chosen race- sin especially murder is unforgiveable- it leads to a path of eternal damnation. Mr Landau rejects these beliefs, rejects the merciless Jewish God even, and chooses that his life on earth is his only true existence.  His conscience is clear when he decides his temporal existence is all that one has, and his happiness in his temporal life is all that matters, thus the murder of the mistress will no longer plague his conscience.  This is a totally different outcome than Dostoevskii came up with.  Raskolnikov conscience wouldnt allow him to become a Godman- or Superman, no one is above another. Raskolnikov found his only salvation was that of God and the ex-prostitute Sonja- and God forgave him despite his wretched act of murder. I am not going to draw the final parrallel on why Woody Allens Raskolnikov- Martin Landau -wouldnt admit to god or the secular authorities his sin.  I am not that acquainted with the Jewish faith or culture to draw such conclusions.  I just hope i havent misrepresented any of my aforementioned thoughts.",

And then there is Cliff (Woody), a documentary director who is constantly looking for a job. Judah and Cliff never meet until the last five minutes of this film, but when they do, the result is comedic: Judah subtly pitches his life story (which includes a recent past of \"sin\": adultery, greed, and murder) to Cliff for a movie idea, and Cliff rejects it as unbelievable.

In the ten years, or so, since its release, I've viewed this picture probably close to 30 times; each time, as the end credits roll, asking myself that very question: Is this the finest American film ever?If acting is a criteria to base this assertion, then the answer is a resounding 'yes!' Martin Landau gives the performance of a lifetime as Judah, the conflicted opthomologist, and is matched by Angelica Huston as his wounded, determined lover. Even Woody Allen - whose acting through much of the early 90s left a lot to be desired - gives a textured performance as Cliff, the earnest, but misguided documentarian.Allen's writing meets the challenge of his lofty ambitions with this film. Has there ever been another film that stares down the day to day existence of morality, and yet has the audience in tears with laughter? Any film that speculates the worth in worshipping a God over truth AND humorously compares a television executive (played by Alan Alda) to Mussolini and Mr. Ed - and does so in a meaningful, thought-provoking manner - certainly must be considered great art.Finally, the director Allen balances two contrasting storylines brilliantly - here, Woody proves himself worthy of comparison to the giants of film lore. This feature is a one of a kind project that will continue to provoke debate and discussion as long as there are means to view it. A tour de force all the way, and Allen's finest moment to date.But, is it the finest American film ever?It might very well be.",

I suppose some of the negative feelings come from the potential bleakness of the material: some folks desperately want to believe someone IS watching upstairs (as Judah's father would insist).  Maybe a film even suggesting otherwise is just what these reviewers feel: awful.For me, I take the view of Judah's aunt (or cousin) who, it seemed to me, could take some solace in a cruel world at least knowing that choice was the ultimate arbiter.  This is not to say that the rabbi was wrong when he said, \"Without the law, Judah, it's all darkness.\"  He was absolutely right; this line is the most chilling in the movie (as he and Judah sit in the darkness), and sums up the role of morality in making the choice.What I find wonderful about the movie is the way that it looks at the existential choices we all face--large and small.  This has been done in such a ham-handed manner in so many other works of art, but here, in the hands of a great artist at his absolute peak, it's monumental...a work that will survive.
