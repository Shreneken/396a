            "content": "I'd been told from multiple sources that Jason Takes Manhattan is a weak link in Jasons legacy. Though hardly impressive I'd say its no worse than many of the others.Finally taking Jason away from the camps we see the majority of the movie take place on a ship with it's perhaps last third in the bustling city of New York.Same cut away deaths, same lack of storyline, but same Friday 13th charm. Also Kane Hodder is Jason so that's an immediate win right there.I do have to ask, what is it with Friday 13th and inconsistencies and poor endings? This one is no different and I feel like I could rant about it for an hour but will resist the urge.Jason Takes Manhattan is a worthy addition to the franchise even if the events that transpired in the finale are not explained in part 9.The Good:Kelly HuKane HodderRefreshing new settingThe Bad:Why'd they have to kill off such a great character so early?Ridiculous endingWeak deaths",

            "content": "Another attempt to shake some life into the franchise, relocating Jason to a major city for the promise of unmitigated slaughter. Two problems: the film might have been more accurately titled Jason Takes (a cruise to) Manhattan, since he's ship-bound for all but the final half-hour, and he doesn't really concern himself with anyone apart from the vessel's survivors once he's there. This is a guy who's made a habit of ruthlessly eviscerating everyone he's ever encountered, yet now he passes harmlessly through a loaded subway car and cheerfully lifts his mask to scare a gang of punks like a haunted house denizen. Production values have taken a significant step up since Part VII, and the gore feels somewhat less censored, but it's failed by yet another repetitive, hole-laden plot and a reliably godawful set of actors.",

            "review_title": "The Last True \"Friday\"",
            "content": "Renowned film critic Leonard Maltin calls \"Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\" the highlight of the series. Of course Maltin rated virtually every other \"Friday\" film a dud, so that's not saying much. In any event, he's wrong. But while this eighth installment is comparatively inferior to most that preceded it, it's not as bad as reputed outside Maltin circles.\"Jason Takes Manhattan\" is one of those movies that's impossible to love unconditionally. There are simply too many flaws, from ridiculous plot elements (Jason can teleport???) and an uneven pace to a lack of chills and incompatible attempts at humor. Indeed this entry represents a bitter come-down after the absolutely stellar parts VI and VII.In many ways, \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" doesn't feel like part of the franchise. The Jason here isn't scary like we know he can be. His deadly moves, be it the electric guitar impaler or decapitatingly powerful right hook, seem contrived. Kane Hodder looks like a guy in a Jason suit rather than the real deal. Director Rob Hedden fell into the trap of gore for the sake of gore, but that's never been what \"Friday the 13th\" is all about. It's all in the build-up, and sometimes, even in low-budget '80s horror, less is more.With all of that said, \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" isn't a total loss. The mere sight of the rapidly decaying villain storming through the mean streets of the Big Apple is worth at least four stars. Aside from the change of scenery, the film offers a semi-compelling storyline or two. And the masked one does have his frightening moments, smashing through portholes and firing harpoons at horny teens. As usual, the climax -- this time a chase through the city and sewer -- is the highlight.For better or for worse, \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" marks the last true \"Friday the 13th.\" This was Paramount's last stab (pun intended) at things before selling the rights to New Line Cinema, which basically destroyed the series with absurd ideas like Jason switching bodies and rampaging through spaceships. Not great, but not godawful, this film carries limited appeal outside of fanboy circles.",

            "review_title": "Better than Titanic!",
            "content": "What's up with all these high schools in the movies having these insane senior trips? The kids in Final Destination flew to Europe, and these kids go on a freaking cruise? I went to Magic Mountain for my senior trip! Oh, well, I guess the payback is that in the movies they all get killed. Magic Mountain sounds a lot better in that sense. By this point in the lengthy Friday the 13th saga, it's clear that even the writers of these movies (generally the last people to catch on when they come up with idiotic ideas) have noticed that a lot of teenagers going up to Camp Crystal Lake to be rebellious and get slashed all up is getting a little bit old, so in this installment they decided it would be a good idea to have the movie take place on a whole ship full of high school students. Moving someone like Jason Voorhees from his home on Camp Crystal Lake to an unfamiliar setting is actually a really good idea for generating more interest in the series, because although it's a given in a series like this, I think audiences always like to see familiar characters come back from other stories. So while you already know Jason is going to be in the movie because it's a Friday the 13th, you at least see him in an unfamiliar atmosphere, which removes a lot of the automatic cynicism that is now being generated toward the teenagers who are still stupid enough to go out to the lake. Now we see Jason killing all kinds of kids unsuspectingly on their school trip and then more people on the streets of New York. Amazing the things we find entertaining these days, isn't it?There are a lot of fairly innovative deaths aboard the ship in the first half of the film, such as a guy relaxing in the sauna getting one of the hot rocks shoved through his stomach, a guy getting impaled on the communication antenna on the boat, and throat slit by a machete, an amazingly botched scene. You would think that since it was so obvious the knife didn't even touch that poor guy, they would at least not have done it in such a close-up.Ironically enough, the part that I was anticipating to be the most interesting was the least creatively done. After realizing what is going on on the boat (meaning, after just about all of them had been killed), the surviving students on board get the life raft and escape, rowing out into the dark ocean in hopes of hitting land. Eventually, they see the New York City skyline and jump for joy. I was anticipating a creative and fun romp through the streets of New York, maybe with Jason confused at his surroundings and therefore going even more nuts, which would create havoc among the population. I mean, LOOK at the guy. He spent the time between the last movie and this one rotting on the bottom of the lake, and he certainly looks like it through this entire movie.Unfortunately, the filmmakers not only revealed the modesty of their budget through the lack of anything really interesting happening, they also displayed a massive lack of understanding of the geography of the city of New York. I've never even been there myself, but it seems like pretty much basic logic that they would not design the city so that the dirtiest slums had the finest waterfront property. Meaning, I doubt you could row up to New York from the ocean, right alongside the Statue of Liberty, and climb up onto land, finding yourself surrounded by endless alleyways full of things like gun-toting rapists and standing barrels of toxic waste. New York is a big city, and all cities throughout the world pretty much have to have things like this somewhere, but generally not right on the water and right next to major monuments. I happen to know, for example, that if you go to San Francisco, you won't find the crime-ridden slums right under the Golden Gate Bridge, and I doubt that you would find open barrels of toxic waste ANYWHERE.But anyway, they certainly find some room for effective comic relief (although notably less than other films in the series), my favorite example of which is the scene where Jason looks curiously at a picture of a hockey player on a billboard wearing exactly the same mask that he has on, a sort of self-realization that has since been overshadowed by the T-1000 pausing to look at a metallic mannequin in Terminator 2. I love that stuff, it gives even the most two-dimensional bad guys a sort of self-consciousness, so that they're not just mindless killing machines but have some semblance of actual thought in their heads, seeing and analyzing their surroundings and pausing when they see something that they don't understand. Makes the inhuman killers more human, you know?Speaking of which, there was also a scene that was really funny for much the same reason, and feel free to make fun of me for seeing it this way. There's a scene pretty near the end of the film where Jason is pursuing the few remaining kids through the streets of Manhattan, and he passes by some street punks hanging out and smoking on the sidewalk and listening to some ridiculous 80s music ('Livin' inna city ain't no big deal, livin' inna city ain't no big deal. If the drugs don't getcha then the hooka's will\u0085.' And so forth\u0085), and as Jason walks by, he kicks their boom-box across the sidewalk. Being tough gutterpunks, of course, they stand up and pull out their switchblades, informing Jason that he just dug his own grave. Jason's response is to turn and face them and lift up his mask so they can see his face. I liked that scene, because like the one above, it shows a self-consciousness. Jason KNOWS that he looks terrifying. He always has, and rotting on the bottom of the lake made it even worse. It also shows that he can deal with people in a way other than cutting them all up and still have it be pretty satisfying to the audience. The climax of the film is bogged down pretty badly by some heavily botched logic and another massive lack of understanding of the underbelly operations of a major city. First of all, none of the passersby up on the streets take a second look at this gigantic, wet, rotting man walking down the street with a hockey mask. I know New Yorkers can be cold and indifferent, but even THEY would not take something like THAT as normal. But even worse, as the kids escape into the underground sewage system (which does not run through wide walkways beneath the sidewalks in ANY city that doesn't want to smell like it's own waste), they run into a sewage worker who informs them that the sewers (in which they are currently standing) fill with toxic waste every night at midnight ('Exactly ten minutes from now!'), and is then killed by Jason before being able to show them how to get out.I won't get into the fact that there is no imaginable reason for any underground pipe system to fill with toxic waste every night at a certain time other than to create false suspense for a movie like this, although that is most of the reason that this climax falls so completely flat. We do get something for the kids to run away from and a time-limit for them to get out of the sewer, and we do get a glimpse of Jason's hideous face as he melts into the waste, but it is a completely contrived setting that has no basis in reality, which is the one thing that always makes horror films (or films of almost any genre, for that matter) more effective. Friday the 13th VIII, obviously, is not very concerned with that, which makes it one of the less interesting installments in the saga, although at least it takes place in a different setting so we have a reason to slap our foreheads other than because there is yet ANOTHER group of morons going up to Camp Crystal Lake to taunt the legend of Jason Voorhees.",

            "review_title": "Cheesy sequel offers a change of setting - and is surprisingly enjoyable",
            "content": "God be praised - here is a film in the long-running series that is actually fun to watch. Dropping the lame, tired and incredibly clich\u00e9d slashing in the woods and summer camps which had been done repeatedly to death in earlier films, Part VIII thankfully goes in a new direction. Although the formula stays the same - it's still Jason picking off unwitting teenagers one by one - the setting is now a boat heading for New York. A slasher film on a boat is an original premise and therefore reason to watch! Things kick off with Jason returning from his watery grave via an anchor. Not an exactly impressive way to start, but there's immediately some sex and violence to grab the attention including a shocking explicit scene involving entrails - maybe the censors were lightening up at last! Jason has changed a lot since the previous film. Here he's picked up a slimy squelch in his step - no doubt from being underwater so long - and has also amazingly regrown a lot of his flesh as he's now looking human again, unlike the skeletal zombie he was in Part VII. Kane Hodder has a ball with the role, and plays the most interesting Jason ever. Here, he's a kind of anti-hero who even murders a pair of would-be rapists at one point! The action moves to a huge liner which is inevitably inhabited by loads of annoying teenagers in dated fashions. Thankfully it's not long to wait before the murders start and here a weaponless Jason is more creative than usual; guitars, pipes, and axes all come into play at various points. This section of the film is watchable and over quite quickly, but nothing special. With only five survivors left, the action then swiftly changes to take place in the heart of the big city itself - and then the fun really begins.It's very easy to like this film due to the silly things happening in it. There's a higher comedy value than before which makes it a lot lighter in tone, and as I mentioned previously, more fun to watch. One scene sees a gang of punks make to attack Jason only for him to lift his mask and drive them off! The climatic chase through the sewers is quite suspenseful and Jason's death - dissolved in toxic waste - has to be seen to be believed. Sadly though his makeup in this film is less than impressive, and it just looks like a deformed rubber mask he wears.The acting is poor from most of the too-gorgeous young cast, although there is an exception: Peter Mark Richman, who plays the unlikable teacher, is actually very good in a \"love to hate him\" role. Richman, who looks like a cross between Charles Dance and David Warner, is the kind of sneering, know-it-all, stern and boring teacher that everybody had at school. His presence is very much appreciated as it's not often we get a real actor appear in these type of films. On top of all this, there's one defining highlight which almost makes the entire series up until now worthwhile. It's the rooftop fight sequence, which sees a young athlete going up against the hockey mask-wearing psychopath with just his bare hands. He knocks the stuffing out of our killer, over and over again until he's too tired to fight anymore. Standing back, he whispers \"take your best shot\" and Jason proceeds to knock his head clean off with a single blow. It's as funny as it sounds and makes the film for me!",

            "content": "Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan is a guilty pleasure of mine. I know this movie was also cut by the MPAA like was Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood and it is most of people's at least favorite film mine isn't. I am one of the fan's that I think it is not that bad film at all, like many of people are claiming. I will admit Jason Takes Manhattan and Jason X are guilty pleasure of mine and In my opinion are not that bad of a films.I know this film is more Jason Takes A Cruise Ship then Manhattan because 1 hr is mostly set on the cruise ship and the first hour goes slow around. This movie is slow and boring at first but when the characters come in to the city New York the film get's really quickly around and interesting yes I love movies in the city's. Predator 2 get's a bad rap because the story was set in the city. But in my opinion it is good and a great sci-fi action slasher film. Maniac Cop was also set in the city and it was a good action slasher film. Why everyone dislike this movie I don't know I thought it was an okay film.Kane Hodder was good as Jason Voorhees I didn't mind him in this movie I thought he was an alright Jason. I like the kills I also like the cast and the soundtracks for this film.I like Jensen Daggett and Scott Reeves in this movie they are not that bad, this movie also has some action like police car explosions I love that. In here we also have Kelly Hu when she wasn't famous but she is now. Saffron Henderson was hot babe in this movie too bad she was killed in the beginning of the film. Sharlene Martin was great hot sexy babe in this. The gore scenes in my opinion wasn't that bad but were still good.The reason Part VII and VIII were so toned down in gore and violence is the MPAA took an absolute hatred and developed contempt for these movies. Their minds were already made up before they sat down to review it. Sad to have this kind of censorship in modern times.I love the song Darkest Side Of The Night by Peter Freddette. Director Rob Hedden also wrote the song for this film Tamara's Bio Project and he performed.I know I said I dislike Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D and Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning but in my opinion I have simply enjoy this movie more I really like that Jensen Daggett and Scott Reeves were on the train and Jason was chasing them, I like that Scott Reeves electrocuted him and Jason still walked ha ha that was funny.I love that toxic waste killed Jason on the end of the film, but what was I confused was why Jason suddenly turned in to young boy after he was killed by toxic waste? I don't understand that at all. But the ending was satisfying for me I didn't except a lot but it was alright and it has happy ending. I like happy endings in horror movies and I was rooting for the good guys.The reason why this movie was on a cruise ship and was filmed in Canada was because they run out of the money so they filmed on a cruise ship mostly scenes in Canada because it was cheap. The last scenes were filmed in New York they didn't had properly money to make it as an awesome movie but I like it.It is not great but it is at least watchable tough it doesn't take place in Crystal Lake. Before I forgot I love that funny scene in which we see Jason with Hockey Mask and we just see with hockey mask a poster hanging on it and he looks right in the camera boy was I laughing that scene was entertaining.This movie get's C+ 6/10 the most underrated movie ever this is guilty pleasure of mine I am still going to watch it when I will have time.",

Probably not, but the filmmakers some so eager to please that I can't help but hop on the cruise ship and go along for the ride.By this point, the franchise was obviously running on fumes having stretched out an already thin idea into 7 movies, but there's still a good bit of energy here. Yes, the film should probably be titled Jason Takes A Cruise (most of the film takes place on a cruise ship that's on its way to Manhattan), but he had to get there somehow.The cast is fairly appealing and likable enough which isn't always a given with these kinds of movies. The death scenes are inventive, if light on gore (then again, the MPAA had it out for these movies since the original, so that's probably their fault), and the pacing is pretty tight.

            "review_title": "One of my favourites in the series. Starting to hit their stride believe it or not",
            "content": "Jason Takes Manhattan is a funny title. The reason is that the time spent in Manhattan is virtually nil. The last half hour is actually in New York considering how much time is spent hyping it up like its Jason lose in the big city (which is an interesting concept I think.) But this is about Jason lose on a boat of High School graduates on their way to New York. It takes the typical Crystal Lake location and mixes it up by putting him on a boat and then truly mixes it up by dropping him into the biggest city in North America. Such intense change in setting is welcomed and interesting and makes the kills that much more fun. This is also the first time I felt like they added a hint of humour to the series with Jason showing his face to some gang bangers to get them to back off. It also has my hands down favourite Friday the 13th kill ever and perhaps the most ridiculous with the boxer on the roof when Jason takes his head clear off with a hook after being punched multiple times. The characters haven't changed much over the course of eight Friday the 13th films but the setting is what makes this one more fun than the average instalment.Jensen Daggett is our latest scream queen and this was her premier role. She is good as Rennie, the emotionally distraught Graduate whose parents were killed, and who was traumatized as a child by nearly drowning. She has that typical deer in the headlights scared of everything performance we have come to know of the lead female in the Friday the 13th series. Barbara Bingham plays Rennie's teacher and one of the only adults in the film and she is a great character but they don't give her enough screen time. A legendary television actor, Peter Mark Richman plays Principal Charles McCulloch. His character is one of the best and he does a great job in the role. Scott Reeves is the young love interest and hero. I think he is actually one of the best actors that played this type of role in the series. He actually has personality and a strong charisma on screen. And its only right that I mention Vincent Craig Dupree who plays the previous mentioned Boxer who doesn't get a lot of screen time but he is good when he's on screen. Kane Hodder picks up the hockey mask again and proves why he is the best at being Jason. His movements are just so defined and perfect for Jason.Another man from the Friday the 13th TV Series takes the helm, Rob Hedden. He also co-write Jason Takes Manhattan and I think these directors that truly care about this series want nothing more than to try and really give it a story because Jason Takes Manhattan tries very hard to actually have a solid plot amongst the insane deaths and kills. The one thing I could have done without entirely was the constant flashbacks to Jason as a child and the ending which for some twisted reason as Jason melting down back to being a child again. IMDb writers pass this off as visions by Rennie but even still it comes across as ridiculous. Regardless this is one of the best stories and the most fun seeing Jason Voorhees run around a populated city...a fish out of water (no pun intended.) This film brings Jason into the 90's and is one of the most fun of the while series. 8/10",

            "content": "After seven previous instalments, three of them at Camp Crystal Lake, it was time for a new locale for Jason to carve up his latest bloodbath. Non-filmmaker Rob Hedden, a former executive at Universal Studios, approached Paramount with the idea of putting Jason Voorhees in Manhattan. They loved the idea and he went to work on the script. Jason was going to jump off the Statue of Liberty, go boxing at Madison Square Garden, go on a killing spree on the Brooklyn Bridge, among others. Then Paramount vetoed the budget for filming in such locations and Rob Hedden had to quickly shift the balance. Jason would take Manhattan, eventually, but first he'd go for a long cruise.With little continuity to Part VII, Jason is still stuck at the bottom of the lake, where Tina's dad left him in chains. Somehow Camp Crystal Lake has reappeared at the far side of the lake, even though it wasn't there before. A power surge gives Jason new life and the killing begins once more as he climbs on board a pleasure boat and makes light work of the kids inside. Somehow Crystal Lake is now connected to the Atlantic (actually Pacific) Ocean and Jason drifts downstream where he ends up on board the Lazarus, a pleasure cruise for teens who have just graduated from Crystal Lake High.On board is aspiring writer Rennie (a very cute and innocent Jensen Daggett who was actually a teenager at the time) and her dog, her overbearing teacher/uncle Mr. McCulloch, English teacher Miss Van Deusen, and her estranged boyfriend Sean, along with the usual extra meat for the chopping board. As the ship steams off for New York Jason begins to off the meat in amusing ways.Eventually, they arrive in Manhattan, for about five minutes before they end up in Vancouver doubling as New York. Part VIII has endured immense criticism over the years for failing to deliver much of the promise made by the title. It's perfectly valid. Why on Earth would Paramount approve the script only to not pony up the cash for the necessary locations? Despite this damning problem it's still fun to see Jason in a new environment. As much as I like most of the movies they really should have taken him out of Crystal Lake sooner and experimented.Kane Hodder comes back for his second (of four) rounds as Jason and really does embiggen the role with his cromulent performance (Simpsons joke). The Jason make-up is rather terrible for this round, but it's mainly hidden behind the mask. This time he's all slimy and gooey (and rather cute and cuddly, strangely) and game for some welcome humor. There is a scene where they apparently try to make his teleportation powers apparent when he's stalking Kelly Hu's character, but I don't think that this was in the script, it comes across as a joke by editor Steve Mirkovich who tried to have fun with the scene in post-production instead of something that Ron Hedden intended. Though we're talking about a man who wrote a scene where Jason swims many miles to Manhattan docks when the reason he's dead in the first place is because he drowned as a child due to his inability to swim.There's plenty of shortcomings, but it's slick and fun, if a little goofy. It does deserve criticism, but not hate. Keep a lookout for the scene where Jason smashes through a greasy spoon diner. That angry cook he throws against the wall is none other than Ken Kirzinger who would go on to play Jason fourteen years later (much to Kane Hodder's annoyance) in Freddy vs Jason. I suppose that scene is sort-of Jason vs Jason.",

            "content": "In 1989 the Slasher genre was living extra time and the Friday the 13th franchise (once the most popular Horror movies) needed a complete re - structure in order to survived. It was decided that the Jason character should have a decent ending so Paramount ended with the franchise with a big budget movie \"Jason Takes Manhattan\". Jason wasn't required in the 90's by the executives so he found his death in Manhattan. Everybody knows that five years later New Line bought the rights of the Friday the 13th movies in order to create the epic battle between Jason and their biggest money creator Freddy Krueger, but that's another story.*SPOILERS* Jason sneaks into a s*** filled with high school graduates and kills them one by one until only three of them and two teachers are left and escape the ship's explosion. Jason survives the explosion and follows the survivors to Manhattan. Once there Jason kills anyone that stands on his way and finds his death in the Big Apple sewers. There's not much to say about this entry. The new thing is that Jason changes his killing location from Camp Crystal Lake to Manhattan. The killings are the same, the teens are the same, and he's even the same.There are some good moments though (may only be appreciated by fans of the series). The storms looked cool and the creepy atmosphere inside the ship was good. Jason looked very mean and his costume rocked. Julius' death is something we've never seen in the series. Jason's morphing at the end is weird and disturbing. How would he turn out into a child again?! Insane and unnecessary. Weird but I don't like it. Kane Hodder reprises his role as Jason Voorhees and I must say that he kicks ass. He gave Jason an attitude and in this movie he shows a powerful display of anger. Jensen Dagget (Renny) is very beautiful and delivers a good performance. The other cast members are just regular. The death scenes aren't very creative but at least tried. There's stabbing, burning, impalement, decapitations, head smashings, choking, etc. There's a lot of job for Jason this time. There's a decent amount of gore, a good score, a good direction, and a nice welcomed atmosphere in the series. The new locations gave fresh air to the tired franchise. Good decision, Jason couldn't stay forever in Camp Crystal Lake and it's nears.JASON TAKES MANHATTAN tries too hard but doesn't manages to stay a solid entry in the series. The late 80's standard for making Slasher movies was high and sadly this movie couldn't top it. JTM is an entertaining Slasher movie that stands out from the rest only for having Jason in Manhattan and being Jason's last movie in Paramount. That's it. Watch it only if you're a die hard fan of the series.7/10 in the Friday the 13th scale. 5/10.",

            "content": "I think Jason fans boil down into two categories - the ones that watch for actual horror and the ones that watch for unintentional humor and shock value.For the former group - this movie is worthless. The change of scenery from the dark, foreboding woods of Camp Crystal Lake to a luxury cruise liner completely ruins Jason's mystique. Jason is a killer made for stalking around the ominous woods, not sauntering through hallways and crosswalks. The kills are numerous and bloody... but don't compare to some of the other installments. Overall, this movie is simply not very scary.For the latter group however, this movie is a gem. Packed full of stereotypes and inexplicably idiotic characters, you can't help but laugh as each one is picked off, Jason-style. With Asian valedictorians, black athletes, and white party girls, the lack of effort that the writers put into the film is clearly evident. It's almost as if the writers got together and tried to figure out how to fit the maximum amount of gratuitous violence and nudity into an hour and a half movie... sheer brilliance.For me? 8/10, one of the best comedies I've seen in a while.",

            "content": "'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all off. 'Jason Takes Manhattan', the seventh sequel and the eight film in the series, is one of the lowest rated 'Friday the 13th' films on IMDb. Apart from a couple of interest points, personally have to agree with those who consider 'Jason Takes Manhattan' one of the series' weakest (whether it's the very worst is debatable). It's not terrible and not quite as bad as some have said, but it is lacking in a lot of areas.There are merits here. When it comes to the photography, 'Jason Takes Manhattan' is a strong contender for the best shot 'Friday the 13th' film, very stylish and crisp with a lot of atmosphere. Regarding the music, the music has always been one of the best things consistently, that is the case here, once again being hauntingly eerie and quite catchy even.Kane Hodder returns as Jason and does a valiant job, and very nearly is as spine chilling as he was in the previous film (the make-up lets him down though but the performance itself is spot on). A couple of the deaths are memorable. It was also nice to have a change in location, the most interesting thing of 'Jason Takes Manhattan' and what makes it stand out among the rest in this regard.However, 'Jason Takes Manhattan' has a lot of severe drawbacks. And no, the misleading misnomer of the film's title, considering there is too little of Manhattan and it takes too long to get there, is actually the least of its problems. Of the acting the only good performance comes from Hodder, everybody else is either irritating or with the range of a broomstick, meaning the film is one of the series' worst acted. The dialogue also makes the film one of the series' worst-written, not just crude, tonally muddled and simplistic but sense is pretty much neglected. The stereotypical characters are the most bland and annoying ones of the series, with the most illogical and stupidest decision making. Am aware that these assets have rarely been strengths in the 'Friday the 13th' films, but not to this extent in comparison to the previous films.Storytelling is also not great to put it mildly. It takes silliness and senselessness to extreme breaking point, the concept poses a lot of confusion and errors in continuity and too much of the film is too ridiculous to even be entertained by it let alone take seriously. The climax is one of the series' most confusing (incoherent even), head-scratching and laziest. One also feels every minute of the rather too long length, due to the story being a stale rehash pretty much that feels tired.Make-up and effects are subpar, Jason looks both cheap and goofy, none of the unsettling gruesomeness of 'The New Blood'. Like that film, The humour is more goofy and annoying than tongue-in-cheek and witty (a big problem considering the over-reliance on it, some of the humour felt unintentional too), there is a real shortage of suspense, far too tame scares and the creativity and creepiness of the death scenes are wildly variable and even the best of them are nowhere near close to being on par with the series' most memorable.Overall, not terrible but rather lacklustre. 4/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Well... if \"Jason Lives\" was an example of the later entries in the \"Friday the 13th\" franchise using a contrived gimmick as a strength with its expert use of self-aware meta-humor... \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" is an example of the franchise using a contrived gimmick poorly and to its detriment.Yes, Jason doesn't exactly take to the streets of the Big Apple with gusto or flair... but more of a whimper and a misstep. It's a gimmick that mostly falls flat when it becomes quickly apparent just how shallow and under-utilized the concept is in the context of the story. It's just a re-skin of prior entries that happens to have a few establishing shots of New York thrown in here and there during the third act, while the action is relegated to generic locations like back-alleys and sewer-systems.There's no reason it had to take place in New York City with the script they used. It could just as easily been any town...After an electric shock brings Jason back from the dead, he stows aboard on a ship loaded with recent school graduates departing for New York City to celebrate. (Chief among them is protagonist Rennie, an aquaphobe played by Jensen Daggett.) Now stuck in the water with a maniacal killer on board, the teens must band together to survive... but their journey will eventually lead them to their destination, where a final battle against Jason will play out on the streets of the City that Never Sleeps...Honestly, there is some definite fun to be had with this entry. Future Hollywood star Kelly Hu (\"The Scorpion King\", \"X-Men 2\") has a minor supporting role and it's fun to see her getting her start. Kane Hodder returns as serial killer Jason Voorhees, and he continues to ratchet up the threat with a great performance. And even though the New York location is woefully under-used, it does allow for a few cute and creative moments of Jason causing general madness and mayhem. (An uproariously funny moment where Jason confronts a group of delinquent youths takes the cake as probably the single best straight-up joke in the entire franchise.)But the film just doesn't pay-off on its promise. It's a well-known fact that the limited budget and production time meant that the film couldn't really take full advantage of its fish-out-of-water concept. Only the final act takes place in New York, and it becomes painfully obvious that much of the time, they're either on-sets or filming in stand-in locations to save money. You only really \"see\" the true New York in a handful of shots and a few short scenes. Legend goes that the film was originally meant to make use of key locations like Madison Square Garden and the Empire State Building, but writer/director Rob Hedden was given a flat-out \"No!\" by studio executives who wanted to conserve the budget.The result... one of the more forgettable entries in the long- running franchise.Jason might have taken Manhattan, but hopefully he didn't take your money with this entry.A sub-par 3 out of 10.",

            "content": "As this instalment in the series gets underway a young couple are getting passionate aboard a boat on Crystal Lake; the boy starts telling the girl the story of Jason Voorhees before slipping out and then returning in a Jason disguise... not realising their anchor has snagged a power cable causing Jason to be shocked back to life yet again; he boards their boat and kills them. We then cut to the dock where the senior year of the local high school is preparing to board the appropriately named SS Lazarus for a celebratory trip to New York. At this point we are introduced to certain characters; notably Rennie, a girl who is afraid of water due to a childhood trauma, her overbearing uncle, who is also a teacher in charge of the trip and Sean, the captain's son. As they set off Jason is seen climbing the anchor chain. He is soon up to his old tricks, murdering students and crew. Eventually his actions cause the loss of the ship and a number of survivors board the lifeboat. When the fog clears they are in New York but they aren't free from Jason.If you sit down to watch this expecting it to make much sense you are likely to be disappointed but if you are keen to see Jason killing people in a new location it isn't terrible. The action on the boat is varied and it provides a good setting however there is no explanation of how an ocean going ship could sail out of the lake... a location that was always shown as remote and only had small boats on before. Also the number of students in the senior year seemed rather small. Thankfully this isn't too much of a problem... with a series like this half the fun is laughing at the silly moments. Less easy to forgive is what happens once the action moves to New York; not only do the survivors get mugged minutes after landing in what appears to be the most rundown area of any city in the Western World and when Jason turns up the locals ignore him and for the most part he ignores them which seems completely out of character. The cast are okay but none really stands out. Overall not a great film but fun enough if you enjoy the series and like the idea of moving it to a new setting.",

Jason is revived (again) gets on the ship and starts slashing away. For some reason he's drawn to Rennie (Jensen Daggett) and starts having flashbacks of drowning as a child (???).Pretty desperate. The original theme music is never used--they throw in some generic rock songs instead; there's a crew member on the ship who inexplicably knows they're all doomed (like Crazy Ralph from parts 1 and 2); most of the killings take place on the ship--only the last 35 minutes are in NY; Jason again shows his amazing teleportation tricks; most of the killings are bloodless or take place off screen (thanks to the MPAA which really went after this one); the makeup on Jason at the end is laughable; it's far too long (100 minutes) and has some of the worst acting too (Scott Reeves is drop dead handsome but has zero acting ability). Also, according to this film, New York City washes all its sewers with TOXIC WASTE every night at midnight!!! The director said he tried to add humor to the film but it fails miserably. The only amusing part is Jason's reaction in NYC to a billboard with a large goalie's mask on it. Also ditching the original theme music was a stupid idea. This one was the last distributed by Paramount. It was (understandably) a bomb--even F:13 fans consider this the nadir of the series. Not worth your time. I give this a 1.",

It is not a bad movie. The film has problems it is low budget film mostly was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia on a boat the most of the time. They filmed only few little scenes in New York City until they run out of money. MPAA cut death scenes in this movie, that were gory.This is different horror slasher movie, the story is not set in Crystal Lake. I like this film, I like this film a lot. I like it better than A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child I hate that movie! In here Jason at least wasnt a cartoonish laughing stock like Freddy Krueger in Part 5 and 6 was. With low budget and problems this movie in my opinion it is still scary and gory. The death scenes are still terrifying to me. Rob Hedden did directed thos movie well, he wrote the script him self. Kane Hodder was still good as Jason Voorhees. He swimed in this movie I don't mind it. They were actresses and actors in this movie that i like and the death scenes were still good trying to be serious. I know it wasn't scary as Part VII: The New Blood but still better than Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X.Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan O like it, better than Part 2 and The Final Chapter. Yes they are good movies , but this movie is also good. Reading this comments this movie is way too hated. Gets too much crap that dosen't deserve it. The movie still has action in which the group get's in the city and Jason hunts them down. I like the kills he punches a boxer's head off. A teen jumps on Jason in the subway from the train and almost electricute Jason. Jason kills a two kiddnapers which i absolutelly enjoy the kills. Jason kills a math dealer and prevents a rape and saves a young girl.Jensen Daggett as Rennie Wickham the final girl is damn good as the unlikable heroine she fought back againts Jason, she throw toxic waste on him. She at least wasn't annoying in my opinion I like her. Scott Reeves as Sean Robertson was still good in his role I like him, i like his character. Sharlene Martin as the bad girl was hot as Tamara. Sharlene Martin was great I love the girl so much. Kelly Hu from Martial Law is in here is good in her performance.I like the song Darkest Side Of The Night by Metropolis powerfull song in the opening scene. Say This To Me by Neo a4 is still good soundtrack I like. J.J.'s Blues by Stan Meissner is still good.I like Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan more than Part 2, The Final Chapter, Jason X and Jason Goes to Hell.

Then when they finally reach Manhattan which is towards the end may I add, the plot barley even involves Jason and is another half an hour dragging on to complete the film. The film becomes even more cheesy and is not scary what so ever and completely ruins the film when Jason is seen by half of Manhattan chasing the two helpless victims because nobody seems to be doing anything to help them.

            "content": "I've seen my share of bad movies in my life, mostly from being such a big fan of MST3K for so long. But this movie really takes the cake. It is without a doubt the worst Friday the 13th, second only to Part V: A New Beginning. Not even the presence of the (somewhat) well-known Peter Mark Richman and the now-famous Jason himself, Kane Hodder, could make this film make any sense.The movie is flawed in many ways, one of the biggest of which involves Rennie Wickham's constant visions of Jason Voorhees as a young child. Often times she is touched by these visions and yet Jason is either with her at the time or is near her, which makes someone want to ask \"What is going on in this girl's head?\". The visions may have been caused by deep psychological trauma suffered from the events of the flashback seen towards the end where she almost drowns and encounters Jason as a young child. But that flashback is a primary example of how flawed this movie is in terms of the continuity of the series. It is determined in Part 2 that Jason did, in fact, not drown as a child but survived and spent the rest of his childhood in the woods, which eventually leads to him being the fully grown undead serial killer the fans have grown to love.Another major flaw is the ending, in which Jason is drowned in toxic waste. However, seconds before being doused with said chemicals, water shoots out of his mouth almost for no apparent reason. It may have been the intention of the writers to do this to remind the viewers that it would be the second time Jason has drowned in his life, but I highly doubt it. And then the end after Jason is killed, the audience is shown the body of a young boy, which is no doubt Jason Voorhees. This ending would indicate that Jason was always a boy but . . . something, maybe being reborn with a body of swamp algae and barnacles that the toxic waste disintegrated? Highly unlikely once again.And of course, there is the flaw of Jason's apparent ability to change places at the blink of an eye, in which he is seen in one place for one moment and then seems to move with lightning fast stealth in front of the characters almost like Freddy Krueger. How is it that someone in reality who walks slower than Michael Myers can move so quickly off camera, especially if he never seemed to be this quick in the previous movies? The only time we see Jason take a shortcut to get to his destination faster is towards the end when he's chasing Sean Robertson and Rennie Wickham through the tunnels.All of these flaws are the faults of the writers, all of whom may need to reconsider their paths and/or hire their own editors.",

In this movie, Jason finds himself a stowaway on a cruise ship full of high schoolers bound for New York City. He slaughters his way around the ship, and when it ends up docking, he chases the final few survivors around New York. This as as good as you're going to get in the fatally flawed Friday series, so I suggest anyone that watches this movie just watch and enjoy without worrying about how unrealistic and hokey it is.Kane Hodder, who played the best Jason, really took hold of the role in this movie. I'd give him credit for Part 7, but that movie sucked the big one. The other actors are okay for this movie, though naturally, it's not great. The plot and dialogue are also alright for this kind of movie. Like I say, this isn't the best movie in the series, but it's the only later one that I can say I was entertained by. Jason enters the realm of comic relief in this entry in two very funny scenes. One where he smashes through a box holding up some thug's boom box. The thug stands up to fight, and Jason turns and lifts his mask, scaring the thug off. The second where a guy is punching Jason in the face to no avail, and then Jason punches his head clear off his shoulders.The one thing that bothered me about this entry is that the title is the most misleading title you'll ever see. When I first rented this, I was expecting the whole movie to be in New York. No, instead we have to sit through a long boring boat ride until the last 10 minutes of the movie when Jason finally sets foot on Manhattan Island. All in all an okay entry, but it's not great.5/10",

One of the biggest pluses here is that there's plenty of fun slasher moments throughout here which gives this one some absolutely fun scenes here. The repeated nature of the kills here gives this one an incredibly frantic pace here that this one basically runs so constantly that there's plenty of action here, from the opening assault on the couples' boat and the stalking through the ship here that piles up a lot of great kills here spread all throughout the ship in getting in plenty of fun here in the finale where there's the rather fun encounters within the city here which gives this some really fun moments here where this one fully delivers as a slasher film. The chases in the ship here are truly a lot of fun as the frequent confrontations along the way provide the kind of enjoyable kills here in requiring this one with plenty of exciting action down in the boiler room, throughout the cabins and different start rooms and then finally out on to the deck of the ship here as the survivors attempt to flee the damaged, sinking ship with plenty of fun deaths in these confrontations. Even more impressive here is the scenes of them being chased through the city which are incredibly fun as well as the early chases through the dockyard with the junkies, into a crowded diner and through the subway are just some of the fun here that takes place within here, as there's even more fun with the chases through the streets in the police car, the absolutely brilliant boxing match taking place on-top of the building where it ends on one of the series' best kills and finishes up down in the sewers for some tense stalking in this section which makes for an overall fun time. Along with the great Jason look here, these make this quite enjoyable to hold off the few flaws here. The biggest issue here is the film's really tame and near-bloodless kills here that are about as far removed from what should've been seen here as this one cuts out nearly everything to the point of barely containing anything. There really should've been some more to this one's kills where they've really become edited-down badly. Another minor issue is the rather weird inclusion here of the mini-Jason tormenting her whenever she's near water which isn't really that integral to the story since it doesn't give her anything to use against Jason or give him motivation to track her down, as instead it's more of a plot-thread about her guardian so this makes no sense other than stretching out the running time. The only other problematic part here is the single lamest kill here in the whole series of a single strangulation where it could've gone through several other attempts instead of what actually happened. These here are the film's only real flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a mild sex scene, drug use, and Attempted Rape.",

Jason was never at the bottom of the lake in child form like Rennie imagined (she's nuts if you can't tell) and has that cruise liner got the fewest ever crew you've ever seen? Sure has! I counted four! Jason should have stayed at home instead of going for a cruise but the film makers chose otherwise. I could write a million word essay on this movie with or without the pen Stephen King supposedly used in high school but i can't be bothered right now. A movie full of mistakes but still good. If you notice, the cook in the caf\u00e9 that gets chucked in to the mirror by Jason near the end is actually Ken Kerzinger who actually gets to play Jason in Freddy Vs Jason. Not the best Friday but not the weakest either. 8/10",

We watched Jason X first, and both agreed that it was pretty bad. And then we watched this..... Oh god this was horrible. To start, the concept is stupid, Jason going to Manhattan. Cities in New York are really over used in movies, no matter how good the movie may be. In the flashback at the beginning, of young Jason drowning, they COMPLETELY screwed up what his appearance is supposed to be. Jason was supposed to look like a bald, deformed child. In this, he has plenty of hair, and he looks like a normal little boy. Another thing, I do believe Jason SWIMS to that cruise thats headed towards Manhattan (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). Everyone who knows enough about Jason Voorhees and the Friday series should know that he can't swim, and that he's afraid of water. And even if I am wrong about that, why would they make him be on a boat, surrounded by water? And one incredibly stupid is when Jason is chasing those two people IN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, Jason scares those kids by lifting up his mask. And finally, the final scene in the sewer, Jason's hockey mask comes off, and you get to see his face. AND THEY SCREW THAT UP TOO. Again, Jason is supposed to look deformed. In this, they make him look like a zombie in those clich\u00e9' zombie movies. I could go on all day about how bad this movie is. Don't rent it. I seriously regret renting it, even if you want to rent a bad movie to get a laugh about it. This is a horrible movie, and I'm never watching it again. The end.",

I liked the first, fell in love with the second, third and fourth, loved the fifth even though it was really dumb and thought the sixth was an honest effort.  The seventh was bad but the eighth sinks to an all time low when it comes to the adventures of Jason Voorhees.  The first thing that is wrong with this is the title.  Jason Takes Manhatten.  Jason is not supposed to be in the city, he is not scary there.  He is supposed to be in the woods away from civilization where he can terrorize unsuspecting kids in the forest or at a cottage.  By putting him in the city it takes away the element of fear but more than that, it makes you question how any of these people could die.  Hello, New York is one of the biggest cities in the world, how hard can it be to get away? Could you imagine Indiana Jones in the same world that The Matrix took place in?  Kind of hard isn't it?    There is no suspence, no terror, no wondering or caring about who is going to live.  There is just idiocy.  And I know the Friday's are famous for their lack of continuity but please, how could that girl have possibly been attacked by Jason when she was a kid?  That is almost as bad as Chris' story from the third one ( remember the story about the hideous looking man that attacked her in the woods and then she passes out and wakes up in her bed ). This is just plain bad.  Really bad.  There was not one character that I really cared about and I was actually hoping that they would die, all of them.  What this Friday does is takes all that is good and creepy about the great ones and throws that out the window and tries to reinvent horror standards.  My gosh, it had only been nine years since the first came out when this one was made, is it really that hard to follow some of the original formula?  This is an abomination and a disgrace and even though I really didn't think part 9 was much better, I'm glad that it pretended that part 8 didn't exist.  What a terrible film and a bad bad bad bad bad Friday the 13th entry!!!",

            "content": "*spoilers*\"Friday the 13th, Part VIII\" is one of the more entertaining entries in this infamous slasher series. Most fans disliked it, partly due to its new settings, but I found it a refreshing, long-overdue change of pace. After the six previous sequels, I was getting tired of that same old summer camp, and I suspect even Jason might have felt that way by this point. It's an entertaining movie if not taken too seriously, especially the final act, where he chases potential victims all over the back alleys of New York City. The sewer finale is what a Jason movie is like at its cheesy best; pretty goofy if held up to the light of day, but fun to watch if you're in the right mood.Actually, its subtitle is a bit misleading. Much of the film takes place aboard a small cruise ship filled with students. That makes things a bit more interesting, due to their isolation in a confined space; it's not like they can just get up and run off. Perhaps it's too convenient that the bodies remain undiscovered for so long, but logic was never a priority in most slasher movies. Another point of consternation among fans was Jason's new teleporting ability, but that didn't bother me too much. If he truly has a supernatural hellspawn living within him, as the next film would reveal, it only stands to reason that he has other supernatural aspects that have not yet been touched upon. The bizarre subplot about the heroine's telepathic powers (shades of \"Friday 7\") are not adequately explained, but exposition never fit comfortably in the series. If it makes things more interesting, why not include it? All in good fun.On a technical level, this is arguably the most polished film in the series (with the possible exception of \"Jason X\"). More effort than usual was put into the lighting, and the camerawork is smooth and assured. Most of the time, it doesn't even look like a slasher movie. Though most of the Manhattan scenes were actually filmed in Canada, director Rob Hedden manages to preserve the illusion by a couple of brief, carefully inserted Times Square scenes. The acting is much better than usual for this type of film, especially a strong supporting performance from Peter Mark Richman as a coldhearted, overprotective uncle. Jensen Dagget is likable as the troubled heroine; overall the performances are credible, if not outstanding. At the very least, the characters are not nearly as obnoxious as they were in previous outings. Even the obligatory \"slut\" character is somewhat more tolerable than usual. The most ironic part is that the Big Apple is portrayed in such a nasty light that Jason himself doesn't seem too bad in comparison. Kane Hodder still makes him a compelling killer though.

As is the case with the other seven films, the film degenerates into the series' tired formula of the usual hack-&-slash, this time skipping back on the gore. It seems that the MPAA has had the last say. Instead, the killings are done with more imagination than the previous films. Jason, not only content with being an unkillable zombie, has now picked up the ability to teleport, an effect that is really daft. The acting is the same as the previous films, although the characters are given some personality, even if they are clich\u00e9d.

The American slasher film directed by Rob Hedden is the eighth instalment in the Friday the 13th film series and captures a time that was grittier, grimier and less polished with gore, rock music, big hair and make-up. That's not to say its' the best in series, its far from it. Hedden unnecessarily slips in more visions and dream sequences with Jensen Daggett's aqua-phobic Rennie Wickham character to keep up with the Nightmare on Elm St series. It's akin to part 7's New Blood shenanigans. Yes there are chronically time setting issues and plenty of inconsistencies but its own failing logic only adds to its wacky charm. Fred Mollin's amps up the score and puts a twist on Harry Manfredini's theme stings. There's also some great stunt work. Veteran actor Peter Mark Richman features and out shines the other actors as Charles McCulloch. Aside from Richman few leave a big impact. Kane Hodder is excellent as the gooier, rotting Jason Voorhees and makes this effort so watchable, there's plenty of effects and fun to be had in Hodder's portrayal. Director Rob Hedden offers some imaginative direction and visuals, it feels bigger than it should moving from Crystal Lake but doesn't deliver on its New York setting with much of the action taking place on cruise ship with (mis- sold) Maniac Cop-like Manhattan featuring at the end. Jason Takes Manhattan is at times wooden and choppy and while Hedden's change in setting offer some freshness the novelty wears off quickly.Jason kills using a harpoon gun, a guitar, slams a hot sauna rock into someone, decapitates someone else to name a few but the flow is nowhere as tight as The Final Chapter or Jason Lives. Of course there's some obligatory T & A, courteous of Sharlene Martin's Tamara and notably from Tiffany Paulsen as Suzi. Hodder saves this innings and as well as his little nuances as the masked killer we see Jason memorably in Times Square.Overall, it's totally mindless with some nice make-up effects but it's the epitome of a cash-in horror sequel.",

            "content": "Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan takes a brave step in a new direction, with pretty unintentionally hilarious results. Part VIII is the instalment which most people seem to enjoy slating, however I think that it is one of the better sequels. From the overly stereotypical teenagers, to the fantastically inventive locations and death scenes, Part VIII offers much more than just Jason's gruesome slayings, and is therefore better for it. The plot is very basic; Jason boards a luxury cruiser full of teenage college graduates on their way to New York. As sexual activities and drug abuse ensues aboard the boat, Jason slashes his way through the entire load of passengers, leaving just a handful of characters to roam around the Big Apple as he continues his stalk. The characters in this movie are fantastic; J.J. the weirdly sexy punk guitarist, Tamara the hot bitch, Evie the naive girl-friend, etc. Once again the Friday the 13th series doesn't fail to bring to our attention a wonderful array of weird and hilarious people to watch be killed off. The death scenes are brutal and inventive in this movie, however for a later sequel the gore and blood seems very trimmed, so you are left feeling cheated, as the gore is much more toned down and very tame. We're talking about the annoying way the camera cuts away as somebody is about to be killed, so all we see is a blood splatter, or a shadow, or a pained face, etc., so the gore is a great letdown. The script in this movie is also very painful, and the characters all seem to be spouting a load of unwitty nonsense at times. In this instalment we also get to see Jason as a young child as well, as background and past stories are weaved into the main plot, both between Jason Voorhees and Rennie, the main heroine of this sequel. The soundtrack to this instalment is upgraded to punk-rock, and gives it a less creepy, tense feel, but is actually blended well with the dank back alleys of New York. There are plenty of plot holes in this movie. The way New York is over-exaggerated as being a shithole is quite unrealistic, but it does go well with the whole gruesome, dark Jason theme. Overall Part VIII is rather loose and could have been much better if we'd have seen more of Jason actually in New York.",

There was camera guy, punk rock chick and hot naked girl with tattoos of body parts on her body - oh don't even try and have me remember any of their names.The deaths are all pretty bland although some stand out. The death in the hot girls bathroom was pretty nice, although I have to say I was rooting for Jason to just kill her anyway he wanted because she got annoying fast. The dance floor killing was pretty subdued but the use of the dance floor made it a little interesting. Oh and near the end where he drowns the teacher in a vat of waste, that was awesome.Jason looks pretty cool as well although I still think his look in Jason X was the best.

No-one would be silly enough to deny that the franchise follows a set formula, which is not directed to push the products towards Academy Award consideration. But seriously?I liked the idea in Part 7 of having a heroine with telekinetic powers, who could take the fight right up to Jason. But then in Part 8 things go awry from the very first scene, when we suddenly go from paddling canoes on Crystal Lake, to having large cabin cruises drift into the picture. Worse still, after the regulation resurrection and the opening kills, we suddenly have Jason apparently skippering the said boat to some marina, of a now suddenly expanded, gigantic Crystal Lake. Here you can apparently seek a berth on what appears to be small cruise liners, which journey to New York ... that's right, from a lake!Jason does so much swimming in this film, I figure he must have webbed feet inside those big boots of his, as well as gills, behind his hockey mask. So after swimming from his launch, the now water-loving serial - killer climbs the cruise liner's anchor chain to create his own brand of mayhem. Now a word here about the supporting cast. They are by and large the most annoyingly moronic bunch of characters, ever assembled for one of these kill fests. You can't help but barrack for Jason, as he goes through them like a dose of sea salts. The 2 leads are just deplorable. Rennie the virginal visionary constantly beset with images of baby Jason and the snivelling, sycophantic, wimpy boyfriend of hers, Sean. I mean they're supposed to demonstrate some heroic aspects aren't they? I just wanted to off these two myself asap! No redeeming features at all! And the chaperone uncle? Did he really need to be so nasty, as to teach his niece to swim, by tossing her into the middle of Crystal Lake?After Jason indirectly causes the liner to sink and the survivors row to the Manhattan docks, we then discover \"the city that never sleeps\", conveniently has a totally uninhabited wharf precinct. This no doubt warms the cockles of Jason's cold heart, after he swims to the same place, in pursuit of those on the life boat, which apparently didn't contain any sort of emergency equipment/beacons except for life jackets.More hilarity ensures when, after their ranks have been decimated by Jason, our 2 remaining heroes, clearly forget about the hideous deaths of their companions and their pursuing implacable foe, when suddenly hypnotised by the wonders of Time Square. Yes, they become like any 2 goggle - eyed, gawking tourists! When they eventually realise the chase is still on, instead of staying with the crowds and looking for police officers, they follow their instincts and climb down into the Big Apple sewers. Yeah right! Meanwhile Jason is taking Manhattan, by lifting his hockey mask and yelling boo! at passing bystanders. Yep! He's just seen as another lost soul wandering the streets.I've only skimmed the (Crystal Lake) surface here, but I can fully understand why Entertainment Weekly labeled Jason Takes Manhattan the eighth-worst sequel. ever made. The good ideas began and ended with taking the action away from Crystal Lake. By all means do that, but at least try to do it by semi-sensible means, with at least a half-way interesting group of potential victims and leads with a modicum of charisma. This was about as enjoyable as a jelly-fish sting.",

It takes Jason awhile to get to Manhattan, but alot of the movie deals with Jason's trip to Manhattan, and when he gets there, the entertainment does not let up at all. The MPAA has done alot to these movies, but they're still grand entertainment at the very least. Jason is taken down several times in the big apple, by Sean and Renny, but he keeps on tickin'. Near the film's finale we see Jason's face, once again and then he is splashed with toxic waste and turns into a little boy again. There has been so much talk about what happens between Part 8 and 9. Because The Final Friday, does not concern Jason at the beginning, leaving the big apple and returning to Camp Crystal Lake. But Jason does return.

If u liked any of the Friday the 13th movies, see this one. If u didn't, then don't. To me i prefer it all back at camp crystal lake, but somehow got changed to new york.

All this amounts to the second worst Friday installment (nothing can top the 5th entry).The loopholes here are major league, even by Friday standards. Jason gets from one place to the other at lightning pace and that's just irritating as hell. Some technique director Hedden was trying out, even comparing this film in some places to the work of Hitchcock! To me, it's just irritating. Yes, some people have made a big deal out of it's visual style, but the fourth entry has a lot more style than here. Hedden also makes silly changes in the legacy of Jason and the ending totally blows everything, the worst ending possible to tack onto this film.The characters are uninteresting to say the least. The film's leading lady is intolerable and her uncle (one-dimesional anyone!) is pretty tough to take. Some of her actions are so far out there (like sitting down, taking a breather and feeling sorry for her abuse since childhood while Jason is just around the corner) that I was nearly in tears. Ahhhh, there's so much incredibly stupid things to point out here that I can't even recommend this film to fans of the series. The others are sometimes stupid but none compare to this.On the plus side; it's quite funny at times, with some clever dialogue and a few chuckles when Jason finally arrives in \"Manhattan\". It was the most expensive Friday up to that point and it shows, every technical aspect well handled.In short; Not recommended.",

            "content": "This 8th part in the \"Friday the 13th\" series, called \"Jason Takes Manhattan\", sounds like a promising new addition to the Friday movies. In some ways, this movie is actually more creative than the previous sequels. In other ways, the movie misses out on many things.In this movie, Jason Voorhees is shocked back to life and climbs aboard a cruise ship filled with college students. The ship is heading for New York City, and Jason starts killing most of the people on board. Then later on, some remaining people survive and arrive at New York, with Jason following them...I must say that I love the very beginning of this movie. There are nice shots of New York City at night, as well as a great 80's song to begin the movie. However, the film doesn't really begin in New York; the scene shifts away to Camp Crystal Lake, where Jason is about to be resurrected by an electric shock from an underwater electric cable.Later on, the film introduces us to the characters that will board a ship, which Jason climbs aboard as the ship leaves for New York. Most of the film's run time is spent on the ship to explore the characters, while Jason hunts many of them down and starts killing them.The problem with this time spent on the ship is that it can get pretty boring just seeing the characters do dumb things. Thankfully, Jason kills them off quite well, although in not as good a fashion as in the previous sequels. There was just too much time spent on the ship and on useless characters.Another problem is the portrayal of New York City, when the few survivors (and Jason) finally get there. New York is a really dangerous place in the movie, with drug dealers and dirty barrels of toxic chemicals everywhere on the docking bays. I have never been in New York, but I'm sure the docks weren't that bad. I guess the film-makers had to make the docking bays look horrible so that the movie can remain a horror film.There are some good points, though. The idea of Jason being in a big city is fascinating, since Jason can finally get a taste of city life, rather than the usual forests on the outskirts of New Jersey (namely at Camp Crystal Lake). Also, the film seems to have borrowed elements from the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" films: The lead female character actually daydreams about a younger Jason in various parts of the movie.Overall, the best part of the movie is when the action happens in New York City. It's really interesting to see Jason stalking his victims in the Big Apple. If you're a fan of the \"Friday the 13th\" movies, then you might like this movie. However, don't expect it to be better than the sequels; it's just more creative than the sequels. Fast-forward to the last 30 minutes, when Jason & his victims are in New York City.I give this movie a 6/10.",

The only kill that's fun is when a guy gets his head punched off into a dumpster. This is absolutely the only moment that even kinda works.Everything else, and I mean everything, is terrible. Starting directly from the opening shot. The film opens with two people somehow sailing in crystal lake and inadvertently resurrecting Jason when their boat anchor hits an electrical line. A giant electric line running under water at crystal lake, that really happens. Then Jason proceeds to kill them in the most awkward way possible. Even part 1 and part 5, which are terrible, have more creativity in their kills.This whole film lacks in exactly that, creativity. They ran out of ideas for crystal lake, so now they go to Manhattan. Except that the majority of the film takes place on a boat. Which is quite possibly the lamest possible setting for a slasher movie. Kids sit around a boat while Jason somehow goes undetected onboard, killing at random. Lame.Then there's the makeup, which borders on amateurish. The kills are unconvincing at best and Jason, who was visually awesome in part 7, is possibly the lamest he's looked since bag head Jason. There's also this kid that randomly pops up who looks like a film student did the makeup. It all looks awful and cheap.The worst sin this commits is how boring it is. The characters are all utterly uninteresting and the story is primarily set on a boat traveling to where the film pretends to be set in the first place. If it couldn't get worse, this is the most 90s movie ever. Even though it was made in 1989, it's so 90s. The ugly clothes, the unfitting music, and especially the dialogue.There's just nothing worth talking about here. Every single thing is awful. It was so obviously slapped together to get a bunch of money. No one seemed to care or even try. All the kids look 30, the effects are cheap, and the writing is worse. Don't watch this.",

I mean it's the eighth instalment in a series where even the original film wasn't very good. I first saw this myself several years ago and thought it was appalling but I have now given it the benefit of the doubt and revisited it for a bit of mindless mayhem before I went to bed. And I have to admit, I now see it in a more positive light. Sure, it's derivative and formulaic as hell but it at least attempts to do something different with this franchise. Not only that but it's paced pretty well with a steady stream of Jason antics and ridiculous moments.The story in a nutshell has the supernatural lunatic Jason Voorhees reanimated by an underwater electric cable. Pretty soon he stows aboard a cruise ship of teenagers on their way to New York and you can more or less guess what happens next.The principal differentiating factor with this entry in the series is the move from Camp Crystal to a cruise ship and then Manhattan itself. This change of scenery does the film some favours, ensuring that the usual Voorhees slasher violence has a new setting at least. To be fair, despite this change this is strictly business as usual, with a plethora of killings all carried out in a slightly different way. A couple of standouts being a heavy metal chick killed by a pink flying-v guitar and a boxer sparring with Jason on a New York rooftop only to have his head literally punched off. The cast of characters is your usual bunch of teenage stereotypes and we also have veteran actor Peter Mark Richman put in an amusing performance as a spectacularly unreasonable teacher; at one point in a flashback he even shoves a little girl who can't swim into Crystal Lake \u2013 Boo! Hiss! Overall, despite the fact its derivative nonsense, this is actually quite fun nonsense. I've only seen another couple of films in this franchise so I am hardly an expert on it but this one may very well be the most entertaining I have seen.",

From what I've seen of the lake in previous films, it was surrounded on all sides by land. There was no channel a vessel could travel to lead it elsewhere, yet in this film it apparently provides a way to enter the Atlantic Ocean and travel to the city that never sleeps.The movie is quite boring, which it really shouldn't have been since it actually took place in a location other than Camp Crystal Lake, it should have been much better than this. Surprisingly the change of scenery is only marginally interesting. The latter half of the film is better than the first, but that isn't saying much.Overall, I'd say watch it on television if you must, but it is definitely not worth the rental.",

            "content": "By Jason Takes Manhattan, the producers and writers involved were well aware that people were watching Friday the 13th for Jason Voorhees and his inventive take on making hamburger out of the horny, unpleasant or just plain brutally stupid, and not the plots or the storyline. Let's face it, the storyline goes like this: '\u00a3@%\u00a3! Jason's back! Everybody scarper!' in all the movies. Part 8 is unafraid to have a self-deprecating laugh at itself, and uses some interesting settings to liven things up a bit.As such, it stands head and shoulders above the frustrating Jason Goes To Hell and the later but equally annoying Freddy vs Jason, as instead of trying to reinvent the slasher genre (an unwise move at best, never aided if you're a pretentious jerk with it, which is what killed both of them for me) JTM just builds on it and sets it some off-kilter places.The title is a tad misleading, but I find it unlikely anybody truly expected Friday to make it somewhere as upmarket as NY for a WHOLE film. Jason does indeed reach Manhattan eventually, but he doesn't so much take all of it as the docks, a train and a few run-down buildings. All the same, the settings, also involving a boat full of grad students which takes up the lion's share of the film, give the movie a much needed injection of energy.It really helps it, too. This movie is damned infectious. After an initially creaky opening, Jason kicks into high gear, and the movie flies out of the stalls at full whack. There really isn't much time to catch your breath once the movie's going, and only the most miserable of misery-guts could help getting swept along with it. Yeah there's a few clich\u00e9 characters, yeah I still really don't know how Jason managed to get up that staircase that fast given he was BEHIND the guy earlier, but this is a horror movie, not a heavy duty drama. As such it excels, and it feels good to be able to say that this is a rad movie, well worth your time.",

Upon awakening, and after killing two teenagers, he steals their boat and proceeds to the open sea, where he climbs on board a cruise ship containing a high school graduating class, whom he proceeds to decimate, until the ship sinks, and he(along with the survivors) square off for a final showdown in the city of Manhattan, New York.You have to love the honesty to use the subtitle \"Part VIII\", instead of trying to fool the audience by not referring to the actual number, like it isn't really a sequel. Director Rob Hedden manages to write a fairly imaginative story here with the beautiful Jensen Dagget as heroine Rennie, dealing with her latent psychic powers, as it seems that fate has decreed she will be the one to break the curse of Jason, destroying his body and freeing his soul once and for all, which was the intent of the thoughtful ending.Of course, this is still a routine killing picture, with the expected violence(though not as graphic as usual) and supporting characters quite similar to Part VII, and this film does not stray that far from formula, but it is IMO the best of the sequels(not the popular view I know!)which at least attempts something different, and brings the series to a fitting end...well, at least as Paramount is concerned, though sadly another studio would get its hands on this franchise, in a series of films I choose to ignore!

I could even swallow the first couple of deaths, because the victims were caught with their pants down (both figuratively and literally) and they did not know what hit them, but when it became clear to everyone what was happening, why the hell they did not stick together, but allowed Jason to massacre them one by one ... And I better not comment on Jason's teleportation abilities. Additionally, I was pissed about propaganda against metalheads. All of the victims are fine shorthaired athletes, and long-haired characters of the rocker's image are portrayed as drug addicts, thieves, thugs, killers, rapists. And on top of that, the only metalhead victim, cool female glam guitarist, ended up dying first, so she had the smallest role. FY writers!5/10",

Yes, it is more ridiculous than Jason surviving the end times of Earth and becomes a space killer in the future. Yes, it is more ridiculous than a zombie killing machine fighting Freddy Kreuger, a creature of dreams (zombies dream?). Yes, it is even more ridiculous than the \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" crossover that is in the works, where Jason kills Congress (this is really in the works) (not really).That said, this is a stupid movie. Jason is awakened from his death in Part VII (he was at the bottom of Crystal Lake) by a lightning bolt. Apparently, Jason just needed a jump start. As usual, Jason decides to kill the naughty teens of the Crystal Lake area. However, this time, the kids are taking a senior cruise. On Crystal Lake. To New York City. They went from a lake to New York City by boat. Of course, Jason starts killing people well before they land in New York, and the kids are forced into lifeboats that drift toward the city in a way that allows them to pass the Statue of Liberty. So, I guess the geography lesson we learn in this movie is that Crystal Lake is located in the Atlantic Ocean, because they certainly came to New York from the East.Another interesting tidbit we learn in this film is that Jason doesn't hate people or teens...he hates CRYSTAL LAKE people and teens. When Jason comes to New York, he doesn't just start a killing rampage, he tracks down the six people from his home town and proceeds to kill their faces off. What does this teach us about Jason? Obviously, he spends his time between murder rampages being a private investigator. He was able to find six people in New York City in one night with absolutely no problem. I would like to see this idea made into a movie. It would be like a cross between Shaft, Shaft in Africa, and Shaft is an Unkillable Zombie (Sucka!).Another fascinating part of this movie is the fact that Jason develops the ability to teleport. Well, there is no attempt to explain how he moves faster that some of his victims, so I suppose it's closer to \"Droopy-portation.\" You know how...you can run to the top of a mountain, lock yourself in a safe, and Droopy (you know, the cartoon dog) will still be right behind you. Jason takes a page from Droopy's book in this film. A kid might be climbling up a ladder with Jason on the ground below him, but through the magic of Droopy-portation, Jason appears on the top of the ladder, ready to kill.For added fun, try to identify the city this movie takes place in. It is clearly not New York. My best guess is Detroit, although it could have been filmed in a garage, too.",

By now the makers were trying to come up with new ideas to keep the series afloat, here the gimmick is to take Vorhees out of his Camp Crystal Lake \"comfort\" zone, and pitch him on a boat - a boat which naturally is full of ripe high schoolers who are ripe for killing in variously gruesome ways. The presence of Manhattan in the title is not wholly accurate since three quarters of the pic is set on the said boat, with standard series rules applying, though Vorhees seems to have attained the dexterity of a paratrooper given that he remarkably appears in kill scenes where the time frame is impossible for him to do so. The sequences in Manhattan are fun, which only makes one lament that more time wasn't spent on this particular gimmick.The acting is generally weak, while the effects work is standard fare - though the cinematography (Bryan England) is very impressive. So all told, it's another divisive \"Friday\" sequel, from breasts and butts, to blood and bone, and onto The Big Apple, part 8 you will either hate or think it's great. 6/10",

The film can be enjoyable enough to watch at times, mostly in an ironic viewing sort of way, but it can be entertaining. One kill was satisfying, the stereotypical annoying bratty teen, but besides that, the kills in the film are honestly quite hilarious and impractical. Let's start with the acting, because by god its awful. Scott Reeves and proves to be okay in his role, as well as the actress who played the teacher (whose name I couldn't find), but the other so called 'talent' surrounding is quite hilariously bad. I don't even know where to start with all of that, but there is sure to be some laughs throughout due to the ridiculousness of it all, except of course Peter Mark Richman performance as stuck up teacher 101. The plot is ridiculous and incredibly dragged out, and even longer than usual for some dumb reason. Only 1/3 of the film actually takes place in Manhattan and when it does, it doesn't help the film become anything than more ridiculous. Its entertaining, but an incredibly flawed and messy pointless sequel that is not quite a disaster, but close. It's better than some of the other sequels that came before it, but ultimately Jason Takes Manhattan is a dud best served with a large glass of irony. Take it or leave it.My Rating: 5/10.",

This is the weakest in the series though there are 3.5 good elements which want me to give this a 5. Look I mean I was close on giving this a 4 though it picked up a little bit with these things: Kane Hodder did a great job at being Jason Voorhees. He truly does a menacing, stunt like, risk taking monster.In this film there is intense music and the theme Darkest Side Of The Night is enjoyable to listen to.The Kills like any Friday the 13th are awesome and fun to watch.The Story line is OK though it could of being more high up like the other Friday the 13th. The other Fridays had a creepy side and this one just doesn't come level and razor with it.Noiw I'm going to talk about the things that could of been improved on and the things that are an utter fail: This film is too Predictable. Every time someone is somewhere, we just see Jason sneak on them. With the girl with the rockin guitar for an example, it was obvious that when she went down to the boiler room, Jason was going to go after her. There are many other scenes that do this and that's why I found this film predictable all the time. The Other Friday the 13ths where never predictable. It was a long wait and then Jason would just attack, but here all we have is Jason on a gory rampage.The film is also very unrealistic. I believe that this 13th film is shitty in the way it's trying to be realistic. In any Horror film, we see one Horror icon in the corner, and then seconds later, we'll see it behind a car or in front of a tree. But it only happened from time to time. Here it's a major problem. They keep up this thing that I've just talked about though they are making Jason move from one place to the other every 5 seconds and in different scenes, it just keeps happening. For example I found it stupid when the Asian woman was getting chased by Jason. Every corner she turned he was there. When she tried another corner, he was there quick before her, WTF!?, and then Jason chasing Remmie's uncle/principal. Jason was standing near a trash pile and the principal ran away, and into a building. As he gets in there Jason is already there and throws him out of a second story window. That's just stupid.There is also bad acting and some of the things that relate to this movie are weird.This film is also a blow up because it's not set at Crystal Lake, and it doesn't have that chilling, eerie feeling because it's not set at Crystal Lake.Anyway that it. I'm going to be fair because even if this film shits big time, there are small elements that make the film alright. It's watchable. 5/10",

Why, you ask? It's so beyond cheesy, that it turns around and is so much fun, I just loved Jason being in New York, how could the world's toughest city handle big, scary Jason Vorhees? Well, I'd say they took him on very well, lol. I just also loved how this movie made me think of Titanic in some sick way, it was like \"Jason vs. Titanic\" as well with the kids being on the boat. It just added so much, the characters are way over done and nothing in this film is done right, but that's what makes the film just so much fun and it delivers as a fun Friday the 13th sequel.A group of teens go on a field trip/cruise, including a girl who is an orphan and one of the teachers took pity upon and let her come, but she is mocked by the other peers. But when Jason comes aboard, he is ready to take on these horrible teens, and when the ship aboards Manhatten, New York is taken in for a very big surprise with what is just a normal thug not to be taken too seriously.The ironic humor in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan is what makes the film one of my favorites. I just loved when Jason is walking the streets and he sees the group of punk teenagers and it takes the kids a few minutes to realize that this is a guy not to be messed with. This is just a fun sequel and I loved it, I'd love to see it again for a good laugh, believe me, this is a sequel not to be missed.5/10",

Not that that's bad but the music and hairstyles are extremely dated. But the 80s are cool so there isn't an issue there. When they finally get to Manhattan there are some cool parts like when Jason smashes through glass. For some reason the Manhattan bits reminded me of the first Ninja Turtles movie. Also(SEMI SPOILER)thank God the movie has the heart not to kill the dog. When you kill a person in the movie it's whatever but when you kill an animal it's much worse.

Worse yet, Jason just doesn't seem that scary or menacing either walking through the corridors of a cruise ship or stomping around urban back alleys.

After climbing on board a cruise boat en route for the big city, the lumbering killer proceeds to hack and slice his way through the passengers: a group of graduates celebrating finishing school.When a handful of survivors manage to escape Jason's maggoty grasp by rowing into New York Harbour in a lifeboat, they believe that they are finally safe. But Jason\u0097never happy at leaving anyone breathing\u0097is not far behind. And besides, New York has plenty of dangers of its own.Although the new locales in Pt. VIII make a welcome change from wooden cabins and abandoned barns, it's not enough to stop this episode being yet another disappointing sequel. Once again, ridiculous plot developments illicit laughs rather than screams, with the silliest moments seeing Jason using supernatural powers to teleport around the boat, a boxer throwing repeated punches at Jason's face (not quite appreciating that a hockey mask is supposed to protect the wearer from harm), and an aspiring film-maker who has lost his glasses looking through the viewfinder of a video camera in order to help focus his vision.However, it is the severe lack of gory deaths that really hurt this film: the camera either cuts too quickly from the kill, or the method used by Jason is simply not gruesome enough. Strangulation, electrocution and drowning in a barrel of green muck just don't cut it, Mr. Vorhees!Jason's actual rampage through the city is also lacklustre, being fairly brief, featuring only one half-decent death scene (a fun decapitation), and ending with the ugly murdering mofo pursuing his quarry into the New York sewers only to be dissolved by a flood of toxic waste (that apparently courses through the system every night\u0097shyeah right!).3.5 out of 10, rounded up to 4 for IMDb.",

Some of the deaths are really elaborate. There's also quite a few hallucinatory dream sequences involving Jason as a boy. (As a side note: Why hasn't anyone ever questioned how Jason could drown as a boy, but come back as a hockey-masked adult?) Eventually, Jason and the survivors DO reach the Big Apple. But we only get to see Time Square once. The rest of the time, the cast stumbles around the seediest wharfs, the grimiest sewers, and generally just runs away helplessly from Jason. One teen actually tries boxing the crap out of him. But to no avail. Though I'm griping, this film is likable and entertaining. And it does bring things to a satisfying conclusion.

He then replies, \"Just remembering this summer camp, where all those murders took place....\". She then unbelievably replies \"What murders?!\". WHAT MURDERS???!!!!, is she and the writers of the script and storyline insane???!!!. In England, everyone has heard of Jack the ripper, and how many murders did he carry out?. Not many. In America, there have been many serial killers that have gone on a insane rampage and how many have they murdered?, possibly in extreme cases 10-15 and American people have heard of those unique cases. It's different though with Jason Voorhees though isn't it. He must have killed over 200 people up to part 8 and she's acting like she has never heard of him!.

I think the biggest problem is that a prospective viewer might expect a lot more Manhattan action because of the title. If it had been called, say, JASON TAKES A CRUISE, your reaction after seeing it might have been: \"wow, that's a neat change of pace...and I think it was really cool seeing Jason in Manhattan at the end! I didn't expect that!\" If a good movie like GONE WITH THE WIND had been called something like ADVENTURES IN HAWAII (I know I'm exaggerating) would that change what was actually in the film itself?Jason continues doing what he does best: dispatching teens in inventive new ways for no reason other than that's what he likes to do. This is all I expect from a FRIDAY film, and it is what I got from this one. I also like the ways Jason gets revived in the later films. It reminds me of the old classic Frankenstein films.The acting is weak in this one, that is for certain. There are some goings-on which don't seem to make sense, like the boy image of Jason which keeps popping up. To my mind, I think that this is the way the lead girl views Jason. Whenever she thinks of him, she sees a boy version of him. If you look at it this way, the ending makes more sense because it's only in the girl's troubled mind that she sees the image of a boy. To anybody else that would view the body, it's just our favorite hockey-masked thug. When Jason meets his end, for our leading lady it also ends her hallucinations.It's true that the movie doesn't deliver when expecting more from its title. But as a person living close to the city, I'm glad they filmmakers tried a different approach in the Big Apple.",

Pretty flimsy start but at least we're on our way to New York, right? Well, sort of. Jason doesn't actually get there for a long time. The majority of the film is spent on the ship and this is pretty routine slasher stuff with Jason dispatching several annoying young people.

            "content": "Released in 1989, \"Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\" is a nice change of pace as the series was suffering from banality at this point; the previous installment is a prime example (people complain about Part V but at least it had an interesting new story angle with Tommy Jarvis going to the halfway house in the woods seeking succor for his psychological trauma, etc.). Part VII tried something new with the Carrie-like protagonist, and that entry has a great finale, but it was hampered by a subpar, amateurish script.Part VIII changes things up by switching the normal location of Crystal Lake (and surrounding area) to a ship going to Manhattan with a group of high school kids and adults aboard. Of course, Jason also gets on the vessel and starts systematically wiping out the youths. A handful of them make it to Manhattan, but so does Jason! The different setting is what distinguishes Part VIII.The story is split into four parts: The prologue takes place on Crystal Lake and features Jason's resurrection, which is a great opening. The brief first act takes place down the river from Crystal Lake at a docking inlet where the youths & adults board the vessel. The long second act takes place on the ship and the final act involves the survivors on a lifeboat and their adventures in Manhattan pursued by Jason.Winsome Jensen Daggett stands out as the heroine Rennie and places as one of my top 3 or 4 Friday girls. Peter Mark Richman is also notable as Rennie's peculiar uncle/guardian and Scott Reeves as Rennie's sort-of boyfriend. Sharlene Martin is a highlight as Tamara and the filmmakers show off her physique, but she's so devious that she's a turn-off despite her good looks. Kelly Hu is also on hand.The main complaint I hear about this entry is that it's called \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" but only the final act takes place in the city. This criticism never made any sense to me as the film spends more than enough time in the big city, the final 37 minutes, not to mention an opening snippet. The fact that the entire second act occurs on the ship keeps the movie from being one-dimensional.This installment reveals that a fairly large river flows from Crystal Lake to an inlet with access to the ocean. The yacht in the beginning drifts down the river to the bay where the ship is docked. This is how Jason inconspicuously reaches the inlet. If there's any doubt about this (due to the mistaken claim that the docking inlet IS Crystal Lake), pay attention to what the crazy deckhand says later on.As far as locations go, Part VIII was shot in Vancouver & Britannia Beach, British Columbia; Los Angeles (the alley way & wharf scenes); and New York City.BOTTOM LINE: Part VIII is a worthy entry in the series and is notable for trying something new by placing the main cast in a cruise ship environment and the big city, plus Jensen Daggett is a highlight as the female protagonist. It's actually better than Part III and VII. Interestingly, Jason's facial F/X (shown at the end) aren't as good as the previous two installments, but they're serviceable.The film runs 100 minutes.GRADE: B-",

In the course of several bloody events they always try to built up some sort of deep, emotional story over the Chrystal Lake legend. This one actually tries to milk desperately some tears out of audience. No success in that, but lets look at this peace of art as a standard slasher entertainment: The story is quite pathetic but thats no problem, it always is. Good thing about it is that the movie actually is very fast-paced without the usual one-hour-nonsense in the beginning. The killing spree starts off right away as the body-count keeps increasing into massive rates towards the ending. Even though not much of gore is shown, but it's always nice to see stupid, I mean STUPID teenagers die. Overall we see few hilarious scenes with the new more humorous and laid-back Jason. For example a decapitation with a punch of a fist! The movie should be titled instead \"Jason Goes Sailing\" as most of it happens on a ship on it's way to New York.

I'm a Diehard jason fan and i love this movie. Overall the second best in the series in my opinon. Friday the 13th part 7 The New Blood And Friday the 13th part 8 Jason takes manhatten are the best in the series both are excellent **** to me. See part 7 and part 8 i strongly recommend them there not a waste.",

(like in every Friday the 13th ever) The boy in it tells his girlfriend about the legend of Jason Voorhees, and she is worried. However, he isn't bothered by it. They throw an anchor down in Crystal Lake which catches Jason underwater tied up in loads of chains. The anchor is then hit with lightning, bringing Jason back to life. He kills the two teenagers and then the movie really starts.The next day we see high school grads on a boat on a trip to Manhattan. All of a sudden, the killing start up. Everybody suspects it is Jason, but the trip organiser is not convinced. They round up weapons and try and chase Jason down, but nearly everyone gets killed. Some of the grads and parents manage to get away on a dinghy, but Jason follows them to Manhattan without the people knowing.They arrive at Manhattan, where Rennie (the main character behind Jason) is kidnapped. The rest of the gang try to find here, but along the way 3 of the gang are killed, along with a police officer. The two survivors (Rennie and Scott) manager to avoid Jason for a while, before finally killing him with a bucket of acid to the face then finally being finished off with thousands of litres of water wiping him, turning Jason back to the deformed child he was.All in all, this movie rocked. Great deaths, (such as Julius getting his block knocked off by Jason), great story, great acting, and great setting! This movie definitely deserves ten stars.",

He wanted to kill Jason for good but fans told him that Jason always would come back. Again Kane Hodder appears as Jason and again he's a brutal Jason but less then in part 7. But things really go wrong here. Bringing back the Jason as a kid wasn't a good idea. And the title does mislead you too, it's just 15 minutes in Manhattan, all the rest is aboard a ship. The killings are really lame. As you can watch on the deluxe version the director told us that MPAA wasn't happy with this flick and had cut it roughly. You can see the slashed scene's on the disc but there wasn't that much gore in it as part 7. But for me the biggest mistake was as I told before bringing back young Jason. He appears as a ghost and at the ending of the film Jason so-called dies and his body returns into young Jason. This wasn't bloody or suspenseful, it was just another part with some bad mistakes about Jason...to be continued, sigh",

When he aboard on a cruise ship with a full of graduating high school kids.Written and Directed by Rob Hedden made an flawed but surprisingly well made slasher film that is certainly less bloody than most. This one is nicely shot, well produced and even nostalgic. Some might called this, the best or the worst of the \"Friday the 13th\" series. But Hedden's script is preposterous, the connection between Rennie (Played by Jensen Daggett) and Jason doesn't always make sense. Unless she's graduated attending her 30 year Reunion (!) as a example. This would be the last \"Friday the 13th\" film to be produced at Paramount. Then later \"Jason Goes to Hell:The Final Friday\", \"Jason X\" and \"Freddy Vs. Jason\" was produced by New Line Cinema.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD doesn't have no extras but the DVD Box Set from \"Friday the 13th\" series, it has an interesting commentary track by the director, interviews with the director & actor:Hodder and the original theatrical teaser is a hoot. This eighth film might have been more successful at the box office, if the movie was re-titled \"Jason Takes on a Cruise Ship\". Which the director explained in the interview from the DVD extras that in his original script, the movie was supposed to take place 2/3 in New York City and then the last third in a Cruise Ship. The plot got flip over because of budget reasons.Because of that, the picture was mis-marketed and it was lowest grosses of the series for Paramount. The film is quite long, heavy handed at times and it has an unsatisfying conclusion that nearly knocks it down but the movie is pretty good, visually clever at times and it has amusing sense of humour. Die Hard fans of the series won't probably enjoy this one but director Hedden did the best he could with this one and brings the best performances from his cast. Which makes this most well acted in the series. Watch for an young Kelly Hu (Best known for The Scorpian King and X-Men 2 as \"Yuriko Oyama/Deathstrike\") as one of Jason's victims. Canadian Stuntman:Ken Kirzinger appears in a cameo in the diner scene. Which Kirzinger went on to play Jason Voorhees in the already camp classic hit \"Freddy Vs. Jason\". (***/*****).",

            "content": "Going into this I already heard this was considered to be one of the worst F13 movies ever made. But it didn't think it could be that bad.Now what I mean with bad isn't that this movie is nothing like any other F13 movie. But what this movie does more than any of the ones that came before is be boring. The acting and writing in this movie is atrocious, bland and downright dumb. With most previous movies the main girl was always at least a decent enough actress but here even she is putting in nothing of value.The directing is slow and awkward at times, mainly due to the script as well but what also ruined this movie a bunch was the audio. So many silent awkward moments and scenes, and so much lack of suspenseful music during jason scenes. There's also a lack of the iconic F13 soundtrack, it's used very rarely, a New blood definitely that it better in that respect. Also they made Jason much more audible, as in weird monster growls and breathing. I'm fine with breathing but growling feels very odd for the silent killer that he is.Now what really made me put down this score were the final 10 minutes of the movies, in particular the scene in which Jason turns into a scared boy who doesn't'' want to drown? Like how is this even a thing?!! First off he is freakin supernatural and was awoken with an electric current *underwater*. Secondly Jason *swam* to manhattan because the cruise ship's engine stopped working and there were no more lifeboats. But suddenly he is afraid of water, so much that it kills jason?! Not to mention the fact he emerges from water and walked into water multiple times in the previous films. If anything Jason is one with water.Another thing this film does is throwing any kind of Jason logic out the window, he can just teleport, deal with it. And they just use it in egregious ways removing any type of chase suspense.The kills were a huge letdown as well aside from the very funny kills where he punches the head off the boxer kid. But besides from that all of them were very bland. And I have to say so far in this franchise this movie has got to have the WORST throat slit ever, like literally 1 drop of blood 5 whole seconds after the slid in weird slow motion.That also another thing, they did a lot more odd frame by frame slow motion stuff which just felt really out of place. It wasn't the worst thing in the world, just not great.Now about the practical effects and jason, I think jason looked pretty good throughout the movie, even at the end. What they did for boy jason though was comical, non of it ever worked for me and It didn't help that the actor (especially during the mirror scene) failed to sell the look.Also, the damn dog somehow got to Manhattan from the stranded cruise ship by itself and found the main girl and guy in the middle of new york. Makes sense.Now about the whole title ''viewerbait'' thing, yeah only 25 or so minutes take place in new york and most of that is sewers and alleyways but I guess some of the shots are cool, especially the one in the metro. Just seeing Jason somewhere not crystal lake is fun. That said, the movie did start out with a whole cinematic overview of new york with voiceover and everything so it's kinda lame it turned out to be 70% cruiseship. Reminds me of Jurassic Park II and its 20 minutes in the city.Why I rate this one of the worst in the franchise is simply because of the characters, lack of synergy, extremely bad writing decisions and audio/editing/directing. It's not just boring or bland, but actually bad.2/10 nope nope nope",

I suppose that's a good thing, because when a movie is this horrifically bad, it's probably best to put it out of mind. There's really not much here to enjoy - characters with zero depth (less than usual in a Friday movie), lame attempts at humor, an inappropriate score, ridiculous dialogue, horrible acting, and not a single scare in sight. But I suppose the two things I disliked the most were the setting and Jason. I didn't mind the boat/ship stuff as much as most people, but Manhattan - how stupid. Jason is a feral, forest being. Take him out of the woods and it just doesn't feel right. My complaint with Jason is that in JTM, he's given the power to \"teleport\" far greater than we've seen in past movies. There's a scene where a character gets clear of Jason. She's way ahead of him. Looking over her shoulder (at Jason trailing behind, I presume), she quickly climbs a ladder.\nImmediately, Jason throws her through a window. How'd he get up there that fast?Honestly, I could go on and on. But really, what's the point? It's like shooting fish in a barrel. Overall, a silly movie with little entertainment value. I may need to revisit Part V. I don't remember it being this bad.3/10",

Unknown to them the anchor is tugging away at some electricity cables at the bottom of the lake which eventually break & send huge amounts of electricity pulsating through the corpse of the notorious ice hockey mask wearing serial killer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) which brings him back to life, it's not long before Jim & Suzi become Jason's latest victims. A group of college graduates from Crystal Lake are about to set sail on a trip to New York but they have an unexpected passenger as Jason decides to gatecrash the party in a way only he can... A rock chick named J.J Jarrett (Saffron Henderson) becomes Jason's first victim when she has her head bashed in, the first victim but far from the last if Jason has anything to do with it...Written & directed by Rob Hedden this is the eighth film in the long running Friday the 13th franchise, I have to be honest & say I'm a fan of the series & while Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan isn't exactly the best film in the world I found it enjoyable & entertaining if nothing else. The script tries something a bit different this time around, it's the first time the series really dared to do something radically different from the original Friday the 13th (1980) all those years ago. Jason's still here, the hockey mask is still here, the mindless teens are still here, the killings are still here & the only thing that's changed significantly is the location. This is still a Friday the 13th film as far as I'm concerned. There's even a bit of The Poseidon Adventure (1972) hiding in here as well as the boat runs into trouble & starts to flood & the film is pretty cool when it gets to Times Square & to see Jason strutting his stuff there. I thought there was a bit too much unnecessary & pointless excess character development in this one, like Tamara Mason (Sharlene Martin) who gets a lot of screen time during the first half but is then killed off & forgotten, nor did I like the way Rennie (Jensen Daggett) had lots of supernatural encounters with the young Jason & it's never explained properly whether these were in fact 'reality' or just in her head. Anyway, it moves along at a nice pace, there's some decent kills, Jason's in it a lot & I personally liked it, it's not the best Friday the 13th film but it's a lot better than the next instalment Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1990).Director Hedden does a decent job & the film looks OK, there isn't much style to it but the kills are reasonably well handled & Jason is as cool as ever. As with most of the Friday the 13th's this was cut to get a certain rating right down to one scene being totally re-shot & another shot five different ways & Hedden being forced to use the least gory take. What's left is a little on the tame side, a few impalings, some stabbings, a hot rock shoved into someone's stomach, a cool decapitation, a bloodless slit throat, someone has a needle pushed through their body, someone has their head bashed in with a guitar, someone is electrocuted & there are a few dead bodies. We also get to see Jason's rotten & mouldy face at the end when he takes his iconic mask off, a scene which contains some neat special effects.With a supposed budget of about $5,000,000 Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan is generally well made & competent throughout although some of the scenes supposedly shot in New York obviously aren't. The acting isn't up to much in this one & Scott Reeves makes for a dull hero.Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan is an enjoyable entry in the series in my opinion, it's not the best Friday the 13th but it's not the worst either. A must for fans of the series, like me so maybe I was prepared to cut it a bit more slack than most folk would.",

Unbeknownst to her and the rest of the passengers, Jason Voorhees, recently resurrected and VERY PO'd, has already boarded the ship and is looking for irresponsible teens to slaughter. Rennie, her boyfriend, her sadistic jerk of an uncle and a very small handful of survivors manage to escape the ship and dock in New York harbor before Jason can kill them too...but Jason is not so easily left behind. The huge and hulking hockey masked killer follows Rennie and her friends right into Times Square.This is yet another semi-brainless installment in the never ending teen slaughter-fest that is Friday the 13th, and yet I really enjoyed this 8th sequel. It's nice to see Jason taken out of Crystal Lake and transplanted elsewhere for a change. Kane Hodder is and remains my favorite incarnation of Jason Voorhees and his performance here is nothing short of amazing: the man somehow manages to make Jason express explosive rage, childlike curiosity, impatience, disgust and even dry humor, all from behind an expressionless hockey mask. My favorite scenes are all of him: Jason peering up at a billboard advertising a hockey team, Jason flipping his mask up and revealing his rotting visage to a group of punks, Jason knocking a guys head off, Jason throwing Ken Kirzinger (the future Mr. Voorhees) across a diner and into a mirror. Jason Voorhees has never been more frightening and cool than when played by Hodder, and watching Jason plow through back alleys, a subway train and the New York sewer system is exhilarating great fun! You'll be rooting for Jason in several scenes, such as when Jason unintentionally \"rescues\" Rennie from rape or slams the jerk of an uncle head first into a rain barrel.The body count is high and bloody, the teens one-dimensional and vacuous - the better to enjoy the slaughter - and the action unrelenting. And though it is true that Jason spends far more time on the cruise ship than in Manhattan itself, its a forgivable mishap. Once Jason enters Times Square you'll have forgotten about the ship anyway. Longtime hardcore fans of the series will probably enjoy this offering of cinematic junk food and appreciate it for what it is - harmless fun. 7 out of 10 stars for Jason takes Manhattan.",

I'll tell you flat out and say this movie sucked! It sucked then and it sucks now! The title of this movie is so misleading that it may make you upset if you were hoping to see Jason taking hostages and making all sorts of demands that could never possibly be honored. No, this movie is primo garbage in a bevy of different ways, not the least of which is the almost complete absence of gore. Apparently they cut it all out. Not that it would have helped the movie much but it would've been a more involving experience. There are one or two creative deaths, the \"take your best shot\" scene being the most memorable. Chances are, anyone who's seen this funky sock of a movie will remember that scene as well.The one thing you will hear the most about the movie is that about three quarters of it takes place on a boat. \"What?\", you say. Believe me when I tell you that this is indeed a sad yet true fact. Most of the people that die get it on the boat. I don't remember the details but somehow the boat gets messed up pretty bad and the survivors escape and float over to Manhattan, where they are immediately greeted by the best that the city has to offer, i.e. drug dealers, bums, street gangs, etc. Jason mangles a few people and it's edited down to a watery flavor whenever it happens. There's one part that will probably make you laugh and it's when Jason, about to skewer our heroes on a train that is unlike any Manhattan train I have ever ridden in my twenty eight years (and believe me, I've ridden them all), loses his balance when one of the kids pulls the emergency brake and slides across the entire car on his back. And then he gets up and does everything short of ask the passengers in the crowded car if they saw him bust his ass. It is the best thing about this movie. Sigh.Anyway, I think my biggest gripe with this flick is that they manage to make Manhattan look like more of a cesspool than it actually is. There's a scene where two people running from Jason on Times Square (!) turn a corner and END UP IN A DEAD END ALLEY. From Times Square! What the hell is that all about? Anyway, I'm gonna stop here. Unless you are a die hard Jason maniac, I'd strongly suggest that you avoid it. Seriously. Thank me later.RATING: 1/2* out of *****",

It's certainly telling that Part VIII is so stupid and insulting to F13 fans that no one wanted to officially follow it up for two decades.Director Rob Hedden is so clueless in his handling of the relatively simple Jason character that one suspects he either chose not to see any of the other films in the Friday series before setting out to make this piece of crap, or he simply thought that discarding every element that made even the most marginal sequels fun to watch would somehow strike filmatic gold. Jason's primary purpose throughout this series is to kill people off in gruesome ways, right? However, in this film, for every creative kill (such as the admittedly original sauna rock meets chest cavity gag), there is a rote piece of minor mayhem that would be more at home in a PG film. After watching Jason use cutlery and brute strength in fascinating ways for 7 films, seeing him limit himself to a strangulation and drowning here is quite a downer. Even the scene where Jason literally punches someone's head off, which should be cool since it has someone's head getting literally punched off, plays out with an air of idiocy on par with the rest of this wretched excursion.Aside from spitting in the face of Friday fans with the absence of gore and the borderline blasphemous change of scenery, the sheer absurdity and disregard of anything resembling coherence here is beyond anything we've previously seen in a series already well known for testing its audience's ability to suspend their disbelief. Our heroine Rennie is haunted throughout the film by the ghost of Jason as a boy (?!) for no apparent reason, which sets us up for a climax where Jason as we know him is caught in a flood of toxic waste that somehow transforms him from our lovable murderous behemoth (who, pathetically, looks and sounds like a stillborn Muppet when his mask comes off) into the sniveling little boy we see in Rennie's visions. To further make this bit of nonsense difficult to digest, young Jason appears throughout the film with almost zero facial deformity and a full head of hair, which, short of Rennie seeing a little girl instead, couldn't be more ignorant of the Jason mythos. But, wait, it gets better! In one of Rennie's visions, lil' Jason manifests as the bald and misshapen lad we're familiar with, only to magically grow his hair back and lose his disfigurements the next time we see him. Make up your mind, Rob...The tone of the film is particularly disjointed, utilizing almost no intentional humor yet reveling in the absurd with such abandon that we're almost certain by the end that Hedden was setting out to make a comedy. The fact that the film opens and closes with a badly aged 80's song that sounds more like a \"Miami Vice\" plot-summary montage tune certainly doesn't help matters either.Even the actors seem confused as they go through the motions. Consider the emotional apex late in the film when Rennie recounts the story of finding out her parents were killed in a car accident, to which her boyfriend replies, \"that's not going to happen this time.\" Good call, dude. It's good to reassure Rennie that being chased through the alleys of New York by Jason is not going to cause her parents to somehow come back to life and die in a car crash for a second time.While the film doesn't succeed as an effective Friday The 13th sequel, or even as a \"watchable movie\", it does provide some truly fascinating little known facts about New York. For instance, did you know that in New York City, there are barrels of toxic waste just sitting around in alleyways? To be fair, this is one of the few points that is consistent with the film's concussed logic, since a sanitation worker tells us later that the sewers become flooded with toxic waste every night at midnight (??!!).We are also illuminated on a few fallacies that the series to this point had failed to illustrate. Like the fact that Crystal Lake isn't a lake at all, but is actually attached to the Atlantic Ocean, thus allowing Jason to cling to the departing cruise ship most of the film takes place on and set sail for New York. Thanks for filling us in, Rob Hedden! Still, you have to sympathize with hapless Rennie, who throughout the film endures the deaths of virtually everyone she knows, gets stalked by a merciless killer, nearly freezes in a life boat for hours, then gets mugged, kidnapped, shot up with heroin, and almost raped by two thugs IMMEDIATELY after finding the relative safety of New York. The poor gal certainly has a legitimate claim for \"worst day ever\". Appearing in this steaming pile of pig-vomit certainly doesn't make things any better for her either.If all of this ranting makes this film sound like a \"so bad it's good\" contender, don't be misled. I cannot stress enough how awful this film is, or how ineptly the makers of this tripe handle material that should pretty much write itself. Jason Takes Manhattan is an abomination, and a definite contender for the \"Worst Film Of All Time Not Starring Rob Schneider\" trophy. Now THAT'S scary...",

            "content": "I guess this isn't a very good slasher movie, I mean I don't think I'd even bother with it if it wasn't a Jason movie, that gives some of the weaker chapters of this series something of a free pass with me, except for part 9.. Anyway I have a bit of a soft spot for this one because it was one of the first Friday the 13th flicks I ever saw. I still enjoy it and don't find it to be as terrible as it's made out to be, but man is it ever chock full of stupid little nagging holes in the logic and the story. I don't want to say last legs but the Jason formula was clearly getting very thin by this point. They should have left it with part 6, that one had a great satisfying sense of closure to it.. So let's point out a few of those holes! I'm pretty sure Crystal Lake is not connected to the greater ocean, when Jason gets his new mask, it has an axe mark on it...why?? It's not like Jason at all to go many miles out of his personal territory to get a few survivors, he did travel far to get Alice, but that was personal! The what-the-hell child apparition of Jason is not deformed, why is Jason scared of water at the end when he already must have walked miles on the ocean floor when he was following the lifeboat on its way to New York - slop-py!! I don't like to nitpick but some of it's just so lazy with this movie it's like they didn't even care, false advertising is just one aspect of what's wrong with it. They should have just had Jason invading the cruise ship be what made this one different, it would have been a bit lame but it would have been honest, they could've called it ocean of blood or something cheesy along those lines. There's no real gore again, thank you MPAA for your utterly pointless censorship of a horror movie made for adults, but there are still some good kills to 'enjoy', like when the rock chick gets axed by her own sexy guitar, and when the poor spurned nerd loses his glasses and is brutally electrocuted and set on fire, Julius' drawn out demise is probably the most well remembered part of the whole movie, if only he hadn't been a good sportsman and offered Jason a shot in return! My favourite though is when beautiful young Kelly Hu flees into a disorienting flashy dance floor where Jason soon takes her breath away, I love the visual style of that sequence, it's very tense and almost surreal with the spinning perspective of the dance floor, it always stuck very vividly in my young mind that one. Julius was a very cool and likeable character, I thought he was more solid and charismatic than everyone else in the cast and I'd have loved to have seen him live until the end but, 80s! I quite enjoyed the performance of the older actor who played the perfectly uptight and stern headmaster or dean or whatever the hell he was, he was a great addition to the really odious characters that did a tremendous job of making you hate them really fast and be eager to see them get bumped off at record speed! So Jason definitely didn't look as impressive as he did in part 7 but I'd say a big plus of this movie is how much Kane Hodder came into his own as the character and I love all the little movements and mannerisms like the showing of the face to warn off the group of punks and the awareness of his similarity to giant hockey billboards! I love his little look at the camera in that scene, he looks like he's thinking \"Do I really look like that?\" And contrary to popular belief Jason doesn't teleport, he's just a very sneaky ghost embodied as a brutal zombie maniac who has a knack for sneaking up behind his prey, very fast, or in front.. To me while sincere and pretty and everything, Jensen Daggett was and still is the most flat and boring survivor girl of the entire series, some of the previous girls kicked some serious ass and were very memorable, but she was a total drip and was just so mopey, she never really gets that vital empowering moment against Jason, all she does is confront her mean old senile uncle about an abusive childhood swimming lesson! They should have shown her little flashback scene right at the beginning of the movie because that at least would have offered some vague reason as to why she was being haunted by the vision of Jason as a child asking her not to let him drown. It's obvious that at some point the movie was written with the character of telekinetic Tina in mind, too bad they didn't bring her back. Like most I've come to strongly dislike the ending and how poor the design of Jason's face is, looking exactly like a rotten jack o lantern. And what on Earth were they thinking when they had him speak!? You could say that it's just her weird mental vision of what's happening, but that doesn't change the fact that you see that old dried up rubber apple head actually mouth the words \"Mommy, don't let me drown, mommy?\" So you do in fact see Jason talk! Very confusing and badly done sequence and the worst death of Jason ever I must agree! As a Friday it does just about get the job done, for its many flaws it is entertaining enough if you like Jason and his strange little career in bloodshed, and hello - it was the eighth one! Surely it can be cut a little slack just for that. Not one of the best but it sure has its moments... it's better than Jason Goes to Hell! \ud83d\udd25 \ud83c\udfb8",

Jason Voorhees gets resurrected again (I think by electricity or lightning), and continues his murderous rampage. This time he makes his way onto a ship which is hosting a graduation trip to New York for a local high school. Many of the characters are awful people, and as a viewer, you really care less whether they live or die (most of them die). Eventually, a small portion of the group latch onto a raft and float to New York City. Jason somehow gets to NYC (I think he must've walked there underwater or something). He kills a few more leading to up a decent ending in the sewers of the city.Jason Voorhees is super human in this one folks. He manages to move from one place to the next in the blink of an eye. One minute he's on the deck of the ship, the next he's standing in New York City. He like many other horror icons at this time, is no longer scary. He's a complete joke, a cartoon. There are some good parts to it though, like a guy getting his head punched off by the masked madman. And the scenes in Times Square and the New York subway were fun to watch. But getting through over an hour of Jason stalking the corridors of a cruise ship gets tedious after twenty minutes.The back story of Renny being pulled underwater by a young Jason when she was a kid makes little to no sense. Jason's age would have had to have been altered drastically for that to have been real. The finale in the sewer was the best thing in the film. Jason's face was very grotesque in this one. Friday the 13th fans, like myself, will slightly appreciate this for being a fun cheesy mess. But others will discard it as trash.5/10",

After Jason kills the captain, the ship is drifting across the Atlantic, set on fire, and only a few survivors make it in a lifeboat to New York where the chase continues...On one hand, part 8 is the best looking sequel so far. Cinematographer Bryan England achieves a great look, obviously influenced by 80s rock music videos. Even if the surroundings are different, a ship and Manhattan instead of the familiar forest, Jason continues his usual line of work and kills in interesting ways. My favorite is the boxing scene on a roof: his opponent hits Jason about 30 times, until he is totally exhausted, and then Jason only hits once! On the other hand, poor characters and unlikely story. After part 7 attempted to present a different type of heroine, part 8 goes back to the nice girl in distress who gets good marks at school, opposed to the bad kids who take drugs. And then there are lacks of credibility. The kids are rowing a boat across the foggy Atlantic for many miles, the waters are as calm as in a swimming-pool, and they arrive straight at the feet of Lady Liberty - come on...",

The overall effects were poorly done from Jason's face looking like some 100 year old Skeletor to Young Jason looking nothing like the young Jason from the first film or at least an alteration that would safice.Young Jason effects were very simple and had full head of hair with no deformation to his face except a side eye appliance. I felt this wasn't taken to heart and the fact that Jason could of taken all of the group on the ship before arriving to their destination it could of been a different look if the story changed at Manhattan.The characters have a brief interest and quickly forgotten considering Jason's motive.Kane Hodder still brings the sheer brute force to the character and doesn't dissapoint in this case.

            "content": "One of the things that have always made me wonder throughout the \"Friday the 13th\" series, are the geographic changes around Crystal Lake. In the first part, for example, the lake was entirely surrounded by deep woods, whereas in the third part, the area looked more like a swamp. Still, none of the films gave the impression that Crystal Lake was connected to any other waters, let alone a river that connects to the sea. Well,... guess what: Good old Jason is resurrected once again by a teenage couple in a boat on Crystal Lake. After butchering the two lovebirds, Jason takes the boat to a nearby coastal small-town, where a bunch of teenagers as well as two teachers are planning a trip to New York on a cruise ship. Jason sneaks on board, of course, and his presence quickly reduces the number of teens on the ship...The \"Friday the 13th\" series is mainly a product of the 80s, and, shot in 1989, \"Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\" is the last 80s \"Friday\" film. This film's setting on a cruise ship (which, considering its size, carries only very few people) is actually a good thing, in my opinion, as a ship is one of the most inescapable settings imaginable. And, at least in the beginning, Jason does what he does best with acceptable results. Sadly enough, \"Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\" is once again relatively gore-less (which also was my main complaint about the previous part, \"New Blood\". Most of the murders either let camera slide away when the good stuff happens, or are virtually gore-less. This is too bad, because, at least in my humble opinion, gore was probably the one thing the earlier entries to the series had to offer. Kane Hodder plays Jason again, which is good as he gives him a creepy and intimidating look. Jason's look is generally creepier in the later entries to the series, but the gore is still way too tame in this film for my tastes. The few gory sequences are pretty cool, though, especially one in which Jason punches a guy's head off his torso with his bare hands. Also, one could (once again) care less about any of the protagonists, as a viewer one isn't scared for them but eagerly waits for them to get butchered. The Jason makeup underneath the mask isn't impressive (it was very good in the previous part). Oh, and the ending is the stupidest thing ever.Personally I have always thought of the \"Friday\" series as extremely overrated by many of my fellow Horror fans, and this eighth part is one that can easily be skipped. The one thing that is applaudable is the new setting, which at least brings some kind of change. 3.5 out of 10",

They did what they needed to do for a slasher movie, and I was okay with that. No stand outs, good or bad.\nThere are two main problems in this movie. First, the film lies to us saying 'Jason Takes Manhattan', since he's ship-bound for all but the final half-hour, and he doesn't really concern himself with anyone apart from the vessel's survivors once he's there. This is a guy who's made a habit of ruthlessly killing everyone he's ever encountered, yet now he passes harmlessly through a loaded subway car and cheerfully lifts his mask to scare a gang of punks trying to pick a fight with him. It just didn't make any sense. The second is the fact that the production value in this movie went down hill since the last. The effects are god awful and Jason looks like he should be on the Muppets! When he takes his mask off in this movie I laughed, it was so bad.\nOverall, I didn't get any enjoyment out of this movie. I love the character of Jason, but this movie turned him into an average stalker with violent tendencies rather than a ruthless killer we are used to.\n1/5",

For a series that prides itself on its frequent kills, it's frustrating that anything gruesome is rendered as an implication. Like most of the films in this franchise, the pathetic MPAA board demanded too many cuts, negating any chance of a gory thrill.Perhaps most frustrating is going against Jason's character. He is rightly invincible, but here he teleports when the script needs him to, whether to reach the famous city or to facilitate the next death. It's perplexing. Jason is also renowned for killing anyone in his path, no matter who they are or if they've come into contact with his lake. Yet once in Manhattan, he only has eyes for those he shared a boat with. Pedestrians are spared his wrath. And it makes no sense. Plus the make-up that was so effective last time fails to do the undead villain justice. Here he just resembles a member from 'The Hills Have Eyes' cast - ugly, out of place, and far from home.The characters don't help themselves throughout when fatalities occur left and right, and their intelligence diminishes the longer the film goes on. The last survivors inexplicably decide that instead of outrunning this monster (Jason doesn't run in Part 8), they'll head down to the secluded sewers and run into a dead end. Time after time the actions defy belief, and writer/director Rob Hedden has to take the blame for failing to capitalise on all the possibilities that come from the change of scenery aswell as making such vapid choices that sink this series to an all time low.At least the dog survives.",

The last one of the original 8 really was the last gasps of breath for this franchise. So many intelligence insulting plot holes! And a film that doesn't exactly live up to its title. A better title for this woulda been \"Friday The 13th part VIII: Jason somehow manages to hi jack a cruise ship and kill everyone whilst defying logic\". Either way, I can imagine people sitting in the theater in 1989 thinking to themselves \"This has gotta be IT!\". And unfortunately, it kinda was. One thing I noticed this time that I never did before is how Jason kills only 6 or 7 teenagers on the cruise ship. yet before all the mayhem begins, it's shown that there are indeed more than just 6 or 7 of them. An entire class, in fact. Where did they all go? Did Jason kill them off camera? Or did they all get tuckered out from their 80's style partying and go to bed early? Doesn't matter. No one in this movie seems to care about anyone elses death. Not even their own, really. I love how near the end while the four remaining survivors are in a cop car that crashes, and then explodes seconds after three of them hurry out, while they leave the one female teacher in there to burn to death, with nearly no acknowledgement whatsoever. Then, they just stand around while the down there and it screwed her up. So, now, Jason is apparently the same age as this teenage chick. Despite the fact that 15 or 20 (or 30?) years have supposedly passed since part 2, when he was already a grown man for quite some time. Nevermind the fact that we still haven't even made it out of the 80's yet. So, we get what? Less than 1/3 of the movie taking place in Manhattan? Brilliant! The ending was stupid, yet sorta satisfying at the same time. Jason's new frog face was hilarious. His look of Horror when he saw the toxic waste heading for him was just epic. And then in a shocking twist, after Jason , the main chick's , that she was looking for way back on the ship, shows up out nowhere just to make it an even happier ending. You gotta be kiddin' me!But while watching the last few minutes, it occurred to me that the next installment, Jason Goes To Hell, coulda been taken a little more seriously had there been one more F-13 to link the 2 films. I think such a movie could still happen. I always wanted an Friday the 13th part IX which ignores Jason Goes To Hell and everything after it. But what about a \"Lost\" F-13 which makes all the ones after 8 make a little more sense? It could even be officially listed as a 1991 movie.

When Jason begins hacking up the repulsive cyphers on board, several believe it to be the deck hand, until he shows up with a butcher knife in his spine. A handful of these obnoxious nitwits are skewered, and a handful of less obnoxious characters survive and escape this now sinking ship on a small lifeboat and head for land, unknowingly followed by Jason. For someone who supposedly drown when he was a small boy, he now swims quite well.But wait, do they land in New York, or Vancouver?

After the incredible makeup John Carl Buechler did in part VII, the biggest letdown for this installment is the gooey, slimy, subpar makeup effects. Jason looks like he's been slimed by that little green glob from Ghostbusters, or doused with a tub full of cottage cheese. Another major problem is that there are absolutely no shocks or scares at all. Unforgivable, considering this is a horror movie; those two offenses nearly sink this movie faster than the Lazarus sinks in it.The silly climax reveals that apparently all it takes to turn Jason into a small boy again is to drown him in toxic waste. (*shakes head in confusion*)I enjoyed this movie a bit more when I was younger, but it really hasn't aged well at all.",

If you like slasher films, it's hard to fathom you not liking this movie.Pros: Creative and graphic deaths. Jason has never been angrier. Jenson Daggett's Rennie is the most beautiful and charismatic female lead in the entire Friday the 13th franchise. The humorous elements added to the New York scenes are great. The change in setting from boring old Crystal Lake was long overdue.Cons: The stupidest and laziest explanation for Jason coming back to life in the entire franchise. They don't bother to explain how Jason gets from land locked Crystal Lake to the ocean cruise liner Lazarus. The killing off of Jason is very weird and not well explained.Favorite kill: (spoiler) Jason stalks Eva to the dance floor of the ship and strangles her to death. Then tosses her to the floor with a sick thud.",

            "content": "For this Friday fan it was a much welcome change of pace to finally get the character of Jason out of the woods and into a different location. Unfortunately, the results were much less than anticipated, for PART 8 emerged as a renowned disappointment; Jason only arrives in New York for the end portion of this movie, and even then most of the action was filmed in some dirty back alleys of Canada which substituted for Manhattan (though what little footage actually occurs in The Big Apple is welcome). The first hour takes place on a cruise ship where the resurrected masked zombie terrorizes a group of students and their adult teachers en route to New York for a graduation celebration. Kane Hodder returns to the part of Jason for his second of four appearances. His patented methods of murdering his victims are occasionally effective, though they still come off as compromised under the watchful cutting eyes of the MPAA. Young actors Jensen Daggett and Scott Reeves don't show much personality as the ho-hum leads, and even old veteran Peter Mark Richman doesn't act very convincingly. Still, there is something to be said for taking the action away from Jason's same old stomping grounds. Would the movie have worked better in reducing expectations by using a different title (maybe \"JASON TAKES A CRUISE?\" \"VOYAGE OF TERROR?\"). I think possibly so, but we'll never know for sure. **1/2 out of ****",

This is a film that should mostly be watched for it's camp value much as you would watch any Ed Wood movie or Snakes on a Plane. This movie has no real value in it's characters, it is just one 98 minute gag. I love the movie for trying to do something different as I know by 1989 the old Jason in the woods scenario had been played out. But what follow up directors of this series have neglected to understand is that it has now been almost twenty years since Jason stalked the woods of Crystal Lake. He's been on vacation since 1989. He went to Hell in 93, Space in 02, and Elm Street in 03. Let's bring him him back to the camp, he needs it, he belongs there. I'm not talking about a remake like the evil Michael Bay wishes to push on us but a new entry in the saga that could end where Freddy vs Jason left off and bridge the gap to Jason X. Give us this film and let Michael Bay go as he does not know what the fans want but only what the stupid jocks and cheerleaders want along with the rap crowd. While that was a little off topic I had to say it as the down fall of Jason began with this film. If Jason Goes to Hell had done better and had more continuity with the Jason story line than the series would most likely be reaching it's twentieth film and not it's 12th. Friday The 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhatten is a fine film but it should have been a one off and then went back to the Masked One being violent and scary again as he was in the first four films and part seven. Bring Jason back. New Line listen, this is what the people want, Bring Jason back to Crystal Lake!!! Post Haste!!!",

            "review_title": "The Death of Jason's Run With Paramount",
            "content": "The ongoing story of Jason Voorhees continues for an eighth chapter. Here we see Jason catching a ride with a luxury cruiser (the appropriately-named \"Lazarus\"), come ashore in Manhattan and continue his trek to slaughter almost everything in his path (though for some reason he does nothing to the dozens of people on the Subway). This was the eighth and final film that Jason Voorhees appeared in for Paramount Pictures before being picked up by New Line Cinema (and saved, in my opinion). Written and directed by Rob Hedden, who is known for practically nothing. He worked on a variety of television shows in the 1980s and 1990s for one or two episodes, and often times nothing really worth talking about (\"Knight Rider 2000\" and \"Simon and Simon\", for example). With all due respect to Mr. Hedden, I am under the impression he was given this film because he was about the least expensive writer and director available. But sadly, he also had the capability to make the film completely worthless even by low-budget standards.I don't think it's a big surprise that this film failed. There was basically nothing new going on (watching a guy walk without dialogue and hack things up is fun, but eight movies in a row?). No new mythology. No great death scenes (in fact, these are almost the weakest and least gory death scenes in the entire series).Jason's ability to teleport reaches an all-time high in this film. Even after getting a quarter-mile behind his victim, he still magically teleports ahead of them, sometimes even up a flight of stairs and then back down to the bottom. Sure, he can run when he really wants to, but not quite that fast.The victims weren't worth caring about. The dad or principal or whatever his role was supposed to be... annoying, to the point that nothing could redeem him. He would make a great vampire, but he's awful in this movie. The two heroes (the young lovers) didn't give me any reason to care about them. Everyone else was forgettable or unlikable. The heroin from the gang members (or whatever that stuff was) did not play into the film nearly as much as it should have. Apparently, it doesn't do anything the first time you inject it and driving a car is still relatively easy. I could point out a dozen other flaws and continuity errors. And sure, I could say it's a horror film and that's to be expected, but they really put no effort at all into making this one streamlined.Two best parts: the boxing scene (though still not as good as the fight scene in \"They Live\"), and when Jason fights the cook. (The cook was played by the guy -- Ken Kirzinger -- who would take over Voorhees from Kane Hodder many years later, so it was almost like a Jason versus Jason moment. At the time this film was released, that meant nothing. But looking back, that's a fun thing to watch for.) The boxing scene is what most people remember from this film, I believe. And it's not bad, but if you're sitting through the whole thing waiting for that moment, you're going to be let down.I should also point out this is the film debut of Kelly Hu, who plays the very 1980s-dressed Asian girl in this movie. She's easy to miss, as her role is rather small and of no real consequence. But Kelly would go on to much bigger and better things (and thankfully become more attractive with age). You might know her from \"Strange Days\", \"X2\" or \"Cradle 2 the Grave\"... I absolutely adored her in the 2006 horror film \"Devil's Den\" alongside Devon Sawa and Ken Foree.If you like Jason Voorhees, you'll probably be okay with this film since you'll be getting what you've come to expect. But the thrills are smaller, the deaths less violent, the plot runs a little thin. This is possibly the least of the 11-part series, or pretty close. Watch the next installment: \"Jason Goes to Hell\", the best in the series, by far. That's the only cure for this failure.",

            "content": "'Part 8' of the infamous horror franchise wasn't a success. No surprise really as it's a classic case of a film with a completely misleading title. Having the undead masked serial killer, Jason Voorhees, slashing his way through New York sounds like a good idea for a film, right? Yes, you're right. However, the 'money men' behind the film didn't agree.For budgetary reasons they couldn't afford to shoot in the Big Apple until the final twenty minutes, leaving pretty much the whole film set on a boat heading to the city in question. Here we have the typical 'slasher' film, only on a boat instead of the traditional camp in the woods.So, fans were more than a little annoyed at the misleading nature of the film. Also \u2013 for no reason at all \u2013 Jason can now 'teleport.' One minute he's a hundred yards behind you, then next he's standing in front of you. Yes, he's a supernatural being, but no explanation is given for this new talent. Plus it does tend to spoil the 'chase' between killer and victim when no matter where and how fast you run, he just appears in front of you every time.So, Part 8 is a bit of a let-down in general. Yes, there are a few nice touches here and there and if you're a die hard fan of the series you'll probably appreciate it. However, although it's definitely watchable (if you're into this sort of film) it's not one of the better films in the franchise. Even the writer agrees that not enough time is spent in Manhattan and agrees with fans. Apparently, it was all down to the film's producers that they weren't allowed to spend enough time there.",

To be honest I don't think any of the Friday The 13th films are bad I found them all great. Being the huge Jason fan for as long as I remember I really enjoyed Jason killing off teens on a cruise ship a little different, as you don't see many slasher movies set on cruise ships.Although there were a few things I was disappointed with in this film, some of the deaths weren't shown and others weren't that good This sequel also slaps in new \"gimmicks\" and they don't really work. I'll start off with the \"teleportation\" vibe. What was up with that? This entry has Jason being able to materialise anywhere he wants, which is just stupid and the back story involving the main heroine and Jason was just pointless.Jensen Dagget (Rennie) is good at playing the female lead and plus she's stunning, Peter Mark Richman (Charles) excels at playing the cruel headmaster/Rennie's uncle you just love to hate him, Scott Reeves (Sean) is good and easy on the eye as the good hearted hunk, VC Dupree (Julius) is amusing as the tough guy, I enjoyed the scene where he keeps punching Jason then Jason takes his head of literally, Barbara Bingham played the kind hearted teacher Miss Colleen Van Deusen well very likable but ends with tragic results Sharlene Martin (Tamara) plays the one-dimensional slut to perfection. The acting is actually very good.All in all I'm a big fan of Jason, Kane Hodder rules as Jason, OK it is a bit of a let down in places but it's still enjoyable.",

I'm not against the setting... it's far better than a big city(why in the name of soup would you want that? Have you considered it for even a couple of seconds? Do you honestly think it worked for the Predator?), it's cool for a horror piece, with isolation and plenty of room for stalking(little occurs, though). If this wasn't so dull, it'd be good. The acting remains poor. FX are the one great thing in this, and yet there are hardly any of them, except for near the end. The deaths are among the most uninspired of the series, with one exception. They try to spice it up by having the score laugh at them a couple of times... this is not entertaining, in spite of being partially a black comedy(there is only one funny line, in my opinion). There is blood, gore, violence, nudity and sexuality in this. I recommend this to those who refuse to heed the warning cries. 4/10",

Lastly he attacks them in Manhattan. There is a great scene where he breaks through this diner door, that was cool. Then he... well i DO not want to give away the whole thing. Good Points There is a brief bit of female nudity in it. Also the women are really cute. He breaks through the door of a diner, that was cool. The soft rock soundtrack was quite good.

Just from that brief outline I think we can all safely assume that it's not one heading for the Oscars, but it is very entertaining.

The Friday series never were intellectual cinema experiences and it probably doesn't take you 8 film to find that out. So I see no use in bashing these film and if you hate them, just skip them. All of Jason adventures are amusing money-makers, intended for the fans. And this 'Jason takes Manhattan' perfectly fits in this slasher-structure. This film should better been entitled: 'Jason takes a boat ride', as more than half of the film takes place on a cruise ship on its way from Crystal Lake to New York city. And, when arrived in New York, Jason doesn't get much further than the docks and the rancid slums. A group of high-school graduates are on their way to Manhattan for a city-trip and Jason cheerfully joins them as a stowaway. Our hockey-masked friend wanders around the boat and violently terminates everyone he comes across. The best characteristic about Jason is that he's the least discriminating killer ever! Whether a NY purse-snatcher or a young steersman who just informed us about his 19-months-old son\u0085.Jason Vorhees annihilates them all! Talking in terms of plotting, part VIII is weaker than the previous installment (The New Blood) that desperately tried to bring some creativity into the routine franchise. This film connects to the original by the main-heroine, who suffers from visions of young Jason pulling her down in Crystal Lake. But\u0085don't worry too much about the plot as the killings offer more than enough amusement and horror-fun.

I've noticed that a lot of people seem to praise Kane Hodder's performances as Jason Vorhees.  I've got to ask: \"What is there to praise him for?\"  All he does is walk around and kill people.  What kind of acting talent does that take?

We start out all right (once we get past the opening credits and the annoying music), with a couple of kids on a yacht having sex. The boat anchor gets snagged on an underwater power line and pulls it into Jason's submerged corpse. Yadda yadda yadda, the kids wind up dead. Pretty good up to this point, but then we start meeting the kids that are going on their senior trip - a cruise to New York. For some reason the director decided to make the rest of the movie with a very morose attitude. The characters act gloomy, dismal, the whole atmosphere is one of sorrowful bleakness. The movie grinds to an immediate halt as soon as the lead female pulls up in a car and we discover that we're no longer watching a Friday the 13th movie, we've stumbled across a Lifetime Movie of the Week! Our lead character is deeply troubled because of something bad that happened to her in the past. She spends every waking moment filled with anxiety and hopelessness. She goes through an entire Lifetime Movie of the Week story arc, eventually facing her fears and overcoming them! Oh, for pete's sake. This boring melodramatic crap drags the whole thing to a standstill, while every time Jason shows up for a quick kill, the movie lurches back into gear. Then it stops, then it lurches. Repeat throughout movie.It doesn't help that among the adult characters, the female has absolutely no personality whatsoever, and the male is a jerk with a capital J, E, R, and K. That guy gets unbearable after a while.Oh, but wait, here's a cool rock 'n' roll chick! Maybe this movie will be fun after all! No, 60 seconds later she's dead. Then there's the prom queen, a nasty little tart who provides what little entertainment there is in the movie. She has one scene where she seduces the teacher. It's fairly indicative of what's screwed up about the rest of the movie, so let me tell you about it. For one thing, the teacher is a JERK (as previously mentioned). For another thing, he's bugging her to hand in her biology project. Like, who the heck turns in homework in the middle of a senior trip? Then miss prom queen strips to her undies, which you might think would be nice, but she's got this stupid stuff drawn all over herself - pictures of her organs. She's her own biology project, get it? It's dumb, it's distracting, and it's completely unnecessary considering she's only trying to get pictures of the teacher in a compromising position with her. And just to really cap it all off, the teacher does a horrible job of acting during the scene. In other words, this scene is a microcosm of all the errors committed in the rest of the film.Anyhow, Jason kills most everybody in very boring fashion. With so few people on the boat, why does it seem to take so long for everyone to die? Well, because there's absolutely no suspense; somebody is walking somewhere, you know perfectly well what happens next, Jason all of a sudden appears and instantly kills them. No suspense, no scares, just boring redundancy. The survivors paddle a rowboat to Manhattan, everything is filthy, there's a stupid ending, and then you're done. One funny part is when Jason punches a guy and knocks his head clean off.Overall, I'd recommend watching parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 10 instead of wasting your time with this one. It's not fun, it's not scary, it actually is fairly boring. There's not even a decent amount of T&A, not that it would help. And that's gotta be one incredibly bad slasher if T&A wouldn't have even helped.The bottom line is that the folks who made this committed the biggest mistake you can make in B movie making: They didn't have the talent to make a good movie, but they didn't have the humility to make an enjoyable bad one.",

Kills again get derived of their prime and most important ingredient - blood and gore.At least we have quite a lot of deleted scenes on the disc we can enjoy. With them in the movie, I think it would have worked better. On the other hand, some don't like the violence at all, so for them this cut is better. But why watch a slasher movie if you don't want it to get bloody? The unstoppable force of Jason is here ... before he gets somewhere else! And I'm not talking Manhattan here, but the change in production companies! Because for the first time ever, the same guy who played Jason before (in Part 7), returns again! Those first time things ... gotta love them - maybe",

            "content": "The first seven films of the horror franchise were all made in the 1980s, this was the last of the decade, and this eighth instalment sees the iconic hockey masked, machete wielding psycho killer getting away from the usual location (bar one of the previous sequels) to go to a bigger place. Basically a year has passed since previous events, two graduating high school students are on a houseboat on Crystal Lake getting frisky, then the anchor is weighed and causes an underwater cable to snap, and the electric charge causes the corpse of killer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) to resurrect, he finds a new hockey mask and quickly kills the two occupants. The next morning a senior class of graduating students from Lakeview High School, chaperoned by biology teacher Charles McCulloch (The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear's Peter Mark Richman) and English teacher Colleen Van Deusen (Barbara Bingham), are setting sail on the SS Lazarus, bound for New York City. McCulloch's niece Rennie Wickham (Jensen Daggett) has aquaphobia, and has heard all the legends of killer Jason when he was drowned as a child, every now and then she has been seeing visions of the young disfigured child Jason. Slowly strange and nasty things start happening to the people on the ship, both students and crew, McCulloch does not want to hear that Jason Voorhees is to blame, but of course once he sees the violence for himself and the actual maniac in the flesh, he thinks different. After many killings, the surviving passengers aboard, McCulloch, Van Deusen, Rennie, Sean Robertson (Scott Reeves), Toby the dog (Ace) and Julius Gaw (Vincent Craig Dupree) abandon ship and escape in a lifeboat, leaving Jason behind presumably dead, they are relieved when they finally reach the dock and outskirts of New York City. Of course they are unaware that Jason is still alive and followed them all the way and is stalking them, Rennie ends up getting kidnapped by two punks and the group are split up, the punks are killed when Jason comes along. As the others are killed by Jason, it is revealed that Rennie's fear of water was caused by McCullough, he pushed her into the water of Crystal Lake as a child, hence her visions of Jason as a child, the killer chases his victims through Times Square and the subways. Jason's kills include stabbing with a harpoon barb, impaling, killing with an electric guitar, slamming a sauna rock into an abdomen, an axe in the back, decapitation in a single punch, incinerated in an exploding car, drowning in a barrel of waste and much more. In the end Jason chases the last survivors through the sewers, where toxic waste surrounds them, he is finally defeated by a splash of acidic waste, then the whole place is flooded as Rennie and Sean escape up the ladder, but Jason will return. Also starring Sharlene Martin as Tamara Mason, Martin Cummins as Wayne Webber, Tim Burr Mirkovich as Young Jason, Amber Pawlick as Young Rennie, Gordon Currie as Miles Wolfe, X-Men 2's Kelly Hu as Eva Watanabe, Saffron Henderson as J.J. Jarrett, Warren Munson as Admiral Robertson, Tiffany Paulsen as Suzi Donaldson and Todd Caldecott/Shaffer as Jim Miller. Jason is still sinister, but the moment just after his defeat - seeing him as a child, and a few times throughout in visions, is ridiculous, there are a few good bloody deaths, but not enough, also the Big Apple is only seen a little with the lights in the dark, it is more so set down the dark alleys and beneath, to be honest I didn't find this sequel as good as I hoped it would be, but it's not a bad horror.

            "content": "Jason Voorhees is raised from his watery grave and sets about mutilating whichever nearby teenagers he can get his hands on.  Sound familiar?  It is.But Rob Hedden has directed what is perhaps the best of the Friday the 13th films with more style and imagination than earlier outings.  The Jason character is cast as a sort of anti-hero in this update of the series, and the result is a campy good time.Crystal Lake's graduating class are shipping off to New York for their class trip, and when Jason is accidentally revived from the bottom of Crystal Lake by an anchor which snags a power line, he climbs on board for the ride. What ensues is a cruise to mayhem as many of the teens are slain en-route to the Big Apple, and the boat eventually sunk.  There's a lot of energy and kinetic camera work in this piece, nearly enough to revive the series to presentable level, and many of the killings almost come off as gags.Kane Hodder, affirming that he is, in fact, the *real* Jason Voorhees, resumes the role he took over in the previous film, and hams it up a bit on the streets of New York while remaining a menacing figure.  He frightens the dickens out of a street gang, proves that you should never touch the third rail of a subway, even marvels at his likeness on a New York Rangers billboard.The ending in the sewers is questionable at best, with Jason dissolved in acid while the spray never harms his cowering quarry, but Hodder is fantastic lurching around the subterranean corridors while clutching his steaming, monsterous face and wailing in pain.  Do zombies feel pain?Jason Takes Manhattan gives a fresh perspective on the old formula, with good, solid performances and a core cast of believable characters.  The fact that it *is* an old formula weighs greatly on this otherwise acceptable film, and the result is a middle of the road thriller that can finally stand almost eye-to-eye with other suspensers not cursed with a \"VIII\" in the title.On a side note:  hardcore F13 fans typically despise this film, perhaps for its change of venue or relatively low body count.  Regardless, this is a film that delivers its share of frights and laughs, and of course, a measure of \"oh, yeah, rights.\"",

            "content": "Film opens on Crystal Lake (will they ever learn?) Two teens on a yacht talking about the legend of Jason, they start to make out while there boat accidentally awakens Jason again with some electricity. Jason (Hodder) quickly dispatches them, grabs the kid's hockey mask and is on his way. We meet the main characters the next day about to board a cruise ship headed for New York. Rennie (Daggett) the main character, talks about her future with her favorite teacher Miss Van Deusen (Bingham). Her uncle, the principle Mr. McCulloch (Richman), the big ass of the film starts to rag on Rennie about everything and how he is disappointed about her coming. Meantime Rennie's man Sean (Reeves) is the captain's son, who is also disappointed with the youngster about not wanting to be a boat captain, sue me dad. So Jason climbs on board and some janitor of course knows more then the others to tell them they are all doomed. Soon we meet heavy metal girl and a nerd, the nerd is a must for most of these films. The metal chick goes to jam in the lower decks and soon has a flying v in her skull. In the meantime Rennie continues to have these silly visions of some boy and fear of drowning all connected to Jason. Even sillier is McCulloch on the senior trip asking for various forms of homework while they are supposed to be partying. The slutty girl of the film gives him a short biology lesson before she is cut to ribbons. Eventually Jason goes the through the kids one by one and after throwing the nerd on some electrical stuff, which starts a fire, those who are left have to abandon ship. After finally arriving in NY some thugs kidnap Rennie, but Jason also is there and kills them. Before going after her he boxes with Julius (laughable scene) and Jason punches his head off. Rennie escapes with Sean, confronts McCulloch about almost drowning her as a kid and they run off, while McCulloch is drowned head first in some toxic waste, one of the better parts of the film I might add. Jason start's to chase them through time square, diner, sub way, and eventually the sewers. Rennie manages to throw toxic waste on Jason's face making him melt and cry like baby, hilarious. The sewer cleans out, Jason wines like baby (laughable) the water drowns Jason and when it subsides he is transformed into a kid. Makes no sense but who cares Rennie and Sean walk off into time square with her dog to live anther day.Overall a bad film and one of the weaker ones in the franchise, however I admit that for some reason I tend to enjoy this one. One of the big problems as everyone mentions was the lack of Jason being in NY. Most people know that director Rob Hedden did not have the money to film in NY so much of the film is on a boat or in Vancouver for the city shots. And I think for the most part that works, but again Jason is there for maybe the last 20 minutes, so it's somewhat of a letdown. The acting as usual is really bad, even for a Friday film, with a few exceptions. Peter Mark Richman as McCulloch is the one who stands out. He plays the jerk of the film to perfection and his death is enjoyable. Most of the others seem to walk through their roles, Especially Scott reeves as Sean. He wines the whole time and is not believable for a second. For instance his dad is laying dead on the floor and he barley acts that upset. As for Hodder, I was never really big on him as Jason. I rather like the actor more then him as the character. But he is good in this.The story is weak as well, with the kids on the boat most of the movie, just a few survivors make it to NY. The worst part of the story is the nonsense with Rennie having flashbacks of her drowning and supposedly Jason was dragging her down as a kid while McCulloch her uncle, watched. It never works out and I think Jason would have been an adult when she was a child. The end is stupid too with Jason being turned into a kid at the end of the film. It makes no sense and looks likes crap. And how funny is having the principle come on the trip and asking for school crap and acting like he is the boss? As always the deaths are what people talk about and there are only a few good ones in this. I think most people like when Julius, one of the better characters from the film, eventually has his head punched off. Stupid but good. Let's see, toxic waste drowning, the steam rock in the gut, the wrench, the nerd on fire, but many more were just generic because they toned the whole movie down, not Robs fault. The MPAA edited up to much so again it's not Hedden's fault so I give him a break. The movie is better then Jason Goes to Hell, which was awful. Hardcore fans will hate it, but it has 80's nostalgic feel to it and if you like that you may want to hit it up. Lets 6 out 10.",

            "content": "I see that many have bashed this film, but it's one of my favorite Jason sequels along with Parts 5 and 6.  OK, so it's false advertising to a degree.  We see a great opening shot of Manhattan, and we don't see Manhattan again until the final 30 minutes.  And other than the Times Square footage (which you can't fake), it was all shot in Canada!  And probably any real New Yorker (like myself) can tell the difference.  But who cares? That's not the issue!  You think the director of a \"Friday\" movie is gonna be meticulous about detail?  Get the hell out of here! \nThe point is it's a fun movie with cool death scenes (i.e.:  the fighter getting his head literally knocked off by Jason's powerful punch), characters you can give a damn about, actors who are moderately good and even some moments of humor.  There was no gratuitous nudity, but I was having so much fun that I really didn't care.  I gotta say, the methods of bringing Jason get back become more pathetic by the sequel (\"Jason Goes to Hell\" is the most prime example), but once you get over that, you should have tons of fun.  It definitely has its memorable moments, like when a group of thugs plan to attack Jason.  Once Jason lifts his mask (and it's made funnier since we don't see Jason's face and instead we're fixated on the thugs' reactions), the thugs quickly run off.  Hell, it's convincing to have someone like Jason roaming the streets of Manhattan and have no one give a damn.  In Manhattan, you got much more deadly people than Jason roaming around, who look weirder than a tall guy in a hockey mask.  Psycho in hockey mask walking the streets of Times Square?  What else is new?  Die-hard fans of the Jason series may find a boatload of flaws with this eighth installment (I once heard someone complain that one of the actors who played Jason didn't show enough expression--WHAT FREAKING EXPRESSION???), but anyone who's simply a fan of good B-horror should appreciate the film. I sure did.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",

Then one of his terrified victims escape into the nightmarish maze of Manhattan's subways and sewers, only to confront Jason one last time.This film starred: Jensen Dagett, Kane Hodder & Peter Mark Richman.Part 8 is my least favourite of the series so far, I have reviewed parts 1-7 already on the website and part 8 just really annoyed me. The film's duration time was 96 minutes and when I was watching it, it seemed to go on for much longer it seemed like it was sitting there for 3 to 4 hours. It dragged too much. With the subtitle being Jason Takes Manhattan, I expected him to be in New York for longer than 25 minutes as he is on the boat for the first hour and a bit. I will carry on watching these films, I don't know why because from memory I remember Jason goes to hell (part 9 in the franchise, sequel to this film) being even worse.

Eventually it gets boring and that will happen before they get off the boat.When Jason's on the cruise though, he doesn't seem to like to use his signature machete and chooses to kill with random things and objects that he finds lying around and plenty of them aren't even inventive.Have I mentioned that everyone in the movie are terrible actors and they provide the movie with so much unintentional humor that you will never take the movie seriously.When they finally get into Manhattan, everything about it feels fake. There's so many wacky parts of this movie that could have been solved if they had just done some research. For instance, it's very unlikely that the New York sewers fill up with toxic waste every night at midnight. ADSURD! I like Kane Hodder but he's makeup was really very awful.

Here you can give your own thoughts on whether or not that is possible for Jason to be in Crystal Lake and while never leaving the water able to jump onto a ship that is in the ocean. Now, I did find the characters more interesting than the previous entry, but at the same time they are far from the series' best.I guess Paramount looked at the returns of this film, saw that it was no longer a mega cash-cow and figured that was it for Jason.

            "content": "By this time \"Friday the 13th\" is just a running gag. I only watch it for pure data at this point. I like to keep track of Jason's death tally as well as his injuries sustained while pursuing his prey.\"Jason Takes Manhattan'' really was a misnomer. It should have been \"Jason Takes Over a Ferry Boat\" because that's where the majority of the movie took place and that's where he did the most damage. He did reach Manhattan and he did a little killing in Manhattan, but that would've been like the finishing touches of the painting if we use that as a comparison.So, instead of wasting time talking about how putrid of a movie this was, I will skip straight to the important matters: the death count as well as the injury count.The total death count in the movie was 18. These are confirmed kills. That needs to be noted because if he simply throws someone against an object but you don't know the person died as a result of that impact then that cannot be considered a confirmed kill. So, of the confirmed kills there were 18 with 16 of them attributable to Jason himself. Two of the kills were at the hands of others. One was a spooked kid with a video camera and poor eyesight who shot the maintenance worker on the ferry and the other was the teacher named Colleen, who died in a fiery car crash trying to get away from Jason. Those two are indirectly attributable to Jason because he was the primary cause of those kills, but they were not at his hands so I don't wanna give him those kills.As far as Jason's injuries, they were not nearly as significant as I've seen in other Friday the 13th's. He was stabbed in the eye with a pen, shot six times with a revolver, hit by a car, electrocuted on the third rail of the subway, and finally drowned in a rush of toxic waste.See you for part nine",

Kelly Hu did a fine job in her film debut. Peter Mark Richman and Sharlene Martin are good as the characters you are glad to see meeting their gruesome demise. But, probably the stand out for me was Martin Cummings as Wayne. His death scene was awesome and I really liked his character's attitude.

            "content": "Other than the fact that the film is largely set aboard ship (complete with doom-spouting caretaker) - with Manhattan itself serving mainly as a backdrop for the finale - this is strictly formula stuff: perturbed heroine, her bitchy rival for the attentions of the misfit hero, her bossy guardian; plus a plethora of stereotypical teenagers (black sidekick, rocker, film-geek armed with a camera, etc.). The shipboard antics don't generate much interest or excitement - but when the scene shifts to New York, it becomes tolerable enough (with even a number of amusing bits such as Jason - wearing his trademark hockey mask - coming face to face with a large billboard with an ad for an ice hockey match, his being accosted by junkies and street gangs, and the scene where the heroine dashes into a bar screaming that a maniac is stalking her - followed by the unalarmed female bartender's quip, \"Welcome to New York!\"). The climax in the sewers - with Jason drowning during a flooding of chemical waste - is effectively handled as well.",

Unfortunately, the anchor just happens to snag an underwater power cable which then releases thousands of volts of electricity through Jason's corpse with the result that he is-once again-brought back to life. Not long after that he sneaks aboard a cruise ship which is hosting some high school graduates and the killing continues after that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film was much like its predecessor in that it featured a predictable plot due to its standard formula and far too many shallow characters. Nothing too surprising there. Even so, it had enough imagination and gore to keep things somewhat entertaining and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",

This is the already 7th establishment in the commercially successful Friday the 13th movie, that started out in 1980. That means that almost every year a new Friday the 13th movie got released. This of course goes at the expense of the quality of the movies and the series mostly consists out of stories and moments that repeat itself. This movie tries to be different by setting the movie at a new location. No, it's not really Manhattan, at least not until for the last halve hour of the movie but it's a movie that for most part is set aboard a ship, with a school-class aboard.The change of settings doesn't help to make this a better movie though. Even more so than other Friday the 13th movies, this movie just simply consists out of the one killing after the other. Its story and characters just aren't exactly good or interesting enough to make this a good or original enough entry in the series. It just no a movie you ever really get into.Guess the movie in its essence showed some potential. I mean an horror movie set aboard a ship should be good enough to provide the movie with a couple of claustrophobic and well build up horror sequences. But none of it. As an horror this movie falls flat and it just purely relies on its graphic killings it seems.The movie does get better though the moment the movie hits New York. It shows that having Jason roaming around in the big city can be just as good and effective as having the movie set at a camp, somewhere in the woods. Guess this movie also made the creators realized this and later movies in the series would also be set outside of the woods. It took them only 7 movies to realize this though.Not a very good or interesting done movie, until its final 30 minutes.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

This movie is directed by Rob Hedden (Clockstoppers) and stars Peter Mark Richman (The Naked Gun 2 1/2), Tiffany Paulsen (Runaway Bride), Jensen Daggett (Home Improvement), Barbara Bingham (Death Mask) and Warren Munson (Executive Decision). The storyline for this picture is pretty awful and spends too much time on the cruise line and not enough time in Manhattan. There's some classic scenes in this, like the rooftop boxing sequence, but their value is more in terms of entertainment than great kill scenes.

            "content": "This film was the first Friday the 13th film I viewed in theaters. It would not be the last, the best or the worst. Jason Goes to Hell was the worst, Freddy Versus Jason the best. This film is also the last go around from Paramount which sold its rights to New Line, not sure why. This film cost the company only five million and grossed 15, so while not a super hit, it made money. It is the last film in the series to really try to follow the story set in the previous film too, as New Line completely ignores the ending here and completely made a crazy film that was more science fiction than slasher. So for me, this film was not exactly good, but I always thought part six was actually the most entertaining and the films declined until Freddy Versus Jason livened things up again.The story here has Jason being shocked back alive again after being left dead in the lake again. Seriously, he is like the Hensei version of Godzilla, where if he is put in the water he stays harmless until provoked again. Well he gets a new mask, kills a couple of idiots and then makes his way onto another boat full of dumb graduate teens that is heading for New York! Though one has to wonder how that is possible as I always imagined Camp Crystal Lake being landlocked and nowhere near the Atlantic Ocean. Well, whatever, I can roll with it. Well you keep waiting for them to get to New York and for Jason to take Manhattan, but for the most part the film is set on the boat. Maybe 15 or so minutes are actually in the Big Apple. If the film had been titled \"Jason Takes a Boat to Manhattan\", people would not be quite as upset with the film. A couple of stupid plot points involving the main girl and her previous encounters at the lake add nothing and the ending is kind of ridiculous. Gunshots do not harm him, electricity revives him and toxic waste apparently turns him back to a child...what? The film is not boring and for that I give it a few more stars than it probably deserves. Honestly, the coolest part of the film is that rather good song they sing at the beginning and end as it is the best song in the series after Alice Cooper's Man Behind the Mask. You have your kills and you have your nudity and for maybe a bit of the movie you have the location promised. After this film though, the series got a lot worse until Freddy Versus Jason which I felt Freddy carried and made. I would be interested in what they had in store next had Paramount continued making the films as they followed and incorporated what happened in previous installments.",

Actually, as slashers go; this ridiculously silly effort isn't all that bad, and it certainly isn't the worst film in the series. The familiar Friday location, Camp Crystal Lake, evidently was worn out by the time of this film; and so we've got a location change to Manhattan. Actually, this is a bit of a cop-out, as the vast majority of the movie actually takes place on a boat bound for the Big Apple. Naturally, this boat is full of teenagers and Jason has stowed away on it. The film kicks off with a ridiculously silly sequence which sees a kid whose almost about to get laid distracted by the fact that he and his girl are at Camp Crystal Lake, where a bunch of murders took place. After a convenient and extremely ham-fisted flashback which serves as an excuse to educate anyone who has found themselves in an eighth instalment of a series they know nothing about, we see Jason resurrected by way of an extremely tacky electrical sequence...Despite the fact that it takes place in New York this time, part eight is a Friday the 13th movie like any other. The body count is ridiculously high and sees Jason Voorhees dispatching his victims in a variety of grisly ways. Strangely, the death scenes involving the girls seem to run the same course every time - namely, we get the girl screaming as Jason is closing in, and then he proceeds to kill them anyway. Why don't they just run away? Anyway, while a lot of people get killed in this movie, it's never very shocking. Somehow, director Rob Hedden has managed to create an ultra-violent movie that feels like something you'd have no problem letting your kids watch. Kane Hodder takes the lead role as Jason, and does just as well as any other big guy in a hockey mask would have done. The make-up on the killer under his mask is typically crappy and hard to take seriously, much like the rest of the film. The loss of Crystal Lake as a location does spoil it a little, as that's the place that is associated with Friday the 13th, and the rural atmosphere fits the tone of the series well; but since this is the seventh sequel, it really was time for a change. I can't say that I recommend this film, but there are worse slashers than this one and at least Jason Takes Manhattan is fairly fun to watch.",

And also compared to the other movies you just don't see Jason stalking people with the camera behind some unknown figure who just isn't scary at all. In this movie Jason is not a stalker, he is brutal killer who kills anyone he comes into contact with aboard the ship all the way into New York City.Im dropping one star because of the visions of young Jason the lead cast has which didn't really feel appropriate.Other than that, its a very enjoyable movie, and like I said, this was the best of the Friday the 13th movies, If not the best",

Over the last seven installments, viewers have seen Jason do many incredible things that defy logic. However, of all of the outlandish things we are asked to accept through suspension of disbelief, this film features the greatest of Jason's powers - Jason can manipulate time... unless, of coarse, this is just a **** movie with a **** script that has so many holes that they can't even follow a simple timeline.A yacht somehow ended up cruising into Crystal Lake - not your typical yachting destination. After having some murder, Jason (off screen) heads north west, following creeks, streams, and small tributaries until he emerged in the inter-coastal waterways of the Pacific Northwest, in British Columbia, Canada. This is a 48 hour drive, or a three week jog, or a 12 week walk (with no sleep), so Jason got to see a lot of North America and I'm sure his Instagram was all blowed up...In Vancouver, Jason boards a steamer ship full of graduating high-school students, on a trip to New York City. Now, here, we should pause and consider this voyage... There are only 3 ways to get from Vancouver to NYC via boat - the easiest being south through the Panama Canal, taking about 6 days. Of coarse, Jason can do whatever he wants, so he could have headed west and circled the globe, taking 2 months. However, as experienced viewers, we accept that Jason lives spectacular afterlives, filled with magic and poppycock...We will never know how Jason managed to get that steamer ship to the waters off the coast of New York in less than 3 days time. After eight films, I am half convinced that Jason is a genius, with a particular skill for creating interesting travel routes. We never saw Panama... we never saw Tierra Del Fuego in South America... We never saw the north pole, or India, or Blytheville, Arkansas... Jason prevents us from discovering his travel secrets by killing about 20 people on the boat in sophomoric scenes that made me sad for watching the movie.Eventually, Jason makes it to New York City, pursuing the handful of travel companions that manged to escape his charm on the boat. Through the use of further magic and poppycock, Jason finds his friends in a city of eight million people. Like all visitors to 'The Big Apple', they have tourist adventures with heroin and toxic water, and Jason kills some more people.I found the seventh installment to be one of the best, so I was sort of excited about this film. But, it's crap. The B-roll footage of NYC is cool, but we don't need a bad horror film to enjoy looking at New York.

            "content": "'Friday The 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989)'? More like 'Friday The 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes The Boat'. Seriously, the eponymous murderer doesn't even step foot in Manhattan until over an hour into the affair. Even then, he's only actually in Manhattan in a couple of scenes because everything outside of Times Square was shot in Vancouver. Once the big lug finally gets to The Big Apple, the picture picks up considerably. Prior to this, the piece plods along at a pretty lax pace and sees its more-supernatural-than-ever slasher skulk around the metallic halls of a teen-filled cruise ship as he does what he does best and kills whoever he comes across. It's honestly kind of dull, despite the odd yet satisfying hot pink / baby blue lighting combination that sculpts each scene. The movie's moments of overt metaphor don't work anywhere nearly as well as they ought to, contrasting wildly with the flick's typically to-the-point approach. In general, the thing is almost impressively blunt, a no-frills farce filled with little more than kill after kill. That's what the fans want, right? Well, personally a bit more connective tissue would go a long way. After all, if I don't care about the characters, why should I care about their deaths? There are a few key players that actually have a personality to them, but even these are generic and honestly rather boring overall. What's worse is that Jason himself has no real presence. He isn't threatening or frighting or intense, despite being unrelenting and merciless. He's an unthinking machine as usual, and the most interesting thing about him this time is his occasional hesitation. Though Hodder is as physically imposing as in his last outing, the actual design of his character is far less engaging. The gnarly segments of bloated rotting flesh and exposed bone have been replaced with nothing more than a layer of head-to-toe, totally unthreatening sludge. He's dead, he's damp, he's... disappointing. As is the film itself, really; it becomes very apparent very quickly that it isn't going to live up to its deliciously schlocky title. Thankfully, the movie does get a lot better once its characters finally arrive in New York. Incidentally, the city is portrayed as a grimy, gang-ridden, graffiti-laden hell hole filled with muggers and rapists. It's stereotypical, even borderline racist on occasion, but at least it gives the flick a sense of atmosphere and grit, however inaccurate and unkind it may be. In New York, the feature transitions into all out ridiculousness and I'm all here for it. This segment is seriously bemusing, often so bad that it's actually kind of good. You may be laughing at it, but at least you're laughing. Of course, of course, of course the best scene in the entire film is the one in which that boxer wails on Jason for over a minute straight before letting the guy take a shot of his own and instantly regretting it as his head is separated from his shoulders and sent spinning straight into a nearby dumpster with one clean punch. It's like something out of a much better movie, a genuinely funny slice of self-aware absurdity that's legitimately one of the best kills in the entire 'Friday The 13th' franchise. Of course, not everything in the farcical final act is as successful as this. The most obviously idiotic moments come as the piece nears its conclusion, with Jason's customary unmasking landing with a total thud (his face looks like a child's homemade Halloween mask) and his inevitable defeat culminating with an absolutely bizarre whimper that's literally jaw-dropping in its stupidity. It's the sort of thing you have to see to believe and it calls into question the intent of several things seen earlier. Is everything in the movie, even that which seems undeniably metaphorical, meant to be taken literally? It's a head-scratcher, for sure, and the fact that this ending was included to prevent the door from fully closing on the series makes it even stranger. Ultimately, despite a fairly fun - or, rather, fun to laugh at - final act, this is definitely one of the weaker films in its series. As tempting as it is, you just can't forget its first hour of boat-bound boredom. The real question is: is it better than 'Friday The 13th: A New Beginning (1985)'? The answer is: I don't know.",

With this being the 7th sequel, it is expected to be a pretty big let down, especially after seeing the series go downhill after Part 4 (not counting Part 5). Not only is this film not well made or scary; It's not even entertaining! The movie starts out with an opening around New York City. The opening of the movie is actually pretty good, but it just makes the rest of the film seem terrible. We are then deported to Camp Crystal Lake when we see a young couple having sex on a large boat on the lake. Well, what do you know, Jason comes back to life AGAIN in the cheesiest, cheapest way you can imagine. Then the plot evolves, if you can even say this movie has a plot. Jason somehow ends up on a cruise ship that is somehow going from Camp Crystal Lake to New York. This is one part of the movie I couldn't get at all. It is not once mentioned in the series that Camp Crystal Lake is a bay or a river. How could a bout possibly get from a lake in the middle of nowhere to New York. It doesn't make sense to me.We are then introduced to a group of characters, who are the worst in the entire series. The acting isn't good at all. I expected much better acting considering the budget and the hype this movie had behind it. I think the only thing that made this movie good was the hype. Without the hype, this movie would definitely be considered the worst of all time. If I had to compare this movie with another slasher film, I would have to compare it to a watered down version of Slumber Party Massacre (which was terrible to begin with).The entire film actually takes place on a cruise ship, rather than New York City. New York isn't actually introduced until the last 15 minutes. This is another part of the movie I couldn't get; When there's a big guy walking down the sidewalk wearing a hockey mask and holding a bloody machete, wouldn't people panic? Guess not. Whatever. Well, because the plot (if you can say this movie has one) moves so slow, I found this movie to be incredibly poor and boring. I actually fell asleep on this movie 5 times.The only entertaining piece scene in this mess of the movie are the scenes in New York, which I somewhat enjoyed. Either way, those scenes seemed watered out when looking at the entire movie.Avoid this movie unless you are a completest like me.",

            "content": "What should've been called \"Jason's Trip to Manhattan,\" due to the fact that 'Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan' takes place 70% on a cruise ship, easily ranks in the bottom 3 worst of the series. We've already learned in previous installments that Jason is an unstoppable and un-killable monster with enormous strength. But wait, 'VIII' now shows us he can teleport as well! No wonder while all his victims run fast, he can always catch up with them without much effort. In a lot of the scenes on the ship and a few in Vancouver, Canada (Oh, sorry, they're saying it's Manhattan, USA my bad,) he seems to just disappear and reappear right in front of the soulless characters. Despite a few unique kills (true meaning to \"knocking one's block off\" and vanity kills,) most are just stale or just simply odd \u0096 toxic waste is just left in barrels in alleys? And speaking of which, I have wondered why we never see Jason eat, but 'VIII' seems to show a \"Freddy Krueger\" side \u0096 when he kills, that seems to be soul-capturing, or nourishment to him, I suppose. Again, in this 'Friday' installment are the usual suspects: scenes that don't make sense (an anchored ship drifts off (??) with Jason on board, and he doesn't seem to want to get off, despite he was at his home where he always tried to get to), sex and dumb characters with dumb ideas. However, there were a few highlights: the soundtrack was pretty good (for the time,) the billboard scene was hilarious and the getting him out of the woods for once and into the city was interesting. Again, unfortunately, only expect that for about a half hour of the film, just like 'Jurassic Park 2's dinos in San Diego.",

The mind boggles, wondering how there could possibly have been such a demand for these films...'Friday the 13th Part 8: Jason takes Manhattan' gives new meaning to slasher - with non-stop slashing and dicing from beginning to end. It is mind-numbing how senseless this movie is. With these movies you always know who the next victim will be, and with Jason being immortal and undefeatable we know there's no escape for any potential victim. There is absolutely no logic, and the film is so painfully overdone with cliches that it is hardly 'original' in any way. It is no wonder audiences are losing interest in the series. (Jason takes Manhattan is officially the lowest earning film in the franchise).As with all the films in the franchise, the characters are real idiots and none of them stand out as unique (except for Tina in Part 7). Rennie (Jensen Daggett) has a back story, but we never know what her story is until we really don't care anymore. Rennie also has a dog, which runs away in the beginning of the movie. The dog is never seen again, yet when they leave in a lifeboat - in a hurry I might add - the dog is suddenly sitting on Rennie's lap!!!Thankfully, once again, there is no humor and the killings are brutal and not comedic. Oh, wait, come to think of it, the killings are NOT all that brutal compared to previous films. In fact, Jason is rather lenient this time around. Some of the victims are merely strangled, stabbed, throat slit, or simply thrown overboard. Yeah, even Jason is getting tired...The film is mostly set on a boat on the way to Manhattan. Once they get there, Jason pursues the survivors. Since when does Jason actually follow certain people? I thought he only kills randomly - oh, and that would be everyone in sight... except when he gets to Manhattan; then he only wants to kill certain people. Why?? He's never killed this way before.The make-up and visuals were not nearly as good as 'Part 7'. 'Friday the 13th Part 8: Jason takes Manhattan' is (yet another) stupid movie that is best forgotten. When will Hollywood know when enough is enough? (apparently not, as this was followed by another two films... yawn already, yawn!)",

            "content": "After the popularity of 1988's flick 'Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood'. You would think Paramount would had gone with Tina Shepard (Laurie Park Lincoln) returning as the main character to fight off Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodden) with her psychokinetic powers once again. Sadly, fearing that the plot of the masked killer stalking her at a mental institution was too similar to 1981's slasher flick 'Halloween 2'; they back out of it as they were already in hot water due to similarities to her character compare with Stephen King's own Carrie White. Instead they went with the masked killer following a new group of high school students making their way to New York City. Sadly, the movie portrayed the metropolis so polluted, drug and crime ridden that it made tour to Manhattan look like a bad idea. Honestly why would anybody in this movie want to visit this version of the city in the first place for a vacation? Yes, I know that NYC in the 1980s was kinda rough, but this fictional version the Big Apple looks like a hellhole with toxic waste barrels lying around. Plus, the characters got mug and nearly rape after only a few minutes once on land for no good reason besides adding to already high number of deaths. Those sequences felt so out of place and ugly. No wonder why this flick got so many complaints from the New York Tourism Committee. Even the original posters for the film wasn't safe as both were drop and replace for something more civil. To twist the knife even further. Everything about this, is somewhat misleading. Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) doesn't really take Manhattan until the final half hour of the film. To add salt in the wounds, most of those scenes were actually filmed in Vancouver, Canada. The only one shot on location in New York City was the killer entering Time Square. Due to the film's budget being cut even more. Original script scenes at the Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty and Madison Square Garden were rewritten to take place on a cruise ship heading there even if a lake flowing into the Atlantic seem highly unlikely. Soundstages in Los Angeles were built for the interior. However, when it came to shooting onboard the deck of the ship. Filmmaker Rod Hedden found himself unable to gain access to filming rights on any working luxury cruise. Instead he rent 3 small ferry boats that look nothing like he has envision to work as exteriors shots of the vessel for the flick. Production got even worst as the original actor for Sean Robertson had to be replaced due to horrible acting. The performer Scott Reeves that they got to replaced him was not any better. He was unremarkable. Even the actress Jensen Daggett that plays the heroine, Rennie Wickham was mediocre. She made a character full of depth into somebody's so dull. Regardless I kinda glad the actress stood up for herself as the pervert director try to get her to do an unneeded nude scene and she said no. Kinda wish actress Sharlene Martin had the guts to do that. Hearing stories about him undressing in front of her is kinda creepy even if he was trying to get her to play homage to the shower scene from 1960's Hitchcock film 'Psycho'. She's not even that sexy. Regardless, the rest of the supporting cast is the ones that really surprised me.\nWhile most of their characters were very unlikeable. At least they stood out like seasonal actor Peter Mark Richman as snobby principal Charles McCulloch and V.C Dupree as boxer Julius Gaw. Even the cameo from later Voorhees character actor Ken Kirzinger was nice to see. All of their character's deaths were fun to witness. Yet there were so many other visual gore and special effect failures. One such example is Jason's face melting. It looks like badly done Claymation. Even the lightning bolt effects appear to be crudely drawn onto the footage with a pen. Another thing that hurt the film is all the unrealistic flukes. I hate how a random boat lowers its anchor on an underwater powerline in the middle of rural nowhere with the killer's body being coincident near it, bringing him back to live. Even more surreal is how the passengers have the same axe gouge copy of the hockey mask from 1982's 'Friday the 13th: Part 3' on the boat for the killer to put on. Then on the next morning, a much larger boat arrives with even more teenagers for him to kill, with many of them already trying to murder other by tossing each other overboard. I found it funny that many of these extras unexplained vanished as the film goes on. Yet the coincidences get worse when Empire State got into the picture. Jason being able to teleport around the big city to find the small group of survivors while ignoring most of everybody else. It really took me out of the movie. Then there is the cop out toxic waste moment. Turning the villain into a child rather than dissolving him was very odd choice that make no sense even with Rennie's flashbacks to Jason. I guess the studio really didn't want to write themselves in a corner if ever they wanted to make a sequel. It's clear that they didn't have the balls to kill him off. Even with the awesome background music from composer Fred Mollen. This movie bomb at the box office to the point that Paramount had to sell the rights to the franchise to New Line Cinema after this film's failure, marking the end of their involvement with the series until they handled the international distribution on the 2009 remake. While there was a particularly funny moment where the killer kicked a boom box. No amount of appearances of Voorhees on the Arsenio Hall show couldn't save the movie for me as well.",

However, this series made its fortune from repeating the same formula over and over again, so we get the same dull hack-and-slash hokum that came before. A more apt title would be Jason Takes a Boat Ride then Walks Around Manhattan for a Bit at the End. The film begins with a young couple frolicking on a boat, where the young boy tells the girl the story of Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder), the deformed mass murderer responsible for the death's of many a teenage archetype. Jason, having been left chained to the bottom of the lake at the end of the previous film, is freed when the boat sails over some underwater cables, resurrecting Jason with electricity. Naturally, the young couple are butchered and Jason is on the loose again. Meanwhile, the SS Lazarus is bound for New York City and young aquaphobe Rennie (Jensen Daggett) is boarded, much to the annoyance of her uncle and stick-in-the-mud biology teacher Charles McCulloch (Peter Mark Richman). Rennie is plagued by visions of a young deformed boy, and soon enough the mutilated corpses of teenagers start to appear.Notice how Manhattan is not mentioned once in the synopsis. Whether it was for budgetary reasons or plain bad writing, Jason's feet don't touch land until the final act. So the opportunity for Jason to be let loose in a city that may just be as deranged as he is - leaving a trail of guts in his wake - is wasted, choosing instead to have Jason chase the leads around smoky back-alleys. When Jason finally stumbles through Times Square barely noticed by passers-by, it's an amusing moment and proves what a wasted opportunity this was. The rest of the movie consists of the same slasher routine as every entry that came before, only less inventive and featuring characters even more grating than usual. Possibly the worst in the series, yet the franchise would somehow prevail.",

For this movie, it's rotten to the core of the Big Apple! Rating 1 out of 5 stars!",

This time we find our hero (Jason Vorhees) is about to crash a boat party. The stupid \"teens\" don't know what they're in for when everyone's favorite hockey mask wearing psycho climbs aboard and decides to mingle with the party and crew. The usual fare. Jason racks up an impressive body count whilst his prey try to do everything in there power to top this nearly indestructible killing machine. Sadly the M.P.A.A. and budget restraints stop this movie on dry dock. The closets Jason gets to Manhattan is in a long matte shot. He winds up in Vancouver and despite the promise in the trailer and t.v. spots he doesn't get to mingle all that much with the locals. If you're into this stuff however you'll not be disappointed.Recommended for genre fans.C+",

            "content": "I remember pretty well seeing previews for this flick back in the late 80's. I wasn't to familiar with the Jason flicks other then seeing part 1, 2 and part 6, but this one looked really interesting to me at the time. Mainly, because Jason is suppose to take Manhatten. The whole thought of it seemed like a lot of fun and was a good time to take advantage of the body count. Of course, as all of us Jason fans know, this movie was a big let down. Jason is in New York for the last 30 minutes of the movie and certainly doesn't take Manhattan.For those of you that don't know the storyline on how the heck Jason even gets to Manhattan, here it is. There is a High School trip on a cruise boat heading out towards New York. Jason, still underwater from the last film, awakens once again and boards the ship. Of course, he starts killing off the High Schoolers one by one in various different methods. About an hour into the film the remaining people on board decide to ditch the boat and head for shore on a row boat. And were do they end up? In Manhattan of course! Some how, Jason has followed them to Manhattan (I just can't see Jason swimming) and starts stalking them on the streets and alleys of New York.This really could have been a fun film, with the whole change in atmosphere and what not. There are a lot of problems with the film, though. Of course, what I stated above in my first paragraph about Jason only being in the City for about 30 minutes. This didn't really give Jason enough time to go on any real rampage. Sure, he kills some dead beat heroin addicts and and a few other people, but I wanted to see Jason really tear up New York and make them remember the name Jason Voorhies. Instead, he just decides to terrorize the last remaining people from the ship.Also, the music for the movie was pretty bad at times dating the movie. The nice thing about the other Jason flicks is a great and unforgettable soundtrack. What we get here is a lot of hair rock. But, they may have done this trying to change the format. It just doesn't work, though. Instead, it adds an extra bit of humor to this already silly film.I think with this movie it is important not to try and take it so seriously. Yes, this is a poor excuse for a Jason flick, but, it certainly is a laugh riot at times. And I think that is what you have to do. Ignore the fact that Jason can magically teleport about and laugh about it instead. Laugh at how silly Kane Hodder looks with his heavy breathing. And laugh at the death scenes, as they are quite funny even if they aren't all that bloody. And finally, laugh at how stupid Jason looks without his mask on.I have to defend this movie as a horror fan and as a \"Friday the 13th\" fan. Certainly, it is not a good movie, but it is still a lot of fun. 7/10",

            "content": "\"Friday the 13th: Part VIII - Jason Takes Manhattan\" is the eighth (yes, eighth) sequel in the series. The film opens with a couple of young adults on a boat on Camp Crystal Lake. The boyfriend, with intent on scaring his girlfriend, begins to tell her the story of Jason Voorhees, who is now somewhere below the waters of the lake, chained down after Tina Shepard sent him there in Part VII. Well, with a lightning strike, Jason is revived, and of course, slaughters the couple on the boat. From there, we are introduced to a girl named Rennie, an aspiring writer who is boarding a small cruise ship with her graduating class for a fun night in New York City. But little do they know, Jason is onboard also, and he begins killing the kids off one by one. A very small group of teens, including Rennie and her boyfriend, escape the ship at the NY dock, with Jason hot on their trail. It's Jason's night on the town, and he reprises his reign of terror on the city.It was different to see Jason in such a different setting here, all of the other films featured him stalking innocent (and not so innocent) teens in the woods around Crystal Lake, so the change of scenery was a bit refreshing. Kane Hodder returns to play Jason, I think he's the best, most convincing actor to take the job of playing such a maniac. It's good fun to watch him stalk the teenagers in alleyways, streets, and the underground tunnels below New York. It isn't until the 40-45 minute point when Jason and the teens actually arrive at the city, but the rest from there was complete fun. Jason actually does good in this film too, unintentionally saving Rennie from two inner-city guys who are about to rape her. Of course, they get theirs from Jason. Speaking of deaths, the body count in this film is quite large, possible one of the largest counts of the series. Well, maybe. The deaths are gory and gruesome, plenty to please the hardcore gorehounds. The acting was so-so, but one doesn't expect much from a \"Friday\" sequel.Overall, \"Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\" is semi-brainless fun. It's a nice change of scenery to see Jason do his thing in the inner-city, and I'm sure all of the hardcore fans of the series will enjoy watching it all happen. Entertaining and fun all around. 6/10.",

            "content": "Friday The 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan is kinda guilty of shitty false advertising, as well as just being an overall laughable effort in the franchise, which by that time had already run thin on new ideas. It was after Jason had run amok in the Camp Crystal Lake Woods, but before he got to go to hell, space or slap fisticuffs with Freddy Krueger, and kind of suffers in limbo at a juncture of the franchise that's stuck in a quagmire of dumb ideas. Of all the evocative, atmospheric locales they could have switched his bloody tirades to, the big Apple just doesn't seem like the ticket. That isn't even the real problem anyways, as a good two and a half thirds of the film isn't even set in NYC, but rather on a luxury cruise liner out on the coastline straights, bound for Manhattan and stuffed with more idiotic graduating high schoolers than you can shake a machete at. Lazy writing, nonexistent plotting and goofball acting are hallmarks in this terrain, but even more so with this flick, literally every non Jason character just being an insufferable ignoramus. The kills are passable but don't even come halfway to topping the franchise charts, Kane Hodder shows up for his shift as the big lug in full gear, hockey mask and slimy mongoloid prosthetics included at no extra charge. When the boat does finally land on New York shores, it's jarring to see Jason waltzing down fifth avenue looking like a homeless nut whose stairs don't quite reach the attic, machete in hand in broad daylight as he pursues the few remaining partygoers through the crowded streets. Really, guys? Keep the big guy in his shrouded summer camp forests where he's at home, and the feng-shui of his murders rings true. Or at least let him go to space where there's still dark hallways and hidden alcoves. Probably the biggest misfire in the series.",

The acting in this movie is though. It's just as corny as the rest of the acting in the Friday the 13th films. The music in this movie is okay. It does succeed in setting the mood for the movie. The deaths in this movie are good. Just like a lot of the deaths in the series. The most memorable death in this film is the scene were Jason punches a guys head off.

It is not often Peter Mark Richman gets a large role in a mainstream feature film but here he is. Richman is known to me for his 1960s TV guest roles (for example in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea) where he is very different to how he is seen in this flick!He has a sexy scene with a woman and once he finally gets to New York some young thug calls Richman \"Dad\", a rude remark about his age. Scenes of Richman running around 1989 New York, still after all these years being chased by fantastic evil ... that is something I remember with joy.As would be expected in a 1980s horror film like this, the violence is strong, but if you want to see a fun movie with a great cast and a nice retro feel (thanks to Richman)...this is the movie for you!",

            "content": "Here I am finally nearing the end of my reviews of the Friday the 13th franchise. \"Jason Takes Manahattan\" is one of my favorite sequels of the series and I find it strange that there are so many negative reviews from fans for this installment. Aside from the weird ending, part 8 actually treads new ground successfully(in my opinion) and definitely delivers it very entertainingly. This is one of the only sequels in which we know other things about the characters than just their names. For example we have the main character Rennie who has a mysterious secret throughout the film that she is terrified of the water because when she was a little girl Jason tried to pull her down under the water while she was drowning: we also have Wayne the aspiring film student and Tamara the beauty prom-queen type and Sean the guy who doesn't want to follow in his fathers footsteps. All in all it just seems as if the script cared a little bit more for its characters unlike some of the previous films. Not too much more, but enough to elevate the story above average.I hear a lot of people complain that too much of this movie takes place aboard the cruise ship. And this is true and sort of misleading because the title states that Jason \"takes\" Manhattan when in reality he just goes there and kills the rest of the survivors from the cruise ship. This DID disappoint me at first but I got over it. I like this movie. The soundtrack and songs are great, it has a good opening, and all the characters are pretty likable(except for Rennie's Uncle and Tamara). There are also a few \"worth mentioning\" death scenes in this installment which is an improvement over Part 7's excruciatingly censored farce. First off there is the fairly violent strangulation scene on the dance floor of one of the would-be grads. Then there is the scene in the boats basement involving a guitar which I think is pretty awesome. And last we have the boxing scene in NYC between Julius and Jason himself which is classic stuff.The NY scenes(the last quarter of the film)were all well executed and definitely worth the wait. I like the scene where Rennie and Sean are pleading for the waitress to call the police claiming that \"a maniac\" is trying to kill them and she replies \"welcome to New York\" just as Jason busts through the front doors. Yeah, this ain't nothing from New York honey!! The finale in the sewers is great. Jason's execution in this one started out just fine/Rennie throws a drum full of toxic waste straight into his eyes, blinding him, and he ultimately drowns again after the sewer \"floods out\". All this would have been a nice end to a fun and energetic sequel until they show the shot of him reborn as a little boy. What?? It makes no sense at all. They should have skipped that and had the last shot be the one of his acid-melted mask floating by. That would have been great. But hey, its all good. 8/10 is my vote. One of my personal faves!!",

            "content": "Better than most films in the franchise, but I've always felt this was an overrated horror franchise and the bar is pretty low for what's a \"good\" film in the series. Kane Hodder returns for his second appearance as Jason, although I still don't know exactly what it is about his performance that fans consider him to be the definitive Jason. It may more have to do with the story than Hodder's performance in that with the prior film the producers seemed to finally figure out the \"rules\" for Jason (supernatural, mutated under the hockey mask, always wet, is a big chest breather). He still isn't really a character in the traditional sense, but he was at least consistent for the four films that Hodder appeared in as a hulking force of nature that cannot be stopped or reasoned with. In this entry, a group of teens take a party boat downriver, but have an unexpected stowaway in Mr. Voorhees, which for the first hour becomes a low rent ripoff of \"Alien\" with junky riverboat instead of a spaceship for the monster to take out the passengers one by one. Jason and company don't even reach Manhattan until the last half hour of the film, but once they do, you do get to see Jason saving a woman from a would-be rapist, fight a boxer on a tenement rooftop, and you even get to see him scare some punks in a filthy pre-Giuliani Times Square. The boat portion of the film isn't all that good, but I did enjoy Jason chasing hapless teens through moving subway trains and through the mean streets of the Big Apple. Nothing brilliant here, but for fans of slasher films, this one isn't completely awful.",

Jason sets sail aboard the cruise ship Lazarus (appropriately named) with the Crystal Lake graduating class, which gives him a lot of victims.  I do like the fact that it takes place on a boat.  It presents certain claustrophobic elements.  You simply can't run away from Jason so you have to face and attempt to kill him.  But, that element is never used properly.  Sadly, this is the only Friday the 13th movie I owned when I was younger so I watched it over and over again.  It's only now that I realize how terrible it is.  The how's of Jason's resurrection, his magical ability to appear and disappear at will (in the Kelly Hu death scene), and Jason's own \"death\" are pathetically explained. Part 7 may be my least favorite, but this one is the worst film (Jason Goes to Hell doesn't even qualify as a Friday the 13th movie).  Kane Hodder is just as menacing in this, but the make-up guys can't match the look of the last film.  Any semblance of continuity ends here.

            "content": "One year after the events of the previous film, Jason Voorhees stalks a group of graduating high school students on the SS Lazarus, a ship bound for New York City.If Part VI was the first Friday that \"feels like a real movie\", Part VIII feels like a made-for-TV movie. The acting is the worst in a series that wasn't exactly getting Meryl Streep-level performances before, and the special effects are practically non-existent. Many of the kills are off screen, or we see Jason swinging something at the camera, and then see a bloody body. Compared to his awesome look in Part VII, Jason looks like crap. His face without a mask on looks like raw hamburger meat.Part VIII's lightning is really bizarre. That's a weird complaint maybe, but if you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. I'm vaguely aware that other countries have different lighting techniques than Hollywood, and I know a lot of the movie was filmed in British Columbia, so that could be the explanation. Or it could just be that the film overall is pretty bad, and the lighting is no exception. Either way, it looks \"off\".As for the plot, most people hate how much of this movie doesn't actually take place in Manhattan; the characters don't make it there until the final 30 minutes. Personally, I don't mind because I think a ship is an interesting setting for a horror movie.Unfortunately, the execution of that setting is poor. It's a big ship, with not a ton of people aboard. Done right, Jason should've continued picking off most of the students until the remaining few noticed people are missing and eventually realized they're surrounded by water on a big ship with a killer onboard. Instead, Part VIII drowns us in boring subplots that go nowhere, and once evidence of Jason's crimes are discovered, there are still 10+ people left. There's no claustrophobia or tension.Also worth noting there's a Crazy Ralph rip-off character who keeps saying the ship is \"doomed\". Advice to writer-director Rob Hedden: you don't need a red herring when it's not a mystery who the killer is.Once the film moves to New York, the movie picks up a little bit. It does have two kills that I think are decent; Julius getting his head punched off, and Charles - the asshole principle who is probably the only character with any common sense - getting drown in a barrel. Great utilization of New York by the way; Jason visits all of the major land marks: Times Square, the subway, a random diner, the alleys, and the sewers. Seeing as he can apparently teleport in this movie, he should've caught a Rangers game.This movie also has some comedy, but I'm pretty sure it's mostly unintentional.The first moment is when one of character, after losing his glasses, shoots a fellow student in the chest with a shotgun thinking it's Jason.Later, as a group of the characters prepare to escape the ship, useless teacher Colleen mentions how she left several students in the ship's restaurant. Sean, the son of the slain ship's captain who is leading the escape in the only lifeboat, replies \"there is no more restaurant!\" Is he implying Jason killed them? He has no way of knowing that. If he implying the restaurant has already been engulfed by the spreading fire? The fire didn't start there and we literally just saw the characters in the restaurant less than two minutes of screen time ago. Either way, airhead Colleen just goes along with it and they don't go back for those students. Enjoy your fiery, watery, or Jason-y deaths, ya poor bastards.Finally, once in New York City, Rennie - the bland main character, by the way - drives a car directly into wall (in a horribly directed scene featuring slow motion). Rennie and the other characters flee the burning vehicle; Colleen does not, and is killed as the car completely explodes. It is hysterical.The ending of the movie is the final nail in the coffin: Jason is submerged in toxic sewer waste and reverts back to being a child. Who writes this crap?Jason Takes Manhattan was the final Friday film produced by Paramount, and the studio went out with a whimper. It's a shame because the first 7 films are all pretty decent, and Part VIII gives us a really crappy ending to the \"Friday the 13th\" story line.Financially, most of the films in the series had a budget of $2M-$3M, and took in roughly $20M at the box office ($30M+ for some of the earlier films). Friday VIII had the highest budget of any of the movies (estimated $5M-$5.5M), but only made around $15M. As a result, Paramount decided to stop making Friday movies, and loaned the Jason character - but not the Friday the 13th name - to New Line Cinema, who produced the next few movies in the series.",

            "content": "Usually suspension of disbelief is one of my strong points, in the past it has helped me through plenty of cinematic stinkers. \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" however pushed me to the limit, because this one really doesn't make a lick of sense. I know that's a common go-to criticism for a horror movie, but I'm aware unstoppable zombie serial killers who get revived by electric jolts probably don't really exist. I'm talking about the inherent logic of this movie.For one thing: I know the filmmakers have been playing around with Jason's pace ever since the beginning, making him appear wherever they want him to. We've accepted that Jason is clearly a lot quicker once he's off-camera, but this one doesn't play fair. The worst offender is probably the scene where the stepfather is running from a strolling Jason, then enters a house only to find Jason waiting for him there. He can teleport now? If you're going to make him teleport, what's the point of all the chase sequences? There's no suspense if Jason catches you whenever he wants to.Little things that don't make sense, but just happen because the movie says so are a real plague here. The very premise is flawed. Jason boards a ship that's supposed to bring a high school class to New York, but why would he do that? Why leave Crystal Lake now, after all these years/movies? And how on earth can you reach New York via a lake? Writer/Director Rob Hedden makes absolutely no effort in providing some kind of explanation to cover all this up, because he's going to put Jason on Times Square by any means necessary.Any means necessary also includes Jason simply swimming to New York once the ship sinks, the remaining characters splitting up in New York's worst neighbourhood because...Lord knows, vats op toxic waste that just stand around on the street, and Jason suddenly being able to walk past herds of people without trying to kill any of them. Killing everything that moves is just about Jason's only character trait, and they couldn't even get that right.All this would be somewhat forgivable if the movie was at least entertaining, but the kill scenes are just boring. We've seen this dude ripping people's hearts out, so seeing him sorta kinda strangle a girl makes him look like he's lost his touch. There's one holy grail is this pile of dung though: at one point the token black kid engages into a long boxing match with Jason, with a predictable winner. This movie blows, but that is one of the highlights of the entire franchise.",

Much of the hate comes from diminished expectations, coming off two good movies in the series, and famously not featuring much of Jason \"taking\" Manhattan. If you can ignore this, and many glaring errors - geographic, spatial, logical - this is fun trash entertainment, and the last slice and dice Jason formula movie until the reboot. The movie is basically shot well, keeps up pace most of the time, features an attractive cast, and - for the modern viewer - lots of fun nuggets of late 80s culture. The filmic portrayal of pre-Giuliani New York always fascinates. Where the film goes wrong are those areas that could have made it more entertaining for what it was: a slasher on a boat. Many of the kills underwhelm. Some go on for so long, we expect more. Some don't quite seem logical: Jason is portrayed as superhuman, yet struggles to strangle or stab pretty easy victims. For a lumbering zombie, he is able to sneak up on victims with no sound, smell, or bodily residue giving him away. This is made plainer by the kills that do work, like the character who boxes Jason, gives up and says \"take your best shot.\" Or the rocker guitar kill. These are like a B on a bad report card, showing it could be better if they tried. When Jason does get to Manhattan, he ignores a plethora of victims to go after the main characters, who don't even have a direct connection to Camp Crystal Lake. His \"death,\" via some whacked out perception of toxic New York, is made more ridiculous by the fact that later sequels deviate to the point where this could be considered his final death scene in the Camp Crystal Lake Paramount octet. It's still better than parts 5 or 9, and still an enjoyable diversion.",

The great Psycho-style music scores for the opening credits have been replaced with a cheesy song from the 80s, to accompany footage of New York, a.k.a. Vancouver. The \"flashback scene\" of how Jason drowned has been re-filmed, with some normal-looking kid (with a full head of hair!) playing him. The opening kill scene is over- acted and not inspired, personally I could have done without the girl's annoying screeching....and that's the first 10 minutes!Then, the rest of the damn movie takes place on a boat.

The setting of a cruise ship and a fairly reasonable attempt to replicate New York was a good start, but once again, the lack of a good story or credible actors dooms the overall effect.This was also the last FT13 film that Paramount paid for. One wonders if it was because they were tired of being punished at the box office for their inability to fight with the MPAA, or simply because they were tired of trying to publicise the results. Either way, the dramatic improvement, quality wise, that the series took after it was out of Paramount's hands is quite amusing to note.Either way, this marks Kane Hodder's second outing as the hockey-masked wildman, and it is certainly one of his more credible offerings. Unlike every other Jason, Kane actually looks the part of someone who spent his entire childhood living in the woods, as the canon would have us believe. The problem here is that thanks to the MPAA and Paramount, he is given sadly little to do that sticks in the mind of the audience as memorable.The support cast are once again as convincing as Peter Jackson promising to respect the integrity of a story. Even the stereotypes they follow seem so hopelessly out of date that one wonders if the FT13 writing staff weren't given a chance to take a peek at some Days Of Our Lives plot lines. However, by far the most irritating support character would be McCulloch. One would think that the writers would have watched a few of the Nightmare On Elm Street films and learned how to write unidimensional adult characters. Sadly, it is a trademark of the FT13 series to plaigarise from everyone for every reason, except when they actually should. The deckhand is a good example of this. Did they really think that borrowing from parts one and two would erase the general suck factor of this installment?Another big problem with this film is how little credit it gives the audience for its intelligence. Sewers filling with toxic waste every evening at a certain time is bad enough, but if this really did take place, one has to wonder at how easily accessible our cast find the tunnels. One also has to wonder exactly where the police force would have been whilst this man is wandering from store to store, smashing everything as he goes. I was under the impression that the NYPD was quite substantially armed, and had enough hardware to separate Jason's molecules if so desired.In the end, I gave FT13 part eight a one out of ten. The \"suitable for everyone\" plays at gore really wear thin here. It's like watching porn without a money shot. Save your money and see an Evil Dead film instead.",

The movie delivers everything we'd expect to see in a Jason movie; a gruesome body-count, cool and unusual ways of dying, and only having one or two survivors at the end of the ordeal. Plus, the movie has a cool and different setting that gives Jason some new tricks up his sleeves.Jason was thrown back into the lake and chained by the end of Part 7. However, his body has been disturbed once again and causes him to rise up from the lake and start his killing spree all over again. This time, things are a bit different as he sneaks onto a cruise boat full of students on their way to a field trip. Even though it is not his usual territory, Jason proves to be a unmerciful killer wherever he is. And the last 20 minutes or so Jason is in New York; a whole new playground for him to spread his terror and bloodshed.I thought this was a pretty neat movie. They went for something different and it worked (unlike \"Jason Goes to Hell\"). While it offers a different setting, it's still the good old Jason formula we've all come to love. I wished that Jason could've been in New York more, though. It would've been cool to see him get a chance to increase the body-count rather than just go after the ones who got off the boat (I know, he mainly only goes after those who return to Crystal Lake, but you have to admit it's a cool idea. I mean, he's there already. Why not give him a chance to take out more people?). Besides that little complaint, I thought it was a cool Jason flick.All in all, I found that \"Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\" to be a successful addition to the Jason series.

The kitchens are empty, the engine room is unmanned and there's no cabin crew, so either the company that runs it is soon to go bankrupt and this is the last voyage, or the movie has nothing but contempt for its audience.

We come to the campiest part of the series. The time when the parody replaced the horror film. Camp Crystal Lake is now big enough for 20 foot boats. And, after a couple movies, it turns out Jason can be woken up by electricity, but only on Friday the 13th, yeah, ok. So, in the original film, Camp Crystal Lake was located in New Jersey and was big enough to be an over-sized pond, but in this film, it has room for a 20 foot boat and a river big enough for that boat to float upstream to Iceland (subbing for Canada?), it looks like, where Jason hitches a ride on a mini-cruise ship, bound for New York. The ship then looks like it is cruising over Lake Michigan in a brutal storm, which I guess is supposed to be the Atlantic Ocean. For a majority of the film, we are on the cruise to hell, while Jason chases after graduating students from Lakeview High. Jason makes it to New York City with 30 minutes left in the movie.The basic plot, especially the scenes on the ship, in some ways, reminds me of Bram Stoker's story about Dracula. Having Jason preying on the people on the ship, like Bela Lugosi in Dracula (1931) or Max Schreck in Nosferatu (1922), has an interesting similarity. It is even more evident, when the New York City police are inspecting the ship, that ran aground, full of corpses, just like in the different depictions of Dracula. I noticed a few things in this film, that reminded me of other movies. Part of the plot reminded me of The Poseidon Adventure (1974), too. There is an extra side-story, involving the captain of the ship and his son. It had the similar character development pattern found in disaster movies. It was appropriate though, because of the impending doom we know is coming to everyone. This was really the only interesting part to the film.Once Jason gets to Manhattan, he seems to be ignoring the New-Yorkers and just keeps chasing the people from Crystal Lake. I guess we are to assume, he only kills those from the lake? So, he is ignoring the New Yorkers? Jason is much faster in this film. Jason is also an excellent swimmer. I did not know Jason bellowed like a dinosaur when you throw toxic chemicals on him. Jason can read, \"In Case of Fire, Break Glass\". Jensen Daggett, who plays Rennie, keeps seeing premonitions/visions of, I guess, Jason drowning. It makes no sense and comes out of nowhere. That is just part of the paper thin plot found in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989).The majority of the film has very unlikeable characters, which is typical of these films. It is a believed idea, that the point to making the characters unlikeable is, that you root for Jason to kill them. That is the point. Jason is the anti-hero in this. Composer, Harry Manfredini, left the series after doing all of the films up to this point. Fred Mollin, who co-composed with Manfredini on the last film, took over the reigns, to fully compose this film. There is a stark difference in the music. That is not a commentary on the quality of the music, but the music seems to accidently emphasize the camp-atmosphere felt in the film. Veteran television and film actor, Peter Mark Richman plays Dr. Charles McCulloch, the chaperone of the students. On the flip-side of the career scale, making one of her early film appearances is Kelly Hu (Nash Bridges, 1997-1998 and Arrow, 2012-2019), as Eva Watanabe.The film is a slight mess in its design. There are some strange edits, found in the wrong places. It contains a ridiculous ending to an even more ridiculous movie. Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989), is a failure and I am not alone on this. You can see the results, that the critics came to, as well as, the audience scores, anywhere online. I remember the noise heard, even back in 1989, when everyone said this film stinks. I'm pretty sure I saw it in theaters, so I probably read some of the bad reviews or saw an episode of Siskel and Ebert (1975-1999), back in the day. I do remember people being almost-angry about it. Even though this film is a failure, I still think it should be seen, because you have to see it to believe it. Other than the Dracula comparison, a few clever scenes and Peter Mark Richman being a jerk, I would tell you to skip this one, but it was the end of an era for this franchise. Is this the end of Jason? No, but it sure looks like the producers wanted to kill him. That makes sense considering New Line Cinema would pick up the franchise for the ninth film, Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993).3.5 (F MyGrade) = 4 IMDB.",

Yet the budge wasn't there and thus became Jason takes a cruise. By this point in the series it feels like it was dead weight and they had ran out of ideas. It wasn't bad when it was brand new novelty waiting to be explored but it became a problem when one was released every year and ran into the ground. Why not bring back Tina or have her team up with Tommy to take him on sounds like a better idea to me then moving Jason to another location when the woods have always worked fine. Another plot point they could work with is why people keep going back to the lake or even mentioned it has been demolished. Anyway, the kids are party hearty when they are hijacked by the water monster known as Jason and one by one go missing or end up dead. The survivors try to make it to safety on a boat raft towards their destination. Once the statue of liberty is seen in the mist it feels like they are home free and will get the help they need. I wanted the kids to search the city in amazement and awe at all the grand locations you see in other films.Jason on the other hand follows, which is where the movie gets hooky, he looks rotted and his spine is showing. Yet no one on the streets find him horrifying or weird and act like it's a normal day in New York. Another strange addition is that the tunnels below are flooded nightly with toxic waste. For the rats? What about the mole people or an innocent bystander falls in a hole? The comic relief is present as always. Jason pisses off some thugs, takes off his mask and gives them freight. The only time it seems steeped in logic. It never explained if Renee had a psychic link to him or why he restored to his younger self once bathed in the toxic waste. I know that the budge wasn't the best but they could've came up with some creative and cunning ways to use the footage they did have to create one last great Friday the 13th. Sadly it proved the series needed to be put to bed once and for all.",

This is a guy who's made a habit of ruthlessly eviscerating everyone he's ever encountered, yet now he passes harmlessly through a loaded subway car and cheerfully lifts his mask to scare a gang of punks like a haunted house denizen. Production values have taken a significant step up since Part VII, and the gore feels somewhat less censored, but it's failed by yet another repetitive, hole-laden plot and a reliably godawful set of actors.",

            "content": "This 8th title in the Friday THE 13TH series is not a great film but at least it's not as bad as the part VII. First I think here they tried to recall some stuff of the original movies (especially the part of the little JASON die drowned), which was good. Then they also put some new stuff: the new scenarios (ship and New York). I guess it was something nice to be different, unlike the Part VII when they tried to \"innovate\" with the paranormal phenomena, and I found it really absurd and out of context to a JASON flick. Unlike the title might induce the major part of the plot is not passed in New York but inside the ship which was traveling to there. So JASON just took a lift to travel a little bit!:) I think this film is more suspenseful than other titles in the series and it fits in a type of horror movie which has more to do with the 90's and recent horror films that to the 80's flicks. It's clich\u00e9d of course, but with the clich\u00e9s of the 90's and not so much of the 80's, like the previous films. Besides, it also has a subtle but effective humor (like that scene where JASON takes his mask and show his face to some New York street kids, or the other one when a guy says give me your best shot, and JASON rip off his head...), unlike the Part VI, where it was totally \"forced\" and unfunny.

Part VIII isn't even that. It's a chore to get through, has a lot of plot holes, setting isn't very good for the series (what's a \"Friday the 13th\" movie without a summer camp which makes a great place for murdering and chasing horny and stupid teenagers) and acting is bad and not convincing at many times.

As the censors wouldn't let them get away with the gore of the early films it would make sense to make them more scary as it is the series by part 6 was just a pale shadow of its former self.Part 8 is not a bad film - it's just not a very good one either.",

The bulk of (Jason Takes Manhattan) takes place on a low rent cruise ship where Jason stalks and kills more teenagers with most of the deaths taking place off screen. Then after around one hour and fifteen minutes they finally make it to New York City but not really as the next twenty minutes of the movie takes place on the slum town docks of New York City where the only thing waiting for the survivors is muggers and of course Jason Voorhees. The scenes that take place on the docks were actually filmed in Vancover (Canada) which is made more obvious by the movies unconvincing backgrounds. Only the last ten minutes of the movie actually takes place in New York City that's only around 4% of entire movie and honestly in the last ten minutes Jason barely does anything interesting. Jason kills only one person and just walks away from anyone who doesn't stand up to him but even when they do all he does is shove them aside not so different from any other New Yorker in a rush.The kills aren't anything special most take place off screen. The only decent kill is one where Jason literally punches a guys head off and it flys into a nearby dumpster other than that pretty standard stuff for a Friday the 13th movie. The only reason this sequel is watched by fans of the series is because of Kane Hodder's badass performance as Jason Voorhees.",

I like that they branched out and stepped outside of Camp Crystal Lake and featured some new scenery, modern (for the 80s) music, and new style. You have to watch such films through a certain lens. They are a bit of fun to have a laugh with friends perhaps and to enjoy 90 mins of light entertainment. And it is very light for modern audiences, these are horror films very different from the gore and torture porn of the 2000s+. They are fun and lighthearted and not to be picked apart logically. You really don't see a great deal. I watched these films when I was about 13 without feeling actually scared as such. 15 years on they are even more nostalgic for their predictability and carefree nature, which films these days struggle to be as there's always some part of the woke brigade that is being pacified. I only give this 4/10 to stay consistent with the way I score all films overall on IMDB. Of its type, a classical slasher movie, it is an 8/10, but in regards to its place in the annals of film history, it is a 4/10 film and that is being generous lol.",

The climatic scene where Jason is killed by toxic waste and the two survivors walk off into times square is strange but good none the less.I have heard so many complaints from fans of the series about this film not about taking place in New York that i will right this wrong by writing a version of the script that will be set entirely in New York.

The film has no imagination, no creativity, which pretty much demonstrates that Hedden is dead weight in talent.Jensen Dagget is just about the only actor in the entire film who had something to offer. The rest of the cast must have been taken off the street.Jason is re-awakened again. And in the same way...again. Talk about no imagination. Why come up with your own idea when you can steal someone else's? The sad part is that it was pretty stupid the first time around.Jason boards a cruise liner...the worst looking cruise ship I've ever seen. Of course, he manages to slaughter a bunch of dumb, inept teens and crew members alike. Got love the girl who just sits there while Jason goes to the mirror to get a weapon. Never mind trying to run. Gotta hand it the prop and writing department, There's never a shortage of weapons. Some even manifest out of thin air, from chain saws, to spears, to you name it!Somehow, after the ship is destroyed, Jason follows them in the water to NY. And I guess there isn't a single soul around the piers or docks of NY either.Pathetic plot devices are used, such as when it's suggested that they all split up! Even the two gang bangers (only two!) are laughable beyond belief. Don't even get me started about a masked man rampaging through the streets of NY, and nobody notices. I mean that literally, since hardly any of the extras react at all.The last set of writers and directors ran this dead franchise into the ground where it should have stayed about five films ago. Hedden makes the writers of the last few Halloween and Elm Street movies look like geniuses by comparison!I'll keep the first three films of this series. The rest are being deleted.Congrats, Hedden!

I have no intention of becoming a manuer expert.#8 recieved a couple chuckles, but didn't provide the same number of laughs that #7 had, nor did it make me cringe with its annoying music and comic relief like #6 did.From the title it becomes obvious that Jason takes a vacation away from Crystal Lake.

            "content": "I watched this movie directly after watching the others before it. It tries to combine several teen exploitation genres together in one movie and fails quite dramatically. Others have reviewed the movie's myriad flaws much better than I can here, but I want to point out something that none I've read seem to have noticed.Where the heck did most of the characters go? There are several points in the film where people simply vanish from the movie. The kids on the boat are gathered in the dance room by the teacher. Then the teachers and the main characters flee the boat without going to check on them. The only thing said about it is \"there is no restaurant\" when the teacher asks about the other kids. Also, the female teacher dies in a car explosion for no apparent reason. They just leave her in the car when everyone gets out. I guess she just didn't feel like being in the rest of the movie. Can't blame her.Another simple thing. The makers of this movie must really hate New York people. The people are possibly the coldest and most non-reactive people to ever witness a murder. I lived in NY. This kinda stuff in times square would not stand. One last flaw. Since when can Jason teleport? There were more than a few times when someone was running away only to find him already at the other end of a flight of stairs or on top of a ladder or inside a room when he was right behind them a second ago. There's even one scene where a teen looks up and sees Jason at the top of some stairs, then looks at the bottom and he's there too. He's supernatural, but not that supernatural. It takes away from the \"running as fast as I can but he keeps gaining on me\" suspense of a thriller.Overall, this movie had some OK death scenes but no discernible plot or intelligence. The boat was a dumb idea for a location. NY was even worse. The subplot about the girl and her visions and the jerk teacher was dumb and never bore any fruit. Don't even get me started on the stupid attempt to portray a high school graduation party. The ending...what?So 3 stars. Watch for laughs, otherwise don't bother.",

I have nothing against changing the setting (the ship sounded intriguing to me) or putting Jason just a few clicks away from his longtime Jersey home.  What I am against is how cruel they've made him, as he ditches his usual pop outta the darkness and bang your dead for long, lingering, tortuous deaths.  Thats what made this \"Friday\" seem disconnected, having Jason so mean.  Ok, so he wasnt nice to begin with, but at least he sent his victims to a quick grave which is what made the filmsfun. Here he's more heartless than usual, a big mis-step by writer/director Hedden.  People slowwwwly drowned in toxic waste, or slowwwly choked, or the girl who has her head slammed into a mirror and then has Jason hover over her with a glass shard raised in the air as she screams forever until finally killed.  Or when he holds the harpoon gun over the other girl for like 30 seconds as she screams \"no no no no\" endlessly.  Tons of stuff way outta place.  In the old days his victims didnt have the chance to scream let alone say no.  Only two kills remotely resemble the old Jason, the head-punch-off and the sauna rock to the gut.  Everything else, like the subplot concerning Daggetts association with Jason, is awful.  And the ending, complete junk.  Jason gets hit by toxic waste in a sewer and when it all washes away...we see the body of a little boy!  What the hells that sposed to mean?!!  And no Harry Manfredini score!  Even if he didnt wanna come back, still another glaring disappointment.  Jason make-up sux too, he looks dorky with those big eyes.  A few smiles, like the Jason billboard, or the raised mask to the gang members, and \"theres a maniac trying to kill us!\"...\"Welcome to New Yawk.\"  I do recommend you see this, just to find out how bad it was.

            "content": "This is one of those films where director Rob Hedden wanted to be different. In most of the killings scenes there is no possible way Jason could get to the victim unless he was a magician. Like the character J.J., she sees Jason on the top of the stairs, she drops her guitar, runs down a flight of stairs and there is Jason waiting for her, guitar in hand. If you look at it from that stand point then the movie is going to be dumb. But I believe that Hedden wanted this 7th sequel to not be a typical slasher film like the ones before it. This is why I think it is the best of the series and a decent horror movie. In my opinion this movie has tons of irony and symbolism. If you notice, each character Jason hacks off has something they want to become. This is more of a film about dreams, Jason seems to be everywhere in this movie and he, more or less, represents fate. It is there anytime any place, you can run from it and it will always find you. The dreams of these young people will not happen and that is what Hedden wants you to see. All of this could be coincidence, but let's look at the ending. Jason turns into a child again. That has to be some kind of symbolism otherwise it wouldn't make any sense. Just like all the rest of the people who parished on the Lazurus, this shows Jason as being young and the fate that led him up to that point. Where the other movies have a more serious tone, this movie doesn't really take itself seriously in that way.",

            "content": "The eighth film in this iconic slasher franchise sees supernatural killer Jason Voorhees taking his hack/slash mentality on the road. This was meant to be a final entry, but as is commonly the case with these movies more followed, and despite the 'Jason Takes Manhattan' subtitle there is not very much in the way of Jason taking Manhattan. This film is incredibly rooted in the late 1980's and the time period does not do it any favors. Apparently in an effort to liven up the series the writer/director decides to take Jason out of the confines of Crystal Lake and send him towards the big city. This seems like a silly direction for the series to even attempt especially in what is supposed to be the final entry of the series. This is a silly entry into what is overall a pretty silly series. The actual horror is that it is possible to make a good slasher film utilizing the Jason character, but the accomplishment of that feat continues to flummox everyone who attempts it.This film starts on Crystal Lake as a houseboat drags an electical cable to the entombed Jason who is resurrected once again with a jolt from the high powered cable. Jason immediately takes advantage and kills the first teenagers he comes across. Most of the action in the film takes place on a large boat dubbed, not so subtly, SS Lazarus. A graduating high school class has rented a boat to transport them to NYC as a graduation party pleasure cruise. First off since when does little ol' Crystal Lake connect to the open sea? All of a sudden because the plot demands it. Secondly this looks way more like a trawler/barge than any sort of vacation pleasure cruise vessel not to mention this graduating class seems to have only about ten people. The girl who is included to be the final girl has a fear of the water and almost drowned once and for no good reason whatsoever is having visions of Jason drowning as a child. In predictable fashion Jason dispatches teen after teen as well as chaperones until pretty much everyone on the boat is dead. At that point the boat finally reaches NYC. The few left flee into the city pursued by Jason. The busiest city on the planet has bizarrely few people in it as Jason whittles down the remaining kids. There is an odd scene where the lead girl is abducted by ruffians and almost raped, but of course Jason slaughters them too in an inadvertently heroic move. It is just yet more ridiculousness in this shambles of a plot. Eventually Jason is dispatched by drowning in the sewer when the tunnels conveniently flood at night. It is meant to mimic him drowning as a child. If you say so.This was meant to be Jason's swan song? This is the character and the franchise at the height of its ridiculous intention. This should be graphically violent and scary and instead it is laughable for its stupidity and poor value and has surprisingly little in the way of actual graphic horror. The characters that Jason is killing here are so forgettable they don't even merit mentions by name. It always seems a mistake to take this character away from the confines of Crystal Lake which is really what ties his mythology together. It'd be like taking Leatherface and relocating him to Wisconsin. It just doesn't make any sense, but they keep doing it. It doesn't shock me that we keep producing 'Friday the 13th' films, but it does shock me at how exceedingly bad they continue to be. There is absolutely no redeeming qualities in this movie which is a really hard feat for a movie to accomplish. This movie is one of the worst the series has to offer and that is saying something for a series that sets an incredibly low bar.Eric's Grade: F.",

The only reason why I have this film is it was a double feature with Friday the 13th The New Blood. Unlike 7 this film lacked in so many ways. They killed the cool girl, J.J. too early, and Wayne lacked screen time. Some of the characters like Tammy and Ava were just stupid characters. They were mean and Tammy reminded me of some of the girls I went to school with. I did like Rennie and Sean the survivors of Jason's wrath. This is one thing they did right with the movie. It just wasn't my type of movie, the film went from Crystal Lake to a cruise ship, big no-no.The plot was stupid and when I think of Friday the 13th, I think of Camp Crystal Lake. This is one of the worst of the Friday franchise, and I thought Jason Goes To Hell was bad. This one ranks high on the SUX Meter. This whole idea of Jason taking a bite out of The Big Apple was doomed from the start. This film with it's weak plot, weak characters; and moving away from Crystal Lake-BIG F##K UP.

Her character appears to be a merging of Joan Jett (hence \"J.J.\") and Lita Ford (hence the more heavy metal style of playing than Joan and the type of guitar--a flying v---). Both Joan and Lisa (former band mates in The Runaways(1976-1979) were at the peak of their popularity when this movie came out. Since guitars are also known by the name 'Ax' Jason uses her new instrument as one. Annoyingly though he appears to 'teleport' from above his victim to down and in front of her while picking up her 'Ax' along the way.\nReni is nice looking too, but I like JJ best.As for the rest of the movie. It does suck. I hate the location changes and no one has commented that Crystal Lake is a LAKE! How do you take a small boat into a lake? I thought this was a landlocked body of water in upstate(?) New York. But as others have noted Crystal Lake seems to be like The Simpsons 'Springfield' and be located near whatever the plot needs.I, too, am confused why Jason gets on the boat and leaves Crystal Lake? Does he think more victims will be acquired this way?The special effects on Jason are terrible. Continuity flaws abound. Jason's 'teleportation' power is a joke. The \"Manhattan\" scenes are awful. The ending is pathetic.A 2 star movie. I only made it 3 stars for Saffron Henderson's too-brief role as a girl with a guitar.I've seen Jason goes to hell.

            "content": "Jason Takes Manhattan is the last Friday the 13th to be released by Paramount Pictures and was the lowest grossing instalment, which is probably why they sold it off to New Line Cinema in the 1990's who ironically didn't gain the rights to use the Friday the 13th title. Paramount produced eight movies in nine years from 1980 to 1989, sometimes reluctantly so, and with Part 8 it's almost as if they wanted the series to come crashing down under it's own weight because this is the lamest instalment and it doesn't really feel like a Friday the 13th movie and at 100 mins run time it is the longest.The electronic score by Fred Mollin has none of the subtlety or tension that Harry Manfredini's scores had and the cheesy 80's rock soundtrack tries to set a broad tone to appeal to a wider audience like Part 6 tried to but again it doesn't work. There are a few things going for it such as Kane Hodder returning as Jason, Jensen Daggett being a cut above the average teen victim and Bryan England's cinematography making this one of the nicest shot Friday the 13th movies of the series. However it does feel restrained at times and almost like it was made for TV, and maybe we can put this down to a few things. Firstly veteran TV actor Peter Mark Richman is a familiar face to many Americans as he appeared in numerous popular TV shows in the US from the 1950's through to the 1990's, but gives a lacklustre one note performance here, and secondly writer/director Rob Hedden had been promoted from the Friday the 13th TV series to make his directorial debut with Part 8.The failure of Jason Takes Manhattan however is not all with Hedden but mostly with Paramount for not investing in what he had envisaged for the movie. In fact he has publicly apologised for the way it came out and has disowned it. The studio wouldn't even fund more days filming in New York which is why it takes more than an hour before we get there, with a majority of the film taking place on board a cruise ship, and when we do get to the city it's Vancouver that is doubling for the streets of New York. Only the scenes in Time Square were actually filmed in the Big Apple so it makes for a very misleading title.Having to employ another ludicrous idea of resurrecting Jason from another watery grave, this time with a severed electrical cable, he becomes a stowaway on board the SS Lazarus where a group of graduates are taking a celebratory trip from Crystal Lake to New York. There's plenty of chasing down corridors and bashing down doors as Jason begins his slaughter but this offers few shocks and scares with below par make-up effects, especially the Jason reveal at the end and the young Jason seen as an hallucinatory vision throughout.Having Jason run amok in a highly populated city could have been a rich source of ideas for the franchise instead of being confined to Camp Crystal Lake but Paramount clearly didn't see the benefit and treated the franchise with their usual disdain.I wonder if New Line Cinema could do any better?",

When Jason finally arrives in New York,the last 30 minutes show him chasing the survivors of the boat around the city. This movie is a downgrade in all the ways. The VFX is worse than all the previous movies,Jason is more friendly for some reason,the kills are not as good as the previous movies,the characters are boring. The ending makes no sense,jason is destroyed by toxic water,but becomes a child again for some reason,or maybe that was just his spirit,i don't know.

            "content": "This one sinks Lower than the last sequel did and this time we send Jason over to Manhattan and half the time there on the boat, really disappointing (this is where i started to lose hope in the series) anyway here's the plot Jim and Suzy drift peacefully through Crystal Lake on his houseboat - at least until its anchor snags an underwater power cable and drags it to the submerged body of Jason Voorhees! As Jim and Suzy make love, Jason boards the boat and kills the two teenagers.The graduating class of Lakeview High boards the SS Lazarus, bound for New York City. Boarding the ship with her teacher Miss Van Deusen, Rennie Wickham is accosted by her uncle (and trip chaperon) Charles McCulloch. Despite his obvious displeasure at her attendance, she boards and meets up with her boyfriend Sean Robertson. Sean also has problems with his father, Admiral Robertson, the captain of the Lazarus. But their personal problems are about to become secondary to one big problem - Jim's boat drifts by and the Lazarus picks up an unwelcome stowaway...Soon JJ is killed by Jason when she goes below decks to jam on her guitar. Rennie is assailed by visions of a young Jason, and her dog Toby runs off. Elsewhere, Julius pummels a hapless opponent in a boxing match. Above, Tamara and Eva watch the match, and then head off (at Tamara's request) to do some cocaine. They are interrupted first by Rennie, then by her uncle. Jason kills Julius' opponent in the sauna while Tamara, afraid of being ratted out by Rennie, knocks her overboard. Rennie can't swim, and is first hit with visions of a young Jason as she flails in the water, and then again in the restroom after being rescued by Sean.After Tamara gets Wayne to tape McCulloch in a compromising position with her, she is stabbed with glass shards by Jason. A storm breaks out, and Jason makes his way to the bridge to kill the first mate and the Admiral. Sean and Rennie, going to radio the Coast Guard to get off the ship, find the bodies and call everyone to the bridge. Jason cuts the radio, and everyone splits up to find the killer. Eva finds Tamara's body, is chased into the dance room and killed. Below decks, Wayne loses his glasses and accidentally shoots a crew member before being thrown into an electrical panel by Jason.A fire breaks out below as Sean tries to get the ship back on course. Miles is killed by Jason and Julius is thrown overboard. Rennie has another vision and then is attacked by the real Jason, who she stabs in the eye. Below, the fire causes the fuel tanks to explode and most of the kids on board are killed. The crazy deck hand is axed in the back by Jason and only Rennie, Sean, Miss Van Deusen, Rennie's dog and McCulloch make it to the lifeboat. In the water, Julius climbs aboard.Julius and Sean row from the sinking Lazarus to New York. Once there, the group is accosted by two thugs who take Rennie away and inject her with a filthy syringe. The others split up to look for help, and Jason kills the two thugs. Rennie escapes but Julius runs into Jason. After a valiant fight, Jason literally knocks Julius' block off, sending his head flying. The others find each one another, along with an cop who lets them into his cruiser. On the dash sits Julius' head, and the cop is dragged away by Jason. Rennie takes the wheel and slams the car into Jason. But when she tries to run down a vision of the young Jason, she rams into a wall. The car explodes, and Miss Van Deusen is killed.The trauma forces Rennie to remember her childhood, when her uncle took her out on Crystal Lake. He pushed her overboard to teach her how to swim, and she had a vision of Jason then. Sean and Rennie run off, leaving McCulloch to be killed by Jason. They are chased by Jason through the subway and Times Square - can Rennie and Sean stop Jason from taking Manhattan?I only recommend this to the DIE HARD fans only (as with part 5 and part 7 i only ever watch this if i watch the whole series in one go).",

            "review_title": "High school drama on a boat.",
            "content": "In part 6 of the famous franchise, Jason, who was previously put (back) to rest at the bottom of Crystal Lake by Tommy Jarvis, is resurrected (again) by an even sillier method than the time before. It makes the underwater cable business in Shark Attack 3: Megalodon look like Oscar-worthy screenwriting by comparison. The perpetrators of this fiasco are two teenagers who tell the audience about the plot's setup while trying to get frisky with each other. They are rudely interrupted in a predictable manner and proceed to make the sort of terrible decisions expected by now in this franchise. If only the rest of the movie had been as over-the-top silly as the opener, it would have been a 'so bad it's great' kind of movie. Instead, we get the rest of the high school seniors the victims from the first scene went to school with, who are being escorted on a cruise to Manhattan, New York. Canonically this series takes place in New Jersey, so presumably they're either cruising the Delaware River to Cape May or they're driving to meet the boat at the shore, but we never see anything to truly confirm either scenario. Once the kids weigh anchor, the only times we get a glance at the boat's surroundings the ship is already at sea. They're a very small high school class, probably due to a combo of being from a smallish town and having Jason haunting their woods. I'm all for character building, but this movie spends way too much of its runtime deeply invested in the soap opera antics happening between these kids. The final girl, Rennie, seems like a cross between Chris in Part 3 and Alice from the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. The attempt to merge these two characters is not quite successful and it's hard to connect with her. There's also a mean girl, an undefeated jock, a wholesome boy trying to live up to his father's reputation (a staple of slasher horror and usually the hero, as is the case here), a valedictorian who, in an interesting twist, is also the mean girl's bestie and trying to keep up with her rule flouting without getting into trouble herself; an A/V nerd, a heavy metal girl, and some randos. A problem with pre-meta but post-boom slashers is that the final girl started to get really boring. Due to the era I suspect Focus on the Family interference was at play in the attempts to make the Final Girl more palatable to their ideas of femininity. There are some post-meta slashers out there trying to revive the classic formula that suffer from the same problem. In this movie, either Eva or J.J. would have been much more interesting characters to follow than Rennie, and might have even been the heroine at an earlier point in the franchise. But if that was all that was wrong with the movie it would rate at least a six, and that's really not all that's wrong with the movie. You've got a potentially very tense situation in the notion of having a bunch of people trapped in a confined space with a killer who has nothing to lose. Other movies have mined this story for maximum tension. Alien comes to mind. Those movies worked because the survivors teamed together and were still up against something so terrifying they had to improvise. The audience roots for them. In this movie, the characters just start getting picked off one by one. By the time they figure out they're trapped on a boat with a killer... they freak out, separate, and get picked off one by one. It's hard for the audience to get attached to any of these people. Eventually the survivors wind up in Manhattan for the final act (really late in the film to finally introduce the titular location) and then they freak out and get separated again. And get picked off one by one, along with some locals that the audience just barely met. I will say there are some good Times Square location shots, but overall the movie is not one of the best in the franchise, or in any horror franchise, though it's surely not the worst either. It's worth an initial watch for that opener though, which has to be among the funniest ones I've seen.",

One aspect of this film that keeps it true to the Jason formula is that is retains the functions of most of the films - Jason going around killing a bunch of teens. The difference is however that it isn't set a Camp Crystal Lake, but aboard a cruise ship and for a short while Manhattan (yes, despite it being called \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" there isn't a lot of screen time in New York). The usual rules of Jason are broken in parts 5 and 9 most notably.Heralded Jason performer Kane Hodder returns for his second voyage (excuse the pun), and does his job well. Interestingly, like part 7, this entry also has a demanding male authority figure in that of Charles McCulloch, played well by Peter Mark Richman, and a kind yet uncommanding female authority figure in teacher Collen van Deusen, played by the lovely Barbara Bingham. The heroine and hero in this film are pretty good, particularly hottie Scott Reeves as hero Sean. Jensen Daggett plays heroine Rennie, and while she is not as bad as certain heroines, there have been more interesting ones. Also look out for a pre-fame Kelly Hu as Eva, one of the more interesting teens. Aside from the ill-fated two who accidentally resurrect Jason at the start of the film, the rest of the teens are utterly forgettable.A reason this film doesn't work so well would be the connection Rennie has to Jason, that she saw him drowning when she was just a child. But this is of course illogical, as it would make her over 50 years old. Part 8 even has a crazy deckhand, who takes the role of Crazy Ralph from parts 1 and 2. At times, it is very painful to watch the early 90's outfits and hairstyles, particularly Rennies was awful. There is also a lot of drug use in the film which makes it seem more 80's like (despite the clothing and hairstyles). Like some of the earlier films, there is also a dog in this one too, a rather nice one at that.At times it feels like you are watching a music video especially the opening/closing song (which is quite good), but at other moments in the film as well. This was also the last film by Paramount Studios, which may be why the ending in which Jason is reduced to a child after being covered in toxic waste is ignored for film number 9. I should also point out that there is a lot less sex and nudity in this film than the previous and future. I would seriously advise that if you wanted to watch a \"Friday the 13th\" film for the first time, you avoid this and check out parts 1, 2 or 7.",

            "content": "Being eight films into a monotonous franchise, taking things in an new direction seems inevitable. Taking Jason to New York City sounds like an awesome idea on paper, and why wouldn't it? Jason is the largest city in the country! Imagine Jason hacking up people in the subways, Jason throwing people off of valiant skyscrapers, Jason eerily stalking in dark foggy alleyways, Jason taking on the entire NYPD! Or, we could watch a movie that spends over an hour of its runtime on cruise ship. Indeed, it's well known that this entry somewhat lies to its audience, as it doesn't arrive to NYC until the 3rd act of the movie. It's been well documented that this was due to heavy-fisted budget restraints that gutted the original script of potentially awesome sequences and instead stranded it on a boat. Literally. This entire movie takes place on a boring boat with a boring cast. The disappointment of Jason not really \"taking Manhattan\" is only one of several horrendous elements this movie holds.Above anything else, the characters are terrible. This film possesses easily the most banal, cliche, forgettable, and unlikable band of teenagers and human characters of the entire Jason franchise. Hard to believe, isn't it? None of the human protagonists are fun, interesting, or well written. They're almost like a compilation of the worst characters from every Jason movie. Their ages are also completely confusing, as the film states they are fresh-from-the-robes high school graduates, but people are constantly talking about needing to finish biology projects and getting suspension. Do the writers think that college freshman still have to do high school summer projects? The one almost likable character is the principle/professor whatever he is, but he's still the cliche snobby old cremudgion professor character in every bad comedy and the film, for some reason, tries to paint him as an antagonist. So we aren't supposed to like the one character who is almost likable?Beyond the terrible cast of teens, the film is simply tired and lifeless. Setting the entire film on the boat was a terrible idea. I get the budget was small, but why not set it in an apartment? Or set it in the sewers or subways? There are plenty of ways this movie could've gotten around the crippling budget cuts besides what it ended up doing. The cruise ship scenario is incredibly boring to the point where it's practically offensive to its audience.It seems that many times throughout the film, the writers just completely forget that Jason is even in the movie, and the protagonists just kind of chill and do their thing for several long and tedious minutes. This movie is a drag to sit through, going even slower than the boat featured in the movie. With all things considered, I think that Friday the 13th part eight: Jason takes Manhattan is the worst of the entire Friday the 13th franchise. Even without the massive false advertising that the title promises, the characters featured in this film are the woartnof the whole series and the plot is incredibly boring. Things do slightly pick up once the movie takes Manhattan, but by this point, it's far too gone and far too late. Things do slightly pick up once the movie takes Manhattan, but by this point, it's far too gone and far too late. Even Jason X is a better movie because at least that film is fun and highly entertaining, though in a bad way, and at least that movie takes place in space!

Firstly the name is completely misleading, first hour we spend the time with Jason on a crappy boat and rest of the time in Manhattan's sewers. I expected this movie would be about Jason on Manhattan killing and chasing people but no, its about Jason on a holiday cruise, highly censored (and I'm not talking about MPAA cuts but showing style of killings in movie) so we don't even see most of killings.

I don't think this is Friday the 13th about all, its just a stupid and lame sequel. And I don't understand where they put 5 million in this movie (its highest budget on this series) there's nothing special in it, not in decoration, actors or anything.",

Apparently, the public wasn't going to watch Jason killing people on the lake again, so the writers thought something along the lines of \"Hey, why don't we put Jason in the city?\" \"Pfffttt... what if he was seen killing someone?\" \"What would they do about it, arrest him?\". So Friday the 13th; #VIII was born! This movie also has good flashbacks, they bring you up to speed if you havent seen all 7 previous Jason movies and establish a supernatural presence at once. This Jason also has the regular Jason/Michael Myers basic elements, taking shots from a wide variety of firearms, explosions, rudimentary teleportation, stabbings, drownings and futile pleas for mercy. However F13#8 has endearing qualities unlike any of the other Jason films, the almost funny scene when he stands next to the billboard with his exact likeness and when he disses the street gang and scares the hell out of them instead of killing them, showing that he takes priority over those who step near his lake. This is one of the best Jason movies as of late, but the upcoming battle between Jason and Freddy Kruger is sure to bring some closure to both longwinding series.",

Everything is wrong with this movie, even the freaking title. Jason does not take Manhattan in this movie. All he really does is chase two people the entire time he's in New York. Anyway, that's the least of this movies' problems. Wanna know how Jason comes back in this movie? It's the most ludicrous one yet! He comes back by being electrocuted by a random electric pipeline on the bottom of the lake and the only reason that pipe shocked him was because some random people on a random boat just happened to drop the anchor in exactly the right place to cut the pipe. I'm not making this up, though I wish I was. Next we have Jason killing people on a cruise boat. I don't know why he decided to get on a cruise boat (probably because the script called for it), but that's not the main issue. Jason is literally never seen, despite the fact that it's a fairly small ship and despite the fact that he killed like four people. HOW DID NO ONE SEE HIM!? It kills me to even try and think about it! Okay next we have bad acting blah, blah blah, the standard Jason won't die, blah, blah, blah, and of course the idiots being idiots.

But I always think Friday the 13th films are quite dumb, they do what we expect, so what's wrong with that, right?The problem with this particular Jason Takes Manhattan movie, is because the movie has too many errors to begin with. The fact that it is impossible for a boat to come from Crystal Lake to sea (and Jason must have to drive the boat at some time) is already a huge mistake. And the most horrible thing, it's just the beginning! The ship voyage (which covers the most scenes in this movie, and that's not Manhattan pal) full of meaningless off-the-screen boring kills.I love Jason because he's an indestructible-creative killing machine. However, I really hate his omnipotence to smooth over any plot. Why do you need to make him survive hours underwater? Why do you need him to walk among publics in New York? Beside the assumed self-parody (which I don't know if this tongue-in-cheek style is what they aimed), there's nothing remotely interesting in this movie.And don't let me start about the acting, they are terrible with bad script like how you imagine soap operas think of horror film. The grumpy guardian of the female main character is just nagging all the time without any development at all. I know I shouldn't hope much, but ... the stupidity here is just beyond my comprehension. And it's not funny! So I just watch the longest Friday the 13th film and complain every minute.I watch this movie because Netflix has it, so I just wasting my time here.

The murders are the tamest yet, and the characters don't seem to belong in this movie. They all seem like they should be on a soap-opera. None are likable. Not one. Each film before this had a couple characters you could enjoy before they got hacked.I know things had to change for this sequel because Paramount wasn't making their money with the last few films, but still, the result here is a bloodless, characterless, sequel that bears no resemblance to the previous films.

As a horror movie, it sank quicker than the Titanic, because a lot of things just don't hold water for Jason fans.  To begin with, Jason leaves Crystal Lake.  WHY? The whole point of the series is that he kills anyone in his territory at the lake, because of the wrongs against him and his mom.  If he leaves his territory, what right does he have to kill on New Yorkers' territory, hmm?Plus Jason is on a boat with teens, whom he is stalking.  Does this sound like the antithesis of Die Hard, or even remotely like Under Siege to anyone?  Hey if Segal and Willis can do it, why not Jason?The make up job on Jason stinks as well.  When do eyes migrate?  Any Friday fan will tell you that Tommy Jarvis hit Jason on the left side of his head with a machete, resulting in the loss of Jason's LEFT eye.  In parts six and seven, the continuity showed us that Jason has one working eye, and it's the RIGHT one,  BUT in part eight, it shows the scar left by the machete that took his left eye, but when h pulls off his mask, we find that he still HAS the left eye, and his RIGHT one is gone.  \"The Mystery of the Moving Eye\"I could go on and on about how bad this film is as a horror, but I must say that as a comedy, it's funnier than most things on the shelves!  Which, I might add, is the one redeeming feature.

The teens that had the greatest potential to be well developed characters, get killed early on, and this film quickly turns into a huge time waster.\nOh yeah, 90% of the movie takes place on the ship, only the last 15 minutes take place in Manhattan. There are two funny scenes to watch for where Jason sees an image of himself on a billboard, and when he politely asks some punks to turn their radio down.

In fact,not only are the cast on a vacation but Jason seems to be as well, as he hardly needs to break a sweat in order to dispose of them and you can't really blame him-after seven installments,he deserved a break!). Anyway, this movie is all about Jason. He proves that he was the hero all along. I also like the way this one was shot.

Then, the same-old, same-old begins with Jason slicing and dicing his way through New York, looking for the survivors until only two remain, one with a back-story involving Jason and her uncle in her youth, at the infamous site of Camp Crystal Lake...The unique part of this film is that it's, for once, not in Crystal Lake, and that you become very close to about three of the characters.

Is it the concept of taking Jason out of Crystal Lake in the first place? Is it the moronic(yet entertaining) ways he kills people such as the girl with the guitar? Is it a zombie walking around New York and nobody seems to notice? Is it the logic of New York having toxic waste in it's sewers? The plot holes are so mind boggling one has to fall off the couch laughing. It's almost amazing that Paramount gave money for this script. I put this with A View to a Kill in the \"Where they trying to mutilate a movie franchise or did the studio really think people would enjoy this?\" catagory of 80's films. Of course not being a huge horror fan I can look at this movie and laugh my butt off.

However, I give the film props for changing scenery and finally getting Jason out of Crystal Lake. But if they really intended to have Jason run loose in the Big Apple, they should have made that the dominant plot point. As almost every review every written for this film will tell you, the movie should have taken place in New York more. Instead we get an hour of predictable blood sheds on a cruise (which also foolishly suggests Camp Crystal Lake is connected to the ocean) before the cast finally gets to New York in the final half hour. Cast is pretty bland outside of a hilariously high strung performance by Peter Mark Richman, and Kane Hodder who once again proves he's the scariest Jason. Also the first 'Friday' film to have comedy override the suspense. Some bad special effects such for lame kills and the worst Jason face in the series combined with poor acting and film decisions makes this installment edge out part five as the worst in the series to date. Although on the plus side I did appreciate the humor in portraying New York as a dirty, graffiti ridden city. Poor ending featuring an unexplained transformation of Jason to his former child self.",

Big mistake on his behalf since he electrocutes Jason back to life (how much more cheese would you like on that pizza?). So Jason kills those two for just plain stupidity on their behalf. He then takes the boat (which is supposed to be in a lake, but we later find out that it is on an ocean or something much much much much bigger than a lake) and plows it into another oceanliner and starts making hell on that ship. One by one that kids die on their senior vacation to the Big Apple. A few students, the teacher and the principle make it off the boat into a lifeboat (which shouldn't be lowered if the boat is still moving and since they didn't stop the engines, that would have caused the lifeboat to be sucked underneath the ship). The somehow pull off making it to New York City where Jason, being the Olympic swimmer he is, meets them there. Now comes my favoriate part of the movie with the hockey mask sign. Tell me that wasn't the funniest part of the movie? It was great. Anyways, as they kids and the adults are trying to find the police, they run into the druggys, which eventually get killed, and finally run into one another and a cop. The cop, which only lasts a couple seconds before being killed as well, was useless. They start taking off down the sewer system which gets flooded by toxic waste every night at midnight (there goes our oceans). What luck these kids have!!! Jason gets 'killed' and transformed into a little kid again by this magic toxic slug. Terrible terrible terrible.I didn't understand how Jason picked up his teleportation thing. I was only under the awareness that Freddy could do such a thing. Lets leave Freddy doing his nightmare thing and Jason can just walk really slow, and yet still meet up with the person where ever he/she runs to huh? I didn't enjoy this movie at all I will tell you that much, and Jason Goes To Hell wasn't anything to look forward to either.2.5 out of 10",

Now I know he enjoyed making this so at least he had a good time, but it just has far too many plot holes to suspend disbelief for me as a viewer to have a good time. What I end up doing, especially on this last re-watch, is counting all the ways the story doesn't make sense. Some examples below:Once resurrected, why doesn't Jason just go to shore and resume stalking Camp Crystal Lake? Why wait until morning and then hop aboard a boat?Why does Jason, who has super human powers, at times not use them at all? And why does he avoid killing so many people when he has the chance? Especially the main girl when the gang member was on top of her?Why, if he can teleport, does he choose to get knocked down or hit by cars when he could just disappear and reappear somewhere else?? The teleporting is the worst aspect of this film as it makes every scene laughable, especially when he throws the dad out of the top window.Why didn't Jason just kill them on the row boat instead of letting them even reach NY?And where the heck did everyone go who was on the boat in the beginning??These are the notable ones but there are so many things that can be picked apart easily and it's not that I'm looking for them but they hit you over the head while watching. It doesn't help that the kills are a tad weak, gore wise, and you have to wait forever until he gets to New York.While I think it's watchable in terms of being new to the series and wanting to see Jason in NY, it doesn't hold up well for horror fans re watching the series. I could easily see myself skipping this entry next time along with 7 and keeping the OG series from 1-6.Now onto Final Friday...",

I was just a kid when they first came out and I can remember them being a big deal and everything. I liked to watch them back then as I do now. The Friday the 13th movies are alot of fun if you don't take them too seriously. They were never meant to be masterpieces of cinema...but movies to see with your friends and laugh and scream at. This movie is no exception. It's actually not that bad...the girls are hot, the killing scenes are grisly (the most nasty one involves Jason stabbing a girl with a piece of a broken mirror ouch!), and the film has it's own share of humorous one liners like most Friday the 13th films have. Since it was made in 1989, it has that retro 80's look. Once the 80's were over, it was the end of an era and the Friday the 13th movies were part of that. So basically, it's an average Friday the 13th film. It's an okay film, but one thing is for sure, this movie is a hell of alot better than Jason X.",

A grittier, dirtier Manhattan, but one that is also much more fun. The entire cruise ship sequence should have been skipped entirely in favour of Jason just going to Manhattan.

Well, the main reason is taking away Jason from Crystal Lake in the first place. But the title is misleading as well. The story mostly takes place on a boat. And Jason doesn't really go into New York. The urban scenes are set I believe in Toronto. The images of Times Square are mostly stock footage. Further, this is the movie where Jason somehow teleports to his victims. I swear, there is one scene where the victim is thirty feet away from Jason, but the very next scene he's grabbing the dude's leg. It's stupid. It doesn't make sense. And yeah, I realize this is part eight, but that's just lazy direction on the part of the director.I guess the only bright spots are some of the kills. But even the ending was terrible. Jason somehow turns back into a young boy? What?By now, the slasher genre was just about dead, and with it, the box office gross wasn't that great for this movie.

In this movie alone he survives being shot 5 times, being stabbed in the eye with a pen, being hit with a car(!), being electrocuted and being punched repeatedly in the face and body.2- For a boxer, Julius has remarkably low stamina. He should have been able to go on for a least a little longer with Jason. Maybe he was tired3- Nobody seems to notice Jason (or care) as he walks through\na) a (somewhat) crowded subway trainb) Times Square How could you not notice a very slimy, probably quite smelly, creepy looking guy with a hockey mask.4- Has Jason suddenly become Darth Vaders long lost cousin? His breathing throughout the movie seems to indicate this.With the above comments aside I found this to be a most entertaining and watchable movie with some hidden humour. The body count may be low and the gore, nudity and sex somewhat minimal, but its fun neverthless. Especially memorable is the scene were Jason goes one on one with Julius, the boxer and literally knocks his block off. A most fun way to spend and evening. Also keep an eye out for future \"Scorpion King\" starlet Kelly Hu as the ill-fated Eve Watanabe. I give this a c+ (7/10)",

            "content": "In the dumbest entry in the whole series, Jason dauntlessly returns once again revived by a open power-line under the waters of Crystal Lake where his body lies (I thought he was blown to smithereens in Part VII), his first victims are two grad students aboard a yacht.Ironically, they are due to board a ship to Manhattan with other grad students including the Captain's son Sean, their professor Charles, and his niece Rennie.There is a bunch of non-descriptive deserved Jason fodder such as the slutty prom queen Tamara, JJ the guitar player, Wayne the film-maker wannabe, Eva the science major, Rennie's teacher Colleen, Julius the boxer, and a crazy deckhand that rants ominous warnings that the voyage is doomed and that Jason is back. With that kind of foresight this deckhand could have had a better career on stage and late night talk shows. Also before launching off they are warned of a coming storm coming their way soon.In this episode Jason is not happy with slaying his usual Crystal Lake residents but migrates down river and boards ship by scaling up the anchor.Doesn't take long before Jason trims down his cast mates, in a contrived twist of events Rennie conveniently is psychically linked to the young boy Jason Voorhees begins suffering visions of the boy drowning or pleading for his life.When Sean's father the captain of the vessel is discovered dead, the students begin to buy into this Jason crap but the professor Charles suspects it's that crazy loony deckhand (honestly I would have made the same deduction but oh well). Everybody arms themselves and choose to divide and conquer hunting Jason down to kill him before he kills them never mind he is a walking zombie corpse.This choices only seems to hurt their chances of survival and during the course of this action more bodies pile up and Jason even succeeds in destroying the engines. Soon the ship is taking water and the survivors board a life boat and escape.Luck is on their side, they dock at a New York harbor, begin discussing their next set of actions when they held up by some lowlife crooks who abduct Rennie. The gang flees the scene to find help and meanwhile Jason emerges out of the bay onto the dock (either he is an incredible fast swimmer with an on-board GPS device or he teleported?).In his pursuit of the gang, he does something heroic for once and kills the pair of crooks that were going to rape Rennie.Once again our intrepid gang decides to divide their efforts to find the cops.In this movie New York is about seven city blocks large because everyone has no difficulty finding each other through the labyrinthine alleys and streets of New York neither does the instantaneous teleporting Jason. Yet they can't find a single damn cop anywhere. And Jason has to be the stupidest one of all, he can kill the whole city of New York but chooses to chase our gang of grad students and teachers (maybe it's his on-board GPS device?).With the students dwindling, Rennie has sudden recollections of her uncle Charles cruelly using Crystal Lake and the tale of Jason as a motivational tool to help Rennie learn to swim as he is one of those stern figures that encourages success and achieving important goals. Rennie believes she seen Jason while she was drowning under the watchful eye of Charles and that the boy had tried to pull her under. Here is our link! Eventually it's just Sean and Rennie with Jason close behind in pursuit after a couple of near misses and dead ends they find themselves in the sewer with 10 minutes left before its flooded with toxic waste. The end is predictable.I have rated F13 Parts VI-VIII incredibly low I find nothing respectable about these films, they are strictly catering to the popularity of Jason Voorhees and these films were for the fanbois to set their panties in a hanker.1/10",

For one thing, a boat is much larger than a plane, and often larger than a train.  You also have multiple paralell means of travel within the boat, so you don't have to spend half your time trying to come up with silly, novel ways for characters to get from one part of the conveyance to another.This movie doesn't make much use of those advantages, however.  Instead, it seems to take place in 3 or 4 spots on the boat, only briefly visiting any of the rest.  When you consider that the ship offers literally hundreds of places for teens to run screaming, Jason to stand menacingly, and general mayhem to take place, it seems absurd that all the characters involved would spend so much of their time concentrated in such a small region.You'd also sort of think, given the title, that Manhattan would play a more prominent role in the film.On the whole, it's just a mediocre film.

            "content": "This is a great entry into this series, and thankfully it came along after dreadful part 5 and even more lousy part 6, and the mediocre part 7.\nWhat made this one great is that it actually delivered some REAL laughs instead of the laughter one usually gets from the lousy scripts and terrible acting. The scene where he removes his mask to scare off some gang is great, and when the kids burst into a diner and shout, \"Some guy out there is trying to kill us!\", a waitress looks at them without blinking and says, \"Welcome to New York.\"My only gripe is that the actualy scenes in NY take place in the last 15-20 minutes of the movie. The first 1/2 hour takes place on a boat and then in between that, it takes place in 'New York' but it is obvious that it is being filmed on sound stages. They could have done more in Manhattan and that would have made things a little better.Overall a good movie. Not as high a body count as the other movies, but this one goes a little lighter and it was fun to see.",

            "content": "I Love Jason, and i don't like to say it but, this film wasn't to my liking. Jason showed himself 90% before killing, which made it 0% shocking. Jason was not spooky, he reminded me of a normal killer instead of the Avenging zombie he really is. there was not really any moments where you got a \"pow\" inside, there was so many places where a shock (whatever its called) could have been horrific but not there, it was like following an agent sent by some corporation, killing people. ****************************SPOILER (or maybe not, very small)********** His Head / mask beneath hockey mask was Low budget, like many things in the movie +++++++++++++++++++++++++++SPOILER END************************************************************PLUSS (GOOD) ****************************** +Uhm... yea people getting killed for those who love that :p +Makes it kinda less spooky, but some like it: you follow Jason more than the teenagers. + Some Creative kills Cant really find anymore :( ***************************MINUS (BAD) ******************************** -I know this is an old movie, but still much low budgeted effects. - Not really spooky, some action and they could have called it an action movie instead. - Much \"didn't care scenes\" Since when was Jason (kid)a Bald kid and an Adult Asian at the same time? and Jason should be afraid of water. - What was part of making Friday the 13th famous, the horrific scenes where you could keep a little \"Wow / eww\" at the screen for 4-6 sec.s, where not properly used in this film",

            "content": "What the hell is this?!? Who directed this? I dont even wanna know.People say that hardcore fans of Friday the 13th movies dont like this movie because it has a change of venue (a boat and about 8 minutes in Manhattan,pay no attention to the title of the movie) But i beg to differ, now i am a hardcore fan of the Friday movies and of course Camp Crystal Lake will alway be the best! But it isnt the change of venue that kills this film, most people dont care where its shot as long as they get to see Jason hacking up some teenagers, but what is there to say when you dont even get to see that?!? Now the version i saw was the DVD release from paramount, and believe me, they`ve done more slashing than Jason ever has. Theres not any gore in this movie, not thats worth mentioning anyway, and the death scenes are hacked to pieces. It`s probably not that hard to get a hold of an uncut version of this film and if you do please watch it! But do not, NOT! Waste your money on the dvd, just rent this movie or buy it uncut if you can. This movie probably has the worst and most stupid \"old guy that tells everybody that theyre gonna die\" actor i`ve ever seen in a horror movie and that says a whole lot ;) And what the hell is with the morphing?!? Has Jason entered a secret pact with the star trek enterprise or something? One second he`s right in front of you the next second he`s 20 feet above you! So, this movie is ok renting if you love Friday the 13th movies and if you can get a hold of the uncut version, but i`d rather blow my head off than watching the dvd release again.",

This is like a fricken Tootsie pop, \"the world may never know\"..... but I do, He did indeed spend almost the entire film on the cruise ship...now...if 10% percent of it was on the cruise ship and the other 90 in manhattan this would have been a better title. Other than that though the movie doesnt have too many flaws....ok, i lied it has many flaws but what do you expect? Its a friday the 13th flick?! but for the series I do have to say that I HATED the music it was awful and there needed to be more blood and whatever anybody else thinks but over all its not the worst but this one isnt cutting it in the series too much.** out of *****",
