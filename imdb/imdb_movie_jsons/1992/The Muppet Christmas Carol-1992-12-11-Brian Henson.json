            "content": "This is a masterpiece. Not because it follows Dickens' marvelous story to the letter, but because it uses the Muppets to take the story to a wonderfully creative level. Michael Caine is Scrooge and he plays him really well. He never flinches at the fact that his clerk is a frog, that Tiny Tim is also a frog, and so on. Jacob Marley is played by those two old guys who carry on a commentary on the Muppet Show. As Scrooges wades through the famous story, meeting the ghosts of past, present, and yet to come, we are starting to believe that what we see on the screen are real characters. There are some wonderful songs that move the plot nicely along. Of course, the Muppets are incredible jokester, punning and dropping one-liners at will. Of course, we have to accept that Scrooge was apprenticed by old Fozziwig at a rubber chicken factory. Make this an annual event at the holidays.",

Scrooge (Michael Caine), meanwhile, is not portrayed as some screaming maniac as he so often is in other versions. His transformation from cold-hearted tightwad to caring, generous person is done more subtly, too, than in other films. However, to be fair, sometimes the slapstick humor in here gets in the way of the touching story.The last part of the movie is a lot sentimental drama than Muppet comedy and I found that refreshing. Not much offensive in here, either, making this a good film for little ones as well as older, sentimental folks.",

            "content": "The two best Muppet movies after Jim Henson's death are this and Muppets Treasure Island. The worst, I think is Muppets Wizard of Oz. Muppets Christmas Carol is wonderful, and deserves the high rating. I also think the rating for Treasure Island is too low, as I loved that film too.The Muppets are truly funny here, especially Gonzo and Rizzo, who have the funniest lines. Kermit and Miss Piggy were at their most touching here. Scrooge's encounter with the Marley Brothers was the highlight of the film for me. The high point of the movie is the performance of Michael Caine,(like Tim Curry in Treasure Island) who was the best he was in recent years, and his singing was passable. Very convincing! I personally think this is the funniest post Jim Henson Muppet movie, and was my favourite Christmas memory as a kid, and managed to stay true to the spirit of Christmas, and was heartwarming with the character of Tiny Tim. The songs, also, weren't that bad at all, but in comparison to the ones in Treasure Isaland, one or two of them are a little hit-and-miss, but that's just me, and that is my only negative! The incidental music was beautiful though.All in all, a wonderfully entertaining film, that has enough to satisfy Muppet fans. 9/10. Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Brian Henson does his dad proud in this, the first Muppet feature filmed after Jim Henson's death.  All the things which have made the Muppets appealing--charm, humor, tenderness--are very much in evidence in this adaption of Charles Dickens' much-retold classic.Michael Caine fills the central role of Ebeneezer Scrooge admirably, throwing himself into the part with much energy and gusto.  Familiar Muppet faces take up several roles--Kermit and Miss Piggy as Bob and Mrs. Cratchit, Robin as Tiny Tim, elderly hecklers Statler and Waldorf as the Marley brothers (Dickens' character Jacob and original creation Robert)--with new Muppets designed for the roles of the three Christmas ghosts.  The result is a somewhat fanciful 19th-century London where humans, animals, talking vegetables, and various undefinable creatures live side-by-side.  In spite of potential complications the concept works very well, thanks to the spirited performances by both actors and Muppet handlers.Gonzo (adopting the persona of Dickens himself) and Rizzo the Rat narrate the story and add a healthy dose of humor to the proceedings.  But the film knows when to be serious--the climactic scene focusing on Christmas Yet to Come is as eerie and touching as it should be.  And ultimately, the resolution leaves one with the warm, peaceful joy synonomous with the season.  Definitely a movie which deserves a place among the family classics of the holidays.",

If you can get past the fact that most of the cast are muppets, this is actually a terrific version of A Christmas Carol.  Michael Caine makes a fine Scrooge, one of the best I've ever seen in fact.  I usually hate musicals, but all of the songs in this film are great (and the girl who plays Belle - this girl can SING!)  The comedy is mostly provided by Gonzo, narrating as Charles Dickens, and his sidekick Rizzo the Rat.  The humor is truly funny and appropriately placed (notice how a very good reason is created for Gonzo and Rizzo to exit during the serious Christmas Yet to Come portion .)  This is truly one of those movies \"for young and old alike\", though it will probably go over the heads of very young children.

            "content": "Over the years, there have been countless tellings and re-tellings of Charles Dickens' classic tale \"A Christmas Carol\". Who would ever have thought, then, that a version staring the Muppets would be the best one ever produced!Basically, this version is narrated (quite comically) by The Great Gonzo and his sidekick Rizzo the Rat. They follow the story of curmudgeon Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine) on Christmas Eve night, when he is visited by three spirits that show him the meaning of Christmas. Central to Scrooge's emotional journey is Bob Cratchit (Kermit the Frog) and family (Miss Piggy), whose simple, hard-working lives prove quite inspirational.The reason why this version of the story works so well is because not only does it provide the humor that one would expect from a Muppet performance, but it also brings the heavy emotional drama as well. You wouldn't think you could get teary-eyed over a Muppet, but that is exactly what happens. The comedy is on the fringes (mostly provided by Gonzo/Rizzo), while the story plays out about as expected.The performance of Caine (now known for so many other projects!) is also a visual treat, again one of the best \"Scrooge portrayals\" ever put to screen! Caine is just such a great acting that he knows all the right beats to hit.Overall, then, \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is a movie that will stand the test of time. Even if you don't particularly care for the Muppets in generally (this is, in all honesty, the only Muppet- based piece of media I have ever watched/owned in my entire life), the combination of comedy/emotion in this movie will boost it up near the top of your Xmas movie traditions.",

            "review_title": "The very best of all the Muppet Movies!",
            "content": "The Muppet Christmas Carol is my favourite of all the Muppet flicks. Jim Henson, of course, never lent his name to anything even remotely resembling 'bad', but nevertheless, there is a clear mark of sheer mastery and brilliance in this movie that is somehow less evident in most of the other muppet movies.In a way, I have to admit that I find this surprising. This was the first Muppet movie to be shot after Henson himself passed away; the voice of kermit, the most beloved and indeed inventive puppeteer ever to have lived was dead. Could Henson's magic touch ever be recreated? Did the Muppets have a future at all without their creator? The answer, of course we now know, is Yes they did.As is the secret to all truly great children's movies, The Muppet Christmas Carol does not pander to notions of anything being 'too scary'; nor does it shy away from the innate darkness of the material at hand. Dicken's tale is one that revolves almost uniformly around themes of corruption, poverty and death, and here it has most certainly not been diluted.\"There was the year we evicted the entire orphanage! I remember the little tykes all standing in the snowbank, with their little frostbitten teddy bears!\" hollers a ghostly apparition of Scrooge's dead business partner early in the film. We witness a heartbreaking lament from Scrooge's lover, who leaves him because he has become too money-hungry to love her. We watch as Bob Cratchett's family mourn the empty chair at their table where their beloved and selfless young son once sat. At the eleventh hour, scrooge even bends before his own tombstone and begs in tears of desperation to a grim reaper-like spirit to be allowed to live. So much for it being the season to be jolly.Where there is humour, it is frequently black, and where there is emotion, it is generally somewhat adult by todays standards. Of course, before you decide not to show this to your five year old son or daughter, you should consider that these dark themes by no means drag the film down; rather, they help to raise it up to become, just like the original story, a stirring and emotional story of triumph and redemption in the face of mortality. Whilst the script writers wisely keep the story pretty much identical to the original in all of it's major aspects, there is plenty mayhem and indeed magic here too which is 24 carat Henson Studios. I remember as a 5 year old simply adoring the spectacle of Kermit's Bob Cratchett taking part in a the Penguins of London Annual Christmas Skating party, or the delight of Gonzo and Rizzo's almost post-modernist presence as physical participants but also omnipotent narrators in the tale. Indeed, the translation from book to screen is almost peculiarly elegant; the Muppet characters all seem to open up to new ranges of poignancy and dramatic possibility when placed in the storyline. You will find yourself feeling immense pity for Miss Piggy's somewhat hysterical but ultimately warm Mrs Cratchett for example, and indeed a whole host of wonderful performances on show from the familiar Muppet Show Cast. Of course this review could not be complete without tribute to the simply brilliant performance from the great Michael Cane in the role of Ebeneezer Scrooge. he understands his role excellently and invests it with a moving, convincing and genius reality; always resisting the temptation, that must surely be strongly felt when one is the sole human among a cast of felt puppets, to play the role for laughs. One feels that his performance would not seem out of place if he were surrounded by the ranks of great British thespians and taking part in a 'straight' production of Dicken's tale as opposed to a Muppet movie. Upon recently viewing the Patrick Stewart film of this story, I was delighted to find that Cane quite simply out-acted Stewart in the role and clearly this makes his performance something special.The production values are high in this film as is to be expected in a Henson movie, and the film has a wonderful, almost Tim Burton-esquire look which is by turns wintry and quite breath-takingly beautiful or dark and positively scary. In terms of music it is filled with an array of wonderfully enduring and subtly written songs that fill me with a sense of child-like happiness and that allusive 'christmassey feeling' even after all these years. One recommendation I would make to anyone planning on purchasing the film is to if at all possible obtain a copy which contains the beautiful song \"When Love Is Gone\" which, in the recent DVD re-release, was sadly cut from the film. This decision to exclude the song from the film detracts hugely from the pathos of one of the film's central themes (past Mistakes and ultimate redemption) and definitely takes away some of the indescribably bitter-sweet overall mood of the film.I strongly recommend this film to people of any age or gender as a film that it is virtually impossible not to fall in love with.",

            "content": "While the 1951 Alistair Sim version of A Christmas Carol is the most faithful to the original Dickens story, A Muppet Christmas Carol possesses heart, whimsey, and a joy that is so very much lacking in our evermore commercialized holiday season.  Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge easily surpasses those of Reginald Owen (1938), George C. Scott (1984) and Patrick Stewart (2001).  There is a more genuine degree of transformation and redemption in his characterization than has often been portrayed. This makes the story a truly wonderful experience both for adults as well as for children.The use of the Muppets in the various roles makes for a lively film experience.  Statler and Waldorf as Jacob & Robert Marley are appropriately heckling as they seek to convince Scrooge to change his ways.  Kermit the Frog is a wonderfully sympathetic Bob Crachit just as Miss Piggy is appropriately and aggressively belligerent Mrs. Crachit.  Perhaps one of the better-inspired comedy bits comes with the arrival of Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past at Scrooge's former workplace, described as \"Fozziwig's Rubber Chicken Factory.\"  Such bits are frequent and help to keep the story fun.  Paul Williams' music score and songs are eminently singable and leave the viewer with a lasting memory.A Muppet Christmas Carol has joined the pantheon of classic holiday films, easily ranking alongside Holiday Inn, White Christmas and A Christmas Story. It is the opinion of this reviewer that for those whom holiday films have become a part of holiday celebration should make this a part of their seasonal experience.  One might even complete the film humming the tunes and thinking better of themselves as well as of their fellow humans.  In other words, Henson and company have made Dickens story as memorable as Dickens himself wished it to be.",

            "content": "That question pretty much sums up my reaction to \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\", a hilarious, yet touching film.What did I like about the movie?  Just about everything!  Michael Caine made a great Scrooge, and this film showed us, possibly better than just about any other version I've seen, just how Scrooge came to be such a miser (although that could partly be because the versions I saw which really go into Scrooge's childhood were clearly adult versions, which meant they could be more subtle in their explanations).  To Caine's eternal credit, he made Scrooge very believable, which is no small feat considering most of his fellow cast members were puppets.And what about the Muppets?  They were also brilliant!  Kermit made an excellent Bob Cratchit, loyal and humble, and he had a wonderful tribute to Tiny Tim which also served as a brilliant tribute to Jim Henson.  Miss Piggy was a great Mrs. Cratchit, feisty yet very loving toward Bob (the worst of her temper was thankfully muted by the story).  Fozzie the Bear was a hilarious Fozziwig, and The Great Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat made a great team, having some of the best lines out there (my favorite is Rizzo's \"Light the lamp, not the rat!  Light the lamp, not the rat!\").  The ghosts were definitely believable (and in the case of the two Marley Brothers, hilarious as well).  Incidentally, the original text had only one Marley -- Jacob, but to get the two comedians from the balcony in the story, Robert Marley was added.Finally, the songs were rather good, with the best one (in my humble opinion) being \"When Love is Gone\".So, I firmly recommend \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" to one and all.Belle Book",

            "content": "I resisted watching THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL for over two decades. Why? Because I don't like most versions of the Dickens film because it's been overdone so many times that the story has practically become a clich\u00e9. Heck, there have been 95 versions of A Christmas CAROL!!! And, among the many versions were even ones that starred Mr. Magoo and Scrooge McDuck! Talk about overdoing things!!! Some of these variations are quite clever--most are not and are just cheap ways to get past writing original material. My feeling about THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL is that if you must see one, this is better than most though not as good as, in my opinion, the best version which stars George C. Scott*.Now, despite all my Scrooge-like comments, I cannot fault the film too much since despite the familiarity of the story, it's actually one of the better Muppet films. I was particularly impressed by the sets. The scenes of rooftops of London and the forest were all created on the sound stage and must have taken a tremendous amount of time and effort--and they are beautiful. Additionally, some of the other sets are amazing--such as the Cratchit house. They are just lovely. Likewise, I just loved the puppets--especially the Ghost of Christmas present. The only negative were that there were perhaps a few songs too many. Otherwise, a lovely family film overall.*While it is a very, very, very different version, I strongly recommend you see BLACKADDER'S Christmas CAROL.

When Kermit the Frog sings the song \"One More Sleep 'Til Christmas\", we cuddle together and sing along, knowing that Santa's on his way and the next day is the most special day of the entire year. My parents told me that when this movie was released in the theaters, it didn't do well, but I can't seem to believe it. How can one of the most adorable versions of A Christmas Carol, one that remains one of our all-time favorites\u2014and we've seen every version known to man\u2014not be treasured by everyone in the world? Paul Williams wrote the memorable and lovely songs in the film, and when Miles Goodman's music flows during the opening credits, it instantly puts the audience in the mood for Christmas. The cast is announced, and as Kermit the Frog is listed as Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Emily Cratchit, and other well-known Muppets and human actors are credited, the best is saved for last. Michael Caine gets the \"and\" in the credits; he plays Ebenezer Scrooge. He's truly heartwarming in the film, playing the iconic role as a sensitive man. While other versions of the story portray Scrooge as unwaveringly mean until the memorable ending, Jerry Juhl's fantastic script shows Scrooge affected by the early scenes.The Great Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat speak to the camera in the opening scene, introducing themselves and the story. They're the continuous narrators of the film, and the running commentary is absolutely hilarious. Too many of the lines from Juhl's screenplay have become household phrases in my family for me to list, but there is one part that is worth mentioning. When the Ghost of Christmas Future appears, there is the usual ominous setting. Gonzo and Rizzo remark how spooky it is and tell the little kids in the audience that they're going to leave and come back when it's not scary anymore, which is not only a considerate warning but is kind to the kids who choose to hide their eyes so they don't feel embarrassed. When the Muppets reappear, they say, \"We're back! We promised we would be!\" Every time I used to come home and greet my kitty, I said that phrase.There's really too much perfection in this movie to keep my review short, but I'll try to keep it relatively brief. The sets and costumes are beautiful and look very authentic. The smaller roles\u2014Steven Mackintosh as Nephew Fred, Meredith Braun as Belle, and the incredibly cast Raymond Coulthard as Young Scrooge\u2014are lovely and put just as much of their hearts in their performances as the main leads do. And the songs, which I've already praised, somehow make the listeners' hearts lighter and spirits brighter. In \"It Feels Like Christmas\", the production number started by the Ghost of Christmas Present and continued by the ensemble, Michael Caine actually dances along as his Christmas spirit is rekindled. The back-and-forth rocking is forever known in my house as \"doing the Michael Caine\" and it's a dance move we love to imitate. Speaking of the Ghost of Christmas Present\u2014have you noticed that sometimes this jolly spirit isn't always nice in other film versions? In The Muppet Christmas Carol, he's incredibly sweet and caring.If it's at all possible you haven't seen this version, buy a copy. I guarantee it'll become a staple in your household during the Christmas season. Whether you watch it the first night you put up the tree or wait until there's only one more sleep 'til Christmas, it'll be one of your favorite parts of the most wonderful time of the year.",

This is a well done version of the story, and it is the only Muppet movie I can look at as a real movie, rather than a movie starring Muppets.The way the story is told in this movie is done really well. Having Gonzo play Charles Dickens as he narrates the story was a smart move. It adds more humour to the story. The different characters that Muppets pop up as are genius, for instance, changing Fuzzywig to Fozziewig so Fozzie Bear could play him. Also, the movie manages to remain dark like the story should be, while also staying tame for kids.Micahel Caine is great as Ebenezer Scrooge. He's actually one of the best Scrooge's I've seen.

Their goal is to show the progression of events in his life that led to his current sour outlook on the world, how it is for the other citizens in whom he has little interest (unless they owe him money), and the possible outcome should he continue on this path.Certainly there have been a number of noteworthy adaptations of this Dickens perennial throughout the decades, especially the 1951 film with Alastair Sim. But this can stand head and shoulders with many of them, mainly because of the appeal of the Muppet characters and their cheerful spin on the material, and the effectiveness of Caines' under-stated performance. The Great Gonzo plays Dickens, on hand to narrate the story, and he's accompanied by the hilarious Rizzo the Rat, whose misfortunes are frequent. Kermit the Frog is Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy is Emily Cratchit, Fozzie the Bear is \"Fozziwig\", Statler and Waldorf the Marley Brothers, etc. There's room for many of the old favourites, including this viewers' personal favourite, the Swedish Chef, who has a brief bit. One interesting twist is that the spirits of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come are NOT filled out by familiar Muppet characters.However, despite the ample amount of humour, the appeal of the story, and its tale of redemption, are still solidly punched across. Screenwriter Jerry Juhl keeps a fair amount of the poetry of Dickens' words intact, while also including some great moments for Muppets fans. And Paul Williams composed a variety of songs that are both catchy and poignant.Whether you love Dickens, Caine, or the Muppets, or all three, you're guaranteed to find this pretty charming.Eight out of 10.",

Reportedly, Quibi-Boy thought kids wouldn't stand for a song that was \"too sad\" and had it cut out, though why it stays out decades after his departure from the company baffles me (I mean, we've all evolved to the point where Inside Out works as practically a rebuke to his logic, but I digress).It's an extra shame because the time to just put it back in and not make a big deal of it is when it's in theaters again for a limited time and when only silly geese like myself who find the Muppets and Michael Caine in particular so darn special are trudging out to see it when I could as well pop it on my Disney+ thing and put up with the noisy ads neighbors (again, my patented digression). Point is, if you go thinking it'll be back, don't bother, and once again be jarred by the abrupt cut to a crying Rizzo to a thirty second scene and a *reprisal of the very song at the end of the film as a way of bringing the message of the song full circle that finding love is a really big deal* and so on.As for the rest of the film, it still mostly slaps because Henson and Juhl and company know how to balance the comedy and the rest of the pathos. The whole thing is tied together by Caine, who is my first Scrooge (in live action, no disrespect to the voice of McDuck), and still the one who gave the greatest and most deeply felt Scrooge I've still come across. The 1951 film may be superior overall, and watching this again the songs are hit or miss (the ones that work are lovely, but Williams's music is less memorable than the lyrics and I just don't see myself listening to these like I would his for the Muppet Movie, tall order but it's what it is for me).Caine gets it right, not just for playing it straight but for channeling the dark and miserly side with such dead poker-faced focus, and yet the warmth at the end feels completely earned and genuine. He... Makes this Scrooge likable to the extent that is possible, and especially the scene in the cemetery is as great as anything he ever did as an actor. And the movie around him doesn't go for anything at all topical in the humor and that helps to make its staying power solid (maybe there's one joke where Rizzo mentions New Jersey? That's about all, though), and that speaks to Henson and company's courage of their convictions.So... Third best Muppet movie? That's still a high as hell compliment. And yeah, Mr Dickens, I'll go read the book next.",

            "content": "The Muppet's Christmas Carol (1992) -Firstly I have to say that 'A Christmas Carol' is my favourite book, there was so much squeezed on to the pages of such a short story that it just made it a fantastic tale and one that is still very relevant today.What foresight Dickens had to focus on commercialism as a vice and love and kindness as the cure. And what a shame it is, that a lot of us, still pay no heed to the message, forging longer and longer chains each day.The Muppets captured the story very well here, they brought out all the humour that already existed and added to it. I firmly believe that if Charles were here today, this would be his favourite interpretation of his work.There were some things that weren't strictly in keeping with Britain in the 19th century, although I do believe that many businesses had a frog or two working as a clerk in their offices and Rabbits were renowned for Carolling at Christmas, but Penguins on the streets of London might have been stretching it a bit. However, if you have a sense of humour and can take a film at face value, you can't help but enjoy it, because this one really did make it easy to indulge yourself in a little bit of culture, without needing a dictionary to translate all the big words. It was as a story that will always be made again and again, but I don't think many will ever surpass this one.There were so many lovely touches thrown in, so many funny little things for children of all ages (1-150) to look out for and a magic feeling that could only come from this canny bunch of critters and all of the people behind the scenes who made it all possible.Although I thought that George C Scott was a great, more traditional version of the cantankerous old Ebenezer in the 1984 version, Michael Caine was perfect in this particular film opposite its varied and alternative cast. He couldn't sing and he his dancing was questionable, but he didn't care and actually I think that was how the real Scrooge would have reacted to ghosts who broke out in to song in the middle of the street. I would imagine Mr Micklewhite (Michael's real last name - Look for the shop names after him at the end) struggled to keep a straight face making this film and I bet he had the time of his life.And who could blame him? The thought and attention that went in to which muppet should be cast as what was obviously carefully done. The casting from the Henson universe was spot on, even if they had to add a second Marley (Robert or Bob to his friends), but who else could have played that part. I'm also glad that they didn't get too tricky and try to bring in too many new characters just for this film. Having said that, the 3 ghosts and in particular, The Ghost of Christmas Present, were superb. A couple of the humans were a bit dodgy though.When my Niece and Nephew were younger, we wore out our VHS copy of this film, watching it most Sunday's throughout the year, so I could probably recite the film to you word for word, I absolutely love it that much and I stand by it as the best interpretation of the original work out there today.The Muppets should come back with more like this, because, honestly I don't really get on with their other films, but this was comedy gold and a joy to watch. Let's see 'The Muppet's Romeo And Juliet' or 'The Muppets Miracle On 34th Street' please?954.91/1000.",

A lot of the irreverent humor of the Muppets gets toned down-notice how Gonzo and Rizzo are removed from the 3rd act entirely-to allow for the sentiment of the story to be present. At the same time the story isn't given the full pathos it deserves-I think Caine is a bit stiff as Scrooge as well-because Muppet gags in the background. This tension is never enough to ruin the film, or even really damage it, but it is annoying aspect of the film.This still ends up be quite enjoyable as a piece of entertainment; it is a wonderful introduction for young kids to both the Muppets and Dickens' tale. The song is singable to the point that I mostly sing along with it when I watch this each year.This is a heart warming film that does not quite stick the landing.",

The decision to take in Michael Caine's disciplined, down to earth doctrine in his approach to acting and toss it in with the lovably loopy, varied psychedelic muskrats we know as the muppets is a stroke off juxtaposed genius that make for quite the charming outing. Caine makes a slight Scrooge, relieving us by never being totally committed to the initial nastiness that hallmarks the character, and being especially upbeat when it comes time for the old codger to make his legendary mood swing and dive into the spirit of Christmas. I've only seen Caine in a single film where he played an outright son of a bitch, and it's downright jarring. He's such a pleasant fellow, and makes the perfect companion to the critters that populate the show. Highlights for me: the talking vegetable that audibly protests upon being poached from a local muppet market, and Caine's delightful original solo 'Thankful Heart.'",

            "content": "After certain people, that keep a business going, pass away, can be difficult to keep it moving because the person who left was main source of power and motivation. This usually leads to financial failure and an absence from the media. It could've been that way for The Muppets after Jim Henson passed away in 1990, but by that time, The Muppets were immortal as it was. Thankfully Henson's son, Brian Henson decided to take hold of the reigns and lead the way.And as of Mr. Henson's first theatrically released Muppet film, I must say, it is superb add-on to the franchise. The story of The Muppet Christmas Carol is exactly parallel to that of Charles Dickens' novel. The are no changes in the story, order wise, but there are a few little tidbits that will have the audience understand that this is a Muppet production and not just them retelling the story. For example, The Great Gonzo plays Charles Dickens in this film, the omniscient narrator of our story. And no he doesn't talk from out of the sky; he actively takes part in the story. And along side him is his pal Rizzo, who also provides us with some comedy relief.And that's just these two characters. You still have the rest of the Muppet crew. Because Jim Henson was no longer around, Steve Whitmire took over the role of Kermit the Frog, but unless you really have good ears, it's not easy to hear the difference, which is great. This is why these Muppet characters are immortal. As long as they have a voice actor who has a voice that closely matches their predecessor, no one will ever know. Playing Scrooge is English actor himself, Michael Caine. Caine gives an excellent performance as the grumpy old humbug moneylender. Caine is effective when he's tough and angry and when he's soft and emotional on screen.As for the rest of Muppets go, the usual voice actors perform their parts for their respective Muppets and they do a great job at it. Every Muppet you think that'll have a part will be in this film, no doubt. And it's great because you get to see every single one have a little screen time of their own. The special effects are good for their time; nothing looks overly edited or out of place. The score by Miles Goodman is a fun listening experience as well. In all aspects, it evokes the right tones and emotions all at the right moments. Some real good work here.This first theatrically released film starring The Muppets without Brian Henson's father on board is still just as great. Jim Henson may have left, but his spirit is still there.",

It has its goofy moments when it needs to, but I was surprised by how earnestly this movie treats the subject matter. It's really about the spirit of Christmas; the time of year when everyone is just a little nicer, people a little more generous, the cold snow a welcome sight instead of a dreadful one. This movie gets what makes Christmas such a magical time.It also opts for Scrooge's hatred of Christmas being based on philosophy and not some personal tragedy; he genuinely doesn't understand why it matters. Convincing him is not buying into this saccharine version of the holiday, but the realization that if you can't be kind at Christmas, when can you?What can be said of the music? It's wondrous. Really inventive, catchy, beautifully written songs that never feel out of place. Even when delivered by Muppets, they're mostly taken seriously.Speaking of Henson's iconic creations, they're used at just the right amount. They feel a part of the world and not necessarily front and centre. It's truly incredible how many puppets show up in this movie and how wonderful they are; all of their different bodily movements, facial expressions, and voices add to the world's richness and depth. They're also done so well I honestly forgot they were inanimate objects at the time. The visual effects and movement are just amazing.I also loved the decision for the spirits of Christmas to be wholly different, a little ethereal and strange, and NOT Muppets playing each one. I didn't even mention Michael Caine, who delivers a truly incredible performance here, and never once looks at the Muppets as if they're puppets held by people.I love this movie, you should too.

            "content": "Due to other commitments, myself and partner were having a later \"Christmas Day\" together on something like the 27th or 28th and I was putting some things together to make it feel as festive as possible. I had borrowed some compilation CD's of festive music as well as some DVD's of various Christmas films that could just be run on the TV in the background on mute. Making an assumption I put this film on mute only to be told that my partner had never seen it and, not having seen it myself for several years, we stopped it as background and decided to watch it at the end of a day of cheer, relaxing, feeding ducks in the park, presents, food and, of course, wine. So it was we came to watch the Muppet Christmas Carol, perhaps with low demands but still unwilling to put up with anything that wasn't good or that dragged the mood down.I needn't have worried because, although it is not a perfect film, Muppet Christmas Carol is a real joy that delivers on several levels. Most surprisingly the focus is on the telling of the story \u0096 this has its own modifications but it is surprisingly faithful to the story we all know and it is only really the use of the narrator that changes how it flows. This doesn't matter though because the film is surprisingly engaging \u0096 it doesn't just TELL the events, it draws us into the characters \u0096 or rather \"character\". I make this distinction because that the film does this is almost entirely down to a performance from Michael Caine that is brilliant apart from one or two minor missteps that are more down to the material than him. It is not just that he plays it deadly straight the whole time despite being surrounded by puppets and people below him working them, it is that he plays it so very well \u0096 this is a performance that is way beyond the standard expected for such a film. He holds so much emotion in his eyes and face that minor changes tell of a softening or hardening of his heart. It is in this area that the film engages and it is almost a shame that it is a seasonal kids film because his performance deserves more praise than it gets.In support of him, the film shores up with other aspects that you expect it to deliver in. In terms of laughs there are plenty but no massive killer or sequences that are built around a joke \u0096 it is key that he humour never gets in the way of the plot or compromises Caine's part of the film. I say \"part\" because, although the narration device has its detractors, I did like it as an easy way of framing the story but more for the fact that it allowed for little comic moments that exist as part of the film without putting jokes into the actual Christmas Carol story so much as in the packaging thereof. The songs are rarely magical but are serviceable at worst and good at best \u0096 Caine's singing is not great but his performance bought him a pass on that as far as I was concerned and credit to him for doing it himself. The various Muppet characters are all well received as on paper it is \"their\" film, even if reality it is very much Caine's.It seems weird to be praising a children's Christmas film because as a genre they are rarely the place to go for entertainment as they can be obvious, sentimental and not really much good outside of the season. However, thanks to the core work of Caine, this is a good film in its own right and the well-delivered humour and songs around this core only help and don't detract.",

What I mean by retelling is that it takes place in the 1800s, and it features your favorite Muppets like Kermit the Frog; Miss Piggy; Gonzo; etc. Michael Caine is really good as Scrooge, and I thought his singing voice was fine at the film's finale. The movie does provide some good laughs, but they are not laugh out loud hilarious. The sets are well done as well as Brian Henson's direction. The songs in the movie are fun, but don't have much to say about. The movie is really not my favorite Muppet movie or my favorite Christmas movie, but it is still fun to watch. If you are a fan of the Muppets, then you will love this movie. Overall, \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is a fun retelling of Charles Dickens' book and you will have a fun time watching this movie that really does have that Christmas joy, and seeing one of your favorite Muppets in this movie. Check it out! I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",

And it is my loss that is the case, as today I stumbled on a movie I wish I'd watched with my two kids when they were much younger than they are today. Plot In A Paragraph: In this adaptation of the Christmas story narrated by Charles Dickens himself (played by Gonzo the Great) , It is Christmas Eve in 19th century London. The merriment is not shared by Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine), a money-lender who is more interested in profit than celebration. He is so against it, that his staff, including loyal employee Bob Cratchit (Kermit the Frog), have to beg for Christmas Day off. Later that evening, Scrooge finds himself face to face with the still mean-spirited ghosts of his former business partners, Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf) who have been condemned to shackles in the afterlife as punishment for the horrible deeds they committed in life. They warn him that he will share the same fate, only worse, if he does not change his ways, and foretell the arrival of three spirits throughout the night.

Michael Caine turns in a perfect performance as Ebenezer Scrooge.  I cry with him when his girlfriend Belle leaves him. This is a very touching story with a light dusting of comedic relief. Though most of the characters are muppets, the story flows beautifully with a minimum of nonsense.  The one exception is the perhaps too silly visitation by Jacob and Robert Marley.

To be honest, I am not a fan of puppets - and these ones never worked for me on television when I was young. This film does, however, deliver well. A combination of very gentle comedy, a strong and emotional story and a star who was certainly up for joining in, all combine well to offer an engaging and colourful take on the story without descending into too much sentiment that ends, fittingly, outside the east London branch of Mickelwhite's. Paul Williams has composed some frequently poignant lyrics for the \"Scrooge\", \"Bless Us All\" and \"It Feels Like Christmas\" numbers and, mercifully, the more irritating \"Kermit\" and \"Miss Piggy\" characters actually feature quite sparingly as that huge turkey in the butcher in the next street gets ever closer to finding a generous buyer.

            "content": "Spoilers herein.Film allows so many different modes, that we depend on the first few minutes of a movie to tell us what world we are entering and something of the rules of that world.The first muppet movie was one of the most important of films because of the new dimension it added: highly self-referential annotation. It was about the making of itself. At one point there is a fight and Kermit gets tossed around into the piano. (The piano player is the film's composer.) Kermit looks directly at the camera and says ` I hope you appreciate that I am doing my own stunts!'Jim Henson did not invent folded realities in film, but he surely was a key innovator. He took this notion pretty far with his ambitious experiments in `Labyrinth' and `Dark Crystal,' both failures in the end. The high point was the `Muppet Movie' which was directed by a `real' director. Since Jim's death and the entrance of Disney, all the creative steam is gone and we are left with simple exploitation. The kind of folding Henson had in mind can never be repeated, so this project starts off with a structural handicap.Meanwhile, Charles Dickens. He invented much of what Modern Christmas is. (Santa Claus' appearance and importance would be invented later by Coke.) The magic of Dickens is that he is totally without irony in the story, or folding if you will. He creates characters and lets them bump up against each other on their own accord. The whole thing works because it is without folding.Now these two world-creating paths (folding and antifolding) meet and do a good job of temporarily merging. It is this merged world to which we are introduced in the first few minutes. The clever idea here is that a muppet portrays the writer, the creator of what we see. Gonzo is a fabricated actor who acts the writer of the story. He both creates the characters and intermingles with them as a created character himself. As a clever idea, is is a rehash of older muppetry, but it works at least so far as making a watchable film.As it develops, in addition to the muppet narrator, it folds several other layers: familiar muppets acting parts, humans acting parts (Scrooge and girlfriend, Nephew and wife), newly created puppets who are not muppets acting some parts (the ghosts). The oddness of Dickens characters as created by him smoothly meshes with the similar oddness of Henson's exaggerated characters. That alone makes this the second most successful project in the muppet world. `Treasure Island' for instance, tried a similar trick and failed because Stevenson built his characters a different way.There are three or four muppet jokes inserted that do not derive from the story. But because we have a real narrator, we can get more of the actual language of Dickens' written word. And oddly, that makes this one of the most successful `Carol's on film in spite of Caine's excesses.The songs are dreadful except for the appearance of Marley (here as brothers).Bottom line: it is neither good Dickens nor good Henson. But no stage or film drama is good Dickens anyway, so if all you want is a sentimental echo of the real thing, this will do better than most.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

A movie for children, you say?  Absolutely.  Adults?  Most certainly.  All that's required of any audience is that you suspend disbelief for awhile and check your doubts at the door; do that and you're in for a thoroughly enjoyable ninety minutes or so as Caine, Kermit, Miss Piggy and all the rest bring you a unique and entertaining version of the Charles Dickens' classic, guaranteed to be unlike any you've seen before. For the younger set, the antics of the  muppets alone will be enthralling; for the rest of us there's some subtle humor (as can be found in all of the muppets outings), and of course the story itself which, when well crafted and delivered-- as this one is-- always seems fresh, especially when seeing a new version for the first time. \tHenson has done a tremendous job of melding the live actors with the animated and presenting them together in such a natural setting, and with such imagination, that it's easy to accept the world in which they live and thrive; so much so that if Gonzo came to your door while you were watching this one, you wouldn't think twice about it.  And there are so many clever bits sprinkled throughout, for instance, having the Marley `Brothers,' Jacob and `Robert.'  Things adults will pick up on, and which will be entertaining to kids who will take what they see and hear at face value. \tAs for the casting of Michael Caine as Scrooge, to land such a gifted actor to anchor the story was a coup indeed; and Caine more than delivers, creating an imposing figure of Scrooge that he makes quite his own.  And how gratifying to see yet another interpretation of one of the most well known figures in literature played so well.  Caine immerses himself in the part and performs opposite Kermit the Frog or Miss Piggy with the same dedication and eye for detail that he did opposite Olivier in `Sleuth,' or Connery in `The Man Who Would Be King.'  It's a performance that lends distinction to the film and illustrates what a consummate professional Caine is. \tEveryone's favorite muppets are on hand for this one, with Kermit in the role of Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Mrs. Cratchit and The Great Gonzo in the role of Charles Dickens, who also narrates the story, along with the help of Rizzo the Rat.  The familiar tale remains intact under Henson's direction, and what a treat `The Muppet Christmas Carol' will be to the youngsters who are being introduced to it with this film.  And for the holiday season it's like a bright and sparkling decoration that will fit in nicely with the traditional festivities of every family, and will help to keep the spirit alive within all of us.

Even with a musical number at the end that feels like it should be cringe-worthy, Caine's Scrooge never really is.The songs are, of course, as much characters in the film as the muppets themselves - memorable and catchy, these tunes are all a reminder of Dickens' purpose in writing 'A Christmas Carol': that ignoring the harsh realities of the lives of the less fortunate, particularly children, will result in inescapable moral corruption.At turns sad, funny, joyous, and genuinely moving, 'The Muppet Christmas Carol' is a family-friendly retelling of Dickens' classic cautionary Christmas tale that ticks all the right boxes, deserving to be watched year on year in the days leading up to Christmas.",

But before he died, he 'told' my father (he could barely speak at that time but his gestures meant enough) to buy us a Christmas present from the money he was clutching in his hand. With that money, my father bought us this video: The Muppet Christmas Carol.It would be the last time in seven years my family would celebrate Christmas (this year is the first time in all these years we are trying it again, and so far so good) But every year, I'd go through my closet and watch this movie. I didn't know this was the first Muppet feature since Jim Henson's death... but as this movie was a tribute to the genius, The Muppet Christmas Carol is for me a tribute to my grandpa.And still, after all these years, I still love this movie with all my heart. It's truly a classic, it's inventive, it's funny, it's moving, at times heart-wrenching, always entertaining and touching. I have loved Michael Caine since his portrayal of Scrooge and I still think it is one of his more phenomenal performances. The transformation his character goes through in the tale, he portrays masterfully, and in the beginning of the movie you hate him, during the movie and the journey he takes through his past, present and future you feel for him and at the end you love him, like everybody else. The Muppets are as adorable as always, and I LOVED the family Kermit and Miss Piggy formed together. I will always love Tiny Tim. I will always love this movie.Just my two cents worth: see The Muppet Christmas Carol with the entire movie. It's a great, classic tale for all ages.",

            "content": "Muppet Christmas Carol, The (1992) *** (out of 4) As the title clearly gives away, the Muppets decide to do their own version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol with Michael Caine playing Ebenezer Scrooge. Those familiar with the original story as well as countless other versions known that the story itself is a pretty dark one with some extremely violent moments that would make one seem inappropriate for children. There's even a joke by one of the Muppet's about it being too dark for kids but we then get a funny bit on the importance of the story. I'm sure some might complain that the really dark moments have been tamed down way too much but I guess these people didn't realize the word \"Muppet\" when they hit play. Overall this is an extremely entertaining version of the story and you can't help but smile when you see someone like Caine playing with the Muppet's. There are many very good scenes including, of course, the ending where Scrooge finally makes good to Bob Cratchit who is played by Kermit here. Fans of the Muppets are going to get a real kick out of seeing their favorite characters getting to play the part of famous people from the story. Some of the highlights are of course Kermit but we also get Fozzie Bear doing Fozziewig and who better than Gonzo and Rizzo to play hosts? I think the film made the right choice in letting the Muppets work their way around Caine who is the main star here. I think Caine does a very good job with the part and especially when you consider this is a kids movie and he wasn't allowed to go as far or as dark as some of the previous versions. It appears that the actor is having fun with his fake friends and it also seems as if he's in on the joke and willing to substitute some of the darker moments for lighter ones. I think some of the music is forgettable and there's a tad bit too much slapstick that gets in the way of the story but overall this is a pleasant little film that's perfect for the holidays.",

            "content": "The Muppet Christmas Carol is an unlikely match made in Heaven; a strange little miracle of the kind that comes only at Yuletide.Who could've thought that the Muppets -- known, at the time, for summoning the goofiest sides of celebrity guests like Mark Hamill and Julie Andrews -- would be able to faithfully re-tell Charles Dickens' immortal tale (even making improvements and welcome expansions in some areas), while retaining their wacky charm, and cast Michael Caine as one of the best screen versions of Ebenezer Scrooge of all time? Well, someone did, and somehow they were right on the money.Now, at 30 years of age, recently remastered in 4K, and with its extended cut finally available on Disney+, the picture still holds up and still supplies the right level of drama, horror, warmth, and Dickens-ian prose on one hand, and just enough puppet cheekiness the other. The only time that it breaks the fourth wall in a bona fide Muppet Show sort of way -- in that the production the Muppets are putting on, in this case A Christmas Carol, visibly gets out of control -- is when the Great Gonzo, who \"plays\" Dickens and guides us through the story alongside \"Rizzo the Rat as Himself\", needs to pull Sam the Eagle aside after he boasts that \"business is the American way\", reminding him that the show they're doing right now is set in London.The film, of course, stars several other Muppets, including Kermit the Frog as Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Mrs. Cratchit, Fozzie the Bear as Fozziwig (because of course), Staler and Waldorf as the Marleys (Jacob is joined by a Robert Marley; I trust you get the joke), Robin the Frog as Tiny Tim, and a few others in bit parts -- all, in turn, performed by the likes of Frank Oz, Steve Whitmire, Dave Goelz, and other Henson Studio A-listers. At the center is Caine as Scrooge, and what a Scrooge he is!Too many jokes have already been made about the gravity of his performance; the devotion with which he realizes this classic literary figure; the earnestness with which orates to Kermit the Frog. The only other human actor to treat Kermit so seriously as a colleague is Orson Welles, but that was only for a few seconds.The story... do I even need to tell you? It's A Christmas Carol, one of the best Christmas stories ever penned and one of the earliest novels to feature time travel (and, to this day, one of the best and most poignant usages of such a device). Loathed by everyone in town, even his jovial nephew, for being a \"skinflint\" who \"charges folks a fortune for his dark and drafty houses\" (to quote the first song in the film), callous miser Scrooge returns home the night before Christmas, is haunted by the Marleys, and informed that three Spirits will visit him for reasons that aren't clear.Through the night, Scrooge is reminded of the past, made cognizant of the present, and warned of the future. As noted, all of this is as faithful as any Disney-Muppet variation of the tale could possibly be; not just the gloriously straight-faced performance of Caine or the accurate dialogue, but the details of the production design -- from the atmospheric sets and the way those sets are shot to the ominous lighting of a simple clock automaton tolling 2 for the next spirit's arrival. When I say that this film is bright and dark -- hot and cold -- in all the right places, I am also speaking of the image.Released shortly after the death of Muppet creator Jim Henson and his frequent collaborator Richard Hunt, the movie is dedicated to their memory and, alas, sidelines a few of the characters (sans Kermit, of course) that Henson would always voice, including Dr. Teeth and Rowlf the Dog. It is directed by Jim Henson's son, Brian Henson, and features all the intricate puppetry and direction you'd expect, replete with the aforementioned Victorian sets that seem believable despite discernably being sets. (The film successfully creates the illusion that these houses are lived-in; it probably helps that each set is populated by up to 20 puppets at once, themselves clearly fake yet convincingly alive.)Among the puppets, my favorite may be the full-body suit of The Ghost of Christmas Present -- who also constitutes one of the better alterations from the book. In giving him a short memory and habit of repeating himself, the film underscores how all he knows is the present. \"My mind is filled with the here and now\", he chortles as he greets Scrooge.Indeed there are some changes, but none that disrespect the original story or miss its essence. This includes the decision to make it into a musical. Some of the song numbers, namely the haunting yet catchy \"Marley and Marley\", are written well enough that Dickens himself could have penned them (the song does use the phrase \"captive, bound and double-ironed\" to describe the Marleys' fate on the Other Side, just as Jacob Marley spoke of his own prison in the book).For all the humor in the movie, the material is taken seriously at every turn. The closest thing we get to something that feels spoof-y is, again, Gonzo telling Sam to stay on script and Rizzo routinely asking why this story has to be so scary. (\"That was some scary stuff. Should we be worried about the kids in the audience?\" \"It's alright. It's culture.\") As we get to the third act and are pulled into the dismal future by the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come (who is a decidedly unsettling specter in this version, designed like a mute Ringwraith), Rizzo and Gonzo know to leave the story entirely, even bidding the audience farewell until the epilogue. Before you know it, you'll be bawling your eyes out as the truth of sickly Tiny Tim -- as played by a green piece of fabric -- becomes too real to ignore.I mentioned before that an extended cut exists. Almost every version of the film -- bar the VHS release and the version I saw on TV when I saw the movie for the first time -- excludes a song number from Scrooge's old flame Belle, heard while he's visiting the past, being shown the Christmas that irrevocably broke his heart. The song, called \"When Love is Gone\", was cut for supposedly halting the pacing and being altogether superfluous. But erasing the song ruins the impact of the final song (which is actually a reprise; a merry version of a sad piece) and weakens the emotion of the segment. Hearing the song in full, as Disney+ now permits, also better explains why Rizzo is blubbering at the end of the scene. Furthermore, it's one of the best-staged numbers in the whole thing; the bit where Old Scrooge joins in a duet with Belle, who can't see or hear him, is beautifully done.In any case, I intend to keep arguing that this is an unsurpassed adaptation of this book. It knows when to make us laugh like only these critters know how and when to tug at our heartstrings and rethink ourselves the way this story always should. Its songs range from jolly and memorable to tear-jerking, it looks wonderful (maybe not as technically impressive as, say, The Dark Crystal or Labyrinth, but it doesn't need to be), it supplies a grade-A central performance, and it translates these characters in fun, imaginative ways. (I've already praised the designs of the final two ghosts, but the unearthly agelessness of The Ghost of Christmas Past is inspired also.)So yes, when you hear someone make the case that this or that version of A Christmas Carol -- be it the 1984 TV movie, the 1970 musical, this crap, or any of the silent films -- is actually the best one, ask them: \"But did that one have The Muppets?\"",

            "content": "\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is a 1992 musical drama directed by Brian Hanson starring Michael Caine and Kermit the Frog.\n\u26aa\nAll in all, the Muppets' take on Charles Dickens' classic carol dusts off and converts the iconic story into a lovely musical that knows to tackle both the affectionate as well as the dramatic aspects of it, without ever losing its light-heartedness, and thanks to a phenomenal leading performance by Michael Caine as Scrooge as well as the puppets, wonderfully composed and catchy original songs and a sensitive narration, it becomes an atmospheric, marvellously crafted and child-friendly adaptation that resurrects the values of the tale successfully.\n\u26aa\nI have seen it dozens of times in the past, but this time was still some sort of a novelty, as it was the first time revisiting it after having read the original novelette. To my astonishment, this production here did a phenomenal job adapting the story, for almost everything is done superbly. The book itself was a fine piece of literature, even if it is not the most complex and brilliantly crafted novels, it works out well enough. It is atmospheric, positively edifying and excellently capturing the essence of the holiday. It is a classic for a reason, and hence I think that every child in the world should be exposed to it in some form at least once in a lifetime. Fortunately, there were Brian Hanson and his colleagues, and what they did roughly thirty years ago is absolute magic. In their charmingly iconic way, they turned it into a Muppet musical, and despite this being an undeniably bold undertaking, it works out marvellously well. Michael Caine, one of the few human actors, plays the infamous miser superbly and knows to navigate around his puppet co-stars like it was the most natural thing. Like with many of the Muppet films, it is the perfect balance of humans and puppets that define the film's inimitable charm. However, it isn't the acting that makes this adaptation so excellent, it is the narration. Dickens' story has some undeniably creepy and gruesome undertones that I thought were too heavy for a film aimed at children, but since I wasn't apparently the only one thinking this way, it displays the changes that were necessary. To preserve the way it is narrated in the novel, Gonzo plays Charles Dickens aka the narrator, and by his side is Rizzo the Rat playing himself. The thing is, through this fourth wall breaking narration as well as the occasional jokes, the film is always relieved and maintains its overall light-heartedness. The two are the comic relief it needs to be child appropriate, and I think that is downright clever. Aside from them, I think that some scenes from the source material I deemed to be either too long or too heavy were altered and on many occasions, even improved. Seriously, it rarely happens that an adaptation is superior to its original source, but here we are. Furthermore, there are the lovely and marvellously composed original songs that make it even more lovely. None of them feels corny or pointless, they fit the scenario perfectly every single time. Even my brother, an avowed opponent of singing in films, thinks that they songs are delightful, and I assure you, this is an unquestionable compliment! Honestly, this adaptation is near-perfect. It has a distinct atmosphere, knows to tackle all the emotions it needs to tackle and honour its source material. Even though it cannot be proved, I think Charles Dickens would have liked this production. In the end, it is even my favourite adaptation of matter, and it has proved me once again.",

I cannot name a single failure in his career. This is one of his greatest performances, as well... and it is truly an honor to appear alongside Muppets, I imagine.The film is available in two versions: theatrical widescreen, and extended full-screen. I suggest the widescreen, not only because the picture is better, but because the only scene cut is of a woman singing, and her song and voice are not high points whatsoever.The DVD is worth owning for the special features. A short feature on the life of Gonzo and another short on Christmas Around the World. I wish they had both been longer, but they were still a nice treat.

In this version, we are taken to 19th Century London like any other \"Christmas Carol\" only this time, we have those adorable Muppets to keep us company with the humans. Playing Scrooge is the great Michael Cain who not only gives one his best performances here but is also one of the best Scrooges of all time. He can be both gruff and mean but when it comes to those emotional scenes, well, if your not crying or on the verge of crying, then your not human. In particular, the scene with Scrooge in the graveyard is probably the most powerful one in any of the \"Christmas Carol\" versions and believe me I've seen quite a few \"Christmas Carols\". However, its not all gloom for there is plenty of comedy and good songs that one can find in any of the Muppet movies while at the same time, for the most part, the makers do a good job of keeping true to Charles Dicken's work. Kermit the Frog plays Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as his irritable wife, Statler and Waldorf as Jacob and Robert Marley (nothing but praise for those two in that dual role) and Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat as the film's narrators. Plus, you can find all your other favorite Muppet characters spread through out the movie. In short, this is a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy and anyone who says different, well, they have to be a Scrooge themselves.

It runs for slightly over 80 minutes and has some good parts, some not so good. First of all, Michael Caine is a brilliant actor and he shows it here as well. I would almost say he is too good for the part. Really strong performance that carries the film from start to finish. The Muppets I am usually not the biggest fan of and here they worked well sometimes and sometimes not so much. But as this one is especially for younger audiences, they are absolutely needed for the comic relief away from the dramatic, sometimes creepy story. I also enjoyed the music in here. In terms of emotional impact, this was only partly a success. Probably the loud and boastful Miss Piggy will take heart and feeling out of almost everything. And a little Kermit as Tiny Tim (one of the emotional highlights of the tale usually) is not working particularly well either. I enjoyed this one the most when it's humans only that we see, although I also liked for example the part when one of the gang climbs over an incredibly high fence with all his effort and shows us right afterward that he can easily get in right through the fence. As a whole, a decent watch for the holidays and if you like the Muppets in general, unlike me, you will probably appreciate this one even more than I did. Recommended.",

Whilst the story remains fairly faithful to Dickens' novel (although it is simplified somewhat for a younger audience), the lack of really good jokes and the inclusion of some rather forgettable songs (by Paul Williams) made this film rather disappointing for me.Caine is superb as Scrooge but his Muppet co-stars are just not up to their zany best. Gonzo (as Dickens) and Rizzo the Rat narrate the tale and tend to interrupt the flow of proceedings, whilst Kermit, voiced by Steve Whitmire (not Jim Henson, who died two years earlier), just doesn't sound like the frog we know and love.The whole affair is rather sedate considering this is a Muppet movie and I found myself struggling to stay awake towards the end.

            "content": "Following on from The Muppet Movie, The Muppets Take Manhattan and The Great Muppet Caper, this is Jim and Brian Henson's puppet version of the famous Charles Dickens story, \"A Christmas Carol\". It is a story done many times for stage and screen, and this version is pretty faithful to the source material, though inevitably it does make simplifications in order to accommodate its intended juvenile audience. Michael Caine is a perfect choice for Ebenezer Scrooge and holds the film together well (not easy, I'm sure, when you're a living, breathing actor surrounded by furry puppets!)In Victorian London, miserly counting house boss Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine) looks on in disgust as the citizens merrily prepare for Christmas. Since youth-hood, Scrooge has despised Christmas and what he deems to be the frivolity and excessive generosity associated with it. One of Scrooge's employees, Bob Crachit (Kermit The Frog), asks for time off on Christmas Day to be with his family, and is begrudgingly given it by his sour employer. However, Scrooge is visited later that night by the ghosts of his now-deceased partners Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf). They warn him that he needs to change his ways or else he faces eternal damnation. More ghosts visit him through the night in an attempt to show him the error of his ways. Firstly, the Ghost of Christmas Past who forces Scrooge to relive some of his acts of cruelty from Christmases gone by; secondly, the Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows Scrooge how his mean nature affects those around him; and thirdly, the Ghost of Christmas Future, who allows Scrooge a terrifying and heart-breaking glimpse of what will be if he continues to mistreat those he knows....The film is well-made and enjoyable in its simplistic way. Caine, as noted, is an outstanding choice for the Scrooge role. The production designs are also first-rate, including some well-designed wintry Victorian streets and some excellent interiors. There are a few things about the film that I find rather irritating, though, and as a result I've knocked my rating down to a 6. The linking device, which uses Gonzo as narrator Charles Dickens and saddles him a very unfunny sidekick called Rizzo the Rat, seems both unnecessary and heavy-handed. Also disappointing is the lack of screen time given to some of our favourite muppet characters. True enough, Kermit gets plenty of time as Bob Cratchit, but muppet legends like Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, the Animal, and Statler & Waldorf disappear from the action all too quickly. The central storyline here follows Scrooge, and since Scrooge is played by the human Caine, the muppets are reduced to brief guest roles.... and THAT seems a bit of a cheat when it is supposed to be a muppet movie. This is a worthwhile film and a nice, easy introduction to the story for viewers too young to read the book, but somehow I cant help thinking that it could have been better.",

All the best Muppets are there, and all shine. Miss Piggy is magnificent as Mrs.Cratchet and the cameo of Fozzy-bear as Mr.Fozzywig is a pearl.

The movie, considering its stars, is surprisingly faithful to Charles Dickens novel, Michael Caine turns in a brilliant performance as Ebeneezer Scrooge, one who wouldn't look out of place in any version of the story. The other characters from the novel played by the Muppet's, Bob Cratchit and his family, Jacob Marley etc are really well done, and don't diverge from the original novel too much, and including Charles Dickens himself as narrator was a clever touch as it gave my favourite Muppet character Gonzo a role which 'he' did really well, as was bringing in Jacob Marley's brother so Statler and Waldorf could essentially play themselves, hilariously. The three ghosts, past present and future are all well done, maybe the Ghost of Christmas Present was a bit too jolly as the character is really serious under his jolly persona. The Ghost of Christmas Future is one of the few times this character has been portrayed correctly, with more emphasis on subtlety and less emphasis on fear, as was that scene when Scrooge realizes the consequences of his actions, and scene of the death of Tiny Tim was genuinely moving when the Cratchits are on the verge of tears, you can see the sorrow and sadness in the characters, not an easy task when working with puppets. The music numbers help to move the story along and add to the story, again, no easy task when dealing with classical literature. This adaptation of Charles Dickens classic novel is well done, very faithful and just plain enjoyable for all the family, not just children, even if you haven't read the novel, a perfect place to start for children to enjoy classic literature.",

Even from the opening shot as the camera pans over a model of Victorian London crafted to a level of detail I'd expect from some modelling fetishist you know that you are in very safe hands. With Gonzo taking on the role of Charles Dickens and Rizzo the rat taking on the role of Rizzo the Rat, the pair act as our guides through want is one of the most charming Christmas movies I know.Trying to talk about this film is like trying to decide which packet from a box of Options to have first. It's all so good! OK\u0085 The music. I'll start with the music. From the opening number (Scrooge) we're treated to hearty, well written tunes that you can join in with by the second chorus. It's genuinely difficult to highlight a stand out number as they are all utterly charming. From Statler and Waldorf as Jacob and Robert Marley, to Scrooge regaling us with 'Thankful Heart' via the Ghost of Christmas Present singing 'It Feels Like Christmas' every song is fantastic. Disclaimer: That's not actually true. In the original cinematic release and the VHS version there is a song sung by young Scrooge and Belle called 'When Love is Gone'. While it still exists on the closing credits \u2013 in a inferior version sung by Martina McBride \u2013 it has been cut from the widescreen DVD release. OK, the song wasn't great, but I don't agree with the cut, mostly because now the scene is rather jarring, with Belle rather softly accusing Scrooge of no longer loving her and then suddenly departing, leaving Rizzo in tears. It feels like the hack job it is.Golly I hate finding flaws in this film, so lets move onto the acting. Pleasingly it's mostly the Muppets here, but with them is Michael Caine as the man himself: Scrooge. Now it might be easy to forget that, back in 1992, Sir Michaels career hadn't exactly been shining for the past decade. In fact he had been in some tosh and hadn't really done himself any favours with his performances. However this movie was, far and away, his best in ten years. He is stupendous! Something else great that this movie does is make Tiny Tim likable. I don't know about you but in most versions of a Christmas Carol I just want to punch the kid. They are normally either not that tiny, or to young to give a convincing performance and, no matter what, I almost always feel sorry for the other Cratchet children as they are forgotten in favour of their saintly brother. But because in this version Tim is a Muppet well\u0085 it's OK! It actually works! Though I do get frustrated when I see the Cratchets living in a nicer house than I have\u0085 This movie is a crafted piece of Christmas merriment. With so much going on in each shot you do not get board with repeated viewing, a 'must' for an annual favourite, it stays fairly true to the book, which again is good as, in my opinion, if you're going to start messing around with a work of genius you want to be *really* sure you can improve on it. And finally, like a favourite Christmas jumper, this film will warm and comfort you and is guaranteed to put you in that Yule spirit. Watch it.",

This is an adaptation of Charles Dickens' novella first, a Muppet film second. Take Michael Caine's fantastic performance as evidence of this - at no point does his Scrooge acknowledge that he's talking to a puppet. Every creature that he comes across, be they felt or flesh, are simply characters within the story. Or, how about the fact that Miss Piggy, one of the most famous of all Muppets, doesn't appear until about half-way through the film - or that she and Fozzie only appear in two or three scenes?It's a risky but, ultimately, completely successful choice as The Muppet Christmas Carol is a wonderful film from start to finish, perfectly encapsulating the tone of the novella. The Muppet comedy is left to Gonzo (as \"Charles Dickens\") and Rizzo, but even they sit out the \"Christmas Yet to Come\" sequences in respect to the tone. The songs are also very good, with \"Mr Scrooge\", \"One More Sleep Till Christmas\" and \"It Feels Like Christmas\" being the particular highlights. It would be remiss of me to not mention \"When Love is Gone\", the films's love-song which was cruelly cut from the cinematic release, restored for the VHS, occasionally found its way to DVD and is cut again for the Blu-ray. Yes, it's slow and may make kids restless. No, it doesn't feature any muppets. But if any film sells the torment that Scrooge feels when he thinks of his lost love Belle, it's this one. I can think of very few sanctioned cuts that damage a film so severely.In adaptation terms, the film is also surprisingly faithful and I can think of only two missteps. The first is the absence of Christmas Past scenes showing Scrooge's unhappy relationship with his father and his sister Fan's attempts to fix this. The second is, during the Christmas Present scenes where we see nothing of Nephew Fred saying anything particularly sentimental about Ebeneezer and instead simply skip to Fred making fun of him.But these are minor nitpicks- and cannot dent a film that has so much heart. If it's not making you laugh, it's making you cry. And when I watch this film every Christmas Eve (be that the ones in the past, the present or those yet to come), it prepares me perfectly for the festive season. If you want a truly faithful adaptation, I recommend the 1984 TV film starring George C.Scott. If you want one of the best family movies of all time, go for this.8/10 for the cut version, 9/10 for the version with \"When Love Is Gone\".",

The lavish production design of the city and some excellent camera-work following different walks throughout London as Scrooge makes his way to his place of business to his home (and then the ghosts carrying him from one era of his life to another) are definite highlights, while the heavily criticized Williams' songs weren't that bad to me I didn't exactly consider them the success of the film.

It is fun to see Kermit as Cratchet although the Tiny Tim part of the story that typically guarantees Niagara Falls for some reason just seems lacking this go-around. Piggy reacting to Scrooge on Christmas Day while he's trying to tell Kermit about his raise is one of my favorite scenes, although I thought Gonzo and Rizzo steal every moment they're on screen, (which are far more than I had anticipated) and are one of the main reasons to seek this out during the Holiday season. Another highlight: a younger Statler and Waldorf mocking Fozziewig from an upper floor balcony at his company party during the trip to Christmas Present. Caine wisely doesn't camp it up with the Muppets as Scrooge, deciding to play the character straight. A London filled with Muppets in a Dickens Christmas Carol, especially at the beginning and end with Scrooge first grim and glum then later blissful and bright makes the world a better place. I recommend this adaptation for early December viewing, as kind of a starter for the more serious and dramatic versions later in the month. Gonzo and Rizzo following along with us during Scrooge's trips keeps the tone light and slapstick alive; they certainly add some fun to the proceedings.",

            "content": "A likable version of the familiar story: a collaboration between Walt Disney Productions (who had already tackled the Charles Dickens classic in 1983; see my review of MICKEY'S Christmas CAROL) and the Jim Henson company, with most of the characters 'played' by the latter's popular Muppet figures (Kermit The Frog is Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy is Mrs. Cratchit, Fozzie Bear Mr. Fezziwig, etc.). interestingly, here we get two Marleys for the price of one \u0096 'played' by Waldorf and Statler, the old guys in the balcony from TV's THE MUPPET SHOW \u0096 but also The Great Gonzo as Dickens himself, who recounts the tale to a skeptical Rizzo The Rat! Defeating competition from the likes of David Hemmings, Ron Moody and David Warner, Scrooge, then, is played by Michael Caine, who does well enough as the reformed miser, though he doesn't bring anything particularly novel to the role; indeed, the script seems to be drawing most on the definitive 1951 SCROOGE and the 1970 musical version of the same name \u0096 this too, in fact, has a number of songs (the work of Paul Williams, written in his typically upbeat and catchy style).While the film does fall somewhat in the trap of not delivering enough of Scrooge or enough of The Muppets (Miss Piggy's role, for instance, would be much bigger in a more typical effort), it's generally enjoyable with a fair number of funny bits: the very opening scene with a number of aristocrats patting themselves on the back for a great supper thinking on what they should do next and one of them suggests they have lunch; Rizzo thanking Dickens/Gonzo for making him a part of the story (even if only to clean the outer window of Scrooge's office!); Scrooge's terrified employees transforming themselves instantly into sun-loving beach-goers when the former complains about their overconsumption of coal; the charity-seeking carol-singer in whose face Scrooge shuts his door is later shown freezing out in the street; etc. Ironically, from what I recall of the various versions of the story I've watched, this one provides the most satisfactory depiction of the Ghost Of Christmas Present {he's even given the film's best song!); incidentally, Caine does a unremarkable bit of singing himself. Furthermore, checking on the IMDb just now, I learned that the version I watched is missing a song! P.S. As I had written in my review of the 1935 SCROOGE, I was supposed to watch a good seven adaptations of \"A Christmas Carol\" during this festive season \u0096 but, for various reasons, I could only make it up to four...",

            "content": "Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol' is probably the most adapted story of all time, wiggling its way into all genres and audience generations. There have been straight adaptations, comedic adaptations, scary adaptations, meta adaptations and, even, musical adaptations. Possibly the strangest of them all is this, 'The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)'. For the most part, the piece is a straight-forward, rather faithful adaptation of the oft-adapted story, with lead actor Michael Caine acting as if he's in an acclaimed, 'Royal Shakespeare Company' stage-play. He gives maybe one of the best performances of his career, conveying Scrooge's through-the-wringer journey with confidence and conviction. The thing is that he's partnered up with puppets, most of whom also act with similarly sincere intentions. The juxtaposition of man and Muppet isn't played for comedy. Of course, there is the occasional bit of background slapstick and the odd musical number, but it tends to just blend in with the established, not-at-all-watered-down tone or, worse, seem sort of misjudged. The most unmistakably 'Muppety' element is the narration by Gonzo (as Charles Dickens himself), but even this uses the novel's proper prose and feels oddly redundant. Thankfully, Gonzo and his little rat companion do add some personality to the piece, their banter being fun if not exactly funny. When it comes down to it, the picture is a solid adaptation of Dickens' Christmas classic. It doesn't really set itself apart, despite featuring the Muppets, which does give it an unexpected staleness, principally because the tale has been told so many times before. If this is your first 'Christmas Carol', you'll probably get more out of it. It'll help if you're a massive Muppets fan, too. 6/10",

As much of a Muppets fan I am, I've only seen The Muppet Christmas Carol once or twice before, probably right around 1992-3 when it came out. At the time, I loved their original stories and wasn't pleased when they took on other fables, like 'A Christmas Carol in Prose, Being a Ghost- Story of Christmas' or this movie's follow-up, 'Treasure Island.' I thought this was just okay back then.Insert Present Day Me, or in 1992-3 Me's case, Me Yet to Come (wait, that sounded weird\u0085) and this movie isn't just harmless, it's cute, hilarious for all the inserted perfect Muppet humor and knows how to stick to the original source while intergrading basically a kids play. The humor can be appreciated by both adults and children and the story is timeless. Now, the bad part. I know, bah humbug. I'm not a fan of the musical numbers.

Well done, Muppets!And \"A Merry Christmas to us all; God bless us, every one!\" (I didn't make that up, so I really can't take credit for it. Tiny Tim actually said that. Okay, not for real. It was Charles Dickens who originally wrote it. But YOU GET THE MEANING!

His story here is narrated by Charles Dickens (The Great Gonzo) himself.It has, in fairness, been a while since I watched \"Muppets Christmas Carol\". What struck me on this viewing is how amazing the puppetry work is, especially in consideration of how basic some of the puppets are. There have been much more complicated puppets made since, with much more articulation and much more work gone into the face manipulation - but here the craft is so accomplished that you can feel for Kermit, even though he doesn't even have eyelids.The songs are good, as are the performances. Michael Caine made absolutely the right choice to play everything with a straight bat and treat the Muppets as if they were ordinary people. It doesn't shy too far away from the less family friendly aspects of the story, the deaths of certain characters and the horrors of the ghost of Christmas yet to come. The concessions that the show makes to the Muppets though is well done.Charming and wise enough to not outstay it's welcome, I really like the film.",

            "content": "The Muppet Christmas Carol is a classic Disney movie that lives up to a lot of the other adaptations of Charles Dickens 'Christmas Carol'. It's better than some others Christmas Carols movies. This movie was the first film released after the deaths of Muppets creator Jim Henson and fellow puppeteer Richard Hunt. While the film didn't have any Sesame Street or much Fraggle Rock characters. It's probably the best Muppet movies ever because it focus on a main human character first, rather than the Muppets first right. Rather than playing themselves in the film, the film mixed their Muppet characteristic to that of the characters of the book, with negative and positive result. I just couldn't get behind, Gonzo the Great (voice by Dave Goelz) as Charles Dickens, the author and narrator for this film. Yet, I can see Kermit the Frog (voice by Steve Whitmire) as Bob Cratchit. I can see Fozzie Bear as Fozziwig. I have to say, for all the modern day adaptations, Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge was amazing. He can give a great cold shoulder performance, while also having a bit of a charm to his character that makes you like him ever more. I'm glad, they didn't use a Muppet for this main character. Ebenezer is a surly money-lender who is more interested in profit than celebration Christmas. He treats his family, employees, and friends really horrible. Later that evening, Scrooge finds himself face to face with ghosts. Glad, again, they didn't use Miss Piggy, Scooter, & Gonzo as the ghost as well. Note the description of William Shakespeare's Hamlet passage in the beginning that foreshadows the entrance of the ghosts. I love the simplistic symbolism in this film with all the ghosts represent limits. The ghost visits all contain a distinct episode in Scrooge's spiritual re-education. The ghost of Jacob and Robert Marley AKA Statler and Waldorf Waldorf (voice by Dave Goelz & Jerry Nelson) is limited by his greedy sins, as his chains are forged of cashboxes, padlocks, ledgers, and steel purse. Dickens was particularly disgusted with the writings of an economist named Thomas Robert Malthus, a wealthy man, who wrote Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) that population growth would always outpace food supply resulting in unavoidable and catastrophic poverty and starvation. Dickens alludes to Malthus as Marley, when Scrooge echoes the economist's views on overpopulation in his rebuke of the portly gentlemen. The Ghost of Christmas Past might scare some little children, but I just can't help liking the visuals effects of this film. Ghost of Christmas Past (voiced by Jessica Fox), a childlike specter who takes Scrooge on a journey back through time to his youth is just beautiful to watch. Christmas past is limited by the darkness or negative thinking. The symbol of his light bright head cover by a cap represented optimistic thinking or the illuminating power of the mind. By covering his head with the cap, he limited himself. That is why some people believe that the Ghost of Christmas past is in fact, a young Scrooge whom allow negative thinking to seep in. The Ghost of Christmas Past also represents memory, and all the memories are that of Scrooge. So it does makes sense. I have to say, the film was missing the mention of Fan, Scrooge's sister that plays a big role in his childhood. I love the story of how Scrooge fell in love with Belle (Meredith Braun). Eventually, Scrooge and Belle break up due to Scrooge's obsession with money. While, the two don't share screen time too long; it's work as an emotional heartbreaking scene. Sadly the song 'When the Love is gone\" that works with this great scene was cut in some versions of this movie. It's a great song, and not having this song, makes it look like they jump an awful cut. I have to say, don't watch the versions that doesn't have this song as you'll be missing a big part of the back story. The Ghost of Christmas Present (voice by Jerry Nelson and Don Austen as: In-Suit Performer) was outstanding as the large, festive spirit with a booming voice who lives only for the here and now. He gives Scrooge a glimpse into the holiday celebration of others. The Christmas present ghost is limited by lifespan. He can only live on single day. He represent the central symbol of the Christmas ideal--generosity, goodwill, and celebration. It might be note that he was the late 19th century blueprints to what he think of now as Santa. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come was just scary, a silent entity who reveals the chilling grim future for Scrooge. He is pretty much the Grim Reaper. With A Christmas Carol, Dickens hopes to show how self-serving, insensitive people can be converted into charitable, caring, and socially conscious members of society through the intercession of moralizing quasi-religious lessons. By doing this, Dickens had to make a one-dimensional, representation of the plight of the poor with Tiny Tim (Robin the Frog). Dickens had every intention of tugging on your heartstrings with this tragic figure. Underlying the narrative and paralleling the more ostensible theme of moral redemption, lies an incisive political diatribe. Dickens takes aim at the Poor Laws then governing the underclass of Victorian England. He exposes the flaws of the unfair system of government that essentially restricts the underclass to life in prison or in a workhouse. The story also mirrors a lot of Dicken's younger life when his father was jailed. It was during this terrible period in Dickens' childhood that he observed the lives of the men, women, and children in the most impoverished areas of London and witnessed the social injustices they suffered that give him the idea. Overall: it's a good movie with good music, love nearly all the songs. The visuals are great. Acting was good. It's worth watching during Christmas.",

The familiar Muppet characters take on various roles: Kermit plays Bob Cratchit, with Miss Piggy as his surprisingly pliant wife; Stadtler and Waldorf play Scrooge's erstwhile partners, now living as the Ghosts of Christmas past; Fozzie Bear plays Fozziewig (Fezziwig in the Dickens text); Sam the Eagle has a fine time playing the Head Teacher of the Junior High School graduates. There are some nice in-jokes, such as the occasion when Sam the Eagle associates money-making with the Americans, but abruptly changes his line of dialogue when reminded he is acting in a British classic; now it's the Brits who are guilty. One of the shops seen in the final sequence where Scrooge bestows gifts to all is called Micklewhite's - a direct reference to Caine's real name.

Scrooge is mean, cold and cheap but he is visited by some ghosts, yada yada, and God bless us, everyone!Anyway, the Muppets don't really do anything special with the story so this one just blends in with all the other Christmas Carols.

What makes the film appealing, however, is the presence of Michael Caine, who gives a surprisingly good performance against a bunch of puppets.Also of note, and sadly lacking in most movies aimed at kids these days, is the presence of some truly spooky and scary moments. The spirit of Christmas future, for instance, wouldn't look out of place riding on the back of a fell beast in the Return of the King!All in all the movie is harmless fun for kids of all ages.

While it is not utterly creative to start another adaption of the Dickens novel and nobody would've really missed it, it still includes a lot of intelligent humor that makes the time fly by and enough fluffy puppets to get the audience emotionally involved. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of the singing parts, but on the other hand those belong to all of the older Disney movies as well and therefor will add a touch of nostalgia for all the Disney fans out there.All in all this is great for people with children or fans of the Muppets.

I love whatever they do. I love Treasue island, the jewel thief one and others. I think my favorite would have to be The Christmas carol though. Michael Caine does very well(of course he does he's Michael Caine) as Scrooge. I will not go into the story plot with you. We have seen at least one out of the billion adaptations. There is a fantastic one in theatres as we speak. You must see that one. Anyways, back to the Muppet's. In a lot of Muppet's movies, they at least have one famous actor. There's in this one is Michael Caine. Caine does such a good job in everything he's in. We should all know that. The Muppet's are incredibly funny. All of the characters are. I think I like Kermit the most. Quit the heckling. I think Kermit is annoying. You have such a good time with this movie. The songs in it, surprisingly, are good. I ain't into musicals, this isn't really one, but they do well here. Caine is convincing, as are the Muppets. This isn't the best of the Christmas carol adaptations. But it is a good one. There have been a hundred adaptations of A Christmas carol. Though The Muppets isn't the best, it is one of them. I give it a high rating because I love The Muppets and because I laugh a lot during this film. I like how,besides Scroge and his nephew and his friends, everyone in the town was a Muppet. The Muppets Chirstmas carol is a good film. No doubting that. And perhaps one of my favorite Christmas films.",

            "content": "This seems like a funny time of year to be watching a Christmas movie. As I write this, it's been over two months since the holiday last came around, winter is almost over, and the other three seasons will come and go before Christmas comes again. However, I didn't watch \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" because it's a Christmas movie. I watched it because it's the Muppets. I remember seeing at least some of this fourth silver screen Muppet movie, the first one made after the tragic death of creator Jim Henson, as a kid in the early '90s, but couldn't remember much of it at all. It was definitely well over ten years, probably over fifteen years, since I had last seen any of it before finally watching it all this month. Even out of season, it was still a good viewing.There are many celluloid versions of \"A Christmas Carol\", the famous story written by popular 19th century author Charles Dickens, but this one features the Muppets in the story. Gonzo plays Dickens himself and is the one who tells the story here, with Rizzo the Rat as his sidekick. The story is about greedy, selfish, mean-spirited businessman Ebenezer Scrooge in 19th century London, England who has a bad reputation in this city! It's Christmas Eve, and Scrooge does not believe in this holiday season, so one of his employees, Bob Cratchit (in the form of Kermit the Frog), has to tell him that the place won't get any business on Christmas Day in order to get the day off. After Scrooge arrives back home that night, before he goes to bed, he is soon haunted by the ghosts of Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf), his late former business partners who were a lot like him and are now shackled in the afterlife because of it! They tell him that he will suffer the same fate unless he changes his ways, and also tell him of three spirits who will come into Scrooge's bedroom late that night!This 1992 theatrical Muppet film is visually impressive with its cinematography, filming locations/sets, and special effects. Some of this shows right from the beginning, with overhead camera shots of what is supposed to be 19th century London here. Since it's the Muppets, one would likely expect a lot of laughs in this movie, and there certainly are those. A lot of them come from the Gonzo and Rizzo scenes. I think these two characters usually are funny, and there's no exception here, with their usual antics and many things that happen to them during the telling of the story. It was also a great idea to have Statler and Waldorf as the Marley Brothers. Even though Jim Henson wasn't around to take part in this film, and several Muppet voices had to be replaced after his death, the famous puppets still stand out as their lovable, funny selves here. They help carry the film, as usual. While Muppets are used for many of the characters in the story, some of the characters are played by on screen actors, including Scrooge, played by acting veteran Michael Caine. His performance as one of the many actors to portray the character in film history is definitely another highlight of \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\". As well as being funny, the movie also eventually becomes touching, and not all the scenes are for laughs.This Muppet version of \"A Christmas Carol\" says at the beginning that it's dedicated to the memory of Henson and Richard Hunt, another puppeteer who worked as a Muppet performer and whose life had also sadly come to a premature end by the time this movie was filmed and released. Henson had been deceased for over 2 \u00bd years by the time \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" came into theatres during the Christmas season of 1992, but they still managed to make another good film with the characters, and watching it this month made me feel like it honoured Henson, unlike the third theatrical Muppet movie made after his sad passing, the very disappointingly dreary \"Muppets From Space\". Some of the songs in this musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' book might be a LITTLE weak (though they're mostly pretty good, even if they're generally not classic), I didn't really care much for the version of the Spirit of Christmas Past here, and there may be other minor flaws, but all the positive aspects of the film make up for this, and make this holiday film an entertaining one for probably all ages.",

It is, of course the classic Charles Dickens tale told using the inimitable style of the Muppets. My thoughts later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please go & buy the biggest goose you can find while I write the next paragraph).This is the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a mean businessman who treats his staff very badly and is mean to everyone, even his own family. One Christmas Eve he is visited by the ghosts of his old partners, the Marley's. They warn him that he will be visited by three ghosts that night and urge him to change is ways or he will end up like them, in chains for all eternity. The Ghost of Christmas Past visits him first and he is taken back to his childhood to see the boy, and the young man, he was and he began to see what could have been. Next comes the Ghost of Christmas Present and he is taken to see his employee, Bob Cratchit and his family. One of Bob's sons, Tiny Tim is crippled, but has great spirit and this touches Scrooge deeply. Finally the Ghost of Christmas Future visits Scrooge and shows him what future awaits him if he doesn't change his ways. Will he take heed of the ghosts? Well, if you don't know I guess I'd better not spoil it for you.It's a pretty well made film with lots of comic moments thrown in courtesy of Gonzo the Great (as Charles Dickens), the narrator, and his sidekick, Rizzo the Rat. There are plenty of songs along the way too, these didn't do much for me, but I guess they have their place. I thought Michael Caine was excellent as Ebenezer Scrooge, but please don't sing on film again Mr Caine, it's not your best talent I'm afraid.Over all, a very engaging film with lots of familiar characters, some great comedy and a pretty decent Scrooge. It's not the best Christmas film ever made, but it is pretty entertaining and I enjoyed seeing the Muppets again! I liked the fact that they didn't stray too far from Dickens original story too, and so, recommended (but mostly for younger viewers).My score: 7.4/10",

            "content": "This movie gave Caine credence with a whole new market audience - the child / family one. Prior to this, Caine's movies weren't exactly family orientated, at least not for an age group below five, so this is a welcome addition. The 'story' needs no introduction, and as well as being a Christmas classic, has also been remade and redone countless times for the cinema. What will remain unique about this version without doubt are the muppets. I think the muppets still work well, despite advances Hollywood continues to make in terms of animation and new technology. There's just something unique about them and therefore they don't even fall between the two stools of Pixar and the classic Disney style. The muppets will forever remain timeless and a source of fixation for young children, essentially because the cleverness is having them appear in scenes opposite real life actors which gives them credibility and clout. So, what of this movie? Well, Caine is sufficiently nasty and cold hearted as bad old Ebeneezer, perhaps not as menacing as Jack Carter but distinctly unpleasant nevertheless. Caine himself has said in the past that the scripts that interest him the most are when the main character undergoes a huge change, so in that respect he wouldn't get a better one than this. Caine skilfully displays the changes needed, and he is a joy to watch. Unlike most Scrooges, Caine's post-ghost Scrooge is actually more convincing than the original, and his happiness in the final scenes of the movie are heart warming, and yes, he even tries his hand at singing, surely a first. There is also a delightful in-joke, as when Caine / Scrooge makes his way to Bob Cratchit's house on Christmas Day, he passes a shop called 'Micklewhites', which, was, of course, his original surname. Two final things I must share here. I recall when this was first shown on terrestrial television, the Radio Times movie review summed up its piece by using the phrase 'Caine hasn't been this good in ages'. Well, perhaps I am na\u00efve, but nearly twenty years later it was shown on television on Christmas Day and once again I came across the exact same review. I know I shouldn't really expect resident publication film critics to come up with different reviews time and again for movies that are on all the time (The Mummy anyone?), but it really did make me gasp. Well, I did say I was na\u00efve. Oh, and now for the second piece of sacrilege. It's Miss Piggy. Is it just me, or is anyone else irritated by this character? I nearly said 'her' but that would be falling into the trap. I'm talking about the countless times this 'creature' appears on chat shows and the audience and fellow guests whoop in faux delight, regularly claiming to be in the presence of a superstar. Er\u0085no. You're not. She / it is a puppet (ok, muppet). It isn't real! Get over it, and stop this ridiculous myth. I feel the same way about Dame Edna Everage (get over it, it's a bloke dressed up in womens clothes) and don't seem to find anyone prepared to share the same view.",

The title is a good indication of what viewers can expect from \"The Muppet Christmas Carol.\" Michael Caine is old miser Scrooge, who plays straight to a cast of everyone's favorite critters including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, and the rest of the gang. He's visited by three angels on Christmas Eve who teach him the importance of the holiday and showing good will toward men.\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" isn't a bad movie. It's just another unnecessary re-telling of a classic Christmas tale. The concept of adapting Charles Dickens' short story and adding wacky characters or updating it was already played out even in 1992. I'm sure children will find it amusing, but their parents will be catching a quick nap amongst the tiny laughter.Michael Caine is absolutely perfect in the role of Scrooge. He pours his heart and soul into it. The fact that he is surrounded by Jim Henson's hand puppets doesn't affect his performance at all. As far as Caine's concerned, he's starring in a version of the famous tale surrounded by other Oscar-winning actors.The film provides good clean family entertainment for everyone.

The humour was light and didn't take away from the story,which is a welcome change from space or treasure were the muppets are just too loud and crasy. Gonzo was at his best in that film and look more like the gonzo we love from the tv show than the moaning Alien (Horible idea that was to tell the world gonzo was an alien it was better when nobody knew what he was) you see in Muppets from Space.Ignore the other muppets film just watch this one.",

I mean, there are Muppets around the edges of this film, but Scrooge is not a Muppet, and only Jacob Marley is a Muppet. I have no idea what the Ghost of Christmas Past was, though.It is basically the plot of the Charles Dickens novel. Grumpy man is visited by ghosts that show him what a horrible man he is. He is horrified that he is a ghastly human being so on Christmas he changes into a very caring man giving everyone presents. Oh, by the way, Gonzo and Rizzle the Rat are narrating the movie and travel with Ebenezer Scrooge.Overall, this is a nice little cute version of a Christmas Carol. Also, I would like to point out that the Ghost of Christmas Past is unbelievably creepy, even more creepier than the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come. Also, Scrooge's appearance in this film is a good scene, with good music and good atmosphere. I thought this was supposed to be a musical, but there are only two or three songs in this movie. Either way, this is a good film.7/10Recommended Films: Scrooge.",

            "content": "I am a big Muppet fan. One of my hobbies is collecting anything and everything that is Muppet, at least relating to \"The Muppet Show\". Naturally, I've seen all the mainstream Muppet films, and it's difficult for me to determine which one of them is the best. However, if \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is not the best of the movies, it at least comes in second or third.There are so many things I like about \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" I really don't know where to start. For starters, I found from actually sitting down and reading Charles Dickens' story that this movie stays more true to the original book than other adaptations. Other movies, for instance, make the mistake of naming the last ghost to visit Scrooge \"The Ghost of Christmas Future\", when it's actually \"The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come\". Other versions completely skip over Scrooge's nephew's \"has done me good and will do me good\" speech. Although this Muppet version did take its own artistic liberties with the story, and didn't reenact Dickens' story word for word, they still did a really good job telling the story.Another thing I liked is that the makers of this movie didn't worry about making the film too sad or too scary for kids. I found from watching the movie at the age of 26 that these parts which were sometimes very sad added some real depth to the movie overall. I still can't help but cry during the scene when a young Scrooge finally loses Belle, and she sings \"The Love Is Gone\" (a song, by the way, that was originally cut out of the theatrical version back in 1992, but was thankfully re-added in the video release a year later). The scene with Robin as Tiny Tim singing \"Bless Us All\" is also very touching.Not only does this movie stand as one of the best Muppet movies made so far, but Michael Caine in this performance alone plays at least one of the Top 5 best Ebenezer Scrooge's in film history. This is significant too, especially since a number of great actors have made a name for themselves for portraying Scrooge long before 1992. I haven't seen every version of \"A Christmas Carol\", and probably never will, but Caine made a very convincing, and human, Scrooge. When he was mean, he was mean! When he was transformed by his dream experiences in the end, he really came off as genuine and believable, which is probably not easy to do when acting alongside puppets.There's so much else that's great about this film. Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat made great narrators, providing comic relief to prevent the movie from being too serious. The special effects were amazing, especially the Ghost of Christmas Past who looked like a living Monet painting. And most of all, Jim Henson would have really been proud of this film. There must of been a lot of pressure for the Jim Henson company to make this film great, especially since it was the first Muppet movie made after Henson's unfortunate death two years earlier. Fortunately, even sixteen years after the film's release, it still stands as a perennial favorite alongside all the other Christmas movies and TV specials played annually on TV. It's a great film, I still love watching it again and again, and I recommend it to anyone.",

It wasn't until a few years ago I watched this in full whilst staying with my family for Christmas and I found it funny in parts if moving towards the end when Tiny Tim passes away in the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come's vision. Upon watching this today, I got more out if it than I'd ever done before because I picked out bits that were faithful to the original novel as well as some fourth wall jokes from Gonzo as Charles Dickens and Rizzo.The puppetry is mostly smooth if some of the movements are jerky but Michael Caine played a convincing Scrooge. While a lot of the dialogue stayed true to the book (which I read an abridged version of), it had elements of typical Muppet humour and the cameos from Animal and Swedish Chef were absolutely hilarious as was the 'Heatwave' performance in Scrooge's workplace and the part where Dickens lights Rizzo's tail by mistake. The first song is the most memorable. While the rest were initially forgettable, they were pleasant enough with a touch of festive spirit. The whimsical if somewhat generic incidental music had its Christmassy charms as well and the voice acting for the Muppets stayed in line with that from the original Muppet Show despite Kermit's voice actor having changed. Gonzo was perfect as Dickens to narrate the story while Kermit and Miss Piggy provided top-notch support as Bob and Emily Cratchit respectively.All in all this is one of three of my favourite adaptations of the classic Dickens novel, the other two being 'Mickey's Christmas Carol' and the version starring Jim Carrey that has a similar design to 'The Polar Express' and it's still a joy to watch over Christmas. 9/10.",

It was hugely successful at the box office and on home video; largely due to having the clout of Disney behind it. Back in the day when I had Disney VHS tapes there was often a trailer for this \"coming soon to Home Video\".Michael Caine for some reason was seen as a weird choice for Scrooge, maybe because he was best known for playing comedic nice guys in the 80s. His playboy roles (Alfie, The Italian Job) and the tough guy (Get Carter, The Eagle Has Landed) were also a recent memory for viewers in 1992. He turned out to be an inspired choice for the role turning in an incredibly charismatic, but also in places scarily mean character. The songs in this film are good and memorable. There's some genuine laughs for people of all ages: \"light the lamp, not the rat\". The sets and costumes are also first rate. The ghosts in this are also surprisingly frightening for a kid's film.This film is now regarded as a classic with a cult following. Its legacy long lasting and it gets a cinema re-release every few years. After having praised this film it has to be said sitting in a sweaty theater with 30 and 40-somethings singing along to the songs at high volume, possibly even dressed-up as muppets is my personal vision of hell on earth.

Their goal is to show the progression of events in his life that led to his current sour outlook on the world, how it is for the other citizens in whom he has little interest (unless they owe him money), and the possible outcome should he continue on his path.This was noted as the first Muppet film to be released after Jim Henson's death in 1990, and the last for Muppeteer Richard Hunt. The first Muppet film to be released under Disney and the first since The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984). While it does take a lot of elements from the source material, the makers of this wanted it to be centered in the Muppet Universe, with characters like Kermit the Frog (as Bob Cratchit), Miss Piggy (Mrs. Cratchit), Robin the Frog as Tiny Tim, Fozzie Bear (Fuzziwig, or Fozziwig), Gonzo as storyteller Charles Dickens, and his rodent pal Rizzo the Rat, who narrate the story and even are considered part of the story as well. There are still humans in this, including Ebenezer Scrooge, and other Muppet characters including Stater and Waldorf as Jacob Marley, as well Three Ghosts that are one-shot Muppet characters.This along with Mickey's Christmas Carol are the earliest versions of A Christmas Carol I ever saw and perhaps watched them more than any of the live action versions, but the thing is, these two films are still part of me since I grew up with them, and I thought Disney and the Muppets made such great retellings and just as timeless as the source material.However, despite the zany amount of humor coming from the Muppets, with fourth breaking and occasional pop culture references, the appeal of the story, and its tale of redemption, are still solidly punched across. Screenwriter Jerry Juhl keeps a fair amount of the poetry of Dickens' words intact, while also including some great moments for Muppets fans. And Paul Williams composed a variety of songs that are both catchy and poignant. Overall, another adaptation of the Dickens' tale that really connects with people and the Christmas spirit, and the most child-friendly since Mickey's Christmas Carol.8/10.",

I was impressed with the creativity in representing the spirits of Christmas using muppets. Most of the other muppet characters are not very different from other muppet movies.

I don't just mean the Characters I also mean giving the side Biblical Stories a Comedic take. Now I kind if don't mind a Fresh Comedic Take in the Christmas Carol it's just that I felt that it was over the top too Much. I found that CGI itself was Serviceable at Best. And there is one of if not the Worst Scene for me which is the Patriotic Scene during one of the Visits to Scrooges Past. And for me a large part of the Final Act was really Forget Able.

            "content": "Jim Henson's ever irresistible Muppets takes on the famous Charles Dickens \"Christmas\" classic, with genuinely pleasing results. The story, as everyone probably knows by now, centers on one Ebenezer Scrooge, a greedy and mean-spirited moneylender who thinks only of money and can only respond to Christmas with \"bah, humbug!\" On Christmas Eve, he receives an unexpected visit from his deceased business partners, who warn him that three spirits will transport him to his past, present, and future. Grudgingly, Scrooge goes along with the spirits, and eventually realizes that his selfish acts will provide not only drastic consequences for himself, but for the welfare of his long-suffering clerk, Bob Cratchit, and his sickly son, Tiny Tim.The film follows the original tale faithfully, and more importantly, keeps most of the dark, sometimes dreary tone of Dickens' tale. Since the story has its share of heartbreaking moments, it is surprising that this movie, skillfully directed by Brian Henson, manages to handle them in a very emotional way without coming across as forced or out of place. Scenes such as Scrooge witnessing the departure of his former love Belle and an even more devastating sequence where the Cratchit family mourns the loss of their beloved, frail son (keep in mind that this is only a vision) all manage to tug at the right heartstrings effectively.Naturally, the Muppets do sneak in ways to provide a bit of humor in various places, but in an adaptation like this, it is most welcome. Actually, most of the laughs come from the Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens, who narrates the story to a skeptical Rizzo Rat as the latter questions about whether the \"scary stuff\" is appropriate for children. \"That's all right, this is culture,\" explains Gonzo, er, Dickens, respectively.It is a treat to see Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy as the Cratchits and even more amusing to see those old tycoons Statler and Waldorf as the ghosts of Scrooge's deceased business partners, but the whole weight of the movie rests on the performance of Michael Caine as Mr. \"Bah Humbug\" himself. He plays the role flawlessly, somehow managing to blend in with his Muppet and human co-stars. Also noteworthy are the creation of the spirits themselves: Christmas Past is a ghostly-like child, Present is a jolly, Santa Claus like giant, while Future is a dark-robed, faceless figure who is made all the more scary by the fact that he is mute. Paul Williams' musical numbers are also very sprightly and infectiously catchy, well-suited to both the spirit of Christmas and the story itself.All in all, THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL is great family entertainment, but even adults may find a lot to enjoy too.",

The iconic roles of the book are mostly filled by Muppets(Kermit as Bob Cratchit, Ms. Piggy as his wife, etc.)but Scrooge himself is portrayed rather well by Michael Cane. You should be well aware of the story of A Christmas Carol by now, a man is viewed as a miserable, greedy miser and is visited by three ghosts who show him his past, present and future. Little by little he becomes a better man through these visions and ultimately turns his life around for the better. The same applies for this movie. Only there's a lot of humor you'll find in a Muppet movie. Fourth wall jokes, slapstick, the usual brand of Muppet style. But some of the dialog is actually taken from the original book, and the themes of redemption and good will toward men are still present. One thing that makes the movie a good adaption is that the three ghosts were originally created Muppets just for this movie. Being a Muppet movie there are a few songs in it but they're all done very well and don't seem to slow down the plot(at least for me).The Muppets really captured the tone of the original story for me and I really love this version.

Two years later, in December 1992, the Muppets released their newest theatrical movie, \"The Muppet Christmas Carol.\" This was the first Muppet production that was released after I was born, and I LOVE THIS FILM! This is a wonderful movie! The Muppets keep up their tradition of having so much heart, charm, and spirit in their Christmas special. It's also a fantastic tribute to Jim Henson and his fellow puppeteer Richard Hunt. Richard Hunt performed such characters as Scooter, Janice, Beaker, Statler, Sweetums, and Gladys the Cow and the Two-Headed Monster on \"Sesame Street.\"...But I digress.This movie accurately tells the story of \"A Christmas Carol.\" There are some changes here and there, but they don't sugar code the story that much. It's a very good adaption, and a very good way to introduce the story to kids. Kermit is Bob Cratchit, Piggy is his wife Emily, Fozzie is Fozziwig, Gonzo is our narrator Charles Dickins, Rizzo is himself, Statler and Waldorf (now performed by Jerry Nelson and Dave Golez) are Jacob and Robert Marley, and our Ebenezer Scrooge is portrayed by Michael Caine.To be honest, this is one of the weird things about this movie. In this Muppet movie, Ebenezer Scrooge, the story's main character, is played by real human Michael Caine. In past Muppet movies, there was always a human cast, but the focus was on the Muppets. Here, the Muppets share the spotlight with Michael Caine. It makes sense when you think about it - after all, which Muppet could actually play Ebenezer Scrooge? - but it's still weird thinking that our main star is not a Muppet. Maybe it's just me, but it's just kinda weird.A lot of our favorite, lovable characters aren't shown here a lot like they are in other films, like Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem (they're seen, but Animal's the only one who speaks), The Swedish Chef, Scooter, and Sweetums. The reason is obviously due to the passing of Jim Henson and Richard Hunt. In these days, the producers made the decision to not have the characters speak in honor of our late Muppet performers. I actually thought that was a nice idea.This is one of the first movies ever I have the earliest memory of watching. This film has a special place in my heart because it is THE Christmas movie for me and my family; we do not let the Christmas season pass without watching this movie. But even by emotionally detaching myself away from this movie, it's still a really good film. The songs are great, the comedy is good, and you're even pulled into the drama. If you're curious to see how the Muppets take on the great Christmas classic piece of literature, take a look at this movie. You won't be disappointed! BOOYIKA!",

If you're a fan of Dickens' writing, you'll like the way that much of the dialogue is lifted from his original novel and yet can still be understood by the audience, whatever their age. (Of course, Rizzo's literary observations don't hurt, either.) If you're into costumes you'll appreciate that the \"present\" cast are dressed in the typical 1840s Dickensian wardrobe, whereas in the Ghost of Christmas Past segment, the boy Scrooge wears Georgian clothing and the young man (who looks uncannily like a younger Michael Caine) dresses in Regency attire. And pretty much everybody can appreciate those wonderful Muppets.Although the tale of Ebeneezer Scrooge is well known as a simple Christmas parable, it's clear just how much work went into making this film really work - using Fozzie Bear as Fozziwig, for instance. I wonder if that's why the Hensons decided to make this particular story in the Muppet style. In the school scenes, the walls are covered in busts of Aristotle, Shakespeare and others, all made to look like Muppets. The fake snow looks better and adds more Christmas atmosphere than real snow ever could, and I like the darkness of Scrooge's office - if he was too mean to provide lighting, it would have looked like that.I do like the interaction between Gonzo and Rizzo - \"Should we be worried about the kids in the audience?\", \"No, this is culture\" - and the way they retreat from the scary Ghost of Christmas Future by hiding in the church. It surprises me - given the way that the Ghost of Christmas Present was designed - that nobody ever seems to have made a toy out of him.The inimitable Miss Piggy is a wonderful (and, dare I say it, borderline psycho) Mrs. Cratchit - it seems so right that she's enormous compared to Kermit, with all her curly blonde hair and her mob cap.One thing I was really sad to hear of is that some new DVD versions (I was watching my thirteen year old video) have cut the song When Love Is Gone. It may seem soppy to some, but I think it's an important bit of the story because it shows that Scrooge lost people he loved because he was so concerned with money.",

Sure, there may be some events that are a little scary for kids (the characters in the film mention this themselves), but it really is enjoyable nonetheless. I wouldn't say the scenes involving the Marley ghosts are too scary, but I've seen this movie countless times and have since not been scared in future viewings. I don't know if I have or haven't been, but that scene aside, there is nothing wrong with the movie. It has all the markings of your average Muppet movie (breaking the fourth wall, funny but corny jokes, etc) and I would recommend this to all. It was my childhood favorite but all ages can enjoy this.",

I absolutely loved the songs they sang because some were really funny but others made you feel sympathy for another character. I think they captured the character of Scroog very well and the acting from him was brilliant.

That being said, how does The Muppet Christmas Carol stand against the rest? Is it really that good? Sort of. There are some nice moments or rather moments that really feel like scenes from A Christmas Carol. However, there are also moments that feel off, mostly because many of the characters are Muppets. And to be honest, I don't think of the Muppets when I imagine a serious telling of A Christmas Carol. However, there is still a great amount of effort put into it to make it work. Many Muppet characters really come to life as characters we all know from the story and I personally think that Michael Caine does a good job at portraying Scrooge. If you want to be entertained by the Muppets because you lik ethe Muppets, you will be entertained. If you love A Christmas Carol and want to see a new version, you'll probably enjoy yourself. Is it made more for kids, yes, is that bad, not neccesarily. Unfortunately there are some bland moments and some characters like the Ghost of Christmas Past are so creepy that it's just distracting. If you want to have a nice christmas movie, go ahead and give it a watch, just accept that it's the Muppets so don't have any high expectations. Still, it's very Christmassy and if that's all you care about, you'll definitely enjoy yourself.",

            "content": "A Christmas Carol is a surprisingly difficult book to adapt on screen. Its story is familiar to all, making it hard to deliver in a fresh way. The structure is fairly repetitive, too, and Scrooge's character arc always comes across as too swift or unearned. Rendering the fairytale imagery of Dickens' language proves to be a challenge visually, and the subtext is too inherently blatant to be expressed creatively. So, why not make it a musical featuring the Muppets? Certainly an inspired choice, and while this version suffers from the above pitfalls of every adaptation, it reigns supreme amongst all other Christmas Carol films precisely due to its uniqueness. The Muppets add some necessary levity - no one could take this overdone story seriously by this stage anyway - and the absurdism of the concept alone holds interest throughout the welcomingly short runtime. Michael Caine's performance is the counter-balance here, being oddly genuine (and quite good indeed). The songs add next to little, though even the weaker tracks are charming and easily watchable. Goes without saying that all the puppetry and voice acting is stellar, with the sets also standing out as lovingly crafted. Largely does away with Dickens' social message, the extent of its presence being two mentions of \"workhouses\" and the sympathy built for Cratchit's family. Feels rushed at times, as though it were struggling to fit in all the essential beats of the novella; end of the Christmas Yet to Come section in particular gave a reaction of \"Oh, that's it then.\" Following sequence of Scrooge as a philanthropist is a joy to watch, however, and as a whole the film is too short and heartwarming to take any major issue with it. Doesn't exactly work as a Muppet movie or a Christmas Carol movie, yet I can't deny I was smiling throughout. (Except upon seeing the Ghost of Christmas Past - that's solid nightmare fuel.)",

            "content": "This is the first movie in what I consider the second trilogy of Muppet movies. The first trilogy consists of The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper and Muppets Take Manhattan. The second trilogy consists of The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island and Muppets From Space. What separates these trilogies has nothing to do with plots and such, as the movies don't really have much connection with each other, other than the fact that they of course contain the Muppets. What separates them is the fact that the first trilogy was made before the tragic death of the Muppet creator, Jim Henson, and the second was made afterward. Being the first movie made completely without Henson, and I really have to say, they handled it very well. The movie was directed by Jim Henson's son, Brian Henson, and he really filled his father's shoes well. They also had to use a new voice for Kermit the Frog, Jim Henson's most well known role, and also the other Muppets he voices. Taking over the role as Kermit was Steve Whitmire, who I believe did a fantastic job keeping the character alive.As the title suggests, the movie is yet another adaption of Charles Dickens' famous story A Christmas Carol. Various characters are portrayed by Muppets, while several characters are portrayed by actual actors, with the key role of Ebenezer Scrooge being played by the brilliant Michael Caine. He did a great job, and it's my favourite role of his. That's partly what makes this movie interesting\u0085 all Muppet movies before this one were all about the Muppet characters, with human characters in more supporting roles. This movie focuses on a human character, with Muppets in supporting roles (not counting Gonzo as Charles Dickens narrating the movie). Kermit the Frog plays Scrooge's kind hearted assistant, Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy plays his wife and Robin the Frog plays Tiny Tim.Part of what I love about this movie is how well they are able to keep the fun of the Muppets, yet still tell a heart-warming story of A Christmas Carol. There are scenes in the movie where I honestly get a little emotional\u0085 but I am a big sook with stuff like this! I think that this the effort put in by Caine contributed a great deal to the emotional side of the movie. I think, if played by another actor, the end result may not have been as good. That's not to say it's not a well made movie overall, it's great! I'd have to say, my favourite parts of the movie would have to be some of the songs. They're catchy, and I often find myself singing them. My favourite is probably Marley and Marley, performed by the characters Waldorf and Statler (both with different performers, due to the death of Henson and also Richard Hunt, who died in 1991).If you have children, or if you want to feel like a kid again, you must get this movie, as it is a must see, especially over the Christmas holidays (a time when it was shown each year for a while when I was little). The movie actually makes my Top 50, along with The Muppet Movie and Muppets Take Manhattan (and also Labyrinth, if you want more puppet fun). I've actually caught flack for having them on my list, but it really doesn't matter. I love the movie, and I make absolutely no apologies for it!",

            "content": "It is amazing to me, really. My wife and I, this evening, were looking up the 1966 film ALFIE with Michael Caine. I had never seen the film. But while looking it over, and being really amazed at the sheer number of films that the man has done, I clicked on one of my favorites: THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL.It was then that my jaw dropped. The overall rating is 6.9 -- something I consider close to 3.1 points shy of where this film belongs. There are not many 10s in my book of films. The Godfather, perhaps. Ben Hurr, might be there. And perhaps Patton. But in this list, most definitely, is this little gem.First of all, I am an old fan of the Muppets. From the old days of watching everyone from Steve Martin to Alice Cooper host THE MUPPET SHOW (nothing like the Muppet version of \"Welcome to my Nightmare\" I can assure you). The death of Mr. Henson was something that struck me fairly deeply, like a part of my childhood being ripped away.Brian Henson's word since has been spotty. Some of it has been good, some of it sub-par, but all of it worth seeing and enjoyable. But without a doubt, the peak performance has been with this beautiful rendition of a timeless classic. And lest I not get this across as I write this, let me say it now: there has never been (nor can I imagine in the future there will ever be) a better portrayal of the Charles Dickens's classic.The songs are perfect. The two best sung by Scrooge, one as a young man losing his first love, one as a grateful old man on Christmas morning telling us that if you wish to measure the worth of a man, you simply count his friends. But the rest are nothing short of spectacular: the ghost of Christmas present and his ditty about living life in the moment and appreciating every little thing; the song of having one more sleep until Christmas... all of them are unforgettable.The storytelling is superb. With the Great Gonzo playing the part of Charles Dickens himself, telling the story as it unfolds, and the part of Scrooge's old business partner, made into two partners so that the two old hecklers could do it together... perfection.But none of this really matters. None of it matters if the heart of the tale is gone. You can get all of the right people, all of the right gimmicks and still fail. Examples include that piece of cow dung that Bill Murray put out, SCROOGED. Believe me, this tale has been attempted a hundred times -- plays, movies... but none capture the magic of Dickens like this one. It has a heart as big as the story. And in the end, it captured mine. I watch this movie every year -- I get my family together, and we spend a night sharing stories about one other and remembering how much we mean to each other. And then we watch this simple telling of a perfect Christmas story... Thank you, Brian Henson. Thank you for reminding me what Christmas is.",

Every time Tiny Tim (Was Robin the Muppet name of the little frog?) gets sick at the end of the song I get a lump in my throat and start crying. And in the future scene when you realize Tim's dead you can't help crying.

Academy Award winner Michael Caine stars as Ebenezer Scrooge, a selfish miser who hates Christmas, and he is also a boss to Bob Cratchit (played by Kermit the Frog), who tells him tomorrow is Christmas morning. At one point, when Scrooge gets angry and shouts something funny, the rats (that are working for Scrooge along with Bob) begin to sing the \"The Island in the Sun\" song.One night, Scrooge gets haunted by the spirits of his partners, Jacob (played by Statler) and Robert (played by Waldorf) Marley, who both tell Scrooge that he will be haunted by three spirits. When Gonzo shouts \"EXPECT THE FIRST GHOST WHEN THE BELL TOLLS ONE!\", Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past (played by Waldo C. Graphic from \"The Jim Henson Hour\" and \"Muppet*vision 3-D\", AND PLEASE NOTE: this movie marks Waldo's very first big break into movie business just like all the other Muppets did). Scrooge is later visited by the Ghost of Christmas Present, who sings the song \"It Feels Like Christmas\". When the clock strikes twelve, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Future, or Yet to Come, and even both Gonzo and Rizzo can be unseen when the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is around. At Christmas Morning, Scrooge asks Bob to be his partner, Bean Bunny has brought in the turkey, and Tiny Tim (played by Robin the Frog) says, \"God bless us everyone.\"The Songs in this Muppet Movie are catchy. Also the gags and scenes are very funny and hilarious to me throughout this movie. For example, Rizzo shouts at Gonzo, \"Light the lamp, not the rat! Light the lamp, not the rat!\" Overall, I gave \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" a two thumbs up, when I laugh during watching this movie at the same time.

The final spirit scene could for sure have been scarier if they wanted it to, but they found a good balance.There are moments of humor, but never descending into slapstick goofiness. The narrating muppets contribute to a lot of the humor, but they pull away at the right moments.All of this, coupled with a great performance by Michail Caine give this movie just enough seriousness and soul to be memorable. Caine pulls off the pacing of Scrouge's transformation perfectly, and it felt natural (not forced).To nitpick, I didnt find the songs to really be all that memorable, but they were enjoyable I suppose (again, remember I am coming at this with no nostalgia bias). I also found the \"message\" of Christmas the film was trying to communicate get lost in a lot of non-specific, but nice sounding language - \"love\", \"hope\", \"giving thanks\". Felt like the script was going to great lengths to avoid the \"G\" word. But again, Im nitpicking.Great film, this one will be added to the shelf for our daughter to watch when she's older.",

Following this I was slightly sceptical about going to see another film, but \"A Muppets Christmas Carol\" saved me from my impending doom. The acting was flawless, the songs were infectious and the puppetry took my breath away. This is possibly one of the greatest films ever made and makes street fighter look like a pile of raw sewage. It's teachings on tolerance and labour finally opened my eyes to the life of a puppet struggling to survive in 18th century London, and taught me valuable lessons about the lives of ghosts whose job is to annoy people at Christmas. Overall, I feel this is an excellent piece of work and will hopefully stand the test of time along with other classics such as \"The Godfather\" and \"Creep\".",

It features stellar performances from both the human and Muppet cast, with Michael Caine playing Scrooge with delightful flair and the Muppet roles very well chosen. The jokes are fun enough to keep adults amused, and even the inevitable songs do not become annoying. The story manages to remain true to the source, suitably sad and macabre at times. Both Henson and Dickens would be proud of this movie. It should be watched by the family every Christmas.",

Don' t be afraid to watch this if you're a Dickens purist - I am, too.Michael Caine is as good a screen Scrooge as there's ever been - he said he tried to act with the Muppets as if he were acting with the RSC and that's how it comes across.Funny, moving, lively, heartwarming and very, very true to the spirit of its source, this is a quite wonderful film. The Muppets are great, of course, but even so, this is so much more than just another Muppet movie.",

They deal with death and human nature in a very moving way, the highlights..you can't pick a highlight, really, because of the 5-star performance turned in by Michael Caine as an exquisite Scrooge, whose change in personality through the film is nothing short of amazing to me. We have been spared too much of his singing, but the numbers everyone else does are of the moral yet humourous style we know and love the Muppets for. Made to make you cry and laugh in turn, with outstanding moments from all the Muppet cast, and the few supporting humans, such as Michael Caine and Steven Mackintosh, it may be a little Muppified  but it is a movie which would have made Jim proud.",

As a teacher I could always tell whether a book report on \"A Christmas Carol\" was based on reading the book or watching a video because the pupil would refer to the Marley Brothers. For those who don't know, in the book there was just the one.\nMichael Caine played the role of Ebenezer Scrooge. Michael Caine is one of the famous actors who were tax exiles. He was a tax exile for ten years and is \"worth\" an estimated \u00a358 million.A partial list of tax exiles is available on Wikipedia.\nWhat would Scrooge have said about taxes? \"Humbug\" probably.\nHowever, in the movie Scrooge also talks about his taxes going to fund the workhouses and the prisons. We no longer have workhouses (at the time of writing). Tax exiles and tax dodgers want the police to lock up criminals and the prisons to house them. They want other people to pay for the police and the prisons.\nArguments about poverty causing crime are irrelevant to them. After all, they are not poor.\nAnd if poor people die, Scrooge had an answer to that too. \"They'd better die then and decrease the surplus population.\" Half the Tory Party would probably agree with that sentiment, and the other half would refrain from saying it out loud.",

I think my favorite part of the movie is when Belle is singing goodbye to Ebenezer and Michael stands behind her and sings. At that point you know he understands what he has missed out on in life. I also enjoy his singing at the end. Anyway, get into the movie, let it move you and touch your emotions. Laugh and cry along with it.

Instead of raging his hatred of Christmas he remarks on it with keen sarcasm. Dickens uses humor and irony throughout his writings and I truly enjoyed seeing it brought out in this movie. Maybe making it more amazing is that Mr. Caine gives this performance opposite the whole troupe of The Muppets. I am also impressed with how much of the content of the original story is included with the most important passages remaining intact. The Ghost of Christmas past is so true to Dickens' description, more so than any other version I've seen. Also interesting is that this character is mostly computer generated in a world of puppets. The Ghost of Christmas Present is completely infectious with the spirit of Christmas and I love the way he expands to fill any space he inhabits and gets smaller to relate to Scrooge. I find all of the songs enjoyable and high quality, the production numbers entertaining. This movie is also the best of its kind showing Ebenezer truly in love with Belle and the sadness of their parting. The Muppets are matched well to Dickens' characters and the performers are at their very best in this film.I love the cast and production of the film starring Reginald Owen from 1938 and it sets the bar for all other movies to be judged by. Alastair Sim (1951)is the scariest Scrooge and the movie has a very dark quality. I love Albert Finney as Scrooge in the 1970 musical, and look forward to \"Thank You Very Much\" being sung as the they parade through the streets and dance on the coffin. George C. Scott gives the character pathos and shows how truly haunted Scrooge is, not only by the ghosts but by his own past, while his conversion is subtle and believable. I watch each one of them portray Dickens' most famous character every year during the holidays and, in my opinion, Caine is simply the best Scrooge ever.note: I purposely left Patrick Stewart's 1999 portrayal of Scrooge off the list, it doesn't rate being included among the greats.",

It's hard not to rate his performance in this film as he delivers a fantastic turn opposite what is essentially someone's hand covered in felt and foam. My one grumble, however, has been the removal of one of the songs from the DVDs and TV broadcasts more recently - When Scrooge is in the past and splits up with his partner. The song was very poignant and Caine's voice breaking as he fought back tears in the duet had me biting my fist and trying not to blub like a 5-year-old. It now just goes from her saying she's going to leave, doing so, then Rizzo crying. I luckily managed to pick up a VHS copy with the full film in so plan to burn that to DVD for this Christmas so I can fight the tears once more!!

The muppets are well cast in the roles they are given and it really does work.And I haven't even come on to Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge. There have been various portrayals of Scrooge and in my personal (albeit slightly biased) opinion Caine brings out what Scrooge from the book should be.
