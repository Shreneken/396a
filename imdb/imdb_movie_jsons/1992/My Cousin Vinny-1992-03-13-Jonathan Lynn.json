            "content": "\"My Cousin Vinny,\" along with the megahit \"Goodfellas,\" put Pesci on the map.  Of course, he's been in the Scorcese's previous hit \"Raging Bull,\" but didn't get a hell of a lot of recognition at the time.  Joe Pesci's character of Vincent LaGuardia Gambini is a landmark character in comedy history.  When his New Yauker street smarts collide with Southern hospitality--brilliant fish-out-of-water humor ensues! \nOf course, Pesci should've be given all the credit.  Marisa Tomei, who RIGHTFULLY won the Supporting Oscar for her excellent performance (please don't believe that urban myth about Jack Palance calling out the wrong name!!), is hilarious as Pesci's fiance with a foul mouth, a smart a**, the heaviest Brooklyn accent and an incredible expertise in automobiles.  This was also the movie that made Marisa a star, and a performance I commend to this day.What can I say?  This movie has some of the most priceless bits of comedy. One, of course, involves Pesci's pronunciation of the word \"youth\" which sounds like \"yute.\"  One underrated bit is the one where Pesci first meets his cousin's friend (Mitchell Whitfield) in the jail cell.  His cousin (Ralph Macchio) is asleep and Pesci suddenly pays the friend a visit.  He doesn't know Pesci is the lawyer, and assumes he's some guy who...wants to make him his b**ch.  The comic dialogue in that scene is so perfectly executed and I feel it's one of the funniest in the movie.  I'm not going to give away any more of the film's slick, intelligent humor--You have to see it for yourself!!!If you're in the mood for a smart, well-written, well-acted comedy that will have you on the floor--look no further!  \"My Cousin Vinny\" doesn't disappoint in any of those aspects.  This is a truly memorable piece of comedy, and though it was released in 1992, I'm sure comedy lovers will pay homage to this movie in the present day.My score:  8 (out of 10)",

            "content": "My Cousin Vinny is one of the most brilliant comedies ever produced. There is simply so much to love about this movie.First, this is not simply a slapstick comedy. Sure, there is some of that, including a few hilarious moments in the Alabama mud. But the dialogue in this film is terrifically funny. The writers were able to turn a courtroom script into an incredibly funny exchange of dialogue between lawyers, judges and witnesses. And the whole idea of an out-of-work hairdresser knowing about Positraction is simply brilliant.This dialogue is brilliant because of excellent performances by both Marisa Tomei and Joe Pesci. These two sell this whole load of nonsense so beautifully it should be mandatory viewing for first-year drama students. These two actors show how talented people can read practically anything and make it not only funny but wholly believable.Even all the side characters, from the judge to the D.A. to the defendants to the jury and witnesses are brilliantly played. Some of the exchanges between a local Alabama judge and a NYC poser lawyer would be completely ridiculous in anyone else's hands, but these people make it so real and so funny it's truly a thing of beauty.This is one of those rare films that I can watch over and over again for hours and not tire of it.10 out of 10 Barky",

            "content": "My Cousin Vinny (1992)**** (out of 4) Terrific comedy has two youths being arrested in Alabama for a crime they didn't commit but thankfully one of them has a cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci) who just happens to be a lawyer. The thick New York accent at first doesn't sit well with the South but soon his skills come out. A lot of people seem to forget that this picture did lukewarm business at the box office and had several negative reviews when it was first release. I enjoyed the movie at the time of its release but I didn't think it was anything overly great but this is a great example of how a movie just gets better with age. Today MY COUSIN VINNY is rightfully considered one of the best comedies of its time and the performances here are just downright classic and make the film so special. Of course you've got Pesci and that terrific line delivery that adds so many laughs. Just the way he's able be to over-the-top in some of his line delivery is just flawless and the chemistry he has with the supporting cast is where much of the heart of the film comes from. Fred Gwynne plays the tough Southern judge and gets one of the greatest roles in his career and he does a remarkable job with it. The back and forth between Pesci and Gwynne is just so perfect that it never grows old no matter how many times you see the film. Oscar-winner Marisa Tomei is flawless in her role as the girlfriend and we get great support from Ralph Macchio, Lane Smith, Bruce McGill and Austin Pendleton. The film has so many classic sequences that the long 118-minute running time flies by without any dry or slow moments. There's no question that the film contains some of the biggest laughs of the decade and it's also fair to call this thing a classic.",

            "content": "This was the best way for Joe Pesci to follow up GOODFELLAS and JFK.  Those two were ultra-serious roles for him and to forray into comedy was perfect. It was a perfect role, perfect timing and a perfect opportunity to show people that he could play something other than the heavy or the bad guy. MY COUSIN VINNY is really just a distant cousin of his character in Goodfellas anyway.  Just imagine one of the guys in Goodfellas that didn't want to follow in the footsteps of the rest of the gangsters and this is him. Vinny is a foul mouthed, sometime violent, insecure but smart man.  He went to law school but took six attempts before he passed the bar.  They are definitely similar characters.  The difference is that Goodfellas was a serious film with a funny side and My Cousin Vinny is an absolutely hilarious film with a somewhat serious side.What makes the film work as well as it does, is many things.  First of all you have the fish out of water scenario with Vinny and his fiancee Lisa, wearing leather jackets and cowboy boots down in the south where it seems everyone is wearing overalls and they hang out in establishments where their best selling feature is chicken and pool.You also have a great supporting cast that features Lane Smith as a very animated D.A. that has to hammer home every point to his jury like they were morons.  He says the word \"truth\" is a word that comes down from England where all of our ancestors come, and looking at him incredulously is some of the black jury members.  Fred Gwynne supplies some of the best comedy for the film with his constant badgering of Vinny.  Everything from his suit, to his enunciation of words like \"youts\", to his court room impropriety to his just plain dislike of him.  Gwynne and Pesci are so opposite as people. Gwynne being a giant of a man with a southern drawl and a long, virile face while Pesci is a short man with a distinct New Yawk slur and a pudgy, baby looking face.  They are complete opposites and much of the hilarity comes from their inability to see eye to eye on many things.It also has to said that Marisa Tomei is brilliant in this film.  There are people out there that try to demean her Oscar triumph that year because the favourite did not win like anticipated.  But her performance here is nothing short of Oscar worthy.  She is a gifted actress and her comedic timing in this film is bang on, or as she would say, \" dead on balls accurate. \"This is one of the funnier films to come out in the 90's and it is well worth seeing again.9 out of 10",

            "content": "This engaging and hilarious comedy from Clue director Jonathan Lynn, is an absolute delight from start to finish. The direction is top notch, and there is a fresh and irreverent screenplay. The film has plenty of priceless moments, the courtroom scenes were particularly strong, but the gag about Vinny being woken up by something everywhere he sleeps, and the argument about the dripping faucet were hilarious. Plus the ridiculous looking suit Vinny wears in one scene. The plot tells of two youths being accused of first degree murder, and here comes the film's ongoing joke, what is worse than being accused of murder? Why having Vincent Gambini as your lawyer of course! Moving on, there is lovely scenery and photography, but for me the best element of the film was the perfect performance of Joe Pesci as Vinny, a performance that ensures plenty of laughs whether in or out of the courtroom. Out of the supporting performances, Ralph Macchio and Fred Gwynne were both great, but Marissa Tomei was just wonderful here, sexy and feisty is what Tomei does best. I for one never doubted the innocence of the defendants, but the film's conclusion was so exceedingly clever, I felt completely satisfied at the end of the film. Although I didn't see this until recently, My Cousin Vinny is up there with Clue and Oscar as one of my all time favourite movies, that's how good it is. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Underrated.",
            "content": "Underrated. I won't belabor relating and describing the plot, because that's been recited nicely by numerous others. I'll simply return to my one word point. Underrated. Even though Marisa Tomei broke through and won Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards for her performance, an award she earned and much deserved, I still say underrated. This film really never got on the public's radar the way it should have, probably because there are no big-name actors featured as box office draw. Joe Pesci was as good as it gets that way. In 1991 he was the hottest name in the cast. But has Joes Pesci ever established himself as a leading man who could carry a movie by himself? I ask that in open-ended wonderment, and certainly not disparagingly. Just asking, is it fair, has it ever been fair, to expect Joe Pesci to carry a film?Regardless of Joe Pesci's latent starpower, this cast of players as assembled possessed remarkable chemistry in the performances they gave, not only in their interactions with one another, but also in the creation of a final product that excels way beyond the sum of its parts, beyond any of their individual levels of genius, certainly beyond anything that could ever have been reasonably expected of them. Competent though they may have been, these were not thespian heavyweights or comedic savants. You ever wonder why this singular performance 15+ years ago and counting remains Marisa Tomei's magnum opus? That might be one big reason why. The Germans have a word for this. It's called gestalt. My inclination is to give most of the credit for this winning final product to director Jonathan Lynn. It seems obviously to be his creation. Who else singularly deserves it? Along the way it would have been such a cheap trick and easy thing to surrender to the obvious, but Lynn didn't do it. This is a story built around stereotypes. New Yorkers. Ethnic Italian New Yorkers. Southerners. Small town southerners. Southern justice. Southern small town justice with New York Italians in the dock. It would have been so easy to traffic in those stereotypes, to over-the-top cash in on them, to submerge the movie in them and to exploit them for all they were worth. These people could have been made into cardboard cartoons of themselves. Surely the Englishman Lynn was thusly tempted, but it was a temptation he mainly resisted. Oh, almost obligatorily, he dances us over to that edge and gives us a big whiff of all that, but instead of jumping in and wallowing in the stereotypes, he deftly pulls it back and carries it all off and away in a new and different direction, indeed in an uplifting direction. Just as there are no cheap tricks in this movie, there are no cheap shots either. People are not ridiculed for who they are or where they are from. It rises above that. Lynn raises it above that. Yes, the regional differences that exist are juxtaposed. And yes, we get the fact that cultural differences divide these characters. But the beauty of it is that no one is treated unfairly. In fact, the viewer comes away with the feeling that these are all good people. Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei are given a broad canvas to create great humorous art, bouncing one, two, three liners or more off of each other, at the other's expense. It's the game they play with each other, the nature of their characters' relationship, and it's fun to watch. And this must be said: not only does Marisa give an exquisite performance, she is an utterly delightful feminine creature to watch here. As for the southerners, in not taking the bait to exploit the southerners as dumb hicks, Lynne actually captures part of the true but rarely portrayed essence of the south: polite gentility. Lane Smith embodies that essence. And Fred Gwynne? He practically steals the show, and would have were it not for Marisa Tomei.What has been going through Joe Pesci's and Marisa Tomei's heads for the last 15 years? What is wrong with their agents? These two needed a sequel. If not a sequel, then more film(s) together. The dynamic between them was too good to just be abandoned. We should have been treated to much more of them together.As a trial lawyer let me say that the portrayal of courtroom events, while certainly not perfect, is more than adequate and passable. One thing that is accurately captured is the fish-out-of-water experience of a city lawyer when subjected to trying a case in a far-flung rural county. This depicton conveys the essence of what that's like.This movie deserves more recognition. It is clever, funny, and fun. I recommend it. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and indulge yourself.",

Joe Pesci plays Vincent LaGuardia Gambini, a Brooklyn lawyer who is asked to defend his cousin and friend from a murder charge in Alabama. Marisa Tomei as Mona Lisa Vito, Vinny's girlfriend, deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, rare for a comedy to even be nominated for anything by AMPAS. I really liked Fred Gwynne as the no-nonsense Judge Chamberlain Haller, a great foil for Joe Pesci's laid back, easy going Brooklyn wise guy. Even his name, Chamberlain Haller, evokes seriousness. A lot of fun, especially the courtroom antics of Pesci. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "My Cousin Vinny if it does nothing else sets forth the proposition that it's a good thing to have a lawyer in the family. Can you imagine what a good defense attorney might have cost Ralph Macchio and Mitchell Whitfield if Pesci was not Macchio's cousin Vinny?Of course for a lot of the film that does not seem like a good idea because not only is Pesci a newly minted attorney, but he's a Brooklyn Italian trying a case among the good old boys in Alabama. The culture clash is shocking and Pesci can't seem to do anything, but irritate the judge Fred Gwynne with his manner and dress.These two 'youts' are in quite a jackpot. Driving through Beechum County, Alabama they stop at a convenience store and Macchio forgets to pay for some twinkies. When the cops stop them, they confess to the accidental burglary, but in fact the convenience store clerk had just been shot and killed by two other 'youts'. Macchio and Whitfield are arrested for murder and armed robbery.This very serious situation even while the audience never forgets how serious it is for the boys, the film concentrates on the culture clash between Joe Pesci and the residents of Beechum County from whom a jury will be chosen.Aiding and abetting Pesci is girlfriend Marisa Tomei, a beautician who has an encyclopedic knowledge of auto mechanics having been raised in a family of them. She also is a quick study on courtroom procedure and Alpha male that Pesci is, Tomei really does save him, especially during the trial itself. Not to mention the boys.So very few Oscars are given for comic performances and I think Marisa Tomei was as surprised as everyone else when she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. I'm sure she thought she was there to round out the field, but she won it and she's nothing short of brilliant, especially in her scenes in the courtroom.I would also take note of prosecutor Lane Smith, the down home southern lawyer who's used to winning and doesn't like being upstaged by a Yankee in his home town. My Cousin Vinny also was the farewell performance for Fred Gwynne who until this last role was best known as Herman Munster. He and Pesci play off each other beautifully.So if you've got an argumentative sort in your family, encourage him or her in the direction of the legal profession. My Cousin Vinny is the best argument I can make for that proposition.",

The rest of us will find at least some genuine funny moments. In my case, I found several. My Cousin Vinny is a movie that I will play to cheer me up because it's hard to feel down while watching it.Joe Pesci who scared the hell out of us as Tommy Devito in Goodfellas takes on the role of wise cracking, inexperienced attorney Vincent Gambini. He is wonderfully matched with the nagging, street smart, and charming Maria Tomei as his girlfriend Mona. The two hard core New Yorkers wind up in rural Alabama to defend Vincent's cousin (Ralph Macchio) and friend on robbery and murder charges. There are plenty of funny moments created from the culture clash between the \"yankees\" and the southerners ranging from the fascination with grits to the colorful colloquialisms used by each. Some of the best moments involve the exchanges between no non-sense Judge Haller (Fred Gwynne) and Vincent who he can't understand due to his New York accent. However, this film does not rely on stereotypical southern slapstick comedy. It is actually smart and there's a real plot involving a court case that all but looks clear cut until Vincent and his girlfriend begin looking at the evidence. I love all the court room scenes and Pesci and Tomei have great chemistry.This movie is truly underrated; although Tomei did earn an Academy Award for her role in this film.

Bill Gambini and Stanley Rothenstein are two NYU students who get scholarships at UCLA and decide to drive across America to get there. Bad idea. In Alabama they are picked up and arrested for murder and robbery. They are innocent, but there are witnesses who ID their car and ID them. And it is the word of two New Yorkers against the locals.Not having any money, Bill calls his cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci), who is a lawyer but hasn't practiced yet. And here the culture clash begins. Into this sleepy little Alabama town arrive Vinny and his girlfriend, dressed in leather with rather flashy but faux jewelry. The judge (Fred Gwynne) in the case demands that since this is a capital case that Vinny have trial experience. He does not, but knowing he is his cousin's best shot, he lies and just hopes the judge can't find that out until the trial is over.Well the Southerners don't get these New Yorkers (\"Two Yutes? What's a Yute?\"), and vice versa. Vinny and his girl are awakened by factory whistles at 5AM and don't understand why every meal has to include grits, to name a couple of the problems. And the judge is a stickler for decorum. The prosecutor invites Vinny to go deer hunting to discuss the case. As a longtime urban resident who thinks that meat comes from grocery stores not live animals, Marisa Tomei as Vinny's girlfriend is hilarious in her reaction.This is just a very good comedy with lots of light moments, and yet you wonder, how is Vinny going to debunk these people, who have nothing against the defendants, claiming they are the perps. Watch and find out. This is a rare lead role for Joe Pesci, and he is marvelous. Putting Gwynne and Pesci together was unexpected comic genius, and you'd never guess that Gwynne, with that Southern accent he is sporting, was somewhat raised in New York City. Marisa Tomei absolutely earned her Oscar as Vinny's mechanic whiz girlfriend. And the best thing is that neither the Southerners nor the New Yorkers come off as cartoonish. This film was made when both sides got along pretty well. I'd highly recommend it.",

This is one of my three all time favorite English language comedies along with \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\" and \"A Fish Called Wanda\". When I think of it, all three share the same concept - playing the differences between the cultures, mentalities, ways of living, talking, doing things, even cooking - Europeans versus Americans, particularly British and Americans or New Yorkers versus Southerners in My Cousin Vinny. They also have in common a flawless, witty script with all pieces falling into right place, all guns firing, all characters developed and interesting. As with Scoundrels and Wanda, performances in \"My Cousin Vinny\" are simply terrific. Joe Pesci as a lawyer with no legal experience from Brooklyn whose first case just happened to be defending two \"youtes\" in a first degree murder trial, and Marissa Tomei in the dresses that are so magnificently out of place in the muddy Wahzoo City, Alabama but so deliciously fit her like a glove, make one of the best screen couples ever but I like the supporting characters and small cameos, too. Everyone shines in this delightful comedy. I remember three witnesses for prosecution - grits loving Sam Tipton (Maury Chaykin), the guy with seven bushes (Raynor Scheine), and sweet Mrs. Riley who just may need a thicker pair of glasses. Austin Pendleton as a stuttering public attorney was hilarious. Fred Gwynne, sadly in his last performance as Judge Chamberlain Halle, made his every scene (each of which he shared with Pesci) the double delight. Ten years after the film was released, Film critic and historian Mick LaSalle wrote in his article, \"Half of what made Joe Pesci funny in this comedy was the stream of reactions of Gwynne, as the Southern Judge, a Great Dane to Joe Pesci's yapping terrier.\" The film made me root for Vinny, wishing him victory in his first case, and he won gloriously with the help of a lovely, lovely expert in the general automobile knowledge in this lovely, lovely comedy.",

They are one of the best on screen couples I have seen. They act like a old married couple. They just work so well together and have the right chemistry. They make me laugh more than anyone else in this picture, the scenes I particularly laugh the hardest at is when Vinny has been invited by the prosecuting attorney to go hunting and he doesn't know what to wear and Lisa goes into a tirade about the deer being shot and his brain lying on the floor and not caring what the \"son of a bitch\" who shot him was wearing. Another is when Vinny is trying to prepare for a case and she heaps on more pressure by talking about her biological clock, it is a lot more funny in the film and you should watch it for just those scenes alone.What I find entertaining about Vinny's character is that he is not a practised lawyer, he hasn't had any cases and doesn't really know what he is doing. He doesn't even know about disclosure till Lisa tells him. He also has to convince his cousin, the cousin's friend and the judge that he knows what he is doing. On top of this, he hasn't had a good night's sleep because it keeps getting interrupted by loud noises throughout the night, the judge doesn't like him and keeps putting him in jail for contempt, a local idiot who wants to fight him for $200 that he owes Vinny so there is a lot of factors working against him. You cheer for him when he starts to do the right things in court and will him on to find evidence that will prove his cousin and friend innocent of murder.I have to say one of the scenes that has me falling about laughing is the scene where there is a stuttering lawyer who is trying to do his opening statement but keeps stuttering through it and the jury's face is a picture and really it is their expressions I am laughing at.I like that the film is unpredictable. You don't know how it will be resolved, you are in a way in the same boat as Stan and Bill as you watched them leave the Sac o' suds without killing the clerk and you wonder who could have done it and how the witnesses are so convinced that Stan and Bill did it and at least at the end, you have a satisfying conclusion when you find out they have caught the bad guys in another state.It was good to see Ralph Macchio in something else other than The Karate Kid. I hardly recognised Fred Gwynne without the makeup of Herman Munster. He was such a treat especially when he couldn't understand what Vinny was saying when he said \"yutes\" and couldn't understand some of the other words Vinny said with his thick Brooklyn accent.10 for the actors, 10 for the directing and 10 for the writing which makes this film a joy to watch.",

I expected a light, breezy, entertaining comedy and that's what I got, although I do think that the running time was just a bit too much. It could've afforded to lose maybe 20 minutes there. Joe Pesci is very good, but seems to be playing the type of usual character he's so known for. As good as the film is, the biggest, most absolutely sure reason to watch it is for Marisa Tomei. Already know that it's an all-time worthy comedic performance, and we don't get those often. She manages to come across incredibly natural, while still being brassy and fun. She manages to make her character a real person and not just for show while hitting all of her notes perfectly.",

He is downright likeable, and so is Marisa Tomei, a sassy and stylish figurine who was amazingly superb to take home the Best Actress Oscar. Both Pesci and Tomei have the colorful wits and personalities to make a wild pair for themselves (almost like living in the 50s for sure!). Also, the movie's best moment arises when a freight train disturbs Pesci's sleep at five in the morning. The deep downside is the latter portion: a climatic courtroom scene that, while up to the point of interest, runs terribly long and weak....until one of the film's cast members gets into the act! Still, it's worth plenty of good gags and good laughs that aren't so bugging. Pesci would look terrific in a torn-up leather jacket in front of the judge, to his ultimate disgrace!

Bill accidentally pockets a can of tuna into his jacket and forgets to pay the clerk at the counter. As he and Stan are driving down the road, Bill realizes his mistake and tells Stan. Although both of them are somewhat concerned, they continue driving down the road. They are then stopped by the police and taken to the local police station. Figuring that honesty is the best policy, Bill makes a blanket confession. What he doesn't realize is that he has inadvertently pleaded guilty to the murder of the store clerk. When he realizes his mistake he panics and turns to a lawyer in the family-his cousin \"Vinny Gambini\" (Joe Pesci) who is only too happy to drive down from Brooklyn with his fianc\u00e9 \"Mona Lisa Vito\" (Marisa Tomei) to contest his very first trial. Ever. Anyway, rather than disclose the entire story I will just say that this is a film that is one of the best comedies of the modern era. I really enjoyed the performances of Joe Pesci and Fred Gwynne (\"Judge Chamberlain Haller\") as both of them were hilarious. In addition to that, Marisa Tomei also put on quite a show and ended up winning an Academy Award for her performance. Now, having said all of that, I must warn viewers that some of the language may not be suitable for younger audiences.

My Cousin Vinny turned into a very intelligent and great comedic story.It's about two boys who have been accused of murder, with a lot of pressing evidence against them that can get them executed, but one of the boy's cousins, Vinny, is a lawyer, well, just graduated and starting his first six weeks. Not to mention, he's never fought a trial or murder case. Vinny has also brought along his Brooklyn talking fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito. With little experience and getting into a web of lies, Vinny must learn that good arguing is not just what will help, but he also has to learn how to be a lawyer.Joe and Marissa absolutely steal the show. I think my favorite part was when Mona Lisa was on the stand talking about which cars were involved in the murder case, she just got into a fight with Vinny and she refuses to help him, but she does and he kisses her hand and you can tell they made up, but it's just their looks that are just plain priceless!

However, I would consider this to be Marisa Tomei's breakthrough movie.  She is excellent as Pesci's flamboyant girlfriend and totally deserved the Oscar she got for best supporting-actress in it.  Bill (Ralph Macchio) and his friend Stan (Mitchell Whitfield) are going to UCLA and decide to go through Alabama to get there. But they get arrested down there.  The only problem is that they don't have any money and don't know any lawyers.  But Bill learns that he has a lawyer in his family.  His cousin Vinny.  Now I don't want to spoil the fun of watching this movie for the first time so I won't tell you much about what happens but there are some classic scenes in this movie.  Great performances, great directing, and the funniest script ever are the three elements that make this one a sure winner for anyone who watches it. Everything in this movie is funny and yet, it's all helpful for Pesci. Jonathan Lynn May not be the most known director around and he may not have directed that many movies, but \"My cousin Vinny\" is a winner.  Marisa Tomei's costumes should have won the movie another Oscar for best costumes.

And ran into a problem. Part of the problem is how broad the word \"comedy\" has become. It can include for example a Romantic Comedy of the type was pretty much standard in the 1930s and 1940s. It can include the insanity of a Jackass movie. It can include fanboy films that are star-centric, like the Jerry Lewis films (I did review NUTTY PROFESSOR, but not as a comedy) or the mostly-junk they have produced around ex-SNL stars; it can include endless riffs of the same theme like the SCARY MOVIE series, it can be merely a crude attempt to jam as many names into the same film as possible, like trying to stuff co-eds into a phone booth (MAD MAD MAD WORLD) or it can be almost exclusively situational as opposed to character-driven, like the Bachelor Party series. And this is not an exhaustive list! Anyway, after a lot of diddling with the database, I kept coming back to this film as perhaps the purest iteration of the original 1930s screwball comedy. Simple story. Only one or two leads, with a good supporting cast (Fred Gwynne as the judge). A beginning, a middle and an end (I have written before about the many many film-makers who have forgotten this most basic fact about telling a story -- you need all three elements!). A breakout performance by a prior unknown, to take it up a notch (Tomei). And here we are folks, one of the best comedies of the era and arguably one of the best of all times. The fact the the other ratings don't see to agree only reinforces my argument -- we have over the years lost track of what is funny, and what is not.",

The movie itself is an interesting case in how an amazing coincidence could serve to screw over two basically innocent guys. It would seem at first to be basically a one joke comedy - take an Italian American and drop him into the deep South - but it's developed in an entertaining way and has some real heart and charm going for it - although it does go on a bit long.Pesci stars in the tailor-made role of Vinny Gambini, a so-called \"lawyer\" who needed six tries in order to pass the bar exam. He's thrust into the unlikely position of defending his college age cousin Bill (Ralph Macchio) when Bill and his buddy Stan (Mitchell Whitfield) are accused of murdering the clerk at a convenience store. With his fianc\u00e9e Mona Lisa Vito (a radiant Tomei) in tow, Vinny finds adjusting to life in the South - and adhering to the strict procedures of its courts - to be a struggle.Pesci and the Oscar winning Tomei are lots of fun to watch, and have fine chemistry with each other. They receive fine support from a well chosen bunch of actors. Macchio and Whitfield don't have much to do once Pesci enters the picture, but prove to be reasonably likable. (Macchios' character Bill, however, isn't too bright.) Top notch character actors Lane Smith (as the prosecutor), Austin Pendleton (as a stuttering public defender), Maury Chaykin, James Rebhorn, and Raynor Scheine (as witnesses), and Bruce McGill (as the sheriff) all do fine work. Fred Gwynne has some great moments as the stern, disapproving judge who doesn't care for Vinnys' way of doing things.Serious at times but never too, too serious, \"My Cousin Vinny\" knows how to end big, and send us away with smiles on our faces. It's worth noting that Jonathan Lynn, the director, is British, adding to the overall sense of the outsider perspective.Seven out of 10.",

            "content": "As they pass through Alabama, young Bill and Stan stop off at a garage where Bill accidentally steals a can of tuna. When they are arrested by the police they assume it is for this offence and confess to it \u0096 only to find themselves accused of murder in the same garage. Desperate for help, they are grateful when Bill's cousin Vinny comes to defend them. Having just passed the bar on his sixth attempt, Vinny is able to bluff his way into the court but his street-attitude and relaxed approach (not to mention bad luck) puts him on the wrong side of the judge from the very start; not a good thing in a case where everyone is pushing for the death penalty.If you are looking for a sassy little comedy that is sparky fun despite not amounting to much then this is a good a place as you could start as this film is a lot of fun and has stood up well over the ten years since its release. The basic plot is about a murder case but if you are coming to this film looking for a courtroom thriller then forget it because, although the plot is enjoyable it is pretty slight. However what it does do well is deliver a consistently funny tone as well as a good collection of laughs spread over the film. It won't have you rolling in the aisle but for me it did have me consistently amused and that is as good as a film that has a lot of hit and misses \u0096 the humour is nicely pitched and it was fun to watch. The script is well written and provides fun although some viewers will miss the highs of other comedies or will bemoan the fact that the film appears to lack energy and just roll along slowly.However a big reason it all works so well is the great delivery from a great cast. Pesci's career is a strange one of mostly support roles and here is one of his few leading roles and easily his best. He plays against his crazy Italian type well to reveal a more vulnerable character that creates a mood that suits the self-deprecating humour that asks us to find him funny but still like him. Of course, he comes very close to losing the film to Marisa Tomei who deserved her Oscar (and how much more of a surprise was it for a comedy role to win one of the main awards?). She is very funny in a clich\u00e9d role that she still manages to make feel fresh and witty \u0096 others have done similar Italian-American characters but made them annoying, she makes it funny and sassy. Macchio and Whitfield are OK but really they are just a plot device and they fill that role well enough. Gwynne is a delight; Lane Smith is well played; McGill is a familiar face and the various small town characters are all well played and convincing.Overall this is a fun film that may not across as high energy or having a hilariously funny script but it produces a consistently amusing tone with plenty of enjoyable sequences and has stood up very well over the past decade. Pesci plays it perfectly, Tomsei is wonderfully sassy and Gwynne's support makes the courtroom scenes even more fun.",

            "review_title": "A great courtroom comedy movie, in fact a great courtroom movie period",
            "content": "Two students are accused of murdering a store clerk in a small Alabama town. Being stereotypical New Yorkers, they react with all the worst clich\u00e9s about the South, fearing some lynching driven by an ancestral hatred against Yankees, making them even more stereotypical. One of them (Ralph Macchio) calls his Brooklyn lawyer cousin Vincent Gambini aka Vinny for help. Vinny (Joe Pesci) comes to the rescue along with his sexy and beautiful fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei).So we get the flashy city slickers dealing with the humbler but no less peculiar mentalities of a small Southern town. There's more, Vinny's also a small-time lawyer who passed the bar exam in extremis after a sixth attempt and kept chasing ambulances after. Vinny must make his bones and learn from scratch in a case where his cousin's life is at stakes, the judge doesn't seem to like him, so the pressure is big... and as patient and helpful as Lisa tries to be, she doesn't help when she kindly reminds him that she's also submitted to pressures of her own (on a biological level).A new viewer might get the feeling that the botched investigation and the trial are just excuses to generate stereotype-ridden laughs based on the fish-out-the-water element. But as you let the film grow on you, you realize it's actually the other way round.I actually believe the comedy is the starting point of a rigorous and insightful exploration of the subtleties of the legal system in general and Alabama in particular. It might be an open-and-shut case for an experienced lawyer but then there would be no movie; no, it's crucial to have a lawyer who still has to learn the ropes so we learn with him. When Mona Lisa tells him that he's got nothing to brag about getting files from the prosecutor since it's the latter's job, there would be a vice of form otherwise. It's funny but at least that won't be forgotten, not by Vinny, not by us. And that's one example.\"My Cousin Vinny\" shows how to deal with an expert witness, how to make a cross examination, how to create a reasonable doubt, how to psychologically handle witnesses and experts, but you know that comes rather late in the film and I guess watching the first part fills the first-time viewer with an urge to see Vinny taking off his amateur clothes and Mona Lisa Vito eventually shine and outshine everyone. But before, we've got to come through the two kids indirectly confessing their crime, thinking they've been caught for a non-paid tuna can, we get a series of running gags involving Vinny's impossibility to get a good nightsleep, his procedural interplays with Judge Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne) who takes his job so seriously he holds him in contempt because he can't even say \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" and many other subplots.So what we get in the first part is pure comedy routine. Yes, it's funny but in a predictable way. But director Jonathan Lynn who had a law degree insisted that the film would be the most accurate in its depiction of trial strategy, with its share of attacks and counter-attacks. He knows what he's doing and prepares us for a big finale. So we laugh with Joe Pesci being his usual loud and annoyingly raucous guy, Gwynne the 'straight man' whose facial reactions make for one good third of the laughs and we even get the lousy yet hilarious gag of a stuttering lawyer, (which still serves to make a point: never ask a witness a question if you're not prepared for the answer). By the time we get to the climax, the film at least reassures us that it didn't care much for stereotypes, they're downplayed to nihil, Vinny stops being a clown and accomplishes his job fairly decently, with growing confidence, using his street smarts and proving that he has the makings of a great lawyer. Pesci is truly given one of his best roles for three reasons: he's the lead for once, he's as loud and foul-mouthed as his usual roles, but he's smart and he's a good guy who wants to do his job. And yet, that's not even the film's secret weapon, in a nutshell, it's a bombshell.Anyone who didn't see the film knows it earned Marisa Tomei an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and \"supporting\" is the word considering her man. But the way she saves the day at the end through her car expertise (pointed out early enough so it doesn't come down as a Deus Ex Machina) is brilliant, intelligent, insightful, funny and even romantic (Pesci and Tomei had quite a chemistry). And it's beautiful acting from Marisa Tomei whose reaction shots were already gold during the trial but look at her after she answers the trick question leaving the prosecutor, as deflated as a tire, the look she gives the judge was enough for the Oscar.The film was the third of 25 legal films voted the best by the American Bar Association, which says a lot about its accuracy. According to experts, it not only shows what they teach you in school but what they don't, which is where Vinny is the best, being wise, charming, funny but sharp and cutting when it comes to counterattack feeble testimonies, using mathematical precision and pure logic to turn eyewitnesses' own arguments against them, and teach the jury not to judge on appearances.And if there's anything to learn from that movie is not to judge on appearances. Indeed, behind seemingly hostile Southerners, there are decents folks doing their jobs and eager to cooperate, behind a loudmouthed crook-like New Yorker, there can be a great lawyer, behind a sexy gal dressed like Fran Fine, there's a car expert. And maybe behind a great courtoom comedy, there is one of the best films about... cars.",

It's a jarring experience.Lynn, being British, is severely critical of capital punishment and tosses in the occasional barb against it, although most viewers might not realise what he's up to.And Smith, McGill, and the ever welcome Chaykin do their bit - and as Lynn himself says, there are no real bad guys in this one: it's about a lot of people thinking they're doing the right thing - and about how screwed up things can get, about how innocent people can get convicted - and what having capital punishment therefore means in that context.The 'skits' are precious. The dripping tap, the biological clock, and Tomei's final foray before the end are such classics that people keep coming back to the movie to see these segments. The interplay between Pesci and Tomei is nothing short of fantastic.This movie is as close to perfect as it can be without really touching there. There is no '9.5' for the reviewer to give, and so because everyone on this project did such a top drawer job, they get the final '0.5' for pure effort and intentions alone.Normally the comments on the DVD version by the director are a total bore, but in this case they're a refreshing exception to that rule.The DVD is a definite keeper. You'll never tire of this one. Never. Beware of yutes.",

I get that reaction-this is one of Pesci's best roles and Tomei deservedly got an Oscar for it. Gwynne is also wonderful in his bickering with Pesci. Even Macchio manages turns in a performance that grounds the stakes of the trial. The cast is the best part of the film. But near perfect films like this are not just the cast.The script -besides being very, very funny-manages to finely tune the elements of the case, legal procedural to work as a comedy while being a compelling legal case in its own right. Not only that but the script is smartly observed on cultural clash between New Yorkers and Southerners without condescending to either (or equally). The trial story gets tied into the romance story and the fish out of water aspects in natural ways. No element of the script seems overcooked or in there just for laughs. I think a light re-write of the script could yield a competent court drama. Which is really something as this is a comedy.The direction is classical, unobtrusive. Lynn let's the cast and script stand on their own with any distracting flourishes. And the film moves at a great clip. Of course also got the great cast. Even after nearly 30 years this film is engaging and fresh. It is a very funny film but it is a little bit more than a mere laugh fest.",

Thankfully one of the youths has a cousin who's a lawyer Did I say thankfully ? I'm not a big fan of comedies since the premise usually over stays it's welcome by at least half an hour , but screenwriter Dale Launer has crafted a very funny , well paced script that succeeds because of the amount of obstacles for the characters . Lawyer Vincent Gambini is warned by the judge to get a suit , so he gets a suit only to find there's an obstacle in the way . Vincent stays at a hotel , but there's an obstacle in staying there . Every time a character the audience feels for looks like they're going to get a lucky break ( Vincent especially ) another obstacle appears barring their way . A superlative example of pacing a script . Launer has also written things that at first appear throwaway at the time like eating grits at a diner but then incorperates them into the plot later on . Not only that but Launer has written a script with gags that are both credible and funny , even the skit involving possible sexual abuse in prison ( They'd have to be one of course ) isn't as silly as it could have been The cast are pretty good too with Joe Pesci showing that he's just as good as a comedy leading man as he is at playing Italian American wiseguys . Let's see you in another movie sometime quick Joe . I'm not sure if Marisa Tomei really deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role here but if the choice was between her and Vanessa Redgrave I'm glad the Oscar voters made the choice . The only real problem with the casting is that it's impossible to believe the short middle aged Vincent would have a hot leggy girlfriend like Mona in real life . But maybe I'm just jealous ?",

Fred Gwynne, who played the old Alabama judge, was actually the best actor here. I recall first seeing him 40 years ago in the TV show, \"Car 54 Where Are You.\" Sadly, he died just a year after this film was released. There is something about Marisa Tomei that puts her near the top of my list of women I wouldn't mind being deserted with on a tropical island. In this film she is perfect in a part that could have been written for her. As the sassy \"unemployed hairdresser\", and former mechanic, her testimony for the defense proves the two boys could not have committed the murder. \"That's a bill$hit question. No one can answer that question.\" (The car did not have that type of engine until 1964.) I saw \"My Cousin Vinnny\" on a DVD my neighbor, Ron, loaned me. For a 10-yr-old movie, made long before DVD became a household word, the video transfer is very nice.

OK, let see that movie, especially as Oscars for comedy are not something spread. Yes, I never heard for this movie, you guessed.Well, another surprising thing was that this is almost 2 hours long, again not usual for comedy. And it was 2 hours of great fun most time. Kind of humor what I like + great performances by lead actors. Almost can discuss that her role was not supporting, since she was main female actress, but surely it was in fact supporting role, and screen time was not so big. It was hilarious in several cases, and surely deserves and even needs second watch to get it all completely.\nAs only weak part I found public defender's scenes - too long and repeating.Of course, the script is clever, with witty dialogs, and pace was just spot on most time.\nI can only recommend this, even for younger audience, for who early nineties, atmosphere of 80-es are not familiar .",

            "content": "A homicide; a sleepy southern town is rocked to its very core. The lives of two innocent guys accused of murder are now the line. If they loose their case, the death penalty is a near certainty. What to do when the stakes are so high? Who can you truly depend on? Well family of course. Thus starts My Cousin Vinny, a fish-out-of-water courthouse procedural that just may be the most objectively lean and enjoyable scripts to ever come out of early 90's Hollywood.When cousin Vinny (Pesci) shows up, he's clad head-to-toe in black leather; hardly the look of a newly minted lawyer. He sniffs around, as if simultaneously amused and horrified by rural Alabama's quaintness. His fianc\u00e9e Mona Lisa Vito (Tomei) snaps pictures on her pink Polaroid; equally beside herself though mostly she's concerned about the quality of the Chinese food. The two youts initially accused of murder are Stan Rothenstein (Whitfield) and Bill Gambini (Macchio), two New Yorkers initially taking in the American South in their '64 Buick Skylark. In desperation Bill suggests the duo turn to his cousin, a personal injury lawyer imbued with the \"Gambini\" flare for argument.At first glance, there is a lot to love about My Cousin Vinny. The film features a volatile mix of well recognized character actors including the boyish Ralph Macchio and the pitch-perfect casting of Fred Gwynne, Bruce McGill and Lane Smith as the judge, sheriff and prosecuting attorney respectively. Our two leads Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei are a revelation as two working-class urbanites struggling and failing to adapt to the inconveniences of loud sawmill whistles, rumbling trains and Alabama mud.Years after My Cousin Vinny's release, many have joked that Tomei's Supporting Actress win in 1993 was at best a fluke and at worst undeserved. Many have made the argument that her Lisa can be summed up as a floozy just south of Miss Adelaide only made useful because she comes from a line of grease-monkeys. Yet within the context of the script, Lisa isn't just a plot device but is arguably the strongest character in the film. She's haughty, high-maintenance and nagging for sure, yet her resourcefulness, wit and intelligence always shines through. Most people arguing about a leaky faucet do so with angry indignation yet come from her pitter-pat with Vinny, she's smart, concise, charismatic and even a little erotic. She's basically the whole package.None of this could be accomplished without a dead-on-balls script by Dale Launer whose previous scripts Ruthless People (1986) and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988) had a tailored affinity for good old- fashioned farce. My Cousin Vinny however is arguably Launer's best script to date. Every scene is the perfect balance between artfully disseminating information and tactfully piling on high and higher stakes all while being gut-bustingly hilarious. Most comedies would be so lucky to have a scene or two everyone knows and fondly remembers. My Cousin Vinny may just have to many to count.If there's one thing wrong with My Cousin Vinny it's in the directing. Don't get it twisted, director Jonathan Lynn isn't bad and gets the job done but one can't help but think the entire process as film is entirely reflexive. There's just nothing special about the film visually. It creaks and strains under the limitations of early 90's big studio film-making and fails to take advantage of its screenplay with similarly grappling camera-work. Much like the similar A Few Good Men (1992), My Cousin Vinny sadly looks and feels just a tiny bit dated.My Cousin Vinny is an incredibly tight and wondrously fun little tall-tale that does wonders with the dusty courtroom genre. Not a sour note is reached among the cast which all run away with their roles and what's more, they seem to be having a lot of fun doing their thing. If I ever taught a class on screen writing, I'd show My Cousin Vinny in the first week and celebrate it as a near-perfect example of good mainstream movie writing. After all, the film is already being used as a tool for young trial lawyers.",

It is certainly one of the best comedies ever made.Four years prior, Dale Launer was one of the writers credited with \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\"--another great comedy.

They call upon one defendant's cousin, Vinny Gambini (Joe Pesci)--a rookie lawyer--to save the day. Vinny brings his fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei) with him from New Jersey. It looks like the deck is stacked against the defendants. And Vinny only seems to irritate the strait-laced judge. But Vinny has a secret weapon--the Gambini family trait of being argumentative.This brilliantly written film allows Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei to deliver the performances of their careers. Their characters are so well developed and so likable. As the judge, Fred Gwynne also delivers a career-making performance. All of the acting is topnotch.There are a number of gags that run throughout the film, all of them hilarious.In my opinion, this is one of the top three comedies of the last fifty years.

It's really one of those overlooked gems because it seems so small in stature and on the surface looks like a lightweight comedy, but in actuality it is a comic masterpiece! Coming out in 1992, and starring the great Joe Pesci, fresh off his Oscar-winning performance in GOODFELLAS (in 1990) and another impressive performance in the decade's best film JFK (in 1991), MY COUSIN VINNY was the completion of a trifecta of great films for Mr. Pesci. Up until this point, Pesci had been strictly a supporting actor. But finally in VINNY, he was allowed to carry a movie all his own, and carry it he did! Pesci is 100% absolutely memorable as newly-crowned lawyer Vincent LaGuardia Gambini (as classic a character name as you'll ever hear!). Vincent is tasked to defend 2 young men (his cousin Billy and friend Stan, played respectively by THE KARATE KID's Ralph Macchio and Mitchell Whitfield) falsely accused of armed robbery and murder in a sleepy Alabama town.MY COUSIN VINNY is a sublime comedy. It doesn't try to be laugh out loud and throw a bunch of zingers at you like most comedies, yet for much of this film, I find myself laughing out loud again and again! The story, the situation, the characters are what bring it to life. In addition to Pesci's brilliant performance, we the viewer are treated to some exceptional supporting work by Best Supporting Actress Marisa Tomei (as Vinny's hot, smart girlfriend Mona Lisa Vito), Fred Gwynne (Herman Munster himself!) as Judge Haller and Lane Smith as DA Trotter. A great cast! Also the minimal characters are hilarious as well.Pesci really deserves much of the credit. He plays the fish-out-of-water role to perfection here. Vincent Gambini, while new at law and very green about a lot of the law, makes up for his lack of book knowledge with an amazing array of street smarts, guts, guile, and confidence. He's just so likable. Tomei was ironically ridiculed for winning her Oscar here, but she is terrific as well, although I do think the rest of the supporting cast, especially Gwynne as the judge, is great as well. I find Gwynne and Pesci's pairing to be the best of the film. The way they go at it is a wonder to behold.MY COUSIN VINNY is one of those flicks that you just can't stop watching because it is constant laughter throughout and the payoff is worth waiting for. Watching this lovable loser Vincent Gambini win in the end always makes me smile!",

            "content": "After getting accused of murder, a young Italian-American (Ralph Macchio) hires his hoodlum cousin Vinnie Gambini (Joe Pesci) to be his lawyer. With the help of his girlfriend (Marisa Tomei), the illegitimate lawyer goes up against the questionable justice of a small, southern town. Who will prevail? In one of Pesci's less violent roles, we see his more humorous side... and it's not bad. Still in something similar to his Italian mafia character (as seen in \"Goodfellas\" and other films), he mocks himself and the stereotype, wearing a leather jacket to court and pronouncing \"youths\" as \"youts\". For those who like a good satire of Jersey culture, this film is right up your alley.The story plays out in a predictable way, and that's not a bad thing -- the focus here is the humor, not complex plot. There are some funny subplots -- the $200 fight, for example -- but nothing too complex. Even the twists aren't anything out of the ordinary. But this is early 1990s humor, a time when 1980s simplicity and innocence spilled over into the next decade.The second time I watched this film, it was with my friend who also happens to be a law student. It was interesting to have her critique the plot on its legal merits, and explain which parts might or might not happen in real life. But, as with any court show or movie, you cannot really be too strict or you disrupt the flow and humor of the story.This film used to play regularly on cable television and probably still does. I think I caught it the first time on TBS. If it's on and you haven't seen it, check it out. Sure, some of the language will be bleeped out, but you don't need that to get the full effect of the story. Pesci, Macchio and Tomei in one film? When will we ever see that again?",

            "content": "Taking aside when it's edited down for its content and for time, this is really a neat movie to watch when it comes on TV, which- if you have cable- is pretty often. It's also one of the best vehicles for Joe Pesci that was ever made (even if it didn't technically originate with him), and will probably make for part of his great standing as an actor years later through all the other Scorsese movies. It's sometimes very ridiculous- i.e. the suit Vinny wears to Court following no choice, always brilliant- but it's also got a sincerity to it that works. It's original in its characters and dialog even if it always takes some liberties with Southern and New York clich\u00e9s. The best example of the former would be with the grits part in the courtroom scenes (\"no respectable Southerner would make instant grits\"). And the cast surrounding Pesci always makes it worth watching. Marisa Tomei- maybe a little unnecessary of an Oscar win- is in her prim here as Vinny's girlfriend-would-be-fianc\u00e9 who ends up helping him out more than he could've thought. Meanwhile four of the more talented character actors, some seen more than others, bring up the courtroom scenes perfectly- Fred Gwynne as the judge, (the late) Lane Smith as the prosecutor, Bruce McGill as the Sheriff, and Austin Pendleton as a stand-in defense attorney. They bring both professionalism and a few laughs in measure with the very sharp, unpredictable script. That it also sometimes leaves it onto Pesci's shoulders to keep up entertainment wise is not altogether unexpected. But at the end of it all it's a very watchable, endearing piece of work, where the case itself in the story is not as worthwhile as the memorable lines of dialog or the bit players. And there's even a bit of good craftsmanship that goes unnoticed by some in it as well (the first scene at the bar shows this if you look close enough). Whether you've seen it in the theaters or not, it's probably one of the true enjoyable movies to watch on a weekend afternoon with nothing to do.",

            "content": "As everyone knows, comedy is a very divisive genre, but My Cousin Vinny seems to be one that unites more than it divides audiences because it has such affable charm, there really isn't much not to like here.Bill Gambini & Stan Rothenstein are driving across country on their way to college, after a shop stop in Alabama they mistakenly get arrested and find themselves on trial for murder. Bill enlists his cousin Vinny Gambini to represent them in court, Vinny is only 6 weeks a lawyer and has never seen the inside of a courtroom. His city ways and mannerisms do nothing but rile the judge (a bang on form Fred Gwynne), and he finds himself firmly up against it whilst having the lives of the two boys in his hands. Excellently scripted, the film is paced perfectly to allow the good writing to come to the fore, and although the ending is never quite in doubt, it does however bring about an unusual twist that is a shot in the arm for the film's denouement.Yes this film is another in the line of city folk falling foul of rural America's lawmen by being oblivious to their plight, but this film has the bonus of Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei on sparklingly comic form to see it home safe. I have probably watched this several times since its release and the long standing charm never ceases to amaze me, to me it's one of the best comedy films of the 90s, and I say hooray to Marisa Tomei's Oscar win for it was fully deserved. Comedy always gets a raw deal come awards time, here the interplay between herself and Pesci is not only funny, it's also cheekily precious, just like the film, actually. 8/10",

Vinny roles into town with his hot fianc\u00e9 (Marisa Tomei) intent on winning his first big case.I've heard a lot about this movie over the years, but never got around to seeing it till the other night and was pleasantly surprised. It's part fish-out-of-water comedy and part courtroom drama. The hulking Fred Gwynne plays the staunch judge, an amusing performance. It was Gwynne's last film.The movie is filled with laughs throughout, but it's more than just a goofball comedy. At some point early in the second act I strangely found myself liking Vinny and wanting him to succeed. I also found myself warming up to Vinny & his fianc\u00e9 as a couple. They're an odd couple, but somehow click. I guess this is where Marisa got the reputation for liking short, stocky men.Speaking of Marisa, she's just stunning here, although I prefer her more as she gets older, e.g. 2008's \"The Wrestler.\"The film was shot in Georgia and runs 120 minutes.GRADE: B+",

Joe Pesci is Vinny Gambini. Marisa Tomei is his fianc\u00e9, Mona Lisa Vito, and Fred Gwynne plays Judge Chamberlain Haller.

They turn to Bill's attorney cousin Vinny Gambini (Joe Persci), a wise-talking and foul-mannered New Yorker who appears initially incompetent to get the guys' case dismissed.This movie initially wasn't on my list to see, but a buddy of mine loaned it to me and it became a great way to spend a quiet night with and became one of the best crime comedies I've seen. Dale Launer's script of the movie is amazing and clever, giving us a motion picture that is original and non-clich\u00e9 that is full of entertainment value. The plot gains traction all throughout the film, from the guys getting arrested to the introduction of Vinny onto the screen, giving the audience a surprise and laugh to think that this stereotypical New Yorker in a mild-mannered town will be able to pull off defending the Bill and Stan successfully in court.The scenes of Vinny attempting to study the case and law books while dealing with seasoned prosecutor Jim Trotter III (Lane Smith) and his clingy and frustrated girlfriend Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei) are amusing to watch, two subplots that coincide well with the main plot point, which leaves you ponder what Vinny has planned up his sleeves to crack the case and save his cousin and his friend. The loving but sometimes fiery chemistry between Vinny and Lisa was spot on with a great dose of humor that balances just the right amount of drama and comedy.All the actors did a superb job in their roles, each giving a sharp and charming performance that keeps this movie interesting from beginning to end.

The plot was good, the dialogue was good, the film as a whole was just...Good! Go do yourself a favor,and treat yourself to this movie.",

I don't mean that in a negative way. As a matter of fact, I thought it was a very nice-looking, mask-like face. I laughed really hard every time Vinny (Joe Pesci) walked into the courtroom wearing something unusual got awakened by a loud noise, such as a factory whistle, and yelled, \"What the f*** is that?\" Please, don't say I have a twisted sense of humor. That's just the way I am. There was only one person that sort of annoyed me, and that was Lisa (Marisa Tomei). This was because she was a little snobby, especially when she was on the stand. Plus, she should have treated Vinny with a little more respect while he was defending Bill (Ralph Macchio) and Stan (Mitchell Whitfield). Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that this is one of the funniest films of 1992! Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Joe Pesci, and you haven't seen this laugh-out-loud comedy that will leave you laughing until it hurts, I highly recommend it!",

            "content": "MY COUSIN VINNY is the kind of comedy that makes its point pretty early on when it's apparently going to be a battle of wits between a fast talking New York lawyer (JOE PESCI, who only passed his bar exam after six tries) who finds himself embroiled in the Alabama court system and a stern and uncompromising Judge Waller (FRED GWYNNE) who takes an instant dislike to his lack of courtroom decorum.The brash Vinny comes to Alabama to help his nephew and his friend, innocents accused of a convenience store murder who seek his help as a last resort. Vinny's equally brash and foul-mouthed girlfriend MARISA TOMEI is along for the ride and turns out to be the saving point of the trial when she exhibits a knowledge of automobile engineering that's hidden by her crude behavior and comes as a real surprise in the amusing and cleverly written courtroom windup.JOE PESCI is excellent as the lawyer who antagonizes the judge so much that he has him jailed twice during preliminary hearings. FRED GWYNNE does a masterful job as the disbelieving judge trying to get the lowdown on this clown in his courtroom. And MARISA TOMEI is priceless as the loyal girlfriend who pleads all along to be helpful to Vinny because she knows that his knowledge of the law is extremely limited. When she finally gets her chance to shine, she walks off with the film and it's easy to see why she copped a Best Supporting Role Oscar for her work here.The other supporting standout is the job done by RALPH MACCHIO as Bill, the nephew who sends for Vinny and then has second thoughts about maybe using a public defender. MITCHELL WHITFIELD as his friend Stan, accused of being an accomplice to murder, is also excellent.Enjoyable nonsense all the way through, never much of a lull except for a weak sub-plot involving a bully who stiffed Vinny's girlfriend for $200. It's unnecessary in a film that runs two hours instead of a breezy ninety minutes but the film only occasionally gets sidetracked and it never runs out of steam.",

I got a kick out of about all the characters, particularly Fred Gwynne, whom I always enjoyed in his two old TV series: \"The Munsters\" and \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" Joe Pecsi provides most of the laughs as the defense attorney. A lot of people also laughed at Marisa Tomei's character here, too.Watching this 10 years later in 2002 was kind of a shock. I had changed and now was totally offended at the extremely large amount of profanity and particularly the high usage of the Lord's name in vain (five in the first five minutes alone). It's funny how you can deaf to that sort of thing. Tomei's super-Brooklyn accent, which also was funny 15 years ago, now sounds like chalk on a blackboard - just brutal.However, if the profanity or accents don't annoy you, this is a very, very funny movie and one of the more popular ones of its day. Gwynne made the word \"yout\" (for youth) funny by mocking Pecsi. It isn't just that word; the whole film is well-remembered. I was talking about this movie to several people in recent and all of them had nothing but fond remembrances of \"youts\" and other humorous scenes and words in this movie.",

            "content": "Without any argument here, flocks come to watch \"My Cousin Vinny\" is because Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei just chew up every scene that they are in. This comedy from 1992 is brilliant humorous (at times stereotyped) overview of contrasting American lifestyles between the Yankees from the North and the Rednecks from the South.The story is set in Alabama as two New York college young men from New York Billy Gambini (Ralph Macchio) and Stan Rothenstein (Mitchell Whitfield) are wrongfully accused of a murder they didn't commit. These two young men haven't a chance with the strict laws implemented in the redneck South. The cost of a lawyer is very pricey, therefore Billy and Stan hire Billy's smart-mouthed attorney, Vinny Gambini (Joe Pesci) a grease monkey from Brooklyn who has no experience in the courtroom and needs seven tries to pass the bar exam.With the death penalty for the two young men progressive within their reach, at the right moment Vinny makes his dramatic entrance along with his much younger girlfriend who's also a fellow car mechanic/hair stylist named Lisa (played by well-deserved Oscar winner Marisa Tomei). Once upon entering the the South, they end up getting culturally trained in dirt roads, eating \"grits\", and the 5am wake up calls. One of the more memorable scenes is when Vinny gets escorted into Billy and Stan's jail cell. While Billy's asleep, Vinny strategically plans with Stan who believes that he's a ruthless prisoner instead of a legal adviser This scene alone shows why this movie is an Oscar winner.As the trial goes into progression, Vinny's courtroom antics light up the entire movie as he has several run-ins with the book-obedient Judge Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne) and the snafus between the two were very engaging. The exchanges in dialogue between the two provide entertainment that will have you laughing in tears. The real scene stealer goes to Tomei who was poetic in her performance as Mona Lisa Vito. The chemistry between Tomei and Pesci was very sublime was enjoyable all around. This movie clearly demonstrates that a good comedy is played through heart which means they didn't depend on scatterbrained scenes and the plot was executed in an immaculate fashion. That's something you don't see very much in movies these days.",

            "review_title": "Legal Based Comedy Film That Is Funny And Entertaining",
            "content": "Joe Pesci is one of the very few actors who can play either the comedy role;i.e a slightly dimwitted yet funny character, or the serious role as a violent, erratic henchman/psycho; i.e in Scorcese's Goodfellas and Casino. In My Cousin Vinny, he excels as Vincent Gambini: a so-called stereotypical New Yorker, of whom travels to the South with no prior knowledge in legal affairs, faking his way as a lawyer, as he attempts to defend his cousin and his friend, Stan on their behalf, in his efforts to clear their name. One of his clients is a relative from Vinny's family named Bill, played by 'the original Karate Kid' himself, Ralph Macchio, which was interesting to see. Joining Vinny in this travels to Alabama is girlfriend, Mona Lisa Vito played by Marisa Tomei, who undoubtedly steals the show. I cannot fathom exactly why,like the majority of film actresses, she hasn't received so many film offers to date. The term 'underrated' springs to mind when describing this actress, not to mention 'under-used'. And yet with Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, she brings to her performance an endearing quality, as well as a feisty attitude as Mona Lisa Vito- the fast talking, smart, no-nonsense woman with a Brooklyn accent to match. Her much coveted Oscar win was well deserved. Remarkably enough, she bears a striking resemblance to another actress going by the name of Amy Pietz. One of the funniest lines uttered by both Pesci and Tomei was this one: Vinny: What about these pants I got on? You think they're OK? Mona Lisa Vito: Imagine you're a deer. You're prancing along. You get thirsty. You spot a brook. You spot a little brook. You put your little deer lips down to the cool clear water. BAM! A f***in bullet rips off part of your head. Your brains are lying on the ground in little bloody pieces. Now I ask ya, would you give a f*** what kind of pants the son-of-a-b**** who shot you was wearing? Unlike many of his Scorcese roles to name for example, Pesci as Gambini comes across to audiences as likable, humorous and sociable. For once, you want to sympathise with him but also, you want him to succeed in the end and Pesci has given this character a lot of credibility and scope to work with. There are some great scenes such as when the freight train disturbs Vinny's sleep in the early hours of the morning; when Vinny is wearing a white tracksuit and a pair of white sneakers and he slips on mud whilst pushing the car, and thus, his outfit and his suit for the court case is ruined, as a result. When Mona Lisa was in court sitting on the witness stand, having to testify and had to describe, visualise and identify in detail the models of the cars and everyone Apart from Vinny was left astounded by her knowledge of motor vehicles. Another great moment was when the lawyer was about to read out his opening statement- only for him to stutter along the way. It was so funny, the reaction from the jury based on their facial expressions said it all. That was just hilarious. British director Lynn has worked wonders on this movie and the cast, particular the supporting actors all shine in their roles. 'My cousin Vinny' delivers on all accounts, successfully taking what is perceived to be a serious and somewhat complicated situation and subject area, and turning it into something that is farcical- yet entertaining. This is a great film with fantastic acting and comedic moments brilliantly thrown in and utilised for good measure",

They won't be without an ace up on their sleeves because Billy's cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci) arrived in town with his girlfriend (Marisa Tomei) and will do his best to save Billy and Stan from the murder accuse. To say it better, he will succedd but not without lots of misunderstandings and disasters along the way (such as when the judge complains to Vinny about his way of dressing in court).MY COUSIN VINNY is considered a cult classic but despite I am a movie fan who has seen lots of cult movies I hadn't seen this one up until 3 days ago. I liked and disliked the movie. Joe Pesci was good in the title role but a few times his costant fast-talking was hard to understand and a few times you have to suspend your disbelief (such in the scene when James Rebhorn as a tire expert has to confront the tire signs and only near the end he recognizes that the car of the murderers was the one that went AFTER Billy and Stan left). A few of the gags fell flat but the funny ones outweighted the unfunny ones, and Ralph Macchio (when his KARATE KID days were a far cry) was very good actually.Overall, one of those movies mostly famous for its reputation but for viewing it just as a time passer, it's decent and with some moments worth a chuckle.",

            "content": "I felt this film couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a courtroom drama. It's an okay movie (B/B-) which could've been better if it took itself more seriously. There are the more dramatic elements in which two young Italians are accused of murder in the rural South. They call the only person they know out New York, their older cousin fresh out of law school. So the premise is pretty serious but the script still needed a lot of work. The story sort of u-turns when Vinny Gambini (Joe Pesci) arrives on the scene and then a lot of the movies becomes nearly an SNL-type comedy.The comedy of Pesci as a streetwise urban punk-turned-criminal-attorney, Vinny, sort of works. He seemed to be a reprise of his role as Tommy in \"Goodfellas\". If Tommy hadn't been assassinated and went to law school instead, maybe we get Vinny. However some of the comedy seemed very forced and over-the-top which were at times a bit unbelievable. During several scenes Vinny is disrespectful in court and gets a few nights in the slammer. I started getting tired of it happening over and over again.What saves this film is Marisa Tormei who snagged a Best Supporting Actress statuette for her work. She is more believable than any of the other characters. She also is good spoiler/straight man against the wild Pesci/Vinny. So if the film had decided to be a bit more sober, simply telling the story of street-punk-turned-attorney and his intelligent assistant the film would have worked a lot better. The comedy could still derive from that premise. To its credit, the story gets a bit better during about the last third or quarter, but still a one-watch to be sure.",

Although innocent they are put in jail and Bill's cousin New York attorney Vincent Gambini (Joe Pesci) is persuaded to defend them in court. The only problem is that Vinny has never tried a murder case before, has never actually been in a courtroom and has only been practising law for six weeks! In spite of his lack of experience Vinny accompanied by his girl friend Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei) travel from New York to Alabama to take on the case. Judge Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne) is not too impressed with Vinny but reluctantly agrees to him representing the two boys. The friction between Judge Haller and Vinny is one of the highlights of the film and the banter between them is hilarious. A running gag through the film is that Vinny and his girl friend keep changing hotels as they are unable to get a good night's sleep due to noises outside. In spite of his lack of experience Vinny puts on a good show but there are many ups and downs before the final verdict.Some favourite lines from the film:Ralph Macchio (to Mitchell Whitfield): \"There's nothing to worry about until there's something to worry about. Just relax, please\".Mitchell Whitfield (to Ralph Macchio): \"Ridiculous, all this over a can of tuna!\".Fred Gwynne (to Joe Pesci): \"What are you wearing?\". Pesci: \"I'm wearing - er - clothes. I don't get the question\".Gwynne (to Pesci): \"Once again the communication process is broken down!\".Pesci (to Marisa Tomei): \"Thank you Miss Vito. No more questions. Thank you very, very much. You've been a lovely, lovely witness\".Not a well known film but very funny with an excellent Academy Award winning performance from Marisa Tomei. Also a welcome change of pace for Joe Pesci after his psychopathic roles in films such as \"Good Fellas\" and \"Casino\". Austin Pendleton as the public defender has some good scenes and creates a comic character in a small but effective role. Ralph Macchio and Mitchell Whitfield give excellent performances as the two wrongly accused boys and their bewilderment at the way Vinny is conducting their defence is a joy to behold.  10/10.

I haven't laughed this hard in a while.\nIn the surface, My Cousin Vinny seems to be a small easy-going comedy movie with a fish-out-of-water/mistaken identity story, and that's exactly how should you see it to enjoy it, but that doesn't mean it's just that kind of a movie. This movie doesn't just have some smart jokes, and funny characters, but it's a clever, and kinda profound movie at its core. The way the sub-plots are connected to the character arc of Vinny, and how they reflect his development, and express his feelings, reminded me of the Coen Bros. quite a bit, but, of course, in a much lighter way. The funny misfortunes of Vinny are purely Coen-esque! And of course that means that the movie has a moral, and it's really an impressive, and sorta useful, one. It's a message about changing for better; a message about the indifference and how it's unprofitable, and even harmful.As I mentioned that it's better to watch the movie as a comedy and nothing else, I did that and I think My Cousin Vinny almost excels on so many levels as a comedy. From the clever jokes, to the comical slap-stick direction style, to the both oddball and reasonable characters, I found myself enjoying every moment in the movie, and laugh constantly throughout its runtime.Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei's chemistry is just unparalleled! Needless to say that they delivered some of their best performances in their rich career bringing their already well-composed and well-designed characters to life. Especially Mona Lisa Vito, played by Marisa Tomei that I found she really has some depth that can rarely be found in comedy movies. She's a round character; stubborn, kinda sassy, yet smart and sensitive... and she's cute, too!\nMitchell Whitfield and Ralph Macchio, who played the two young New Yorkers, are also very good; they have a good chemistry as well, and their reactions to the misunderstanding at the beginning are hysterically funny.The third act that take place in the courtroom is more serious, but that definitely doesn't mean it doesn't contain jokes or lack of humor. In addition to that, it has prepared for it very well. What surprised me is that I found the third act could be the most intriguing part of the movie. Due to the smartness of the script, the dialogue is pretty sharp, the denouement is surprisingly convincing, and the jokes this time is more clever because they rely on the writing and the acting, not the direction. I mean in a large part, obviously.The dramatic moments at the let-downs, however, seem very forced, and didn't work for me at all. They really could have been balanced with the comical tone of the movie way better than that. The plot could seem a bit familiar, but the content, and many details feel so fresh you almost can't notice this familiarity except when the credits roll.I want to praise Jonathan Lynn's classic visual style of comedy, but it's better to be seen to be appreciated. Please do yourself a favor, and watch this hidden, underappreciated gem.(9/10)",

            "content": "MY COUSIN VINNY is an entertaining and laugh-packed comedy confection that stars Joe Pesci as a New York tough who somehow barely passed the bar exam but has yet to try a case, who is asked to come down south to redneck country to defend his young cousin (Ralph Macchio)and his friend (Mitchell Whitfield), who have been wrongfully accused of murder. Pesci shines in this twisted fish-out-of-water story as the inexperienced lawyer with the mafia sensibility, completely clueless about the ways of people down south and their ultra-conservative methods of upholding the law. Marisa Tomei won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her scene-stealing performance as Pesci's brash and loud-mouthed girlfriend who accompanies him down south. The late Fred Gwynne gives the performance of his career as the judge on the case and the late Lane Smith is effective as the prosecuting attorney, though Austin Pendleton is a bit much as a public defender with a stuttering problem. This is a minor quibble though in one of the best comedies ever made. Tomei won an Oscar but Pesci still commands the screen in one the most perfectly timed comic performances to grace the silver screen in a long time. Pay particular attention as he questions a severely near-sighted old lady and offers the jury lessons on the preparation of grits. A supremely entertaining comedy that just gets better with multiple viewings.",

Marisa Tomei took home best supporting actress for a comedy. And that doesn't happen often! Joe Pesci should have won something for his performance in this one, oh wait he did... Funniest Actor in a Motion Picture from the American Comedy Awards. Gotta love the internet movie database!Its a change of pace for Joe Pesci after his roles in films such as Casino, JFK and Goodfellas. I read in a review that for many years Fred Gwynne attempted to disassociate himself from his role as Herman Munster, with no success. His role as Judge Haller was his last film appearance and is absolute perfection.\nThis is a well written, flawless comedy! Probably one of the funniest films of the 1990's! If you want to laugh... SEE THIS MOVIE!Judge Peter's Verdict: GUILTY of being absolutely hilarious! 8 (out of 10)",

            "content": "There was one main reason I heard about this film, it was for the surprise and minor controversy surrounding the then unknown supporting actress winning the Academy Award against actresses Judy Davis, Vanessa Redgrave, Miranda Richardson and Joan Plowright, so I had to see if she really deserved it, from director Jonathan Lynn (Clue, The Whole Nine Yards). Basically New York University students and friends Bill Gambini (The Karate Kid's Ralph Macchio) and Stan Rothenstein (Friends' Mitchell Whitfield) are driving through Alabama, and stopping at a local convenience store, and moments after they leave the store clerk is shot dead, and the two young men are pulled over by the police and arrested on suspicion of robbery and murder, and unless they can prove their innocence they will face execution. With no money to pay for a lawyer Bill calls his mother, he is told that there is an attorney in the family, Bill's cousin 'Vinny', Vincent LaGuardia Gambini (Joe Pesci), who travels to help them, bringing his fianc\u00e9e Mona Lisa Vito (Oscar winning Marisa Tomei) with him, but the Brooklyn based cousin is a personal injury lawyer, not an experienced attorney in trial, but he is able to fool the court judge Chamberlain Haller (The Munsters' Fred Gwynne) that he is qualified to go ahead with the case. A game of cat and mouse progresses trial, with Vinny being ignorant to basic court procedures and dress code, an often aggressive attitude, and not cross- examining any witnesses brought onto the stand, Jim Trotter III (Lois & Clark's Lane Smith) seems to have the case on his side, only missing a murder weapon to convict the young men, Stan fires Vinny and hires public defender John Gibbons (Austin Pendleton). The trial opens again, Vinny has been given another chance by Bill who he defends, wearing a snazzy secondhand tuxedo that is an improvement compared to his leathers, while Gibbons defends Stan, but Vinny does make up for his inexperience and ignorance paying close attention to witness statements, especially shortsighted Sam Tipton (Maury Chaykin), using his aggression to his advantage with penetrating questions, Billy's faith is restored and Stan fires Gibbons, while Vinny does get some needed sleep resting in a cell for contempt of court. In trial Vinny continues to be a more than capable cross-examiner, but Trotter brings in surprise witness FBI analyst George Wilbur (Independence Day's James Rebhorn) who analysed that during the crime a car drove away, and the tyre tracks and chemical analysis match and are identical to Billy's car, and going to lunch Vinny thinks the case is lost, and has a bad argument with Lisa that seemingly breaks their engagement. Looking through some of her photographs however Vinny spots something that could be key to the case, Billy's car does not have all the same mechanics as the getaway vehicle to make the tracks found at the scene of the crime, and he uses an initially not happy Lisa as a witness, as she has great knowledge of car mechanics from working in her father's garage, and she confirms that the vehicle in question can easily be mistaken for another of the same colour and same type of tyres. Wilbur confirms this testimony, Sheriff Farley (Bruce McGill) also confirms that two men matching the descriptions of the witnesses were arrested in another county driving a stolen car and in possession of a gun of the calibre used to kill the clerk, Trotter dismisses all charges against Bill and Stan, they are released, and Vinny and Lisa leave bickering about their wedding plans. Also starring Paulene Meyers as Constance Riley, Raynor Scheine as Ernie Crane, Chris Ellis as J.T. and Michael Simpson as Neckbrace. Pesci is great fun as the wisecracking and lovably aggressive title character, and Tomei does indeed almost steal the show as the Brooklyn girlfriend who comes across like a typical snobby bimbo but actually knows more than she lets on, this is definitely an alternative to the more serious and dramatic court case films you would come to expect, this one definitely mocks the law system in a way, the best laughs come from Pesci being incompetent in court and Tomei with her eccentric behaviour, I think she is a good unusual choice to win an Oscar, a funny and watchable comedy. Very good!",

            "content": "I remember watching the Oscars when Marisa Tomei won \"For My Cousin Vinny.\" The clip that was shown was the scene of Tomei's character Mona Lisa Vito whining about her \"Biological Clock.\" Her character from that clip seemed cartoonish at the time and didn't tempt me to see the movie. However, thankfully, and gratefully, years later one of my relatives convinced me to sit down and watch \"My Cousin Vinny.\" What a gem!! I laughed so hard at times my sides hurt. And then, when the \"biological clock\" scene occurred it was so perfect and hilarious I thought I was going to pee my pants. Marisa deserved the Oscar for her portrayal of Mona. But, she is not the only one deserving of recognition. Pesci had to have been overlooked because his acting seemed so effortless and people assumed he was just playing himself. So not true. He was brilliant. And, all the other characters were played wonderfully by a great cast. Now, I am not a fan of the F-word, in the movies as well as in social settings. It is so overused to me and evidence of someone with a weak brain trying to express forceful thoughts. In most R rated movies I see it as lazy and unimaginative writing. The more the F-word and profanity, generally, the weaker the plot and lousy dialogue. HOWEVER, the F-word is used judiciously, sparingly, and appropriately, and flows right with the dialogue in \"My Cousin Vinny.\" Kudos to the writer for showing how it should be done. If you have never seen this hilarious comedy please watch it, and watch it with an open mind. It is a comedy. It is not brain surgery. But, it is comedy at its best, and if you don't find this funny you are either from another planet or have no sense of humor whatsoever. If nothing else watch the characters and the skill in which the actors portray those characters. And, listen to the fabulous dialogue which was skillfully written for the characters. Each time I watch it I come away with having discovered something new which I had missed previously. Watch this film!! It should brighten anyone's day.",

Alabama as the intolerant, ignorant hicksville we know, also from movies.Neither place exists, in fact to extent that they do it is in people subconsciously mimicking film.What makes this project successful is that it is a gentle reference: each of the characters only brushes with their stereotype, except for Tomei. She's given the room to play a \"real\" (relatively real) character.The result is a simple, relatively pleasant space-filler. The problem with these things is that the current of film images is strong and deep. If you are not inventing, you are being invented. This is not as harmless as it appears.You can see the mechanics the screenwriter used: he needed a vehicle with traction that would balance both sides without slipping.

            "content": "\"My Cousin Vinny\" is kind of like a mess that configures itself in the end to reveal a performance it doesn't deserve.There are at least a couple of things wrong with it at basic levels. For one thing, the movie doesn't know who it's about. It begins with Ralph Macchio, who had great star power, getting arrested for murder, although all he did was forget to pay for a can of tuna. Three scenes in a row use the old \"character doesn't know something we know, and we wait for them to work it out\" thing, but only the third time, with Joe Pesci, is funny. Furthermore, Macchio isn't really the main character. After his predicament is introduced, he's pretty much forgotten about, and it becomes the Pesci and Marisa Tomei show.Either the screenwriter or the director couldn't keep more than one ball in the air at one time: Macchio and his co-accused, and Pesci and Tomei. Thus the movie should have started with Pesci, not Macchio.Tomei, as you probably know, won an Oscar for her performance. You might also know that her career basically died a death immediately after, and she didn't get back on the radar for over ten years. I guess Oscars don't count for much, or maybe it's when the movie itself isn't that great?The movie does, finally, come together when she gets her big scene, and it is a great scene. Everything that led up to it needed maintenance.",

Mr. Pesci, recently the embodiment of out-of-control evil in \"Goodfellas\" and a burglar of singular ineptitude in \"Home Alone,\" is a puzzled delight as he attempts to gather his wits, being helped not at all by Mona Lisa's loudly articulated common sense and her ability to read law books and retain their contents.

As a rule, I only watch comedies once because they tend not to age well. But I can watch this movie all day. I also tend to cringe when I hear about Hollyweird making a movie that is set in the Deep South. But this movie does a fairly accurate portrayal of Alabama as I knew it when I was a kid (I live in Maryland now.). I was very impressed with the movie's portrayal of Alabamians without stereotyping them. It's true, many Alabamians think New Yorkers are as stupid as they think we are, and the movie brought that out very well.Fred Gwynne's last role as the no-nonsense Alabama judge was one for the ages. He didn't exaggerate the Southern accent, in fact, he sounded like one of my uncles. I was almost convinced he was from the South until I read somewhere that he was originally from New York City. Very impressive, Mr. Munster. I only have two minor criticisms of the movie. Here goes: (OOps. Sorry. Forgot. POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT) (1) Joe Pesci's character would not have gotten out of that pool hall the first time without at least three or four of those guys ganging up on him and giving him a good old fashioned Alabama butt whuppin'! They would have sent him packing, and if he survived the experience, he would never go back in there again. Him decking that redneck after two or three meetings with him would not happen, assuming he lives through the first encounter. There would be no two or three meetings.(2) I would like to have seen a scene where Joe Pesci and the Alabama D.A. go deer hunting and Joe Pesci dresses up in that ridiculous outfit he wore. I would love to have seen them expand on the idea that when you go deer hunting in Alabama, you wear a sturdy pair of jeans, a warm flannel shirt, and some sturdy work shoes or boots, not an outfit that makes you look like you're taking a stroll down Broadway or something. (Yes, folks, it does get cold in Alabama, believe it or not. Sometimes, it even gets below thirty.)Except for these little things, a great movie. My hat is off to the writer for doing his homework on Alabama, and to the actors for finally playing Alabama natives realistically. 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "I think it's interesting to look at the title of the film and then to observe from whose point of view we see the events through. The word 'my' in the film's title 'My Cousin Vinny' suggests that William Gambini (Macchio) is the person we'll be seeing the film through the eyes of after he and his friend Stan Rothenstein (Whitfield) are arrested on serious criminal charges. But the Vinny of the title, who is played by Joe Pesci, is the focus here; he is the best character, the most interesting and if anything he is the one that endures the longest journey despite the two suspects having to endure jail, accusations and emotional anxiety.The overall gag of the film is one that is thin on the surface but lasts the duration of the film. Two years previously, Joe Pesci played Tommy deVito in Goodfellas; a psychotic gangster who was always on the edge and never one to be made a fool of. So here, it is only natural that we should see him playing the clown or the fall guy for what the unfamiliar surroundings has in store for him. At first, it is the 'mud' that catches him out as it gets stuck on his cars tyres, rendering his car faulty. From here, it is a shrill whistle that occurs at 5 a.m.; a freight train that consistently passes at the same time and herds of animals being moved at equally early times \u0096 this is not New York. Who said the country side was easier to get some sleep in over the city? So Vincent Gambini is there to defend a relative and his friend from some pretty serious accusations, only thing is they aren't guilty and we know that from the very beginning: it is Vincent's case to loose because we assume the evidence to be so lacklustre that they surely cannot be charged. There was no gun found on their person after all, but such things are overlooked.Onto the case and during the early exchanges of the film, I actually assumed the entire thing was fake; a sort of sick 'Truman Show' stunt that tested weather characters would be able to help others out of trouble and discover themselves, simultaneously. Maybe it was a deliberate attempt to get some 'city-folk' framed so that they could send 'em to the chair and it be up to the city lawyer to get them out of it. Not to be. In fact, the whole thing is so ludicrous and seemingly false that thinking back, it is more of an establishment of helplessness and imminent catastrophe with an emphasis on scaring the characters and audience with the death sentence should they be charged. This aids with the dark atmosphere but is juxtaposed with the fact you cannot help but find it rather amusing that a crime they so obviously didn't do is being pinned on them.But then again, point of view can be re-applied here. What would the film be like if we had begun in the police station and hadn't had the point of attack involving the two kids and their road journey segment; including trip to the store? Would we be as sure as the rangers that they'd done it? Would the film be able to tiptoe around the fact there was no gun found? Something would have to have given way. But the film is really a focus on fishes being out of their water. Vincent is an informal and wise-talking guy thrown into a poor and rundown setting but tossed into an extremely formal situation in the process ie; the courtroom. The judge is Chamberlain Haller, and is brilliantly acted by Fred Gwynne, and its his rules or the jail house if you do not appreciate them. Then there is that acknowledgement that you can get a bar full of guys dressed like hillbillies who hustle and lack intelligence and yet can share the same space within the town that a man as decadent and educated as Judge Haller.So if Vincent is a fish out of water, how can he possibly utilise his ways by which he usually succeeds in a place that does the same theoretical thing but in a different manner? That's the film's question. Vincent is a character with big charisma, not ego and the two should not be confused. Vincent can talk the talk and he can walk the walk but in order to succeed in his mission he must do it by way of the book and not in his casual, carefree manner; something he learns through dress-sense, addressing those 'higher' than him and controlling his charisma as ill-timed profanities come out. Rather than do a 'wise-guy' act and 'big, bada, boom' your way through it all, Vincent learns to calm it down and address the situation more formally. There are two things that highlight this: the first is the gradual manner by which Vincent addresses the judge by standing up more and more to talk during the trail (he also addresses other people, as well) and two; the scene in the bar when he is talking to a barfly hustler and uses a string of formal sentences to sum up the situation and engage in conversation. The wise-guy would have done the same but in a lot less formal manner ie; hit the guy as soon and as hard as possible.If My Cousin Vinny works as a character piece in progression then it works overall because there is not much else on show. The comedy is there for those that look on the surface and, whilst I did not laugh consistently, there are one or two laughs overall. But it's the 'funny' events that tie in with Vinny's progression as he tries to save the day, even though William's 'confession' evidence disappears after the opening. Such questions should not be asked in a film as enjoyable as this one.",

Joe Pesci is hilarious, and of course Marisa Tomei won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her turn as Pesci's fiance. I know Tomei's win was controversial and considered by many to be undeserved. But as I was watching this, I was thinking about how easy it would have been for Vanessa Redgrave or Miranda Richardson or Joan Plowright or Judy Davis (her competition that year) to step in and do this role. It's a reminder of how difficult comedy is to do well and how underappreciated comedic performances are because usually the people in them make them look so easy.Also with Mr. Herman Munster himself, Fred Gwynne, who gives a very funny and very dead pan performance in his own right.Grade: A",

While in Alabama they are (unjustly) accused of murder and need a lawyer--fast. Macchios' cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci) arrives from NY with his girlfriend (Marisa Tomei) to defend them. The problem is that he has only six weeks of law school training and the judge (Fred Gwynne) hates him...Huge comedy hit which made Pesci even more popular than he already was (he had just won the Oscar for \"Goodfellas\") and gave Tomei a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. The setup is familiar, it's way too long, not all the jokes work and some of the characters are unlikable (Whitfield got annoying quick and Gwynne was TOO mean) but, all in all, this is a fun movie. The parts that do work are hysterical--the verbal matches between Pesci and Gwynne, Austin Pendleton's opening speech in court (you can see Pesci, Macchio and Whitfield breaking up in the background) and just about anything Tomei says.Acting--Macchio and Whitfield sort of fade into the background--they aren't given much to do. Pesci is is just great as Vinny--loud, obnoxious, swearing nonstop and very funny. Tomei matches him word for word. A lot of people seem to think that Tomei doesn't deserve the Oscar she won--but comedy is much harder to do than drama and she takes a stock character is makes her realistic, sympathetic and very funny. Her testimony in court at the end probably won her the award. Gwynne is terrific (if a bit too stern) as the judge. This was a last film and it's great to see he went out on a high note.So, I recommend it. The only debits are its over length and the nonstop profanity may offend people. I give it an 8.Best line--\"Oh yeah--you blend\".",

To think that this is the same man who plays the psycho hit-man in Good Fellas! As for other performances, they are all excellent. F. Scott Fitzgerald said something to the effect that tragedy makes us feel, while comedy makes us think. Hopefully I'm not spoiling things by saying this, but I find myself dwelling on the movie and on the position it takes, whether inadvertent or intentional, on capital punishment.

Even though it was released in 1992, it does not feel very old.What an incredible performance by Joe Pesci. It never felt like he was acting. The subtle expressions, the body language and the laid back approach everything about Vinny Gambini felt real. Marisa Tomei as Miss Vito was really good.

As long as Macchio and Whitfield are the center of the film, it's achingly bad comedy. Thankfully, the movie does get into its element once it turns into a courtroom farce, when Joe Pesci and especially Marisa Tomei take center stage and allow their characters to grow. They're not great characters or very clever ones - how Tomei won that Oscar over Judy Davis and Vanessa Redgrave is a bit of a mystery - but they both do a commendable job with their roles, and make the second half of the movie watchable and even very entertaining, but still completely forgettable.",

I like comedies that take place in standard areas that serve simply as a backdrop allowing for characters to get into intelligent comedic arguments and/or discussions. I like intelligent comedies. \"My Cousin Vinny\" is smart and talkative; in one of the better scenes, Vincent Gambini (Joe Pesci) and his fianc\u00e9e Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tommie) get into an argument over a dripping faucet. I love this stuff.That's not to say that I don't enjoy other forms of comedy. I respect them when done correctly. But for me, character-driven stories and conversations has always been the strongest example of pure filmmaking; of getting inside the heads of others.Billy (Ralph Macchio) and his buddy Stan are traveling through Wahzoo, Alabama, when they are unjustly picked up for the murder of a local gas station attendant. Thrown into the slammer, their only hope is one man: Vinny (Pesci), an energetic, smart-mouthed little guy who happens to be Billy's cousin and a lawyer. He assures them that he'll get them off the hook, despite the fact that he's never even entered a courtroom before. \"How long have you been practicing?\" Stan asks. \"Almost six weeks,\" Vinny says.Vinny's brought his fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito (Tommie), to Wahzoo with him. They rent out a room at a local motel and get into heated debates whilst the fate of Vinny's cousin and his friend rest with him. At the first day of trial, Vinny says absolutely nothing to help his case. The prosecution's lawyer (Joe Don Baker) makes Vinny look like a schmuck, quizzing witnesses over important eyewitness accounts. Vinny just sits there.He's not a very good lawyer, as we can tell from the start. And the court judge (Fred Gwynne in his last film role) isn't too enthused with his courtroom manner. But he gets better as time goes on, with the help of his smart fianc\u00e9e and with the cheering of his cousin. Vinny proves he's a pretty good lawyer by the time everything's over.I didn't enjoy \"My Cousin Vinny\" as much as I should have. Taking everything into account, it is a very good comedy. It's built with a strong foundation of a witty script; funny characters and clever dialogue, not to mention an overall joyful feel to it. Nevertheless, I wasn't as enthralled on my first viewing of the film as I had hoped I would be. My second viewing, last night, was better.Joe Pesci is perfect as Vinny, a lovable clown who prides himself in the fact that he thinks he knows everything, but most of the time his pride backfires when he finds out he's not quite as clever as he thinks. Marisa Tomei (who won an Oscar for her supporting role) is hilarious as the straight guy (or gal) of the story. Fred Gwynne is great; this was his final appearance on film, as he died soon after filming wrapped.The movie has some very funny cultural comparisons, the most evident one the argument over the meaning of the word \"youths,\" which Vinny pronounces \"yutes.\" There's also a good scene when Vinny and Mona Lisa first arrive in Wahzoo and step out of their car clad in leather and jewelry and general city clothing. \"You stick out like a sore thumb around here,\" he says. \"At least I've got cowboy boots.\" Lisa looks at him and says, \"Oh, yeah, you blend.\"Another fine aspect of this film is how strong the courtroom scenes are. Instead of serving simply as a premise for the film to induce chuckles, it has some very interesting and thoughtful scenes, probably enough to go around for ten courtroom movies. There's a discussion towards the end about cars and their tires that had me wondering how the scriptwriters did such detailed research.In many ways, this movie reminded me of the 1987 comedy \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles,\" which I am always bringing up in my reviews. But somehow they're closely related. I think it's the dialogue. It's like John Hughes himself said: \"I always liked character stories best - put two or more people in a room and get them talking.\" I like those movies, too. I've always liked them. I like when characters get into lengthy, deep debates about trivial things. I love comedic conversations. \"My Cousin Vinny\" has a lot of 'em. It's a nice distraction from the overblown goofball comedies flooding the market today that lack any sort of cohesion and wit necessary to make a strong comedy. \"My Cousin Vinny\" has got it all.4/5 stars.John Ulmer",

The reason I find it so watchable is the sensational performances by all cast members (OK maybe not Machio!). My most vivid memory of the movie was that after seeing the theatrical release and thinking it was hysterical, I rented it while on vacation with my folks. To be honest, I didn't remember the language being so... ah... harsh, and I sat there in shock thinking they would be mortified. Well, after 15 minutes my Mom was howling with every morning wake up, every confrontation with the judge, and we almost lost her when Austin Pendelton started his \"stuttering\" defense! She loved Marisa Tomei (who didn't?)! I will never forget that night.The movie itself is the classic \"fish out of water\" tale. Joe Pesci, who I always found annoying in his Mafia roles, is perfect as the New Yorker who will \"learn as he goes along\". And Marisa Tomei, his long suffering girlfriend, creates a character so coarse, blunt, likable and drop dead gorgeous, I haven't seen her equal since. I am always amazed that people question her Acadamy Award credentials. The fact that comic turns are not often rewarded doesn't mean it wasn't a sensational characterization. And this was also a career capping role for Fred Gwynne. He captures the respectful Southern Gentlemen Judge, struggling to suppress his slow burn, perfectly. So tune in if you haven't seen it, enjoy it again if you have. This is great entertainment, but remember, its rated R for language!!",

Well, in this movie he got to show his comedic chops while still staying close to his explosive tough guy image.In the movie, he plays the titular Vinny, an inexperienced New York lawyer summoned to rural Alabama in order to defend a cousin who has been falsely accused of murder. Needless to say, his irreverent attitude does not endear him to the Southern judge, nor does his seeming incompetence inspire his cousin with much confidence. Fortunately, Vinny's long-suffering fianc\u00e9e Lisa (Marisa Tomei) is determined to lend a hand so that justice prevails in spite of Vinny's lack of refinement.Although Pesci was the star of the movie it was Tomei who ended up practically stealing the show. Nevertheless, her subsequent Oscar win was a surprise to many and I can see why. In my opinion, her later Oscar nominations for \"In the Bedroom\" and (especially) \"The Wrestler\" were both more deserving. In any case, in addition to having good chemistry together, Pesci & Tomei also had a stellar cast of character actors supporting them. With the likes of Fred Gwynne, Lane Smith, James Rebhorn & Bruce McGill (among others), the cast is way better than you'd have any right to expect (even considering the questionable casting of ex-Karate Kid Ralph Macchio).Director Jonathan Lynn holds a Law degree from Cambridge, so he was seemingly a good choice for the project. Nevertheless, I was surprised to find that the movie has been praised by lawyers for its authenticity along with its illustration of various legal procedures, strategies & principles. What's odd is that an outwardly light comedy like this actually has a foundation of credibility. Meanwhile, in purely visual terms, although the movie may not be anything particularly special, Lynn still demonstrates more than once his ability to use the camera to produce comedic effects.All in all, \"My Cousin Vinny\" is a pretty good light comedy. Joe Pesci seems a bit out of place here but, then again, that's kind of the point. In any case, the story's entertaining and the cast in general is well above average. I'd say that it's definitely worth a look, even if it doesn't quite measure up to the all-time classics of the genre.",

People may argue that's its contrived, ridiculous, and all that garbage, but this film isn't to be taken seriously. It's a comedy. It's a feel-good-story of believing in someone, and it is incredibly effective. \"My Cousin Vinny\" delivers a ton of laughs, some great acting from Pesci, Tomei, and Fred Gwynne. Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei have a ton of fun with this role and really do a great job acting off one another. We become so invested in this story and so invested with their determination that we're sucked into these characters. A smile is brought to your face just listening to them talk.

            "review_title": "Captured, Georgia",
            "content": "Well, this captures Georgia all right. Small-town Georgia, with its loblolly and slash pine forests and red clay earth, and its baked-brick buildings, and hard-charging justice system. The South in many ways is one of the most laid-back areas of the country; everybody's friendly-like, elderly neighbors visit newcomers and bring them home-made pies. But, don't laugh, it reminds me a bit of Inuit life. People can get away with quite a lot in a traditional Eskimo community as long as they generally stick to the norms. When they don't, they get killed. Not shunned, not fined, not chastized, not remonstrated with, not exiled -- killed. \"My Cousin Vinny\" is a movie that I find myself enjoying each time I watch it, although the story is simple enough and could easily be done poorly. Fortunately, given that the escapade depicted isn't by its nature hilarious, the picture is rather smoothly done, with advantage taken of every opporunity for humor. The underlying drama wears thin after the first viewing, but it's still filled with laughs. Joe Pesci can't help his presence seeming ridiculous, even in his heavy roles for Scorcesi. He simply SOUNDS funny. Marisa Tomei is slender and sweetly appealing. Her relationship with Pesci is a nice mixture of love, frustration, and resignation. She's smarter than he is, as well as much better looking. Fred Gwynn and Lane Smith are the local authority figures, judge and prosecutor respectively. But no one could accuse them of playing Southern stereotypes. The Judge is sharp, a Yale graduate and chess player, and allows no tomfoolery in his courtroom, although Pesci provides plenty of it. Smith, playing a Southern lawyer for the one-hundredth-and-fortieth time, is at least as good as he's ever been. Here, he's affable and full of principle, going out of his way to help Pesci and Mona Lisa find a quiet place to live. His roller coaster of an accent is a delight to listen to. And, like the others, he has some good lines. \"Verdict,\" he tells the jury in his summation, \"it means the truth. Comes down to us from our lil IL' ancestors in Europe,\" and the director gives us a brief shot of an African-American woman in the jury box listening intently. Ralph Macchio's part is rather small, which doesn't detract at all from the movie. He has one good moment. Interrogated by a sheriff, he thinks he's being arrested for stealing a can of tuna fish and knows nothing of the murder he's thought to have committed. He admits to the sheriff that, yes, in fact he stole the tuna. The sheriff says, \"Was that before or after you shot the clerk?\" There are about two exquisite seconds while Macchio continues staring straight ahead as this query sinks into his understanding, then he looks up as if doubting his senses, and says, \"I shot the clerk?\", which the sheriff immediately grasps as a straightforward confession.If you get a chance to see this, you might as well do so. I hope you can get the unexpurgated version so you can pick up on one of the films funniest exchanges after Pesci has repeatedly made a fool of himself in the courtroom. \"Counselor,\" says the judge, \"I'm holding you in contempt.\" And Pesci mutters under his breath as he sits down, \"What the f*** else is new?\"Fred Gwynn's jaw drops and his expression of incomprehension has me smiling just thinking about it. It isn't a masterpiece of comedy, but it's a pleasant way to get through a few hours.",

This is merely a political Hollywood drama posing as a comedy; yet another attempt to sway all us \"vile, wretched, pro-death penalty souls\" into believing that practically every person accused of a major crime is innocent, while the real killer/rapist/whatever is hiding somewhere, safe and happy. All the humanity! All the conspiracy! Apart from its blatant liberal leanings, this movie has another purpose, albeit a less conscious i.e. intentional/relevant one: to yet again mock the people from the South of the States, portraying them as dumb and evil hicks. After all, the New York characters are all likable - even smart - whereas MCV's townsfolk are all either borderline morons or corrupt/immoral. But of course: as we all know, New York nearly always votes Left/Democrat - plus, it's the second-largest center of the film industry in the world - so OBVIOUSLY New Yorkers must be superior to those damn Southerners with their retarded twang and lack of morality and common-sense. What a load of b...Pesci is quite solid playing an unreal character. Tomei tries hard with HER unreal character, but fails because the part was written in such a stereotypical fashion that it was impossible even for much better actresses than her to make that role seem as if it had any basis in reality. She is a caricature, not a character, hence she is neither funny for the supposed humorous bits, nor believable for the dramatic bits. She reminds of Lesley-Anne Warren's ditzy character in \"Victor/Victoria\", but without being nearly as funny or likable as her; plus, that was an actual comedy, not a political-statement movie. Tomei talks like a typical dumb NY harlot, and yet her vocabulary shames even those absurdly eloquent young characters from \"Dawson's Creek\". You can't have your cake and eat it too: have a character that behaves like an utter moron, and yet imply that there is some fantastic unrealized intellectual potential lurking behind the extremely silly exterior. It wouldn't even work in a REAL comedy (which this isn't at all), let alone in a comedy drama with some quite serious social pretensions/ambitions.To make things worse, there are long court scenes which, as we all know, the American audiences adore so much. The fact that most Tinseltown court-room movies don't have an iota of realism in them doesn't seem to bother anyone - i.e. people aren't even aware of this obvious, simple fact. Just stuff your face with popcorn and whatever you do, don't think, please...So why did Tomei get an Oscar? Well, obviously, this is a political film - Leftist, as always - and Hollywood likes to reward its sheep-like obedient film-makers in propagating its way of life and thinking.If you want to make it in Hollywood, all you need to do is shout how liberal you are, for as long as your throat can bear it. Success is guaranteed...Please punish me hard, very HARD, by clicking \"no\" below. That'll teach me...",

It's the kind of movie which comes along, provides a few chuckles, and then disappears, destined to be more or less forgotten. But this particular movie will always be remembered because of one of the great Academy Awards upsets of all time. Marisa Tomei took home the Oscar for best supporting actress and to this day it still seems a little hard to believe. That's not a knock on Tomei, her performance is indeed very good. But it's not the type of role, and certainly not the type of movie, which generally attracts Oscar votes. The fact Tomei even scored a nomination seems surprising. That she actually won boggles the mind.While Tomei got the glittering golden statue it is Joe Pesci who has the central role in the movie. Here Pesci gets a chance to show he's not just the tough guy you know from Goodfellas. He's funny. Pesci plays Vincent 'Vinny' Gambini in what will prove to be one of those classic fish out of water tales. His young cousin and a friend were traveling through rural Alabama and they have rather unfortunately found themselves charged with a murder they did not commit. The evidence against them appears strong and the two youths seem destined for the electric chair. Who will defend them? Enter Vinny Gambini. OK, so he's just passed the bar after six attempts and he's never actually tried a case and this stereotypical New Yorker is completely out of his element in the Deep South...but I'm sure he'll do a bang-up job right?There are some pretty good laughs as we see Vinny try to build a defense despite all the obstacles in his way. Of course no obstacle being greater than the fact that he appears to have no idea what he's doing. Along for the ride is Vinny's girlfriend, Mona Lisa Vito. No, really. You couldn't make that name up. This of course is Tomei's role and she does quite well with it. The verbal salvos being lobbed back and forth between her and Pesci really work. There's certainly nothing about her performance that screams out \"Oscar\" but that would be the end result. Giving just as good of a supporting performance as Tomei is Fred Gwynne, playing a judge who will find himself often butting heads with Vinny. Other than that there's not much. Playing the two youths on trial Ralph Macchio and Mitchell Whitfield don't have much of anything to do after the film's first few minutes. They're just sitting at the defense table watching Pesci do his thing. Pesci has to carry the movie and he proves up to the task. It's a mostly entertaining story, there's some snappy dialogue and good comedic bits sprinkled throughout. But at times the movie does struggle to maintain momentum. You get the sense 15-20 minutes could easily have been trimmed off the two hour running time to produce a much tighter, more focused story. In the end it's no comedy classic but it is amusing enough.",

Take the first scene with such signs as \"Free horse manure\". Is this south bashing? Absolutely! But it does give you a laugh.Then there is the scene in prison between Mitchell Whitfield and Pesci. \"You're getting' f..... either way!\" And you can't get enough of all that southern charm that just oozes out of the prosecutor, Lane Smith.The bit with the stuttering public defender is a bit sick but I guess the director needed a positive argument for Joe Pesci's character to be the more competent of the two. Austin Pendleton does it well too despite objections from his part.And yes. One of the few comedies that was rewarded with an Oscar to an actor, the gorgeous Marisa Tomei (you can understand why George Costanza was so obsessed with her). Many jokes has been made at her expense and that only fuels the speculation about her being the rightful winner that year. In my mind it couldn't have been a goof. She absolutely nails the character and does it without the stereotyping in which these characters are usually played.Joe Pesci's career have had more downs than ups. Remember the tremendously awful \"The Super\" but here he gave us a really compelling character. He is smug, selfish and yes a bit of a tool but he plays it with such tongue-in-cheek that you can't help loving the guy.",

When the police pull them over and arrest them, they think they have been booked for theft... but they are booked for murder. They are broke and have no-one to defend them... except Cousin Vinny. It is then comedy from there.The film is funny in places, but not really laugh out loud funny. It was amusing and fun to watch, but I didn't laugh out loud at many points.The film stars Joe Pesci as cousin Vinny. I like Joe. He has made a lot of good movies, but this is not his best. He also looked like he had his face pinned back. His eyes looked stretched back. I wonder if he had surgery or something? Joe was good in this film though... his character was the funny character in the film. I loved his attitude and the language he uses.Other cast members were Ralph Macchio, Marisa Tomei, Mitchell Whitfield & Fred Gwynne.They all did well. The acting wasn't brilliant, but it is a comedy, so the way they played it was really good.A lot of the film is set in a court room which can be boring sometimes, but not really here. Joe carries the film through. He is brilliant at keeping you entertained and that is what he does here.I will give this film 6 out of 10.I did like it, but I was expecting more.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",

            "content": "I must say 1992's \"My Cousin Vinny\" is a wonderful film the acting, and plot along with the wit and funny moments combined with a culture clash make for a good enjoyable film. Going away from this film you take away and appreciate the cultural differences of the north and south. Being raised a southern I knew what to expect, and visiting up north I saw as you see with these Yankee folks their way of life is different.Two laid back and wild out to seek adventure New York college students are taking a sight seeing tour thru the deep south. And while in Alabama, they are arrested and accused of murder! One of the boys(Ralph Macchio)has a family friend who's just finally became a lawyer after six times of taking the bar! That's Vincent Gambini(well done by Joe Pesci)a Brooklyn guy who's a former auto repair guy, and guess what this is his first court case! So Vinny arrives in Alabama with his hot and sexy strong spoken smart girlfriend Mona(in Marisa Tomei's best role). And this is the start of big lessons in law and most of all southern culture! Thru it all with wit and common sense intelligence rightful justice is served. Most rewarding is the lessons of culture shock for Vinny and the boys, it's so comical hearing the southern accents, and it was funny seeing Vinny ask southerns what are grits! Great supporting work from Tomei a nice eye candy treat. As this was one comedy to laugh at while appreciating the cultural differences.",

Whilst Ralph Macchio's character could have contracted a decent lawyer, he prefers to contract his \"Cousin Vinny\" because \"he is family\". Obviously, this counselor is worse than anyone else would be in this profession. He doesn't understand what the Judge says and builds a strange relationship with him. Marisa Tomei's character (Vinny's wife) is as annoying as it could be, but she has an oddly charisma which made me like her.The first hour of the film had some funny jokes involving irony and naivety, but the other hour forgot it was a comedy film. Instead of that, the writers insisted in building a silly story with a bizarre lawyer. The movie is entertaining and interesting once you realize this is just a low-budget film with an original situation, but won't be much real or believable.",

            "content": "Even Andre Bazin and Jean-Luc Godard surely had films they found difficulty watching objectively. We all are attached to at least one certain movie that resonates with our childhoods, holidays, families and different circles of friends. My Cousin Vinny is at least one film that I watch in pure vegetation no matter how exorbitant my film snobbery gets over the years. I know a guy who seems to watch nothing but gangster and samurai movies, and tends to mingle with similar guys, but will always have a place in his heart for Bob Clark's A Christmas Story, just like so many others who cannot watch it without all the signifying perspective of all those Thanksgivings and Christmases. I cannot watch My Cousin Vinny without thinking of my parents, how we all love it when Joe Pesci refers to his defendants as \"yutes,\" much to the bafflement of a courtroom full of small town Southerners who may have never before heard a Brooklyn accent, how Marisa Tomei's Oscar-winning scene on the bench as an expert witness automobile aficionado never seems to get old to us.What does change over time is my view of Joe Pesci's performance. It doesn't weaken. Rather, it carries different associations now than it did when I was younger, before he had much such a huge impact on me playing Tommy in GoodFellas and Nicky in Casino. I had only known him as a relative comic actor playing the pushover in the Lethal Weapon series, a handful of other films that I doubt I could revisit with an eye impartial to my memories of being obsessed with them in grade school. I'd also seen Raging Bull when I was quite young, and it had a definite impact on me as well, and I got to see My Cousin Vinny in a much darker, much more dejected ambiance. Now, I enjoy Pesci's Vinny Gambini for a different reason, how it's a complement to Pesci's work with Scorsese in terms of the background of the actor's associations as we see him here.There has been lots of dispute over the years as to whether or not Marisa Tomei deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her work here. It is certainly an unlikely film to garner any Oscars, an unlikely role as well. There have been many actresses similar to her in presence like Gloria Grahame, who did powerhouse work before the Academy finally acknowledged her with an Oscar for The Bad and the Beautiful, in which she has ten minutes of screen time at best and plays a role far from the ballpark of central characters. Marisa's career, however, seems to have worked in reverse. I think that here, as Mona Lisa Vito, she was acknowledged because she, having merely appeared on A Different World and a sparse amount of bit parts, stuns us not only with her staggering physical beauty but with her ability to steal each and every frame in which she appears, even from Pesci, the lead, who had recently won the same award she was to win, and essentially for stealing every scene of GoodFellas, a film with a powerful cast. This is all theoretical, and as I said, it's difficult for me to be objective with this movie.Pesci's lead is in part a typecast, as an Italian-American Brooklynite who thinks a black knit shirt with a gold chain necklace under a black leather jacket is proper courtroom apparel. He might be right if he were a defendant in the Bronx, but the movie takes place in Alabama, and he's the defense attorney for his Italian-American Brooklynite cousin Ralph Macchio, and his Jewish friend Mitchell Whitfield, two innocent college students on their way to school, suddenly having found themselves charged with the murder of a convenience store clerk. The circumstantial evidence looks ruinous, but the worst thing they have going against them is Pesci's all-around absence of legal familiarity.Even though this classic fish-out-of-water story is set in the South and has an early shot of a sign that says \"Free Horse Manure,\" this is not really a hick bash. The judge, played by Fred Gwynne, Mr. Munster himself, prosecutor Lane Smith, Perry White to Dean Cain's Superman and the arresting officer Bruce McGill, D-Day to Belushi's Blutarski, are normal Southern men who aren't trying to hastily sandbag anybody by means of false charges and insufficient evidence, but after gunshots were heard, three different witnesses made a positive identification of the two suspects, fleeing the store in a conspicuous late-1960s Buick convertible. (Cue Marisa.)The movie stores most of its best laughs for the extended climactic courtroom sequence, in which one witness after another forges together the prosecution case, and the guiltless youngsters look decidedly bound for the electric chair. Gwynne's surly functioning in his scenes scenes is outstanding. The defendants are for all intents and purposes a foil. Macchio and Whitfield sit at the defense table and look scared, and that's essentially that. Pesci and Tomei, on the other hand, have an ironic relationship that I liked. Neither one is played as a lunkhead, or a contrast to the other. They're very clever, in their own ways that the by-the- book Southern court isn't used to, but in the middle of a legal undertaking for which they are totally unschooled. Basically, it's a great culture clash movie, not only in the courtroom scenes but in Vinny and Mona's struggle to get any sleep or find a suit or get breakfast or duke it out with a classic barroom redneck for the money he owes them. And I think that's probably it's biggest charm.",

My wife doesn't like watching a lot of movies over and over, she's good with My Cousin Vinny. Real comedies like this one are disappearing, I'll always talk about this film when there is conversation about the true greats.From the technical standpoint, I have to report the blu-ray is a little disappointing. (I recently wrote a review on the movie \"Big\" which will look similar to this one). They never really spent a lot of time on the blu-ray re-master. It wasn't a massive improvement over the DVD, but enough that I'm happy with the purchase. Dynamic range wasn't improved much, nor was the almost foggy look in some scenes. There seems to be a lot of digital noise in some scenes also, but not as bad as some blu-ray re-masters. Sharpness is improved a lot (in most scenes buy many are still very soft) and oddly sound has improved a lot in terms of surround effect.

It's still hilarious to me, well acted, clever and just a lot of fun. Everyone in this is delightful. It's not perfect but I still really enjoy it. Still not sure Tomei have an Oscar-worthy performance but she is good and wonderfully charming.I think this is absolutely worth visiting, whether you've never seen it or haven't in a long time. Fortunately, with it streaming right now, watching this is easier than ever.",

In the end, the movie gathers good momentum toward a good climax that makes one feel like cheering. If one listens to the inspirational climax without watching the screen, at that point you still feel like cheering.There are some very minor plot flaws, that one has to get past to enjoy the ending, but they are hardly noticeable and are not worth pointing out.The movie shows two guys Bill Gambini and Stan enrolled in UCLA who happened to be an Alabama store just prior to the store clerk being shot. They are arrested and questioned and they believe they were arrested for shoplifiting a can of tuna and confess to shoplifting, but are arreingned for murder of the shop clerk. Bill Gambini enlists the services of his cousin Vinny, who has passed the Bar and wants to be a lawyer. Vinny knows nothing about trial law and is therefore thrown into jail on his first few nights on the case, by Judge Haller.In the end Vinny and his Fianc\u00e9e Mona Lisa Vito recognize an error in the identification and we see Vinny shine as a lawyer.",

They think they have been arrested for shoplifting a can of tuna ....but the police had more sinister suspicions!!!! They desperately need a lawyer...Enter Vinny, an inexperienced lawyer played by Joe Pesci very ably portraying a New Yorker...Right from the word go, his acting is as sharp as a razor edge...The transition of Vinny from ignorance of 'procedure' to a confidence in his abilities is complete and a treat to watch. This combined with many extremely funny, embarrassing, misunderstanding, etc. moments catapult the movie to a 9 rating in my book..Much controversy has been generated on Marisa Tomei's performance & her Oscar for supporting Actress...I don't know why...Marisa gives a performance of her lifetime portraying Lisa, Vinny's girlfriend....Watch out for the deer speech and the courtroom scene right at the end....!!!",

The main thing about this film that works is the comedy and the performances by the cast that lifts up and enhances the comedic writing. Marisa Tomei is by far the best in the cast with her performance and her delivery of her lines. She deserved that academy award win. Her character is a tough, very New York woman who knows just about everything there is to know about cars. And that proves to be crucial in the court case. Joe Pesci is also very good in his role, Vincent gambini. He and Marisa have great chemistry together, whether it's in a romantic way or they're butting heads. Fred Gwyne is great as the judge, I mean could you have picked out a better more suitable fit for the overly strict judge? Who else besides Mr. Munster? The movie has well thought out pacing too, not too slow but also not too fast. It's not one sided either, it shows the point of view from Pesci and Tomei's, the judges, and Macchio and his friends. I liked that, each character got an ample amount of screen time. The ending is very clever and satisfying. Just when you think all hope is lost, Pesci comes up with a brilliant idea. 9/10.",

Of course Pesci was great - the woman in it, Marissa Tomei not only was quick, witty, gorgeous, but acted the part easily - and I think was the #1 actor in the movie. There's no doubt that My Cousin Vinny will be my favorite repeat picture in my library.

            "content": "Sometimes you walk into a place with a swagger, a confidence. Feeling that no matter what, you have this. Personally I'm not the most presumptuous person on the planet but I recall meeting with a condominium board submitting my application for approval on a duplex. This dwelling consisted of three upstairs bedrooms, two baths, washer/dryer with backyard and front porch. I was self employed with no debts and as far as I knew the board would whisk my application through toot sweet. Three middle aged persons sat across from me. The assessors went over my application with a look of disdain. I wondered what the looks of concerns were as they gazed upon those printed sheets. After a while I said \"WELL\"? They pulled out my credit report and found an item from 1982 where I was late on an equipment payment that amounted to $3000.00. To my knowledge the payment was made but the bad mark stood on my record. They told me to leave the room for a decision. A few minute passed, the condo board called me in and rejected my condominium application. I was shocked , I was livid, I was beside myself. I told them there all full of S--t! This brings me to the comedy where Brooklyn meets Alabama in the Courtroom comedy My Cousin Vinny. Driving in a southerly direction Billy Gambini (Ralph Macchio) and Stan Rothenstein (Mitchell Whitfield) stop off at a convenience store to buy some snacks. They accidentally swipe an extra can of tuna as the two leave the establishment and ride of in a mint green skylark convertible. A few moments later the local police pull them over and send them to the local police station. They are questioned by Sheriff Farley (Bruce McGill)and still in the dark as what they are charged for? A stolen can of tuna perhaps? No, their charged with first degree murder for killing the shop clerk at that convenience store. Off to prison the two youths or yutes go. Billy calls his Mom with the one phone call. Billy exasperated asks his Mom, \"Do we have any lawyers in the family?\" Enter our colorful couple Joe Pesce as Vincent Gambini as the leather clad fledgling attorney at large and mini skirted Mona Lisa Vito (Marissa Tomei) with her fling camera always ready for a picture. The two New Yorker's step out of there car totally out of place looking for Chinese food in rural Alabama. Attorney Gambini goes to the local prison to meet his defendants. Stan never met Vinny and thought he was another inmate wanting to have relations with him until cousin Billy wakes up and explains that this is our attorney. Stanley questions his credentials which are paltry and non applicable to this case . Vincent goes on about passing the Bar exam in 6 tries with zero courtroom experience. On to the hearing where Vinny Gambini meets the prosecutor Jim Trotter (Lane Smith) and the Judge The honorable Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne). Vinny seems very confident and comfortable sitting on the defendant's desk. The writer of this movie was very stringent in courtroom procedure which was very necessary in the making of the film. Vinny Gambini's abrasive behavior clashed with the Yale grad southern Judge as Vinny found himself time after time in contempt and off to prison for a good nights sleep with his defendants. Fred Gwynne plays the skeptical Judge as he constantly questions Gambini's experience or lack off. Procedure is Gambini's weakness but his he makes up for it in his aggressive questioning style in grits preparation, dirty screens and failing eye glasses. Marissa Tomei expertise in auto-motives is masterful despite being a hostile witness. Austin Pendleton adds some stuttering texture to a comedy filled trial you soon wont forget. The hysterical dialogue between Gywnne and Pesce would make a sullen John Housman crack a smile. Unfortunately this was one of Fred Gwynne's final performances as he was battling cancer and passed away a year later.",

What makes it heartwarming is Vinny's good nature. He dresses and acts tough but underneath the ruff exterior is a man willing to risk his reputation, freedom and relationship for those he holds dear. It shows the risks that family is willing to go for blood and nothing matters more in this world then keeping them close. Ralph Macchio, Fred Gwynne and Joe Pesci all gave Oscar worthy performances bringing their own sense of charm to the roles.

For me is has everything, great acting, an excellent script and, most importantly, it's funny. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please consider yourselves in contempt while I write the next paragraph).Two college students, Bill Gambini and Stan Rothenstein, from Brooklyn are on their way to LA via the South when they stop off in a small town in Alabama. They are mistakenly identified as the murderers of a clerk in a small store they had visited. Unable to afford a lawyer, they turn to Bill's cousin, Vinny Gambini, who has only been practicing law for six weeks. Vinny has brought his fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito, with him but he is determined to win the case on his own. Judge Chamberlain Haller is suspicious of Vinny's credentials but allows him to defend the two boys. Vinny immediately falls fowl of the accepted procedure in court and finds himself in contempt (more than once). The prosecution seem to have a strong case but Vinny is determined to find as many holes in it as he can. Will Vinny prove the boys innocence? Will the judge discover he is only a novice? Will Vinny ever get a decent night's sleep? All these questions and many more will be answered\u0085 but not here.First of all, hats off to Jonathan Lynn, I love the way he just lets the story unfold and the way he allows the characters to develop. Yes, there are one or two clunky bits, but for the most part I also very much liked the dialogue. Finally, great casting, I couldn't imagine anyone else apart from Joe Pesci playing the part of Vinny. Also, I thought Marisa Tomei was excellent as Mona Lisa Vito, a role for which she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and it was great to see Fred Gwynne (yes Herman Munster) as Judge Chamberlain Haller. Honourable mentions should also go to; Ralph Macchio as Bill, Mitchell Whitfield as Stan and Lane Smith as Jim Trotter III, the prosecutor.I may be biased, but I saw this film many years ago and fell in love with it then. It's one of those I always get great pleasure from watching. If anything, it is a little long, but I can forgive that, I think when you're invested in the story the time factor becomes less important. Over all, a very well scripted film with some really great comic performances and one which I highly recommend.My score: 8.2/10",

            "content": "Starring: Joe Pesci, Ralph Macchio, Marisa Tomei, Fred Gwynne One of the classic tried-and-true comedy formulas is to have some sort of character mismatch. Throw one type of person or group of people in with another person or group who is totally different, and there are all sorts of things that can be done with it. My Cousin Vinny borrows this formula and does a pretty good job with it if I do say so myself.Bill Gambini (Macchio) and his friend Stan are driving back to New York, taking the scenic route through Alabama. They stop at a convenience store to get some gas and a few \"groceries\" for the road. Bill stuffs a can of tuna into his pocket because his arms are too full with other stuff and forgets to pay for it at the front, then they leave and get back out on the road. A few miles down the road, a cop is on their tail, the flashers go, and they get pulled over. They think it's for shoplifting the can of tuna, but little do they know that the clerk at the convenience store they were just in is now freshly murdered. So they get hauled off to jail on the assumption that it's for shoplifting a can of tuna, all the time wondering why there's such a fuss over one simple can of food.When they do eventually find out that they have been charged with murder and accessory to murder, the jaws drop and panic sets in. Bill uses his phone call to call his mom, who informs him that they have a lawyer in the family. His cousin Vinny (Pesci).So Vinny and his fianc\u00e9 Mona Lisa Vito (Tomei) drive down to Alabama. Two New Yorkers clad in leather in the middle of Alabama. There's a really funny scene when Vinny goes to visit the boys in jail and Stan thinks that it's some inmate who has come to make them their sex slaves. Vinny at one point says, quote, \"So let's do our best to just make this a simple in and out procedure.\" Sure it's a little bit dirty, but dang if it isn't funny.That's pretty much the most important plot points of the movie. The majority of the movie focuses on Vinny, who is completely inexperienced as a trial attorney, trying to win this case that could save the life of his cousin and his cousin's friend. The chemistry that Vinny and the Judge (Gwynne) have on the screen is truly hilarious as they are constantly at each other's throats and on each other's nerves.As usual, it's the kind of movie where you know the ending long before it gets there, but it's not like we're watching a suspense flick. It's a comedy, and a highly entertaining one at that.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (definitely worth a view)",

In defending a relative and his friend he must clear them of a murder of which they are totally innocent....but seems like the boys worst nightmare come true. This is a comedy that stands out alongside \"Dumb and Dumber\" and \"There's something about Mary\" as one of the greatest and most enjoyable comedy of the 90's. Tomei and Pesci, playing the bickering pre-marriage couple, and the superlative performance of the late Fred Gwynne as the judge, allow the film to often remain hilarious, even when there are no direct jokes being made. Indeed, it is the scenes involving the intolerant Gwynne and the naive Pesci that often lead to the films most comical scenes. The overall outcome is a little predictable, and the plot remains on a strict path, but this should not deter anybody against viewing this often remarkably funny, clever and original film. The turnaround of the seemingly useless Gambini and the manner in which he turns this Alabama state town upside down is a joy to behold as he often bluffs his way to a tense and cleverly crafted conclusion. This judicial comedy is a treat and deserves every accolade it receives.",

Although Marisa Tomei does a fine job with her script, I think her 20 year age difference with Vinny (Joe Pesci) is too much for their relationship to be believable. Also, Tomei looks 10 years younger than her age so that doesn't help! However, I wouldn't change Joe Pesci as Vinny and Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for her role as Lisa, so what do I know?! Some of the best humor comes from Vinny's way with words and how people misinterpret what's he saying.

            "content": "\"My Cousin Vinny\" is a screwball comedy, and while it's consistently amusing, its humor factor is more wit, rather than side-splitting gags. That's okay, because this is a movie that would play best on cable TV.Billy Gambini (Ralph Macchio) and Stan Rothenstein (Mitchell Whitfield) are two friends on their way to college. Along the way, they stop at a little shop in small-town Alabama, and after a few misunderstandings (including a forgot-to-pay-for can of tuna), the two of them end up being charged with the murder of the clerk. To avoid \"getting fried,\" Billy's mom hires the lawyer in the family, his cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci). Unfortunately for Billy and Stan, not only Vinny new at the job, he has absolutely no idea what he's doing! My first exposure to Joe Pesci was when he played the inept criminal Harry in the \"Home Alone\" movies. There he made it clear that he's an adept comedian. If you were to take his buffoonery in that movie, amp it up way past the eleven and throw in a huge does of Fran Drescher from \"The Nanny,\" you'd get Vinny Gambini. He's rude, crude, and totally clueless. Fortunately, he's got his fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei) to help. She may be as Brooklyney brash as he is, but she's no ditz. Marisa Tomei is delightful as Lisa. She's interesting because while she has the energy and the personality of a brainless bimbo, she's smarter than Vinny, and frequently saves his neck from the messes he gets himself into. Fred Gwynne, in his final film appearance as the procedure-loving judge, is perfectly cast. His imposing size and deep voice make him an imposing figure, but Gwynne uses that for humorous purposes. The banter between him and Vinny are some of the film's highlights. The other cast members, Macchio, Whitfield (who is still funny despite playing the stereotypical Jewish neurotic), Austin Pendleton and the late Lane Smith, are good as well.But for all the good qualities it has, \"My Cousin Vinny\" isn't that good. It's amusing, but barely diverting. It's one to watch on TV, but not something to rush out and see.",

It's alright when you first watch it but it's one of those films which I can watch again and again without getting bored because it has so much good stuff in it(Galaxy Quest is shaping up that way as well). The whole cast works a treat. Marisa Tomei is excellent as Pesci's foil(as well as goil), well deserving of her Oscar.

            "content": "This is not a thematically ambitious or layered film. It is a fairly surface level exploration of a 'fish out of water' situation. Vinny is a thoroughbred New Yorker who has suddenly been forced to visit and spend time in rural Alabama to get his cousin and his friend off a murder case. If that in itself doesn't make him feel out of place, the feeling gets intensified when he finds out how inept he is in terms of wrapping his head around the technical sides of being a lawyer.As aforementioned, the film doesn't make any effort to be anything other than an uncomplicated comedy and in terms of achieving its objective, it hits the bull's eye. Director Jonathan Lynn manages to perfectly capture the light-hearted tone necessary for the film and his comic timing in terms of staging and editing of particular scenes is great. Of course the script makes use of plot machinations and conveniences to join the narrative dots, but when I'm laughing and enjoying myself so much, those contrivances end up not mattering too much.One of the big reasons why 'My Cousin Vinny' was such a joyful experience for me was the acting. Both Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei are on fire. Pesci plays a character who retains some of the stereotypical Italian-American tropes of Tommy from 'Goodfellas', but he tweaks his eccentricities just enough to make Vinny seem funny and likable instead of looking like a psychotic killer. Tomei is an absolute dynamite in every scene. Her heightened facial gestures and Brooklyn accent along with her pitch perfect timing make it impossible for the viewer to not break out in laughter on multiple occasions. The chemistry between Pesci and Tomei is essential for the film to work. Fred Gwynne needs to be admired too for his role as the overbearing Judge Haller. He plays a perfect foil for Vinny during the courtroom scenes and their exchanges are laugh out loud funny.'My Cousin Vinny' is not an 'important' film from a filmmaking standpoint. It isn't offering any profundities, philosophies or messages. All it wants is to make the viewer laugh, and it achieves that feat tremendously well.",

The thick New York accent at first doesn't sit well with the South but soon his skills come out. A lot of people seem to forget that this picture did lukewarm business at the box office and had several negative reviews when it was first release. I enjoyed the movie at the time of its release but I didn't think it was anything overly great but this is a great example of how a movie just gets better with age. Today MY COUSIN VINNY is rightfully considered one of the best comedies of its time and the performances here are just downright classic and make the film so special. Of course you've got Pesci and that terrific line delivery that adds so many laughs. Just the way he's able be to over-the-top in some of his line delivery is just flawless and the chemistry he has with the supporting cast is where much of the heart of the film comes from. Fred Gwynne plays the tough Southern judge and gets one of the greatest roles in his career and he does a remarkable job with it. The back and forth between Pesci and Gwynne is just so perfect that it never grows old no matter how many times you see the film. Oscar-winner Marisa Tomei is flawless in her role as the girlfriend and we get great support from Ralph Macchio, Lane Smith, Bruce McGill and Austin Pendleton. The film has so many classic sequences that the long 118-minute running time flies by without any dry or slow moments. There's no question that the film contains some of the biggest laughs of the decade and it's also fair to call this thing a classic.",

Joe Pesci was brilliant and funny in his Brooklyn Guido type of way and Marisa was awesome as his girlfriend. She is downright beautiful and her lip-smacking style of talking was dead-on. She deserved that Oscar and not too many win Oscars for comedy but she proved you can do it and do it well!",

Just the idea of the plot, with an inept lawyer who finally passed the Bar exam having to win over his first case, is a great concept. Joe Pesci is as funny as he was in \"Home Alone\" several years before. Marisa Tomei, however (in her Oscar-winning performance), actually ends up stealing the show and becoming the most entertaining character in the film. Her New York accent and funny dialogue with great methods of delivery are hilarious, and I have to disagree with anyone who feels she did not deserve her Oscar. Some of the funniest material in the film is watching Pesci and Tomei try to adapt to the courtroom setting and the new town they are staying in. This is not monumental film-making, and it's not a perfect movie. The story takes a little too long to get going, and it's not until the end that the plot finally starts to build. Nevertheless, it's still a great way to spend a few hours, and this film is sure to entertain.*** out of ****",

That is the beautifully perfect Marisa Tomei. Her comedic timing was amazing to watch and she is so adorable, it made my teeth hurt to watch her.Following closely in a great performance is Joe Pesci.

Joe Pesci plays Vincent LaGuardia Gambini, a Brooklyn lawyer who is asked to defend his cousin and friend from a murder charge in Alabama. Marisa Tomei as Mona Lisa Vito, Vinny's girlfriend, deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, rare for a comedy to even be nominated for anything by AMPAS. I really liked Fred Gwynne as the no-nonsense Judge Chamberlain Haller, a great foil for Joe Pesci's laid back, easy going Brooklyn wise guy. Even his name, Chamberlain Haller, evokes seriousness. A lot of fun, especially the courtroom antics of Pesci. Highly recommended.",

Of course this has some hilarious consequences in which Vinny (Joe Pesci) does a fantastic role. Marisa Tomei plays the part of Vinny's girlfriend with a love for automobiles. The chemistry between the main characters is great and the jokes are fresh and really funny. One of my favorite characters besides Vinny is the judge, masterfully portrayed by Fred Gwynne.

Short money means they may not be able to afford competent legal representation...but...ta-da...Cousin Vinny is a family member who is a lawyer, and comes to the rescue. Only thing is...he's only been practicing for six weeks, and has only done personal injury. Plus, his big city ways clash with this backwards , sleepy, southern town. The main point of the movie is how Pesci keeps a step ahead of the game with lies, mis-statements, mis-representations...and a a girlfriend in Marisa Tomei, who is not only a sexpot...she's smarter than he is. Especially about cars. He gives Judge Fred Gwynne (in his final film) apoplexy...and Gwynne gives him time for contempt. Finally, Vinny gets his legal legs and decides to face this thing directly...just like a full fledged criminal lawyer...though he's NEVER tried a case before...not even personal injury. You know it's got to be hilarious, and the joke is on Pesci, even though he manages to fool everyone.

College boys Bill and Stan are accidentally accused of a murder in a small Alabama town. Their only hope to avoid the death penalty is Bill's cousin Vinny, an inexperienced but aging lawyer. Firstly, the plot is a classic and widely interesting topic: you can't go wrong with a courtroom drama. Courtroom dramas entertain thousands of people on reality television, though this film is definitively a step above. The idiosyncrasies and personal flair that Vinny (Joe Pesci) brings to the film are glorious and unique. Judge Haller (Fred Gwynne) is no doubt the epitome of imposing and somber old men, and his dower and by-the-book attitude clash with Vinny's Brooklyn sensibilities. Jonathan Lynn made precise and brilliant directing choices with this film. He mentioned in an interview that he wanted to create protagonists that were not interchangeable with other generic leading men and women. In tandem with lead editor Stephen Elliott Rivkin, the pair cultivated this wry comedy. Now, the way that Vinny treats his fiancee Mona Lisa (Marisa Tomei) is unacceptable by today's standards. He is rude and dismissive of her ideas, sexist and misogynistic, and actively tells her to put down a book and don't bother learning about the law. She does, in the end, play an important role in the outcome of the case, but she is not treated with any dignity and is dragged into the courtroom kicking and screaming. Overall, this movie is good for a laugh if you enjoy wry humor, and is a fantastic example of how to execute a film with such chaotic content in an elegant and precise manner.",

Pesci himself won the American Comedy Award as lead actor in the film and Fred Gwynne (\"Car 54, Where are You?\" and \"The Munsters\") received a well deserved supporting actor nomination for his portrayal of consummate, deep southern judge, Chamberlain Haller. Ralph Macchio (Bill Gambini) stole the tearful hugging scene finale the same way he did in the first \"Karate Kid\" movie and his small acting performance was flawless. Not only does the humour in this 1992 comedy hold up well but it is also a good depiction of rural Alabama culture.

            "content": "My Cousin Vinny is the improbable but entertaining movie about two college grads who, after road tripping through the South, end up mistakenly arrested for the murder of a convenience store clerk in Alabama. Ralph Macchio (still looking like a pretty boyish 30-year- old) and Mitchell Whitfield (later Rachel's ex-fianc\u00e9 Barry on Friends) play the grads who call on Macchio's character's cousin to use his newly-minted law degree to help them out. Here enters Joe Pesci as Vinny, along with Marisa Tomei as his fianc\u00e9 Mona to save the day.From there the movie jumps into the trial proceedings rather quickly, where in Movie and TV Land murder trials are scheduled just a week after arraignments! The movie proceeds to discuss the lack of trial experience Vinny has, especially with murder cases. There is a side plot involving the judge (played by Fred Gwynne) begrudgingly approving Vinny to practice law outside of New York and Vinny using aliases to distract and stall him while he proceeds with the defense. Lane Smith does an underrated job as the D.A., playing his character sly but fair.Pesci and Tomei get the majority of the laughs throughout the film as they navigate the terrain of Southern Living and their domestic issues. There's a neat scene early on if you pay attention where they are arguing about something trivial with both of them so wanting to win and you realize that's why this May December romance works. Pesci earns his chuckles from playing the fish out of water New Yorker. Tomei charms her way into an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress and somehow comes up with a new outfit for every day of the trial even if they don't live there. Macchio and Whitfield don't really have much to do here except have a front row seat watching the pros run with it, which is easy for all us to do at home as well. Enjoy.",

My personal favorite of all scenes, though, was in the motel with the dripping faucet. Mona Lisa's description of how she torqued the faucet handle was genius!Joe Pesci pulls off the role of the fumbling attorney at law was great. Imagine your favorite wise guy from The Sopranos who decided to go to law school - and flunk his bar exam multiple times. Then, put him in the courtroom for the first real trial of his life. Would you really want him to represent you? I guess, in this case, blood was certainly thicker than water. The \"utes\" ultimately hung in there with him, and (thanks to Mona Lisa), justice prevailed.Marisa Tomei most certainly was the show-stealer, and most deserving of her Oscar. Each time I see her, I appreciate her more as an actor - and more as a woman. What a great addition to any film (particularly, in recent times, as Lola in \"What Women Want!\"I own this movie, and never tire of watching it.

            "content": "Prior to watching this film some years ago, I was told on numerous occasions and by various individuals, how painfully funny it was. It was painful all right, but in my opinion, it was anything but funny. In fact it's only equal in terms of heralded comedic disappointment is the disastrous \"Get Shorty\".First of all, hat's off to Ralph Macchio who took yet another step toward becoming one of Hollywood's all time whiniest actors. Secondly, Joe Pesci his agent or someone at the studio should have known better. I have a great deal of respect for the man and all that he's accomplished, but let's face it, he's tried on a number of different levels and comedy simply isn't his forte.Marisa Tomei's performance was refreshingly amusing, but not nearly enough to make the film worth watching, much less earn her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. This brings me to the first of two reasons that I decided to Contribute my two cents toward such an awful movie. I recently saw a film in which Tomei plays a similar comedic yet provocative supporting role. \"Slums of Beverly Hills\" is a must see for her many die-hard fans, it's far less popular than this one, but considerably more humorous.The second reason for my commentary is Tomei's trial testimony, which leads to the immediate acquittal of Macchio and his partner. The fact that the case was closed with no evidence other than the \"positive traction\" tire marks from a crime scene photograph is absolutely ludicrous, not to mention an insult to anyone who knows better.The film was released in 1992 and set in the same time frame. The car they choose to use was manufactured the late 60's or early 70's. Under normal circumstances, there's probably a fifty percent chance that the rear end in this automobile would have been changed in that length of time. The chances of someone making such an upgrade to the drive train of this particular vehicle are unlikely and would probably be purely incidental, but far from impossible. I grew up in the Mid 1980's, a time when working on your own car was not only an option, but for a teenager it was a privilege and in many cases a necessity. I'm not a mechanic, nor do I play one on TV, never the less I performed this very function by myself at age sixteen.I realize that this was supposed to be a comedy and that hauling the jury out to the impound lot for a test drive could have further enhanced the awkwardness of its ending, but if that doesn't work then try something else. Here's a thought, have Macchio's Auntie Em, or whomever, remind him prior to leaving for his vacation, that the car he's taking has less than fifteen miles on it and that it's only been driven to church, (next door), and to the grocery store, (next door\u0085 other direction). Bottom line, the filmmakers had the opportunity to give us the benefit of not assuming that we all share the same degree of automotive ignorance. By failing to do so they further damaged an already irreparable film and have successfully wasted a little more of my time.",

This is a funny, witty, oftentimes sarcastic film that makes you really like the main characters. It entices you to wait and see exactly how the movie is going to end, even though the outcome seems fairly obvious from the get-go. But in the case of this movie, it's not about the finish line, but about the path which leads there.-Humour: The dialogue in 'My Cousin Vinny' contains a lot of swearing, but the swearing is so funny and so well mixed in with the action, that the film invariably seems dull if you try to see the syndicated TV version. Some lines are so smart and full of clever irony that you will laugh even if you've seen the scene before. It's not all funny, like the Naked Gun movies, though. 20/25-Physical Comedy: There are a few funny bits of physical comedy; most from Joe Pesci, naturally. And it is quite entertaining to see Marisa Tomei in a backless, one-piece, flower body-suit arguing with Mr. Pesci about her biological clock. 12/20-Plot: This film has a very interesting plot, that keeps the viewer's attention until the end. A couple of innocent-looking boys from New York are being trialed for murder in a town in Alabama, and they call Vinny, one of the boys' cousin, who is a lawyer, to help them for free. 15/15-Ending: I liked the ending very much. Of course, taste varies. 10/10-Theme: What can happen to strangers in a small town in the countryside, and the conflict between two completely different types of people. It's very interesting to see sparks fly due to this conflict. Of course, if you want to see this theme taken to the extreme, there's always 'Nothing But Trouble' ('Valkenvania'). 8/10-Nudity: There is no nudity in this film. 0/8-Cast: Joe Pesci, Ralph Macchio and, of course, Marisa Tomei are not only well-known actors, but they are also awesome in this movie. Fred Gwynne, as the judge, and Bruce McGill, as the sheriff, are great, too, and practically all the actors are very believable. 7/8-Genre: This is a comedy. 4/4-->Overall: 76/100To sum it up, this is a very good movie to watch whenever you can, because it's very hard to get bored of it. For some people, it might seem even better the second time. From Swordlord, 3 swords up!",

            "content": "Watched this movie for the first time in 2021. I have heard the title a few times since the 90's but never got to see it before. I give it 4 points as it gives you an eye into what was considered funny in the late 80's (early 90's). I'm pretty sure 1992 me would had enjoyed the movie a lot and this is like a museum piece of something that today is outdated. It has a lot of the structure and gags of that era. And I don't hate everything from the 90's movies, I still enjoy some comedies and for court dramas John Grisham movies are still very watchable, these rely on clever underdogs and this ages better.But in 2021 the movie looks like a sort of train wreck. It is hard to watch as most of the fun is connected to having a stereotypical view of the south that looks kind of bigoted in 2021 (even in 2010 maybe). The characters are too exaggerated and you have to have the mind of a teenager to think they represent real people in a real situation. The problem is that even taken as a cartoonish tale it does not make sense as you know how you were supposed to think about the characters being around in 1992. I was supposed to find Pesci charming and funny because he does not have those rigid values of those Alabama folks, but he looks like a total idiot and if he wins at the end is because of the miracle of 80's scriptwriting.The movie tries to play as a hopeful, goofy movie where the main character is able to overcome big obstacles and impossible odds. But you kind of know as an adult that the man was probably a loser all the time. It also has the drama of a conspiracy in a corrupt south that is kind of out of place for a humor movie, it may had made some sense if the corruption could not be taken seriously. But even though it is obvious there is some conspiracy going on, after like 30 min anyway - in the beginning it is not clear if this is a comedy of errors, it is hard to side with Cousin Vinny. You know in real life if this was a real thing, it would be a tragedy. In 1992 maybe I would fall for street smart Italian-American, full of confidence under achiever. So I would definitely recommend this movie to 1992 me, he would had enjoyed the heck out of it!Part of the comedy relies on Pesci being totally unaware of how out of place he is, but with 2021 glasses only a mentally handicapped character would not be aware of how he was out of place and how bad was his appearance and demeanor in the court. And the seriousness of the case does not match. The script is kind of a train wreck in what genre this is supposed to fall.As other people has commented is not even clear why Marisa Tomei was able to get an Oscar for this performance. 1992 me would have enjoyed it as Tomei was eye candy by 90's standards (I wanted to marry her in Anger Management), but the character is just too simple by today's standards.Adding this so anyone that finds the movie similarly dissapointing by 2021 does not think he watched a different movie that the ones that give it 10 and pretend this is a comedy that makes you laugh from beginning to end and leaves you uplifted.",

            "content": "My cousin vinny is another hilarious comedy that I have to tip my hat to. Joe Pesci is great for the role. He's a (so-called) attorney from New York that travels down to Alabama to defend his cousin Bill (Ralph Macchio) and his friend Stan (Mitchell Whitfield) and get them cleared of the 1st degree murder charge the state has on them. Now he says he's an attorney but, he has very little experience. He has never had a murder case before nor has he done any other case, nor has he EVEN gone to court, EVER! Vinny really starts having a really hard time down in the south, other than the case; he has his impatient girlfriend Lisa (Marisa Tomei) who is really getting tired of waiting for Vinny to marry her as soon as he won his first case. Yet he's really having trouble with the case, because every time he's in the court room he looks like does not even know what he's doing! Not to mention the court's judge who just flat out hates him and as Vinny says \"he's just aching to throw me in jail\". I don't want to say much more but, he does happen to say that he went to law school in Brooklyn, New York, yet he really never has gone to law school. Anyway, this film a Comedy of trial and error is a hoot. I recommend this film to comedy lovers as well. I give \"8\".",

The story and picture of this movie is pretty dull. But does standup comedy have a story or punch-line to it? Joe Pesci does a superb job in playing a dumb hot-tempered never-graduated lawyer, and Marisa Tomei does an extraordinary job playing Joe Pesci's wife with an overdone Brooklyn accent. There is no steering in this movie, and definitely doesn't need concentration. It is fast paced and well, just plain funny. My overall rating, 2.5 out of 6.",

Joe is a master communicator who will keep you listening attentively to hear every word he has to utter in his unique special accent. He was not only very funny but also intelligent and pragmatic despite all the odds he faced in winning the case. Marisa, was not only sexy but also unforgettable. (One of the top 10 most attractive women in the world.) She deserved an academy award for her role as Joe's girlfriend. Very entertaining and exciting movie that will keep you laughing from the beginning to the end. You could watch this movie many times in a day without being tired. I highly recommend this movie to all readers. Ikey Benney, New York City",

            "content": "This movie takes place in Alabama, not Georgia. Follows the story of a pair of New York Italians journeying through the south when they suddenly find themselves charged with a convenience store robbery and murder. One of their cousins (hence the title) Vinny comes down with his fianc\u00e9e to defend the pair. The film's major theme involves Vinny overcoming not only the cultural gap that exists between him and the Alabama legal system, but also his inexperience with the law. Over the course of the film Vinny has many epiphanies, all of which impact the trial in various ways, some positively and some negatively; most of these involve at least a few comedic elements. One of the graces of this film is that it uniquely utilizes the local color of both Alabama and New York simultaneously -- not just accents, but also the norms of both regions are well represented. At times these references may border too close to stereotype for some, but ultimately they are within the spirit of the film.",

I usually watch it straight through at least once a year --it's an easy, LIGHT comedy --The type of movie that is sure to age well -It should never become dated. The acting performances are universally winning --from Pesci and Tomei on the top end down to the townspeople.This movie has a double \"fish out of water\" motif----First- Pesci and Tomei as New Yorkers thrown willy nilly into the life of a small Southern town and then Pesci again as a fledgling lawyer on his first trial.Pesci is the lynch pin here -- I like Tomei also-however-like others who have posted -I really question her getting an Oscar for this performance--the only character her character effectively plays off of is Pesci's character---rather a huge concession to make for what would be considered worthy for an Oscar. Gwynne is outstanding as the judge--I liked Lane Smith's prosecutor also -Machio's character is only incidental--The plot is sharp and intelligent-the course of the trial is surprisingly logical and well formed---I know that a couple of posters have had problems with the technical details of the ending -but it makes good enough sense for the 99 out of 100 people who know little or nothing about cars--My favorite scenes include the interaction between Pesci and Gwynne---Pesci blowing away the prosecution witnesses on cross examination-----Pesci charging out of the cabin -gun blazing after hearing an OWL hoot.....The stuttering public defender is good for a chuckle also------",

            "content": "This movie has all the makings of a real dud. The big-city guy tries to defend two kids charged with murder in the South. With this scenario, it could easily have degenerated into hopeless stereotyping.What a nice surprise to discover that the film resists the temptation to deal in stereotypes, and instead presents the characters as real human beings. The big-city guy (Joe Pesci) tries to learn some things about the Southern culture, and is then able to use this to his advantage during the trial. The Judge (Fred Gwynne) and the prosecutor (Lane Smith, known for playing the newspaperman Perry White on \"Lois & Clark) are appropriately bemused by Pesci's attempts to represent his clients (it is his first case), but instead of making it impossible for him to function, they maintain a tolerant attitude, keeping in mind that the overall purpose of the proceeding is to do justice.SPOILER Marisa Tomei is absolutely fabulous as Joe Pesci's girlfriend, and her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress was well-deserved. She tries to support him as best she can, but the inevitable stress and strain of the trial causes a strain on their relationship. When Pesci puts her on the stand as an expert witness on car mechanics, she is mad at Pesci and it shows, prompting the Judge to ask \"Do you two know each other?\" When Pesci explains that they do, the Judge says \"That would explain the hostility.\" A hilarious moment, but her subsequent testimony is quite serious and turns out to be a key to the defense case. In response to her testimony, the prosecution expert witness admits that Tomei is right. Here again, the filmmakers could have degenerated into stereotyping by having her testimony attacked, but do not stoop to this. The key is the pursuit of truth, which, after all, is what a trial is supposed to be about. Unlike other films about trials (\"The Verdict\" comes to mind), where the desire to win seems to take precedence over anything else, this film gives a balanced portrayal of the legal system. Joe Pesci is one of my favorite actors, and he does not disappoint here. The film is a nice breath of fresh air.9/10",

But of all the many good things about this movie, I want to concentrate on one.I saw the movie years ago when it was new, and I didn't particularly pay attention to Ralph Macchio's performance. But re-watching it, I am struck by what a nuanced, subtle performance he gives. He doesn't overact, he never goes over the top. He's always perfectly modulated, natural and honest.For instance, I liked the scene where he and his pal first go into their prison cell. I was expecting some big statement, maybe ironic, philosophical, or in despair. But Macchio sighs. And not a heavy sigh, just a plain sigh. Understated and subtle. That just rang true to me.Another scene that impressed me was when the two guys have been exonerated, and Macchio is hugging Vinny. He is definitely about to cry -- just on the verge of bursting into tears. But no tears appear. How does an actor play \"just on the verge of bursting into tears, but no tears\"? I don't know, but Macchio does it, and it's very clear.I would put Macchio's work in this movie in the category of \"understated, honest brilliance.\"P. S. A quibble: how come nobody in this movie can pronounce \"accessory\"? They all say \"assessory.\" That bugs me.",

Lack of energy in the acting by the two 'criminals' makes them non-entities, which is OK, because everyone else is perfect and the movie clicks like a well-oiled machine. Marisa Tomei wears her part as perfectly as she does her outrageous New York outfits, and this tends to obscure what a great job the other major actors and director have done in polishing this gem. See it when you want to walk away feeling really good.

More character based (as can be made out from the title itself) than mystery based.The comedy mostly hit the right notes.Music was good.I loved the character of Vinny - Never Die, Always Learning attitude and the smarts, warmth and compassion of Lisa.Conclusion: Fun movie, can be enjoyed with entire family.",
