These statements should be self-evident.Therefore if SOMMWS is so bad why did a reputable director and a canny star have anything to do with it?The answer is that it isn't a bad film at all,when I saw it the cinema audience gave every appearance of huge enjoyment,many of Miss Getty's one - liners induced such laughter that Mr Stallone's rueful responses were often inaudible.I believe the trouble lies in the fact that many critics refuse to accept that Mr Stallone is in fact quite an accomplished light comedian as well as being an action star of proved bankability. As an LA detective having his mother over for a visit he is able to play against type in this fish out of water comedy.As mother,Miss Estelle Getty seizes a rare big screen opportunity and makes every line count.She is an innocent abroad in big bad LA,blithely going where wise men fear to tread. SOMMWS is not ground - breaking stuff,but it is old - fashioned funny. You could take your mother to see it - but don't ask her to stay over.",

            "content": "Sylvester Stallone is an iconic action star and Estelle Getty was a hilarious, sarcastic and witty Golden Girl. Put the two together and you'll get yourself one charming action-comedy, where tough Los Angeles cop Sgt. Joe Bomowski (Stallone) gets a visit from his nurturing, feisty and fearless mother Tutti (Getty), who beings to meddle in Joe's life affairs, interfering with his police work and love life.There are some very oddball and corny humor with some campy dialog in the movie, at mostly the expense of Stallone and Getty. The supporting actors were given the back burner and the villains were forgettable. And yet, while the plot goes at a very steady-pace with limited action, I've found the comedic chemistry between Stallone and Getty, which make up most of the movie, to be pretty entertaining and fun to watch and is, at times, heartwarming. Getty's obsessive behavior to be very baby-nurturing to Stallone as he responds in his frustrated way is itself classic. And, it's not everyday you see a petite, motherly, 68 year-old lady brandish a gun and deal with gangsters!While not an action flick that would blow you out of your seats, you will get several laughs out of this movie.Grade B-",

            "content": "I have little to say about this movie other than it is nowhere near as bad as I'd been led to believe. Actually quite amusing in places, it will strike a chord with anyone who has an interfering mother (and God knows I have!) as Estelle Getty invades Stallone's life.I fail to see the reason for all the bad spirit directed at this film. The incidental music is a little repetitive and it's admittedly a one-joke plot. But it is a fairly good joke, and would have made for a superb hour-length TV movie. Unfortunately it's a 90 minute cinema film and so doesn't maintain its momentum all the way through.I've seen people criticise the film for Stallone not getting to be \"funny\" in this movie. I mean, have you heard of a straight man?? Sylvester's contribution to the comedy is his underplayed reaction to his mother's obsessive behaviour. What do you expect him to do, dress up and tell jokes?Admittedly, the surprisingly violent aspects of the film don't sit well, and it's hard to laugh at Getty when she's just shot a man and splattered his blood all over an airplane runway. Another problem is that her chemistry with Stallone isn't as pin-sharp as it could be; the two leave notable pauses in between lines. Maybe a few more takes could have honed up the reaction time, but generally it's fine, and Stallone really makes an effort to make it work.Not an all-time classic, certainly, but a pleasant enough film to pass a Sunday afternoon. Just don't listen to the nay-sayers, watch it yourself and make up your own mind. 5/10.",

            "content": "Los Angeles police detective Joe Bomowski isn't as tough as he looks. He's actually quite vulnerable, if you look at his romantic relationship with Lt. Gwen Harper. And his mother is coming from Newark for a visit. This time, she didn't answer the phone, figuring it would be Joe telling her why she couldn't come.So when Joe arrives at the airport to pick her up, everyone is laughing at him. Even flight attendants. They've all seen the photos and heard the embarrassing stories. And on the way to his house, Joe has to help a man who is threatening to jump from a tall building. Don't worry--one of the classic moments in the history of comedy movies guarantees a happy outcome here.And Joe's mom witnesses a murder. This is after she has cleaned his apartment, pleaded with him not to do anything dangerous, and done everything else possible to make him feel like a second-grader. But she won't let anyone work on the case except her son--which also means she has to be his partner! How is this possible? She's so tough she won't let anyone scare her with threats of arrest for providing false information to the police. And Joe's mom can do it all! Watch her drive the car in a chase scene. And the movie's title is a line spoken by her son to a suspect.The amazing thing is that when he was 13, Joe was the strong one when his father died. So his mom knows what he is capable of. Her explanation of how he handled the situation gives the movie one of its several tender moments.I shouldn't have listened when people said this film was bad. I would have seen it so much sooner. Estelle Getty was great, and while Sylvester Stallone didn't seem quite suited to this type of role, he was good enough. I liked the character. But, yes, he can do comedy. Remember \"Oscar\"? I remember I liked him in that.I liked several other performances. Dennis Burkley as the big tough gun salesman (the one with the van), and Nicholas Sadler as the man on the ledge (I thought he was one of the Lawrence brothers!). And as always, Gailard Sartain as a big buffoon of a bad guy. And JoBeth Williams as Gwen. I can't forget her.This is my kind of movie, and while it's obviously not Oscar material, it's quite entertaining.",

In no time she's trying to 'improve' him with motherly advice, improve his diet and get him back together with his lady love. It never dips into sentimentality or become too serious, and is a quality, well-paced production in general.Happening to catch this on TV recently, I'd long forgotten that Sly can not only act when he wants to, but has excellent comic timing. (He really should have not spent so much time trying to be an action hero, but explored his dramatic and comic abilities). There are some really good moments, such as when his mom squares up to a sly villain threatening her son and comes out with a catchphrase of Sly's real-life rival Arnie Schwartzenegger.The only criticism I'd give is that toward the end a slightly laborious car chase is thrown in, but thankfully the comedy returns as his interfering mom steps in again. Good entertainment, and it really, really deserves at least a couple of stars more on the IMDb rating.",

Whether Sylvester Stallone , whom the latter do not favor or anything else, is to blame, but from my point of view this picture is underestimated and even humiliated by people who are considered large quantities in the world of cinema.One has only to remind that the poor \" cinema \" prize \" golden raspberry \" in 1993 went to two actors of this ordinary, seemingly comedy. In general, the film has already ripped off three \" awards \", for the worst scenario as well. And that's strange, in spite of the critics and haters, \"Stop! or my mom will shoot\" continues to be popular with ordinary people, who do not see themselves as cinema gourmets from the industry, but simply enjoy the simple and humorous humor inside which lies an equally light, but equally important, meaning.Meaning, close and understandable to a good half of the population of the entire globe. The simple and touching relationship between adult children and elderly parents will always be that way, although less exaggerated. And in general, the question of fathers and children in all spheres of art, starting with books and ending with cinema, was invariably relevant, and this picture shows this.Great movie, easy humor, pleasant game of actors, simple plot, all this is in the comedy \"Stop, or my mother will shoot\", enjoy, and remember that critics do not always tell the truth.",

Every time it tries to be witty or clever or smart it slips up.Sylvester Stallone plays Joe Bomowski (I wonder of what ethnic background they want us to think he belongs to??), a big city cop whose pesky little mother Tutti (Estelle Getty) comes to visit him and manages to single-handedly destroy his life.First she makes a mockery of his job by visiting the police after reporting herself to be a witness of a murder. Soon the pair - mother and son - are teaming up to track down a mother-killer and...oh yeah...in between we get loads of lame gags about how desperately aggravating mothers can be.This would have been a really great film - if it were three minutes long. The material is barely enough to sustain a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit - even then it would be aggravating. The plot is cutesy - so are all the gags, lines and characters. I felt like b****-slapping Estelle Getty and you know there's something wrong when you want to beat up an old woman.The plot basically works like this, scene after scene: 1. Annoying Mother Figure tries to control Son's life.2. Son is angry. He tells her he likes having his underwear strewn across the floor and likes to leave the seat up.3. Annoying Mother Figure tells him he'll never get a wife this way, and mentions his ex-girlfriend who left him.4. Son Figure rolls his eyes and says \"Oh Mom, don't bring that up again.\" 5. Aggravating Mother Figure says a cute one-liner.6. Put-Upon Son looks put-upon.Repeat and rinse. Voila - one huge turd of a film.One of the quotes from the movie is, \"His ass was grass, and I was the lawnmower.\" I felt shame on the producers' behalf that they even made Estelle Getty utter this line. It's really sad. It's utterly pathetic.Stallone was nominated for another Raspberry Award for his performance. Believe it or not he gives a GOOD performance. Really good. That's part of the problem - his above-average acting makes the film seem even more desperate. There's an argument between him and JoBeth Williams in one scene and his acting is really good; it's convincing. But the rest of the film isn't.Stallone tried to have this banned from being released onto DVD and I believe he's succeeded so far. Rent it out on video or watch it on TV and see for yourself why it's his least favorite film he's made in a career of some pretty bad films.",

But I'd yet to re-watch it after a 20 year hiatus from not watching it in for so long, so as of this year bought a new copy in DVD form from HMV.I have to say the film still holds up today! It's funny, comedic, got enough action in it to mix up the comedy & comical aspects! Not to mention the film is watchable & has a feel good vibe about it. Stallone was great in this film along with Getty. It's just a shame Stallone himself hates this film as I think he done a good job in it! The other actors done well too!

They don't make films like this one no more especially in a PC riddled world we live in now, where films have to be laced & choked with leftist woke agenda messages with characters being objectified to deliver or serve a purpose for those messages as a pose to being in the film cos they're generally good actors/actresses.But anyway, the film is great!

            "content": "Alright, I recognize that this movie is not good and has several problems. However, it was the product of a time when nonsensical parodies were in vogue. I remember that the \"Police Academy\" franchise was one of the successes of that years, having continued to have acceptance on TV throughout the 90s. It is a familiar and educated comedy that tries to have fun without slang or dirty jokes, that has been more popular with young people nowadays. Despite the film's problems and flaws, which are undeniable, perhaps the way we look at humor and what makes us laugh also helped to bury this film in the oblivion.The screenplay is based on Joe, a tough, independent detective's complicated relationship with his elderly mother, Tutti, who came to visit despite his unwillingness to do so, and who intrudes heavily on her son's personal and love life, subjecting him to deeply embarrassing situations, such as showing everyone photographs of his childhood and picaresque stories that he preferred to keep to himself. The film shows us how that mother is truly in love with her son, and she stubbornly resists acknowledging that she no longer has to take care of him like she used to. It also reveals how, deep down, he likes his mother, caring about her and accepting her help when he sees that she is right in what she says. For many people, the movie is pure nonsense, but the truth is that I know many mothers like that, for whom their children never grow up, and who like to have an active role in their lives, even if that's not what they want.The movie is funny, in a polite and moderate way. He's not flashy and knows how to parody the cop action movies that were successful in the 80's. Despite this, he has a far-fetched story involving a situation of insurance fraud and arms trafficking, villains that never deserve our respect nor threaten, clich\u00e9 characters loaded with almost every possible stereotype and a total lack of direction.The cast is weak and doesn't get decent material. The spotlight naturally turns to an excellent performance by Estelle Getty, who achieves the most popular performance of her career in this film. The most resounding name, however, is Sylvester Stallone, who offers us a work that almost satirizes some of the action works that made him popular. The actor would later admit that he considers this film the worst he has starred in, and I can see why: there are many bad scenes, and some of them are particularly worthy of regret (the diaper scene, I confess, was something I would refuse). Nevertheless, and despite being far from his usual record, Stallone guarantees an impacting and charismatic presence.The film has heavily dated cinematography that reeks of the 80s, with washed out colors and low contrast, but I think that's part of the nature of the film, which can't go against what was in use when it was conceived. There are a lot of action scenes, highly predictable but well done, where the special effects work reasonably well. The rhythm is very good, it doesn't get into tiring melodramas nor does it really tire us.",

For his birthday she buys him a machine gun out of the back of a van, and ends up being the prime witness in a drive by shooting. Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger were competing against each other at that time this was made, and Arnold faked interest in this movie in order to make Sylvester go for it. Stallone who heard that Arnold was interested in headlining in this movie, fell for it and immediately dropped everything and contacted the producers, saying that he wanted to headline. He deeply regrets this.For this reviewer, it is the lowest point of his post 'Rocky' career so far. As with 'Oscar' Stallone is clearly trying hard, and Getty brings the fun she brought to TV's 'Golden Girls' but it misses on so many levels. It is not without its moments, and anyone with an over bearing mother can certainly relate, but I actually struggled to make it to the end, despite a short running time.",

With Stallone's comment and the film's sweep at the 1992 Razzies, 'Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot' has gained an unfairly negative reputation over the years. Estelle Getty is certainly way over-the-top and the basic plot is predictable with Stallone eventually coming to appreciate his mother after a lot of resistance, but there are enough scattered laughs that the film never once bores. Roger Rees (who would go onto to hilariously lampoon Alan Rickman in 'Men in Tights' one year later) is great as the befuddled antagonist in the tale, managing to maintain a straight face while talking about Getty's plans to pull down his pants and spank him! Alan Silvestri's mysterious, jazzy music score also rates as one of his best and Getty has some funny lines even if her character is too irksome for one to ever truly warm towards. The action scenes are admittedly quite nifty too (director Roger Spottiswoode would later go helm the riveting 'Tomorrow Never Dies'). Sure, this not a refreshingly classy, laugh-out-loud comedy like 'Oscar' was for Stallone, but neither is it anywhere near as mediocre as one might expect. Stallone's uttering the title line is worth a chuckle alone.",

I admit, it is very corny, but it's aptly funny in a couple of scenes, preferably the jumper one, where the suicide on the ledge victim, desists as getting an earful of Sly's history from his molly coddle mother (Estelle Getty) on a megaphone, while Stallone stays putt, and then CUT. I had wished this scene had kept going, as it would have been interesting to see where see could of taken this. This was a disappointment, on the part of the writers, but time is a factor, as to the progression of astory, for the audience's benefit. Another funny scene has Getty singing an original version of \"Wash your gun\" as she washes Sly's piece, getting it all spic and span, only with the opposite effect as you can imagine if using detergents, so forth. Getty makes a meal of her role, and Sly's good too, as the tough cop/failed romantic with inadequacies, and Sly shows this well. His captain (love interest Willams who's just broken up with him) is solid, and sadly isn't used enough in this. Getty's dog, Trixie is cute too. The run down of story, though I admit falls weak, as if they were somewhat looking desperately for a plot or more so neglected story, has Getty, a witness, to a shootout, involving a bungling duo of arms dealers, where a nasty looking Uzi is recovered from Getty, as looking over some arms, prior, to replace Sly's ruined pistol. Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot is by no means great, or even good. It's a lighthearted entertaining comedy, and that's it, that evidently shows Stallone can be funny, although there's almost zero chemistry between Sly and Getty. Although I saw it for the first time the other day, it looked cheaply shot, but it is a cheap movie, which I'm finally glad I had gotten around to see, and Getty I must admit is a really bad shot. Trivia fact: In Adelaide SOMMWS came out exactly five years to the day after Over The Top, both movies involving trucks.",

It had potential, as Roger Spottiswoode looked set for good things, but a lot of things range from pretty bad to terrible. The film goes at a good pace and is quite short. However, the film looks rather slapdash and is just really unfunny, apart from the part with Stallone in the diaper. This is not helped by the lacking direction, the predictable story and the truly dire script that does nothing whatsoever for the actors. The acting, to be honest... it wasn't good at all. Sylvester Stallone is okay here, he does look embarrassed and tired but he does look as though he is trying. However, his material is awful and he struggles with it. As for the debate of whether Sly can do comedy, this and Rhinestone are for me misfires but Oscar is very underrated and Sly is actually funny in that, so if I say he wasn't as funny as he should've been, I blame the script. Estelle Getty is a lot worse though, I like her, but her character is well and truly irritating and Getty herself grates and wears out her welcome early on. In conclusion, pretty awful, not only one of Sly's worst films but one of the worst comedies conceived or so I think. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

In the 80's and 90's Sly and Scwarzenegger compete against each other. When Sly drop out, he hear producers saying we will get Arnold Schwarzenegger instead. So Sly change his mind and accept the role to beat Scharzenegger. Schwarzenegger set him up! He lied that he want to do this movie he set up Sly and that good! I wish Sly would punch Arnold in the face.Kindergarten Cop and Last Action Hero are much better movies than this garbage it was not executed well. What happened Stallone? This is really embarrassing disappointing bad awful flick from you. The action seqeunces are lazy, terrible. When you see an action scene and you see Sly fighting on screen that is not Stallone it is his stunt double doing his stunts! So what happened Stallone? Why did you not make your own stunts? The comedy was so bad awful Sly.The music in this movie was horrible from Alan Silvestri and that guy made a music for Predator 1 and 2, Romancing the Stone, Back to the Future Trilogy, Ricochet, Death Becomes Her, Sidekicks , Judgment Night and even more good movies. The music is terrible Silvestri.The acting is god awful horrible, the plot stinks. I don't consider this movie a good movie I cosnider it a flop. I don't hate the film but I don't like it either Sly.

She also washes his gun really well and causes him so much stress he has a very bad dream. The movie has some good humor here and there and is nothing more than a buddy cop movie that usually does not work as most buddy cop movies featuring someone other than a cop as the other buddy usually never works.

So, watching 1992's Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot wasn't a complete waste for me as I got to enjoy both Estelle Getty and Stallone for about an hour and a half.Is it a good movie? No, but it's not a complete waste either. It was just one of those Big-Burly Action Stars doing comedy for a change, like Schwarzenegger's Kindergarten Cop. (Mind you, I liked that movie a ton more than this flop, but I was just pulling out an example.) On the surface, it's the same ole mix-matched, buddy cop movies with \"a heart,\" but in deep, it's just an overlong TV-movie that was unbelievably released in theatres. I did only watch this because I love listening to the podcast, How Did This Get Made? where they talk about bad movies for about an hour and make me crack up on their take. They covered this movie in tribute to the late and absolute great Roger Ebert who they claimed he stated this was \"the worst movie ever made.\"As much as I love Ebert, and he'll always be on my mind, I have to respectively disagree. Bad, absolutely, but not the worst. Even when the movie's \"heart\" is within itself one of the many clich\u00e9s, it works as a leave-your-brain-at-the-door film.After (my forever \"Sophia Petrillo\") visits her son, Stallone's Sgt. Joe Bomowksi, his life is turned upside down and he must deal with some case he's on \u2013 it's really forgettable and it doesn't help that it was four months ago that I actually watched this for the first time \u2013 and her literal selfish need to baby and embarrass him. He's also trying to be romantic with his superior at the police station and, of course, momma's gonna get involved in that.It's a thin premise that barely fills the already short 87 minute run time, but for a throwback to the 90s and, again, seeing (my forever \"Sophia Petrillo\") one more time, RIP Estelle!, I wouldn't mind a slight recommendation to this.* * *Final thoughts: I have heard that Getty didn't want to do the movie upfront because of her anti-gun feelings. Apparently they lied to her by telling her there would be no guns\u0085in a movie named\u0085Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot. Estelle, I love yah, babe, but seriously?

It's mama, Estelle Getty, basically having told them every secret about him and showing all his baby pictures, and by the time they get out of LAX, he wants to take her back and get her a one-way ticket back home. Sophia Petrillo is a peach compared to Estelle Getty as Stallone's mother here, an absolute harridan who thinks she's well meaning, but her interference goes way beyond smothering. Her presence really could cost a cop his life, and whoever wrote this really had unresolved mommy issues,v and perhaps issues with women in general. Talk about a hate letter to females, starting with those nasty stewardesses!In fact, Stallone seems to have women issues all around, starting with a toxic female boss (Jobeth Williams) who makes Leona Helmsley and Livia from \"I Claudius\" seem like Mary Poppins. As Getty becomes ensconced in Stallone's life, she begins interfering in his career, she becomes ridiculously unlikeable, and everything that I liked about Getty from 7 years of Golden Girls (and multiple years on other shows) starts to become questionable.Yes, she has played possessive and interfering mothers before, but there is not one likeable quality about her here, and if this is motherly love, I'd rather be an orphan. In fact, I'm surprised mothers everywhere didn't picket this film. It is not her fault, but that of the script which seems to think that putting big guys like Stallone and Schwarzenegger with teeny people is an automatic laugh, and giving a little old lady from Newark a gun is the key to laughter. Wrong.Then there is the plot which takes 25 minutes to be created after her character is established. She witnesses a murder in a sleazy part of L. A. and decides she wants to help the police solve it. Not in Newark, not in L. A., maybe not anywhere outside of the wild west 100 years before this was made. Stallone looks tired throughout, perhaps knowing that he was in the process of making a fiasco, yet obligated to do it. Just impossible to get into, and just so eye rollingly hideous that I just felt anger at the fact that such two beloved stars with completely different methods could be coerced into doing this.

I can understand when it first came out if you paid to see it in theatres and when Stallone was at the top of his action game. But now...years later...how can you not see this for the stone cold B-Movie classic that it is? I am not being sarcastic in the least, I had a great time watching this. Is it a great movie? Heck no. The script is terrible and I'm still not sure the action sequences and plot make any sense at all and who cares!! It was still an era where action/comedies always had to have this deep gangster storyline. The sole reason to watch this film is the incredibly cheesy one liners. I had a smile from ear to ear when Stallone yells \"STOP...or my Mom will shoot.\" In fact, I watched that scene twice. Stallone's charisma (I am a monster fan I admit) is perfect and so much more down to earth than his usual macho action flicks. Best of all the awkward chemistry between him and Estelle Getty just works on such a bad level...again yes I mean it! There is very little truly good about the film and yet it is incredibly entertaining and fun and quirky and ridiculous. For me it just works! I admit that my adoration for Stallone has existed since I was just a little boy and he can do very little wrong in my books. This was a very different role for him being in the action character but holding his own in the comedy department. His character does not have a lot of depth and that's good for this film. He is probably the sole reason to see this movie. Estelle Getty...brilliant on Golden Girls and this is likely the only other thing I've seen her in and...well she isn't good. Her line delivery is awkward, she is really annoying (although that is the point) and the chemistry between her and Stallone is completely bizarre and it works! Her Mom character Tutti is fantastically bad and obnoxious and watching her make the same mistake again and again is fun! I don't think anyone else could have done the role the way she did. JoBeth Williams is Stallone's love interest. Her character is supposed to be tough as nails and rough around the edges and she is that but only in the most basic form. She is given very little development and the romance feels mostly forced. Its a small role though and doesn't take or add anything to the script. Roger Rees could have been a formidable villain, he has the look and the voice but the character is really written poorly so there is never really any chance for him to show off.Director Roger Spottiswoode has had a very mixed career. Mostly he's had a lot of B-Movie with perhaps the exception of the late 80's classic Turner and Hooch which most people consider great! However, there is no doubt that he brings a fun campy style to this movie. He uses Stallone's charisma and macho attitude as the focus of the comedy. I do completely understand why the film bombed at the time but allow me to suggest that this is now one of those films that has aged to the point of being timeless now. It has some genuine laughs and doesn't strictly use the \"fish out of water\" comedy to force the comedy. Its ironic but as I said the script is bad, everyone in the film feels rigid and awkward and yet something about it just appeals to me. I could easily watch it again and I was extremely entertained even if it was by how bad the movie was. I won't apologize for it and I guess we can chalk it up to a guilty little pleasure. Still I think if you look at it from the perspective I have suggested I think you'll have a ton of fun with it! You obviously can't take it seriously so don't and enjoy! I sure did. 7.5/10",

One fine day his mother from Newark drops in and just takes over, his job and even his love life. That gets a bit complicated too because he's involved in an open secret romance with his immediate superior Lt.

In making an illegal buy of a new and most illegal machine gun, she witnesses a murder of one of the men. It's the case Stallone is working, but we don't know that yet.Best scene is Sly trying to talk potential suicide Nathan Sadler down from a window ledge. Sadler has mommy issues, but when Getty takes over the microphone Sadler does change his mind deciding that Stallone has much bigger problems.Kudos also go to Dennis Burkley the surviving illegal gun dealer who a gang that murdered his brother because the two stole the weapons from them gets kind of adopted by Getty.Funny in spots, but more silly overall.",

Or My Mom Will Shoot' is what Sylvester Stallone considers to be his worst movie, and he has never stopped trashing it ever since it came out. It's bad. Really, really bad. In this movie, Stallone, the ultra assured, self-confident movie star that we have come to know and love in most of his movies, is sleepwalking through here. It's almost like he doesn't care. In hindsight, he didn't actually do the movie for his career, but rather to compete against Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's an old story, but what happened was the two were huge rivals, and when Stallone was offered the movie, he originally turned it down. When he heard Schwarzenegger was thinking about the part, Stallone jumped at it first to get him back. And boy, it really seems like Stallone is out to lunch in this movie, hell, he seems like he's out to Nobu, not caring about a single thing. It's an idiotic mess of a movie, and that's made dreadfully clear during the opening scenes, which are so boring I can't even believe I got through the first ten minutes. Granted, the rest of the movie has more interest than in the opening, but that's not saying much, because some scenes are almost torture.The film's plot is about as thin as paper, following Stallone, who plays Sgt. Joe Bomowski, a tough cop, when he gets a visit from his mother Tutti (Estelle Getty), who still treats him like a ten year old. She tries to make his life better, but just creates more problems for him.Getty is fine, she does what she can here, but she's a long way from her 'Golden Girls' role. I cannot believe I am saying this, but I laughed. Once. Just once. When Tutti gets off the plane, everyone greets Joe at the terminal, and knows exactly who he is. They all say hi, and Joe wonders what happened on the plane. It turns out that his mom was sharing baby pictures and telling stories about him to everyone on the plane. I laughed at this, because, well, it was funny.But some of the other jokes are just lame. There is a scene where Estelle Getty points a gun at Stallone, to which she says, \"Go ahead, make your bed\". This is a script so inept in itself that it wouldn't even count for a terrible episode of 'Golden Girls'. The only redeeming element of the movie is Getty, who does alright. Everyone else, wow.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I cannot believe that it got a laugh out of me. But, it did. Oh well.",

I like Stallone as an actor and I always found Estelle Getty to be funny and entertaining.This review is because, I saw the movie in 1992 and I didn't enjoy it.If anyone else loves the movie,\nthat's great. ...but, We ALL can't like the same things.Everyone has a right to an opinion, it shouldn't make you mad that someone's is the opposite of yours. Some like this movie and others don't. It's that way with ALL movies, TV shows and music too.Even if I give it 10 stars, then those who rate it less will take it personally. This is just my opinion, an opinion is not a FACT ... I never said I was right.Now the review :In 1993, Stallone's career began to waver a bit. His action films were getting predictable and having seen both of these, his attempts at comedy were just as lacking.(Not trying to be mean, it's just how I feel about it.)I saw this film at the $1 theatre I went to, as it had gone from larger theaters to cheap in a very short time. Just like \"Oscar\" I waited for a situation to build up into something funny or hilarious and it just never panned out to any really great humor.The idea of Estelle Getty being an overprotective Mother to a big tough cop should have been a very easy idea to make into a comedy. I can only term the way the actors brought across their humor as , flat.Just one scene made me laugh. Mom fixes her son breakfast and serves him about 4 or 5 different things at once. This later gives him indigestion and he's guzzling Pepto-Bismol and his buddy asks, \" **** what did you have for breakfast?! \"Stallone: \"Eggs, bacon, sausage , pancakes, Cocoa Puffs (etc...)\"Estelle Getty was not even funny here, which was very disappointingg, as she was non stop funny on The Golden Girls. Maybe she was trying 'too' hard not to be Sophia Petrillo. I'm not faulting her, but I know she was good at comedy.I hate to say it but 2 stars, for at least making me laugh once.With all due respect... I still salute the wonderful memory of Estelle Getty .

            "content": "\"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot\" was written by the late Blake Snyder (et. al), author of the popular \"Save the Cat!\" screen writing books, and seems to demonstrate the adage that those who can do, while those who can't teach. I was interested to see how the much touted Blake Snyder Beat Sheet (or BS-squared) was applied in one of his own screenplays, but was left more confused than enlightened. The opening image doesn't mirror the final image. The dark night of the soul was not particularly bleak or believable. I'm not sure of exactly what constitutes the A and B stories, but assume the mother helping son become a better policeman to win the girl was the B story and chasing down the arms dealers was the A story, but I don't see their synthesis. I expected a somewhat formulaic story with distinct beats and clearly defined acts, but found the beats blurred. The protagonists should be propelled into the second act, e.g., not his mother. One problem seems to be that the characters were stripped of distinct ethnic backgrounds and made generic. I would venture to guess that the role of Sgt. Joe Bomowski was originally envisioned as Jewish character with a Jewish mother. In my experience, having grown up with an Italian mother in a school district that was half Jewish, half gentile with very few blacks, Asians or Hispanics, Jewish mothers are very much like Italian mothers, but they are not identical or interchangeable. For both, culture and religious beliefs are important. Eating a good breakfast is important, but not a breakfast of generic foods. The late Estelle Getty did a good job with the role as written, but she didn't sprinkle her dialogue with Yiddish or Italian homilies, adages, or phrases. She wants her son to marry a nice girl, but not specifically a nice Jewish girl in a Synagogue or a nice Italian girl in a Catholic cathedral. Stripping away the ethnicity makes the characters much more shallow and less believable. The movie is a bit of a train wreck, but it has a few good moments. Mommy telling her son he needs to change, then showing him in nappies was amusing. Bomowski saying the office staff could figure something out because they were detectives was a good line. The airport chase scene was well done. But most of the movie is fairly tepid, lame, unoriginal and not believable, even within the relaxed standards of a comedy. The age-appropriate romance was particularly tepid. The villains weren't evil. The plot made little sense. The notion that an insurance company couldn't determine if steel devices were damaged in a fire that left the structure standing and would pay a claim on illegal inventory items stretched credulity past its limits. Police procedures were non-existent. Most of the jokes were forced and not particularly funny. Stallone is a talented actor and demonstrated his comedic skills in the under-rated \"Oscar.\" Getty was also talented and gave the role her best. But they didn't look or act as if they were from the same family, despite insisting as much repeatedly in the dialogue.",

Sure, it is goofy and campy, but that is what makes it fun to watch.The storyline is actually nice enough. Sure, it is out there, but it does have a good feel to it.

            "content": "There are occasions when I feel like watching a movie I know is meant to be bad on purpose, this had been shown on TV a number of times, I knew it was rated badly, so I thought I'd indulge myself in trash, directed by Roger Spottiswoode (Turner & Hooch, Tomorrow Never Dies, The 6th Day, A Street Cat Named Bob). Basically Sergeant Detective Joe Bomowski (Razzie winning Sylvester Stallone) is an efficient, tough cop. He has a love affair with Lieutenant Gwen Harper (JoBeth Williams), but he cannot make a serious commitment. One time, when she asks why he cannot commit, he gives the unconvincing excuse that his mother is visiting him, he makes a call to his mother to make this excuse a reality. Soon enough, Joe's seemingly frail, overprotective mother Tutti (Razzie winning Estelle Getty) comes from Newark, New Jersey, to spend a couple of days with him. Joe's life is turned upside down by his mother's presence, she still treats him like a child, she meddles in his life, and constantly embarrasses him with stories and photographs from his childhood. Tutti makes the mistake of cleaning Joe's gun with bleach and ruins it, so she decides to go and buy him a new gun, and winds up buying an illegal MAC-10 machine pistol, and then witnesses the murder of one of the men who sold it to her. Tutti is questioned by police officer Ross (J. Kenneth Campbell) about what happened, but she frustrates him giving him vague and babbling detail, she only gives accurate information and description to her son, but she also interferes with his duty and other cases. The gun was part of a large collection taken from a burned building, and as the case continues they find corruption involving businessman Parnell (Roger Rees). No matter how Joe tries to restrain Tutti from getting involved with his work, she always manages to find a way to get out of it, and then ends up getting too close to dangerous people. In the end, following an attempted escape by the criminals at an air strip, Joe rescues his mother, and she shoots a bad guy in the shoulder before he can harm her son. In the end, Joe finally makes a commitment to Gwen, but before Tutti can go home, she recognises a man at the airport from America's Most Wanted, she remembers him on it for shooting his mother. Also starring Jurassic Park's Martin Ferrero as Paulie, Gailard Sartain as Munroe, John Wesley as Tony, Dennis Burkley as Mitchell, Ving Rhames as Mr. Stereo and Richard Schiff as Gun Clerk. Stallone is reasonable being the good guy, but he fails being driven mad and in tender moments, but much worse is Getty, the majority of the time she is highly irritating being eccentric, na\u00efve and nit-picky. The jokes are obviously supposed to be coming from the buddy cop style, the cop having his life ruined by his annoying mother, I will admit some of the action moments were kind of fun, and there were moments that made me titter, but otherwise it a joke-free, badly written and almost detestable watch, a pointless comedy. It won the Razzie for Worst Screenplay. Pretty poor!",

It was probably only his superstar status that saved him from being constantly overlooked by casting directors in the future. Even my cousin who is 7 said that this film was awful. It was only the fact that this movie was rented that I didn't throw the video cassette into the microwave, or in the blender or curled it David Beckham style over my neighbour's gardens.I've also read what the other IMDb users have said about this movie and I have to admit I am in shock. Although the vast majority say it is a dreadful film, there are some who actually like this flick!, which I find quite astonishing. The only reasonable explanations that I can think of is that they have either just been discharged from a mental institution, releated to Stallone or Sly is paying them a disclosed fee to lie about this garbage film.Well, I've hope I have made my point clear and I also hope that other IMDb users who are considering renting this movie out just because it has Sly 'Rocky' Stallone in it, will definitely think again.DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE, BE WARNED!.Rating -0/10, SHOCKING.

It's never quite clear if this movie wants to be a terrible comedy or a terrible police drama, they just keep betting on both horses. There's also a love subplot involved that's mainly there to pad out the running time, and credit where credit is due, it does.

            "content": "I've always been a fan of this Comedy as it's such a nice piece of Escapism from our messed up world.This is like Stallone's \"Kindergarten Cop\" & yes i love that film too.Action legend Stallone plays his part fine as the tough Cop with relationship issues & even bigger mummy issues!!!Stallone is actually good at this comedy stuff although the story sounds silly (well it is) but it's a fun concept comedy that is just simply a joy to watch.Stallone is actually very funny in this film & i think his Joe Bomowski is one of his best characters & should be up there with his best, John Spartan from his greatest movie ever Demolition Man.Joe is a good Cop & one of those proper \"movie Cops\" that lives for the job & the rest of his life is a mess. When Joe's interfering Mum comes to stay with him she picks up on everything that is wrong & missing from his life & it's sweet & funny.The great Estelle Getty as Tutti is truly hilarious & just so much fun as the interfering & wise-cracking old mum of Stallone's un-easy & embarrassed tough cop Joe.I loved the Classic sitcom The Golden Girls & to bring the legendary Estelle into a fun situation comedy movie was a genius move & it works!!! Yes Stallone hates this movie & claims it's his worst work but i love it. \"Stop\" has a nice pure early 90's score that is really feelgood by Alan Sivestri (Judgment Night, Predator, Predator 2, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) & i love the pure 90's movie Cop fashion like Stallone's character wears all the time. This harmless film is such a product of it's more innocent times & i love it for that & it's feel of being a fun time that is clean enough to enjoy with the whole family.Also the legendary Ivan Reitman was a producer on this movie & i love that fact because he's a legend of feelgood fun Comedies such as Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters 2, Twins, Kindergarten Cop & Junior, so having Ivan involved gives the film a feel of his own Classic's & it really does often feel like one of his films.It's nice seeing Stallone having fun in a silly role but a good one & it's a fun play on the popular Buddy-cop formula that was so popular during the 80's & 90's.Estelle plays her part with so much fun, heart & mischief that she's a joy to watch & i love her voice & the way she totally interfered in every part of Stallone's life when she comes to stay with him lol but everyone loves her especially at the police department, great comedic scenes. Also Los Angeles is shot really lovely with it's constant sunshine & blue skies, it's a sunny movie & goes with it's light-hearted nature. Even though fun mum Tutti witnesses a murder in a bad part of town & helps her Detective son with the case, there's still a sense of playful fun to it all.Nice, fun entertainment, i like it lots & think it's very underrated & it's a film i can watch again & again & always enjoy it.Smile & laugh, stop being so serious.",

            "content": "Taking on a gig just to outdo a competitor isn't usually the wisest idea. When you make haste, you lay waste. Unfortunately for Sylvester Stallone, he learned the hard way, when he and Arnold Schwarzenegger were neck and neck. Both stars were at the top of their game when it came to action films, and both were highly sought out. Especially after James Cameron's blockbuster hit Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Stallone was more than likely looking for a way to one up Schwarzenegger. His rival thought otherwise and began a rumor that he would be signing on to the project that would become this movie. As for Stallone, he took the bait and fully regrets the decision.Written by three people Blake Snyder, William Osborne and William Davies, the story is about Joe Bomowski (Sylvester Stallone), a good cop trying to keep things together. Not only with his career but his love life involving his lieutenant Gwen Harper (JoBeth Williams). However, when Joe learns his mother Tutti (Estelle Getty) is coming to visit, things get tougher for him, because his mother embarrasses him every step of the way. Whether it be on the job or in front of his snobby colleague Ross (J. Kenneth Campbell), Joe can't cut a break. With two writers who would later pen The Scorpion King (2002), Flushed Away (2006) and How to Train Your Dragon (2010), it's amazing they made it past this.This is not even an okay comedy at all, but it also isn't awful either. It's just bad. With director Roger Spottiswoode at the helm, viewers would think there must be some redeemable qualities. This is yet to be completely seen though when it comes to how the cast performs. Sylvester Stallone as Joe Bomowski is not much of a compelling character. He's constantly grinding his teeth and griping about everything. Understandably so since Estelle Getty as Joe's mom is completely oblivious as to what his son needs, which is personal space. There are things she spews out to the public that just shouldn't be repeated. How anyone thought this was cute doesn't make any sense.For comedy, there's only a few chuckles from time to time, but much of it is cringe worthy and silly dialog. The fact that the other characters think Joe is too uptight and his mother is really sweet is truly unbelievable. There's also appearances from Roger Rees, Martin Ferrero and Richard Schiff. This doesn't add much to the experience though seeing that they all share the mediocre load of the film. One redeemable aspect are the action sequences since they are fairly quick and entertaining. Further down the run time an interesting set piece takes place that some viewers may not ever get to see done practically. By today's standards it would all be done via CGI.Visually, the film doesn't have much style. It is as bland as the material presented on screen. The cinematography handled by Frank Tidy was competently shot, it just didn't do anything for the viewing experience. While he has worked on other films like Hot Pursuit (1987), Code of Silence (1985) and The Mean Season (1985), this particular work by him is just standard. The film score was composed by Alan Silvestri who does his best to make sure he's known throughout the film. Here he creates a comical theme for the scenario and it's quite different from that of his more contemporary works. His action cues also contain a lot of percussion, again not heard much in his later career. Well done.The problem with this comedy is that it's just not funny and it has really silly material. The cast try to make this work, but it falls flat with uninspired camerawork, and ludicrous circumstances. The only parts that are worth noting is the music and a couple different action sequences. It's good just to see how low Stallone's career was for him at the time.",

He's good in it, it's obviously limiting for his ability, but it's cool to see him in a comedy. Secondly, there are some genuinely funny lines, few and far between yes, but references and jokes which aren't clich\u00e9 are welcome. Thirdly, it's very light, it's easy to watch. There's no real depth to it so it can be watched to switch off.

            "content": "Let me start by saying that Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot is an atrocious film; perhaps Sylvester Stallone's worst movie. Indeed, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is not the worst movie I have ever seen (Home Alone 3 has that dubious honour - see that review for more) but it definitely ranks in my Top 10 and that says a hell of a lot, given that I have seen a lot of movies in my time. I saw this very late in 2004 and dismissed it as nondescript fluff. Over the following days, I reconsidered this thought and gradually my opinion of this movie turned to mud, to the extent that, a few months later, when this movie came on, I turned away in disgust. The plot revolves around a bad-ass cop, Joe Bomowski, who endures a visit from his mother, Tutti, who proceeds to make his life absolute hell, as she gets in the way of his job and his budding romance with fellow cop Gwen. Even writing this makes me seethe.The acting...oh God, don't get me started on the acting, please! It has to be the worst part of this film and that is saying quite a lot. Sylvester Stallone is not guilty of bad acting here, indeed, he is OK, no my friends, the main offender is...Estelle Getty. Yes. Estelle Getty. This is the same actress who appeared on The Golden Girls, which is even now, over a decade after it ended, being touted as a prime example of 'classic comedy' by some. If I had a chance to, I would have shot her - and I don't get kicks out of shooting old women. As it is, I admire Joe's restraint - putting up with his Mum without shooting her, or at least getting her sent off to a distant hospital because of an 'accident'. As for the rest of the cast, they are not worth mentioning. The only thing that prevents this film from getting a big, fat zero from me is that it is pretty short - finishing in under 90 minutes. But let's face it, that's not much of a saving grace.Well, I'll keep my conclusion to the point: DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE! Movies get on the bottom 100 for a reason: because they suck - and so does this film.0.5/5 stars",

As it is, the director has ensured that we can appreciate this contrast to full effect.At it's conclusion, we are left with a sense that we have witnessed something very special and moreover, thought-provoking to the point where we may well ask 'Is there something this film has taught me about how I live my life?'.

The story is probably based on the caricatured image of overprotective mothers, which are relatively common, especially with their boys.

The cast isn't any bad, and Estelle Getty knows exactly how to perform the character she has been given.

Stallone plays Joey Bomowski, L.A. cop who gets a surprise visit from his mother Tutti, played by Getty. She's in town to clean up Joey's house, clean up his crumbling love life with his boss Gwen, played by Williams, and clean up the city as she partners up with her son to catch some bad guys who were involved in a crime that she is the only witness to. Joey, on the other hand, must deal with his mother showing everybody she meets his baby pictures, washing his gun with water and soap, and feeding him breakfast (the most important meal of the day!) The movie is silly but mildly entertaining. Getty and Stallone's on screen chemistry is the worst since Dolly Parton and Stallone's duet performance in Rhinestone.There's really not much to say about \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot\". It follows a recurring gag: the mother embarrassing her son, whether he's at home or on the job. Estelle Gelly sure is an old-fashion mother, very unrealistically so. She baked cookies, tucked her son to bed and sang a lullaby, made a huge breakfast for her son to eat, and even telling stories that he wet the bed (on a speakerphone), even in front of a suicide jumper next to Sly at one point; I know mothers often pamper their children, but normal mothers know when their child grows up. I understand it's a joke, but I don't really understand her at times: she seems very smart when she's helping Sly find some bad guys, but often she's very clueless like when she randomly bought an illegal weapon for her son; idiot savant or wise senility? I know the late great Golden Girl can be funnier than what she was in this movie, and the outrageous zany music didn't acclimate a dumb gag. It's a typical 90's screwball buddy-cop flick with an unusual partner, the unusual one being a senior citizen. The relationship between Sly and his mother had a few heartfelt moments, sappy as they are, which made me felt attached to them a bit. This is a generic flick, but it's a generic flick that plays fair.Overall rating: 6 out of 10.",

Some scenes in the movie is really well done, and the humour in it is not necessarely obvious at first but once you get it you'll laugh. I know I'm speaking \"on the edge of the crowd\" now (seeing how this movie got among the bottom rated), but this movie really is funny.",

The latter wrote one of the funniest reviews I have ever seen when he gave this film \"One star for being in focus.\" Stallone is a very talented writer and actor, though many of his films are not to my tastes, this being a prime example. Visiting Rome several years ago, this came on one evening and was strangely entrancing. I continued to watch and enjoyed it immensely, not understanding a word of Italian. So that worked for me, to watch as a silent film with wall-to-wall slapstick, vaudevillian comedy. It was a riot!",

To add to Joe's problems, Tuttie witnesses a murder and becomes his unlikely partner when she refuses to divulge information unless she's allowed in on the investigation. Just when Joe starts wishing he were adopted, Tutti comes through in the cluth, provoking that Mother-knows-best in this hilarious thriller. Its a delightful.",

Usually I can at least find humor in how awful a movie is, but I was straight-faced throughout the entire portion of the movie I could actually stand to watch. I am glad to see that so many found the movie as being worthless.  Now I know I made the right decision by walking out. Hopefully this might save at least one innocent from being tortured by this repulsive and obnoxious \"comedy\".",

But in the end, it shows that it's not all bad, and a mother's love (in appropriate dosage) can make for a wonderful life.If you connect with the characters, you will probably love this movie. If you can't relate to being or having an overbearing mother, you probably won't. And that's okay. This movie knows its audience, and it does a very good job for that audience.",

If you want a movie that is going to change your life, then this is not the movie for you. If you want to see Sly Stallone run around with his old mom in an action movie, which I certainty do, then this is for you for know until the end of time. From the opening credits to the end credits, I laughed. I laughed when I was supposed to, and I laughed when I wasn't. The point is, I was never bored and often times I feel people forget that if a movie keeps you watching, then its good even if its bad. Don't get me wrong Gandhi is great because you are moves and learned, but movies like this are great because you laugh and forget. Give this a chance.",
