He stars as the titled character, the controversial Black Nationalist Leader who is easily one of the most interesting people who lived during the 20th Century. Spike Lee's uncompromising direction focuses on X's life. From his very early childhood to his violent death, the audience is given lots and lots information on the character as the film runs about 195 minutes. A good supporting cast helps, but this is Washington's show from the very start. His performance is very dominant and this is easily one of the best jobs that was never honored with an Academy Award. Brilliant biopic. 5 stars out of 5.",

So interesting, in fact, that I soon was inspired to read \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" that was compiled and written by Alex Haley. Then, I read a rather interesting (warts and all) account of Malcolm X's mentor, Elijah Mohammad.From what I have since learned from these and other sources, I was quite impressed at the movie--it seemed to try very hard to get the story right. Malcolm X's life was neither over-glorified nor was he portrayed the opposite--the story seemed to be quite balanced and without a serious ax to grind. It would have been easy to make the movie just an attack on the Nation of Islam or an attempt to make the title character some sort of saint.As for the acting, it was super. The script, excellent. The direction, first-rate. An excellent film that everyone should see--it is fascinating from start to finish.",

            "content": "Spike Lee struggled mightily to get 'Malcolm X' made, financially and artistically. But when all was said and done, he produced an epic blockbuster and a definite treatment of the man's life.There's great differences between the two as well, but to me Lee has many things in common with Oliver Stone. Both of them seem to have been born to make films. Both of them are uncompromising in bringing their artistic (and moral) vision to the screen, and neither will try to seduce the public by catering to their tastes. Both present their own interpretation of facts without apology. (For example, from what I've read it's not certain that Malcolm's father was actually killed by Klansmen. But Lee isn't in the same league as Stone when it comes to playing fast and loose with the \"truth.\") Stone even ends his movie 'Nixon' in a similar way to 'Malcolm X,' with footage of real-life figures blended in, though I'm not accusing Stone of imitation.This movie has an epic sweep and scope and as a director Lee is up to the challenge. He is served well by being able to direct in several styles, one of which is almost cartoonish: witness the scene where Malcolm (Denzel Washington) and Shorty (played by Lee himself) go stepping out at the Roseland Ballroom, resplendent in their zoot suits. Some comic relief is welcome at times because otherwise the serious, heavy message of the picture might be overwhelming. For instance, the movie opens with a full-screen shot of an American flag while we hear a voice-over of one of Malcolm's most rousing, or inflammatory speeches, depending on how you look at it (\"I accuse the white man of being the greatest murderer on the planet!\") The flag begins to burn and eventually forms a flaming 'X' as the fiery rhetoric continues. But if you haven't been scared away, the next scene shows the young man Malcolm Little in a funny situation, having his hair straightened by a concoction that threatens to burn off his scalp.Denzel Washington has won beaucoups of rightly-deserved accolades for his amazing performance in the title role. If you've ever heard or seen Malcolm X's speaking, you will be astounded at the similarities in tone and cadence. The illusion is so real one may not recognize that real archival footage of Malcolm is used late in the film. But this is not a case of style over substance here. Between Washington's talent and Lee's directing and screenwriting, an unforgettable character emerges. The film boasts other fine performances by Al Freeman, Jr. (especially good as Elijah Muhammad, a controversial figure in society, and eventually to Malcolm himself), Delroy Lindo, Albert Hall, Kate Vernon, Ernest Thomas and many others in its large cast.It's clear that Lee doesn't care for the Motion Picture Academy and they don't particularly care for him. But the snubbing he and his picture got at Oscar time would be comparable to Richard Attenborough and 'Ghandi' not being nominated the year that film was made. Ordinarily, one would think this film is the kind of production Hollywood loves to honor. But Academy Award nominations or not, the film 'Malcolm X' is like the man himself: impossible to ignore.",

From the opening, when he accurately accuses the white man of all the injustices that the white man has perpetrated, to his conversion to Islam (and rejection of his slave surname), to his eventual assassination, the movie is top-notch in every respect.Having read Malcolm X's autobiography, I can affirm that the movie followed it very closely. Reading his autobiography will actually help you understand him even further. As will his indication that African-Americans bled for the white man in Korea, Japan, Italy, etc., so why shouldn't they bleed for their freedom at home? Anyway, \"Malcolm X\" is a perfect movie in every way.",

            "content": "This was a stirring tribute of a film that to this day still stands the test of time even after its release more than a decade ago. This was in fact a autobiography and educational film which some of the most electrifying performance ever displayed on film,and it is the reason to see why. This was Denzel Washington's finest piece of work and most notably the best of his career in which he should have been nominated for Best Actor Oscar category,instead of his work which he won the Best Actor statue for 2001's \"Training Day\". Anyway,\"Malcolm X\",was a brilliant tribute to the controversial black activist,a leader in the struggle for black liberation as well as black pride and one of the most outspoken individuals who had a different side of the civil rights movement where a time when America was at war with itself.Based on the best-selling autobiography by Malcolm X and Alex Haley,and with spellbinding direction by Spike Lee,it traces the story of Malcolm himself,from his days as a hustler and drug runner and hitting rock bottom during his imprisonment in the 1950's,he became a Black Muslim and then a leader in the Nation Of Islam under the guidance of the honorable Elijah Muhammad. His assassination in 1965 left a legacy of black nationalism,self-determination and racial pride that continues to the day and within a new generation whom for the first time has witnessed a masterpiece of cimematic work. This is marked by strong performances throughout with powerful direction by Spike Lee,cimematopgrapher Ernest Dickerson,and riveting breathtaking performances by Denzel Washington,Angela Bassett,and most notably from Al Freeman,Jr. as Elijah Muhammad. The real centerpiece of the film is from Denzel Washington himself,whose convincing performance in the title role brings this film alive. When this film came out,it only receive one Oscar nomination but however,the film garnered a lot of  awards including the NAACP Image Film Award,The New York Film Critics Award for Best Actor,The Los Angeles Times Film Award for Best Director and Best Actor,and MTV Movie Awards for both Denzel Washington and Al Freeman,Jr.--all of this happened in 1992,when the film came out.As far as the cameos go,this film had a lot of them in one picture including Black Panther Bobby Seale,Reverend Al Sharpton,The Honorable Nelson Mandela,Reverend Jesse Jackson,along with Hollywood walk-ons: Christopher Plummer,Karen Allen,Peter Boyle and Danny Glover,and Whoopi Goldberg.Brilliant!-Five Stars",

But as a film, I thought it was great. I really like Spike Lee; he keeps things fast-paced and interesting with his camera angles and colours/lighting. For awhile after Malcolm first begins his activism with the nation of Islam, you find yourself conflicted, both respecting the man and often disagreeing with him. Lee handles it well without condemning or supporting really, just showing Malcolm's gradual transition in his beliefs. The inserted documentary footage, especially at the end, shows how Malcolm's words still relate today. Someone commented that they only watched an hour of the movie and Lee doesn't know how to tell a story but maybe if they would be slightly more open-minded, realize it's not a literal adaptation of the autobiography, and actually finish the film, they could understand that Lee does not just want to tell the story of one man but rather wants it to reflect the struggle of a race. I really enjoyed the film; it was long but never slow and definitely worth watching.",

Malcolm X was beautifully acted by Denzel. He took Malcolm's mannerisms and passion into himself and carved this wonderful character. The film traced him from a young kid to his Nat'list days to his death. His beliefs were different, but he never compromised himself. Considering where he came from and the time he grew up in, no one can really yell and scream about why he was the way he was. So many want to glorify King as the only leader of the time, but X was a leader in his own right. His ideas weren't that different from King's. His approach was honest and a response to the times. Denzel shows every emotion in his face that seemed to formulate in his mind. I seriously thought of him as Malcolm. He really had to earn people's respect from the background he came from and I liked that. Nothing was glossed over and no stone left unturned. Malcolm X is a great film and worth the watch!",

His one weak area in this film was editing. There is no reason this movie couldn't have been half an hour shorter. Right off the bat, there were unnecessarily lingering camera shots and scenes that could have omitted. Off the top of my head, I'm thinking of Spike himself sliding under a woman's skirt and mugging the camera. That scene not only failed to further the story but instead made the audience stand up and say, \"Hey, that's Spike looking at us!\" Lee's biggest editing mistake was based on his desire to tell the story of Malcolm X AND tell the story of the African-American experience. That's more than enough for several movies so why cram it all under one title? After a clear scene illustrating X's life, Lee would move to a large dance hall to illustrate the richness of the African-American experience. A quick shot of the dance hall would have been sufficient. Instead the far away shots were maintained for too long and when the focus moved back to specific characters it moved to the character played by Lee himself. Why? I don't know. It certainly didn't help us to understand X any better. The ending with children saying \"I am Malcolm X\" also went on too long and should have been part of a separate feature. The cameos were distracting. The movie could have been tighter, shorter, and better except that Spike Lee wanted to put everything, including the kitchen sink, into it.That being said, it is a great movie and I'm glad I invested the three and a half hours to watch it.",

            "review_title": "Sadly one of Lee's flattest film but still a story worth hearing and features a good performance from Washington",
            "content": "Malcolm Little was a young man when his father was murdered by the KKK and he and his siblings were taken from their mother and separated.  As a young man he became a hustler and eventually a full robber with his friends, before eventually getting 8-12 years in prison for his crimes.  While inside he learns the ways of Elijah Muhammad and coverts to Islam.  Once released he rises in the ranks of the Nation of Islam to be an uncompromising leader of the black movement , tackling white oppression head on.Lee does not want any question about the tone of this film.  Opening with footage of the Rodney King beating projected onto an American flag that chars before bursting into flames while Malcolm's `American nightmare' speech is played over the top, Lee leaves us in no doubt that this film will not step back from being provocative and incendiary.  Unlike many reviews on this site, I will not review the politics of Malcolm X but I will try and view this as a film.  I do not need to agree with the stance of X to be interesting in this film - I did not watch this film to fight with it or get annoyed by it, I watched it to listen to Lee tell the story of Malcolm X.Substance wise, the film is too long - Lee did not allow the editors to be as ruthless as he should have been.  I can understand why though, this was a labour of love and he must have felt that he needed that long to do the job. As a flow it works reasonably well, although it is too baggy quite often, but it is an interesting story nonetheless.  Many critics have lambasted the film for it's bias.  In that regard the only thing that surprised me was that they genuinely seemed surprised by this fact - what did they expect from Spike Lee?  However, I don't believe that this is a fair accusation to make at Lee.  He tells the story in a fair light - he doesn't hide the double standards of the Nation of Islam nor does he spin the anti-white teachings to paint Malcolm in a better light.  Of course Lee is going to bring his own pro-black politics to the film, but that is his right and he doesn't rewrite history to serve himself.In fact I admired some of Lee's touches as they actually produced a more balanced view.  For example, where Malcolm is talking to Betty about his thoughts on women, Lee cuts to Malcolm being told the same opinion (word for word) by Muhammad - a brave move that implied the spoon feeding of his views that I didn't expect from Lee.  Of course the other way to look at it would be Lee excusing Malcolm's stance on women by pinning it on Muhammad and in fairness to that view, Lee does tend to gloss over the NOI's view on woman's place.  The film is a little kind to Malcolm but not to the point where the absurd claims about bias and spin would really stick - well, for the majority anyway.  I did feel that, although it wasn't spin, that the final 5 minutes of the film really went too far with the little kids all standing up saying `I am Malcolm X', parallels with Jesus and then Mandella being wheeled out...now THAT bit I found to be unnecessary as it was not from Malcolm - it was heavy politicing from Lee himself in further evidence that he was knocked off his usual style by the weight of the material.In fact, this stands out to me as being one of Lee's least stylish and slick films - only the early, freer scenes of Malcolm's crime, drink and dancing seem to be directed by a Spike Lee using the camera and the space.  For the most part, Lee sits back and watches - apparently in total reverence of this subject and afraid to take away from the supposed importance of what the film is trying to do.  It is a shame because the overly long running time means that it desperately needed a spark at times and I did expect Lee at least to bring the film alive with visual flourishes.  Sadly, like I say, Lee's respect for his subject causes him to do nothing and, worse still, he includes some bits that just don't work - Muhammad's appearance in the cell is worst but Malcolm's trip to Mecca doesn't work as it is overlong and forced (again, as Lee stresses that Malcolm dropped the anti-white stance). In regards this, critics have unfairly accused Lee of trying to lessen Malcolm's stance and make it more acceptable (ie change history) but those of us who are a bit older know that we will learn things over our life and will not hold the same opinions as we did when we were 18, or 25, or 30. In the same way Malcolm lost his harsh teachings with age - this is the case, it is not Lee trying to trick us.For all these reasons, the film is greatly in debt to Denzel Washington. If it weren't for his engaging and powerful performance then this film would be very bland for the majority.  Happily then, Washington rises to the role and deals with it's changes and development really well. He makes a charismatic leading man and it is difficult to imagine that anyone else could have done a better job with this role - or that the film would have worked without him.  The names of those involved is impressive, but not all their performances are.  Bassett varies between being a shy little woman and having raging fights with her husband, in neither mode does she convince. Freeman is also pretty comic - but part of the blame for that lies with Lee's portrayal of him (floating in a cell is not a good look!).  Hall, Lindo, Randle, McDaniel and Lee himself all do reasonably well in minor roles but the film belongs to Washington and it is just as well for the film's sake that he is up to the task.Overall this is an interesting film that is worth seeing as an INTRODUCTION to Malcolm X - however if you take your opinion from this film alone then you are doing yourself a disservice.  As a Spike Lee film it is surprisingly flat and lacking in the usual visual style that he brings, it is a real shame but this labour of love is not one of his better films (although it is not among his worst) - it is rather pedestrian, overlong and, were it not for a charismatic performance from Washington, would be a lot duller than the subject deserved.",

Throughout the course of the movie, we see Malcolm go through a transformation from street hustler, to convict, to positive black leader.  Malcolm X was only violent and hateful towards white people until he made his pilgrimage to Mecca, the holiest city of Islam. When he got there he never saw so many people of many different races worshiping Allah.  It was then that he decided to change his views of race. After that, it was then that he realized the mistakes that he had made and decided to break off his relationship with Elijah Muhammad and the rest of the Muslims, who in fact were the real hate mongers and that's why they later killed him, because he didn't feed on hate anymore.Another thing about director Spike Lee.  Spike Lee is in fact, probably one of the most under-appreciated African-American directors in Hollywood.  His movies have many underlying messages about race in America.  It's a shame that his movies are so under-appreciated.  Sure his movies are \"critically acclaimed\", but that doesn't mean that people are actually getting the messages he is trying to send.

            "content": "Malcolm X cannot truthfully be said to be one of Spike Lee's best films, but it was an important step for him, perhaps the most important one of his career. This biopic, and Spike's fifth full-length feature, makes only partial sense as a follow-up to his greatest classics, Do The Right Thing, Mo' Better Blues and Jungle Fever, the three films in which he created and developed his unique voice and made a name for himself as one of the most prominent independent filmmakers in the US; Spike's own voice can barely be heard in Malcolm X, and his usually immediately recognizable trademarks are tough to point out. The reason is that for the first time in his career Spike Lee took a step back, and he is not the dominant personality in the film; the dominant personality is Malcolm X himself, and Spike let Malcolm's voice be heard throughout the film louder than anything else.So Malcolm X is less a work of art and more a statement than Spike's previous films. It's scope is immensely larger than anything he did before \u0096 it does, after all, span 200 minutes \u0096 and is therefore, naturally, not as tight and focused as Do The Right Thing or Jungle Fever; but in Malcolm X Spike tackles head on the very subjects he treated with symbolism and subtlety in those films, and it was therefore a natural and important progression for him, and a logical continuation of those movies, and in it he proved that he has more than one voice. In a biopic, and for that matter, in any docu-drama, the most important factor is for the director to care about the subject, and I'm yet to see a director who's more passionate about his subject than Mr. Lee.Malcolm X boasts a huge ensemble casts, with wonderful performances by Delroy Lindo, Angela Bassette, Al Freeman Jr. (in a harrowing performance as Muslim extremist Elijah Muhammad) and Spike Lee himself \u0096 but the movie is still entirely Malcolm X's, and therefore Denzel Washington's. Spike's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 gave a lifetime performance in Mo' Better Blues two years earlier, but he surpassed it with his gut-wrenching portrayal of Malcolm X, which earned him an Oscar nomination (unfortunately lost to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman) and based him as one of the best actors of his generation.Although Malcolm X is not Spike Lee's best film, it's an important film that needed to be made, and it's a good thing that Spike was the one to do it. More than it's an impressive, moving, beautiful movie \u0096 and it is - Malcolm X's story is a story that must be heard, and this biopic is a film that, truly, every cultured and intelligent person needs to watch.",

            "review_title": "A Bloated Biopic!",
            "content": "With Malcolm X, director/co-screenwriter Spike Lee has produced a true-to-life biopic on the title character who was first a strident advocate for the American Nation of Islam during the 1950's and early 60's, later becoming an extremely high profile human rights activist during the civil rights movement, before his assassination in 1965.The film dramatises key events in Malcolm X's life with the main thread beginning with his post war criminal career and later conversion to Islam whilst in jail, which directly led to his assumption of the identity of Malcolm X . Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's mental illness, and his experiences with racism are dramatised in (ironically) brief flashbacks, considering the elephantine length of the rest of the film.From my understanding of the life of Malcolm X, Lee has stuck closely to the facts in constructing his biography. I believe there is only a limited amount of fictionalisation for artistic and dramatic licence. For that, I guess many will be grateful. Lee has also recreated the roughly two decades the film's story covers, extremely authentically. The sets and costuming are first class, with occasional pieces of newsreel footage and still photos supplementing that of his own filming. The performances are uniformly outstanding. Denzal Washington must have been desperately unlucky to miss out on the 1992 Academy Award for his powerful, central portrayal of the conspicuously, hard-nosed and divisive X.For me though at 202 long minutes, this film is too dragged out and warranted tighter editing. The first act focusing on his early life of crime in Harlem and later Boston is for instance, needlessly protracted with interesting, but ultimately quite unimportant night club dancing and musical interludes. Could it possibly be that its prolonged appearance is due to Spike Lee himself, appearing in this section as a supporting character?Malcolm X is a technically well-made, obvious labour of love for Lee, but I think it may have reached wider audiences if edited to a more manageable, less indulgent length.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\", the major winner of the Academy Awards in 1992 for best director and best film, is good solid film-making. However, \"Malcolm X\", produced and directed by Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington in the title role, is a bona fide masterpiece--a 20th century film equivalent to a masterwork of the Renaissance. Certainly, it may be unfair to evaluate the two films against each other, but since one received much more acclaim than the other during the year of its release, it begs comparison. However, it's like comparing a Caravaggio with Michaelangelo's frescoes atop the Sistine Chapel. The first is certainly exceptional but the latter is a magnum opus. \"Malcolm X\" is Spike Lee's Sistine Chapel. Like Selznik's \"Gone with the Wind\" or Welles' \"Citizen Kane\", \"Malcolm X\" may be hard to top.The only thing equally as superb as Washington's acting is the directing and the script, which is at once honest and compelling. Except for a coda at the end that seems at odds with the rest of the film, the script is near perfect, relying heavily on true accounts of Malcolm X's life instead of altering the story to fit prescribed entertainment values, a bad habit of Hollywood filmmakers. Instead, Lee and Washington rely on Malcolm X and his history as the guiding force behind the film. Many of the incidences portrayed in \"Malcolm X\" actually happened, from his father being assassinated on railroad tracks, to the young Malcolm being involved with drug dealing to his rise as a star among the Nation of Islam, or so-called Black Muslims. In one scene that is history and not fiction, Malcolm X orders his entourage of male associates to stand outside a hospital when a fellow Muslim, Brother Johnson, requires medical attention.Malcolm Little was an African-American, the son of an assassinated preacher whose family had sustained vicious threats from the KKK. As a young man, he relocated to Harlem and became a streetwise hoodlum involved in crime gangs. Racketeering, gambling, prostitution, and drug dealing were his first religion. Then after an incident with white girls that landed himself and his associate Shorty (Spike Lee, perfectly cast) in jail, he meets a member of a new religious organization claiming kinship with Muslims in the Middle East and re-claiming their African roots.Headed by the honorable Elijah Muhammad who had converted to Islam and brought the religion (or at least his version of it) to the United States as the Nation of Islam, the so-called Black Muslims (although they do not refer to themselves as such) lures Malcolm into a new world of honesty, compassion, and purpose. To the their credit, the religious organization gives Malcolm Little, now renamed Malcolm X, a sense of purpose, an identity, a loving community, and rehabilitation from the vices that were destroying himself in Harlem.After his conversion, he becomes a prominent voice among the sect, a spokesperson for the honorable Elijah Muhammad and his message of religious determinism. Simultaneously, they also preach dangerous messages including that all white folks are devils, and that the honorable Elijah Muhammad is to be obeyed without question. As the spokesman of their cause against whites, Malcolm X in some ways becomes the darker side of Martin Luther King, Jr who propagated that proclaiming African-American superiority was as sinful as proclaiming white superiority. The press dubbed Malcolm X the \"angriest man in America\".Washington does more than just portray Malcolm X, he becomes him. Washington, I imagine, must have studied footage of his speeches and spoken with people who knew him. Speeches of the real Malcolm X as compared to speeches in the film as enacted by Washington are almost indistinguishable. His performance ranks as one of the top two or three performances by an actor in the history of the performing arts and cinema, up there with Ben Kingsly as Gandhi, Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane, Laurence Olivier as Hamlet, and Vivian Leigh as Scarlet O'Hara.The turn in the film occurs when, in the wake of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Malcolm makes some ill-conceived remarks to the press. Malcolm X further learns that Elijah Muhammad is not practicing all that he preaches. The star of the so-called \"Black Muslims\" begins questioning not only his role but the integrity of the entire movement. He then makes a pilgrimage to Mecca, required at least once in the lifetime of a Muslim. His pilgrimage changes many of his views.It's hard to describe this film without using many superlatives, but if there was ever a film that deserved it, it's \"Malcolm X\". Washington and Lee do a tremendous job of neither vilifying nor idealizing Malcolm X, the man. In retrospect on the man, I think Malcolm X began to realize he could serve a higher purpose to help unify rather than divide the races. In the end, Malcolm X began to encourage that dream, but, like Martin Luther King Jr, his mission was cut short. As for the film, it is an honest tribute to one of the most memorable figures of American history. And like the man himself, the work may only be appreciated by later generations. Malcolm X is the embodiment of the American story.",

            "content": "It's impressive this biopic, \"Malcolm X,\" works as well as it does given its rather difficult production, beset by outcries on all sides as to the portrayal of the controversial historical figure, and given its 3-hours-plus length by a writer and director, Spike Lee, who has been criticized for his bluntness and excessiveness, at least occasionally, and a star, Denzel Washington, who is often celebrated more the more over-the-top his performances. Yet, the film is remarkable for its relative restraint and balance. We see all sides of each, and, ultimately, I think we mostly experience the best of them.There's the Malcolm Little born a son to a preacher harassed by the KKK and murdered, to be raised in a discriminatory system of foster care; \"Red,\" the zoot-suit-wearing lover of a white woman who becomes a gangster; the prisoner converted to the Nation of Islam and to civil-rights minister \"Malcolm X\"; and, finally, the more tolerant and cooperative Muslim activist out to lead his own mosque before his assassination. Lee seems to revel in the free-flowing zoot suit and gangster parts--even casting himself as a sidekick, and he mostly reserves his usual didactic overkill this time--making sure to connect past to present racism--to the opening (including footage of the beating of Rodney King) and an ending that admittedly helps cleanse the palate from the protagonist's tragic death, as well as including images of wealthy African Americans who donated money to bring the production to completion (plus, who can say anything bad about a cameo from Nelson Mandela). For the most part, Lee lets the compelling narrative of Malcolm X be told. Arguably, even, America's history of white supremacy doesn't receive enough criticism throughout the film. In the later parts, the Nation of Islam and Elijah Muhammad, instead, come across as the picture's main foes (which makes it all the more odd that the Fruit of Islam provided security for the film) while the FBI eavesdrops under its COINTELPRO program of undermining American civil-rights and political organizations.As for Denzel Washington's performance, I think there's a good case for his being robbed of the Oscar. That year, as typical, the Academy awarded an actor, Al Pacino, for overblown histrionics. Likewise, it took Washington ranting and raving in \"Training Day\" (2002) before he was awarded the Best Actor Oscar. Despite criticisms of extremism and the natural focus on speechifying the part requires, such tactics wouldn't work for playing Malcolm X. There are moments requiring silent reflection and intelligent argumentation. In the end, it turns out that Spike Lee and Malcolm X are more moderate in their radicalism, ultimately compromising within larger systems seeking progress, whether they employ traditional filmic storytelling and hagiography or try to cooperate with other civil-rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., than some give them credit for.",

I don't want Spike Lee to act in this movie. It's too much of a distraction. Spike does lay out his life very well and leaves it up to audience to some extent on what his life truly means.

Perhaps the Three Hours , Twenty Two minutes running time put me off in the past but there is no doubt , this is one of the best performance the great man has ever put in .This is a biographical epic of the controversial and influential black nationalist leader, from his early life and career as a small-time gangster, to his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam.Despite it's length , I never felt this film outstayed it's welcome.It's a well paced movie and I have to say it's much farer than I was expecting .It highlights the good and the bad of Malcolm X and isn't just a vehicle to batter the non black population of America .Denzel is fantastic. Not only do you feel this IS Malcolm X ( especially in the latter part of film ) you absolutely buy into his performance.It's not his greatest ever role , I think that will always be as Alonzo in Training Day , but it's very close second .If I had to be critical I would say it's a little self indulgent on Spike Lee's part . He casts himself as Shorty and has quite a few scenes . He , himself will admit ( I hope) that he's not a great actor and it does show at times.The rest of the cast are superb . Angela Bassett and Delroy Lindo are always fantastic to watch and it's interesting to see early performances from Wendell Pierce and Giancarlo Esposito who both went on to star in The Wire and Breaking Bad respectively .If you want an in-depth look at Malcolm X then this is the perfect film .Highly recommended.",

The story starts with his childhood where his mother who goes insane leaving him and his siblings as orphans. He starts in a life of crime before discovering the Muslim religion while in jail. This religion changes his life forever, helps him get released from jail, and sets him up as a public speaker for his faith. He quickly rises in notoriety which brings him as much success as it does challenges. This movie is directed by and stars Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing) and also stars Denzel Washington (Man on Fire), Angela Bassett (Strange Days), Delroy Lindo (Get Shorty), Theresa Randle (Bad Boys) and Albert Hall (Major Payne). This is the ultimate character piece that shows the vast evolutions of a character. His perspectives and outlooks changed so significantly over time and that is brilliantly depicted. The writing in this is so fantastic as is the acting. This is probably my all time favorite Denzel Washington picture, though Spike Lee is very good in this too. The settings, cinematography and outfits in this are out of control good. Overall there's nothing I'd change about this movie and this is an American cinema masterpiece.

            "content": "I think the major success of Alex Haley with this movie is that he tells the story of a dynamic person known as 'Malcolm X' with such a skill that no man from any part of any society get his feelings hurt. I think it is a commendable effort from Alex Haley, Spike Lee and Danzel Washington that they made a hero out of Malcolm X. I think he deserved it because he was the man who was not after money or popularity......he changed his statements, his way of life , even his faith as he knew that those were true. The theme of the movie is very clear that Malcolm X was not a hardliner rather he was always open for truth. Secondly, it also emphasized though in the end that negotiations and reforms is a better way than the violence. But yet it also gave the message that the ruling races reap the violence which they breed themselves; sometimes in the hegemony of their power or sometimes due the wrong interpretation of their religious verdicts. I think it was right to hit at the ' Black organization known as nation of Islam' and Elijah Muhammad. Muslim community is itself greatly indebted to this movie because Elijah Muhammad's teaching were very far from Islam. The real Islam practiced worldwide does not believe in the continuance of prophet-hood after Muhammad (P.B.U.H)and the Black supremacy by Elijah Muhammad was a ridiculous idea as Islam does not believe in Nationalism. Any Muslim anywhere in the world whether black or white are equal in Islam's teachings. It was great to see the scenes of pilgrimage to Makkah ....... these were not unnecessary ......because they helped us to understand the sudden change in the teachings of Malcolm X. Denzel's acting is really superb and also that of Al Freeman Jr. I think this movie is an invaluable resource for the people who want to take an insight into the Malcolm X's life.",

Through flashbacks, we learn his father, Earl Little, was a minister who supported the return of African-Americans to Africa. Earl is murdered by white racists, but the authorities treat his death as a suicide. Malcolm's mother, Louise, then has her children taken from her. Malcolm does well in school but is discouraged from considering a profession since he's black and is encouraged to become a carpenter.As a teenager, Malcolm lives in Boston and Harlem, where he's fully into jive, complete with fancy dress, booze, and women. His best friend is Shorty (Spike Lee). Malcolm straightens his hair with chemicals and has a sexual relationship with a white woman, Sophia.In Harlem, he gets into the numbers racket but has a falling out with his boss and escapes back to Boston, where he, Shorty, Sophia, and another white woman become thieves. Eventually, they are caught, and Malcolm and Shorty are sentenced to 8-10 years in prison. In prison, Malcolm is converted to the Nation of Islam by Baines. After leaving prison in 1952, Malcolm becomes acquainted with Elijah Muhammad, the Nation of Islam's leader, and over time becomes the Nation's most prominent spokesperson. Malcolm also meets Betty Shabazz, and they are married in 1958.Malcolm's popularity becomes an issue within the Nation of Islam, and his remarks after John Kennedy's assassination give Elijah Muhammad the chance to silence Malcolm X. By early 1964, Malcolm leaves the Nation of Islam, takes a pilgrimage to Mecca, and softens his rhetoric as he saw that Islam included people of all races.The tension with the Nation of Islam increases and Malcolm fears violence from them, ending in his assassination in 1965. The film suggests the Nation of Islam was not alone in planning the attack on Malcolm X.This is a truly remarkable biopic. Denzel Washington deserved to win the Oscar that year. All the actors were excellent. I even got a Christopher Plummer cameo as a tone-deaf-on-racism chaplain in prison. There are also cameos by Nelson Mandela, William Kuntsler, Al Sharpton, and Bobby Seale.",

            "content": "Malcolm X is many things to many people, but one can never say he didn't make a significant mark on his time and for 'his' people, as he and the Nation of Islam defined it. But 'his' was contingent on his religion, his experience growing up and being an 'Afro-American' in the United States, and as it turned out it was not set in stone. What Spike Lee's film does so compellingly is shine light on the history of the man and his place in a country with one of the most disturbing, racist histories in the world, and not make it too dogmatic or beyond reproach. On the contrary, this is one of Lee's most commercial works, made in epic form and imbued with his style at the top of his game. Only Do the Right Thing, in terms of his non-documentary features, tops this for sheer directorial virtuosity and intelligence with the subject matter.How much it sticks true to the autobiography of Malcolm X (as told to Alex Haley) I can't say yet, having not read the book. But for what it's worth, on its own terms, Lee crafts his story with the grandiosity appropriate to the character and the circumstances. Malcolm (Washington) is born to a religious man, but one who's killed by white people. He's denied his dream of being a lawyer and forced into labor. He becomes a criminal and is sentenced to 10 years for multiple counts of theft. And then in prison is changed around by Baines (Albert Hall), who converts him to the Nation of Islam and its teachings. It's mind-opening because, for the first time for him, his perception comes clearer than ever regarding the black experience- and what are really their rights, which have been few since the abolishment of slavery- and he becomes the big cultural figure he's remembered as.Even if one doesn't agree with all of the philosophy and speeches from Malcolm- and it's not hard to see why Malcolm had so many enemies, even from his own fold- it absorbs one not terribly familiar with what he was about in thought and practice and deed, and it gets the audience thinking one way or another about the nature of racism and race and separation in America. And past all that, it's directed with nerve and pizazz, while not going too far off into avant-garde. For all of Lee's success here as a storyteller, it wouldn't be quite the same without the star; oddly enough once he's off the screen- for the final ten minutes which becomes a long eulogy that drags on longer than necessary in nearing pomposity- it doesn't work as well. Every moment he's on camera, whether in the early years in Boston and Harlem as a thug or as X himself in full public figure mode on stage and behind closed doors, it's a reminder why he's the star he is. It's simply one of his very best performances, full of subtlety and wit and bigger-than-life bravura moments that usually (though not this time get Oscars.It's a period piece, it's a history lesson, it's a biography, and a testament to the possibility for a person to change. But above all else, Malcolm X works as a movie, and it's watchable in that big-movie-event kind of way without the usual drawbacks.",

The film's strongest asset is Denzel Washington's lead performance; he undergoes several character progressions throughout as the film documents his whole transformation from convicted criminal to angry protester to revered public figure. The film benefits from some magnificent editing too with well-melded, dreamlike childhood flashbacks, a clever cutaway in which Washington imagines throw a cake in a condescending young man's face and some very deliberate cutting in a scene in which he looks up the definitions of 'black' and 'white' in the dictionary (probably the most potent part of the entire movie). The Oscar nominated costumes (zoot suits in particular) are great too. What does not quite work so well though is Lee's choice to unabashedly celebrate the title character. The sentimental epilogue seems ill-judged. Also, given how callous Malcolm is shown at times (coldly telling a sympathetic young white woman that she cannot do anything to help his cause) and how close-minded he is on certain issues, he always seems like more a deeply flawed man with his heart in the right place than a leader worthy of Lee's celebratory treatment. Never to mind, the film is engaging the whole way through, regardless of how one views the title character, with nary a boring moment to be had - which is a quite remarkable achievement for a that film clocks in at over three hours in length.",

            "content": "There's two ways to look at this movie: as an entertaining evening filler, a roller-coaster of a movie, it's very successful -- strange, and no mean feat, for a biopic about a radical black leader from yesteryear. As a biography however, which is supposed to tell you the truth about a person, I think it's simply a piece of blatant propaganda. I see it as a lost chance to do the man Malcolm X Little justice, and also to show up the critical aspects of his persona.The acting is great, I particularly enjoyed Angela Bassett as Malcolm X's wife Betty Shabazz, as well as director Spike Lee playing Malcolm's zoot era friend, the wily Shorty. Overall this movie is well made, as can be expected of a great director such as Spike Lee.OK, let's focus on content, then. Malcolm X wasn't Martin Luther King, but this movie portrays him like he had been King's ghetto version. In his autobiography, Malcolm X describes himself as having started as a street thug, although one who was driven to this life by racism, who was transformed in prison to a black minister and leader. An alternative but possibly more enlightened way to describe his career would be that he took up the same profession as his father, that of a black separatist minister (his father had followed Marcus Garvey, Malcolm followed Elijah Muhammad instead).Another fact that the movie didn't bring out is that the Nation Of Islam are no Muslims. They were an idiosyncratic black American sect which borrowed some formal aspects from Islam, and sold Elijah Muhammad instead of adhering to his prophet namesake. One interesting question to ask yourself about Malcolm X is, when did he figure out that the NOI were about as halal as ham hock? If he really only became wise to the game after Muhammad had kicked him out, that would have made him seem a bit dim in the intellectual department (and I don't think that he was anything but sharp). But if he found out before then why didn't he leave the sect by himself? Does anyone really buy his magic transformation into a proper Muslim and non-racist on the hadj he went on after he had been forced to leave NOI? In the movie, Malcolm starts to doubt Elijah Muhammad pretty abruptly when he finds out that he has fathered children with his -- very much younger -- secretaries. This is shown melodramatically where the mothers are dressed up in their full freaky NOI costume, have their darling children playing around their feet and profess that they are only worried about their toddlers' wellbeing, i. e. present the picture of purity. I didn't buy that either, neither in the film nor in Malcolm X's life.There are simply some aspects this movie should have addressed, some questions it should have raised. Instead it \"cultivates\" and adulates Malcom X. Apart from being a fierce speaker and writer, what actual plans did Malcolm X have? Did he implement them, did they work out, did they fail? How serious was he about separating the races, or was that just rhetorics? Did he actually further or hinder the Civil Rights movement? Didn't he, especially in the light of Obama, fail quite badly by his own standards? One scene I didn't buy at all was when Malcolm liberates a black man from racist police imprisonment. He threatens the officer in charge by telling him to look out of the window, through which we see a thin row of NOI goons standing before the police precinct. Somehow the captain freaks at the sight of 20 dudes in suits and ties and immediately gives in. In the following scene, Malcolm gives them a sign and they turn around like robots and march off. Wow, that's how the NOI fought? Too bad Martin Luther King hadn't thought of that. Although I'd advise anyone not to don suit and tie and descend on the local police outpost yet. Spike Lee feeds us off with simple cinematic razzle-dazzle.Spike Lee also tells us quite unambiguously that Malcolm's father was murdered by the KKK, where this is at best highly speculative.Another point: were the NOI with their guru, their uniforms, their sex separation and their bodyguards not perhaps a pretty scary outfit? Scary not only in \"the KKK had finally met their match\"-sense but more as in \"made the KKK seem like a regular bunch of guys with a hood fixation, and the John Birch Society like a bunch of hippies\"? Just a thought.Then in the final scene Spike Lee serves up a \"I'm Malcom X\" scene which wouldn't have looked out of place in a Stalinist propaganda film.Malcolm X once said that all his achievements should be blamed on Allah, and only his failings on himself. Spike Lee should have taken his word. If you want to learn more about Malcolm X, then even his autobiography is a better choice.",

In the early scenes we see Malcolm X (Denzel Washington) starting out as a criminal under his accomplice named West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo). He starts by robbing houses along with his assistant Shorty (Spike Lee) and joining his for the ride is a hot young blond named Sophia (Kate Vernon) with whom he chooses as a love interest over a much well-behaved African-American girl named Laura (Theresa Randle). Later on, Malcolm ends up incarcerated and opposing the Biblical teachings from Chaplain Gill (Christopher Plummer) and seems more on the side of African-American Muslim convert Baines (Albert Hall). Once he's discharged, he become the top followers of the Nation of Islam under the influence of Elijah Muhammad (Al Freeman Jr.) Malcolm X becomes a charismatic celebrity, which the white press so arbitrarily decided to lash out controversy towards this young radical. As his bravado increased proportionately, the Nation of Islam became very envious about it while the Nation of Islam becomes a part of a scandal involving Elijah's illegitimate children.Malcolm eventually married Dr. Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) and raise three wonderful daughters. He then makes a religious journey to Mecca and declares that not all Caucasians are not entirely evil. When he returns to America, he breaks ties with the Nation of Islam and establishes a rival church that fits the modern spirit at the time. The Nation of Islam did not take this very well and at the Audubon Hotel in Manhattan on February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was beginning a speech when a disturbance takes shape, Malcolm tries to calm everybody down and was gunned down (one of the shooters was his former friend Baines). The movie itself was very high in terms of budget in spite of the very gargantuan production costs. Denzel was nominated at the Oscars for Best Actor in a leading role, but sadly was ousted by Al Pacino for his role in \"Scent of a Woman.\" Washington had to wait several years before winning the Leading Actor Oscar in the film \"Training Day.\" The film itself was quite accurate in the time period clothes making it very authentic and the lingo spoken by the characters was very appropriate during the time period. The costume design was also in Oscar contention as well. The other high point was that many scenes were very well filmed, especially the uproar during Malcolm X's assassination.Sure it was praised by many including myself, there are still quite a few issues that didn't sit very well with me. Some of these were small nit-pickings while others were much more bigger that truly hindered the film from being anything but perfect. Where to start was the singing performance by Miki Howard, who was supposed to play the part of Billie Holiday, but her voice doesn't even come close to even sounding like her. Anybody who listens to jazz and Big Band music know Holiday's familiar voice. It wouldn't have hurt if she just lip-synched from a Holiday soundtrack and it would have been more convincing. Lee really should have known better. The more obvious falsifications come from the character Sophia. She's hanging out at an all black girls nightclub and just freely throws herself in Malcolm's arms with no indication as to he is. I'm sorry but that is very illogical. It's just a scene designed to get male viewers' attention. It would never happen to you even if you have Washington's looks.It seems strange that the Nation of Islam has a hostile attitude to Washington who at the time looked decent, well-caring family man who loved his wife and kids. Did he munch on pork rinds at the time? Who knows?Another unanswered question stems from the scene where he stands up the cops after they unmercifully beat the tar out of a black man. Malcolm brings in a group of identically dressed black men to await for his command. Where did he find them and how did they fall into his lead? And what's the purpose of them acting like soldiers? To me they're there to look cool behind the camera if nothing else. And finally I must wonder what does Malcolm X himself truly stand for? He transforms from a thief in his early years, to a radical Islamic radical and finally reconsiders his thoughts long enough and before you know it he's murdered. Sure his mission was to for equality, but his execution was more radical rather than peaceful. He was separated from most of his life and wanted his fellow people not to anticipate with anything the white majority did and joined a church who eventually turned against him by having him killed. These quibbles are what brought this movie down. I think some editing should have been greatly desired as this movie went on too long and many scenes needed further explanation. But other than that, the performances were excellent an Washington acted his heart here as the the other performers. But the illogical scenarios brought this film down from being an absolute masterpiece.",

            "content": "I was keen to watch this bio-pic of the life and times of black activistic leader Malcolm X. I've recently watched a Netflix series principally investigating his murder but also documenting his past and have a general interest in the politics of the 50's and 60's, including the Civil Rights struggle in America.Perhaps that was my mistake. I was pretty captivated by the real Malcolm I saw in the documentary, impressed by his appearance, speaking voice and latterly his message, once he freed himself from merely spouting the teachings of the Nation of Islam religious group. Denzel Washington, being the prominent black actor of his day was, I guess the natural choice for the lead and it was no surprise to see the film directed by Spike Lee either.I have to come out and say though, that I found the film to be way too slow and long. We get well over an hour of Malcolm's formative years with it seeming obvious to me that Lee was much happier filming this part of the movie as we check out some sharp-dressed black individuals shucking and jiving on Harlem, none sharper than the young Malcolm himself, throwing themselves around on the dance-floor. Naturally, Lee again gives himself his own customary good part in the process as Malcolm's buddy Shorty. The choreographed moves and flashy outfits, plus for no real reason, an appearance by Billie Holliday seem to me to have no other purpose to be in the movie other than to fan Lee's vanity and own sense of wish-filfulment.Finally though, after a long spell in jail for housebreaking, Malcolm is converted to the Nation of Islam adopts the name Malcolm X and through his eloquence, intelligence and industry rises through the ranks to become the organisation's second-in-command directly below its figurehead, the Honourable Prophet Elijah Mohammed. From there he becomes a national figure in America with his provocative speeches advocating active black resistance to the oppression of the white man, before he breaks with the group over the Prophet's personal behaviour, siring numerous children with attractive young female followers and with ill-considered offensive remarks of his own made directly after JFK's assassination. It all ends up with frighteningly real depictions of the fire-bomb on his house, with him, his wife and four young children inside which occurred just a week before his inevitably brutal assassination at the Audubon Ballroom in New York, reportedly by House of Islam disciples.It's clear that Lee was determined to raise awareness of Malcolm in the public consciousness, which is all very laudable but I think he goes overboard in almost sanctifying him by lining up a bunch of school-kids to say \"I am Malcolm X\" to the camera and even garnering a cameo appearance by Nelson Mandela singing his praises. I also felt that Washington didn't get sufficiently inside the character to convince me he was Malcolm and doesn't even try to adopt his distinctive vocal delivery.Like I said, on the whole I found the film too wordy, too static and too imbalanced to really work as a movie. I appreciate that back when the movie was made there was perhaps a case for this adulatory, non-critical examination of his life but if you want a history lesson on the man and his mission, I think there are now a number of documentaries as well as books out there which will give a better rounded picture of this complex, charismatic and in the end tragic individual.",

It details how he came up from being a petty street hustler to the Nation Of Islam most outspoken character. It also deals with the events that lead to his assassination.Denzel Washington's best performance was here and what does he win an award for? Training Day. Now do you see why they say these awards mean nothing? Denzel role as Malcolm X is just as flawless as Will Smith's role of Muhammed Ali. I still get goosebumps when I hear him speak and I've seen a lot of Malcolm X's actual speeches. Angela Bassett did a great job as his wife and the supporting actors and actresses were great too. My gripe is the certain inaccuracies in the movie and the idea that the Nation Of Islam has something to do with his death is debatable. As far as I'm concerned those guys were flunkies for those people in high places. If not by signature then by nature. At any rate I would still recommend this movie, flaws and all, to anybody that is interested but first read up on his life before you watch this movie. Kudos to Spike Lee for doing his best with the information he was given.Rest in Peace Malcolm X.",

            "content": "Actually I can be very short about this movie; it's one that serves its purpose and serves it well. It's a biopic that does nothing else but telling you all of the right required information you need to know about Malcolm X.So it's a biopic and nothing more and nothing less really. You could say that this is enough, since it simply serves its purpose but I prefer a biopic with a clear story to it, that features a beginning, middle and end that are all connect and not a movie that chronicles the life of a person, through fragments. Or maybe at least something that makes the movie 'spectacular' and memorable to watch. Nothing about this movie stands out really. It remains on the safe side of things and I never felt really involved with the movie or any of its characters. It was like I was watching a moving history book. And again, there is nothing wrong with this but not the type of approach for a biopic that I prefer seeing.But really, the movie does a good job at telling you the life story of Malcolm X. When you are too lazy or incapable of reading a book and documentaries perhaps aren't your thing but you would still like to learn about Malcolm X; this is a good way to do it! Personally I knew very little about him, which I realized all the more after finishing watching the movie. I'm glad I watched it and feel more enriched now. And even while that the movie is almost 4 hours long I'm sure that the movie left a lot of things out, deliberately or not, I feel like it did a more than great job at covering all of the fundamental things you need to know about its subject.The one foremost thing I now especially respect Malcolm X for was that he made black people proud of their color and race, which also taught them to stand up for themselves and show them that they are worthy of all things that are great.It's definitely a well told movie. After all, it's over 3 hours long, yet it never starts to feel overlong or tiresome. It probably is because the movie is always moving. It doesn't linger too long on just one particular period of Malcom X's life and is being set at lots of different locations. It never becomes a movie that drags or slows down too much in any way, which is a real accomplishment for a movie this long. Spike Lee deserves lots of credits for that!The movie gets almost entirely carried by Denzel Washington, who earned a well deserved Oscar nomination for his leading role as Malcolm X. Even though he doesn't look very much like the real Malcolm X, he still convincingly becomes him through his acting and the love and passion he puts into his role. No doubt that a lot of the people involved shared a love and passion for its subject, which shows in the movie. You might question its objectivity because of that at times but it still makes this a good and more than maintaining movie to watch.The movie also does a great job at capturing all of its different time periods, which the movie is taking place in. The movie also still manages to maintain one style throughout, which lets the movie feel like one big whole.Well, I thought that I could be short about this movie but it seems like I failed at that. I could summarize it by saying that it's simply a really good biopic!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

What is also wrong? Bad pacing, very badly conceived flashback scenes and a very very tedious plot. Generally, such films are often a victim of their own weight - they sink like a marble brick, and they are too wordy. Like here, it is the same endless amount of smart speeches and oratories, but after two hours you feel a strong desire to switch to Mr. Bean or Benny Hill. Malcolm X was not a good man and he fell a victim of his own faith, we know that, and what he preached was wrong. So, no matter how much Spike Lee and Denzel tried, they failed to make us like this cold, ruthless, icy man of no sorrow. I felt no sorrow either for him or for his work, and the documentary footage of great late Dr. Martin Luther King Jnr only proved how much better this Baptist minister was than that loud and brash preacher.

            "content": "Spike Lee newly acquired position as the top dog amongst Afroamerican directors with extremely high art-house appeal was put to good use with initiating the production of \"Malcolm X\". Based on his autobiography with slight parts edited in, updated or filled Spike Lee dares not to venture far from the source material giving this key figure in black activism an extremely accurate, albeit lengthy movie portrayal. Not backing down on a critique of the small-minded \"Nation of Islam\" Spike Lee also unabashedly takes on Malcolm X's point of view in the key breakaway from the movement by its biggest spokesperson.A huge figure for black America is gifted a great cinematographic autobiography, which only flaw is being too short while running over 3 hours. Certain key aspects of Malcolm X's life are glossed over (like his prison term or the fate of his mother), as is a glaring under-focusing on post-Hajj era of Malcolm's career, the one which in all essence has the most profound and lasting impact, also is most cited and revered. The road from rags to moral riches is a passionate and convincing one, especially in the gifted hands of Denzel Washington, the only person worthy of an Oscar in 1993 for Best Actor. Starting of from a low-life cat with sticky fingers and a jail-bird through a period of religious fanaticism, until finally discovering his own voice is a spectacular journey through his career, one that could well last 2-3 more hours and still not bore. Flashes into childhood are overwhelmingly brilliant in building context, focus and vividly present the remarkable life of a true American hero.",

            "content": "Malcolm X, Spike Lee's epic portrayal of the street hustler turned spokesman for the Nation of Islam who was assassinated at the age of 39, is undoubtedly the director's most assured, complex and mature film, but it is a wonder that it was ever made at all. Controversy began long before production even started, with heavy criticism laid on the fact that Norman Jewison was lined up direct what many, including Lee, felt was a project a black director should handle. When Jewison gracefully bowed out and Lee took over, many still felt that the polarising activist's life would somehow be whitewashed, labelling Lee a 'Buppie' (middle-class African-American).The irony of many of the statements thrown at the biopic before it was even made was highlighted, and the resulting film was a 3 hour 20 minute testament to Lee's persistence at getting his hands on a story he had dreamt about making since film school. The studio had thrown in a budget for and insisted on a 2 hour 15 minute running time, but Lee, understanding that the contradictions and evolution of Malcolm's teachings and the many events and influences that helped shape the man demanded a longer running time. When the budget was exhausted, Lee called in for donations from the African-American community, and many of them obliged. Somehow, it's still too short to really get to heart of Malcolm, but it's certainly a far better film than it would have been had Lee not been so insistent at bringing his vision to the screen.Malcolm's life was crammed with incident, and Lee does a decent job getting almost everything in. Flashbacks to his childhood, when his mother and father were tormented by the Ku Klux Klan and his family lived under the constant threat of death, are juxtaposed with his early life as a sharp-suited, ambitious numbers runner in Harlem known as Red, working underneath gangster West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo). His actions soon land him in prison, where he meets Baines (Albert Hall), a fellow inmate working for Elijah Muhammad (Al Freeman Jr.) and the Nation of Islam. Baines teaches Malcolm that the drugs and alcohol he enjoys so much are simply ways for the white man to keep the black man in their place, and that the white man is, without exception, the devil. Malcolm leaves prison as Malcolm X, ditching the 'slave name' given to him by his ancestor's owners, and is transformed into an extremely enigmatic and convincing spokesman for the Nation of Islam.The rush of excitement and danger of the opening third soon gives way to a more serious tone, as Malcolm's radical views on segregation under the watchful eye of 'the honourable' Elijah Muhammad makes him an incredibly controversial figure; loved, hated and feared in equal measure. Malcolm's popularity soon causes rifts and jealousy within the ranks of the Nation, and he sees the man who once took him under his wing become a deadly nemesis. His wife Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) receives threatening phone calls, and the family's house is set ablaze. Lee's technical discipline throughout these moments, especially for a director who usually embraces visual flourishes, ensures that a steady, gloomy momentum builds up towards Malcolm's eye-opening pilgrimage to Mecca and eventual murder.A film of such emotional weight also calls for a great performance, and Denzel Washington delivers in spades. Even when Malcolm is at his most questionable, Washington imbues the character with the same charm, wit and magnetism that no doubt saw him sore through the ranks of the Nation and become loved by many. When the pace sags, and it frequently does, Washington manages to draw you back in with his effortless screen presence. The film manages to paint a well- rounded picture of a man who underwent a few radical changes in his life, thanks both to Lee's thoughtful approach and Washington's incredible performance. Lee does go slightly overboard with his worship of the man at the climax, as Ossie Davis reads a eulogy over a montage of children declaring \"I am Malcolm X!\" and a speech from Nelson Mandela, but this doesn't do too much damage to what is engrossing, detailed and fearless biopic of an inspirational man.",

I remember that tall, intense, lean man striding to the microphone and beginning with, \"Brothers, friends...enemies.\"  This film is a fine but flawed work which creates a confusing and often confused picture of a very complex man.  The Black Moslem movement is a significant political event in our nation's history. Lee's portrayal of Malcolm X, however, is much more Lee than Malcolm X. This film is long, repetitious and often tedious.  The coda is distracting, unnecessary and borders on the maudlin. However, Lee presents but misunderstands the turning point in the life of the late Malcolm X, i.e., the change from a political icon, mouthing the half-baked, jingoistic half-truths of Elijah Mohammud into a man who underwent a profound religious experience.  Many Black Moslems are an anathema to mainstream Moslems; this distinctive African-American movement is willing to lay all the ills of the African-American's treatment at the door of the \"whites.\"  This is not religion; it is politics and has little to do with the religious tenets of Islam.  The accusation of Elijah Mohammud that Christianity is a \"white man's religion\" and Judaism is practiced by Jews who \"exploit Black people,\" is pure nonsense.  The origins of Christianity, Islam and Judaism have common roots among the Semitic peoples, Arabs and Jews, and it should be remembered that it was Islamic Arabs who ran the Slave trade that sold many of the West African ancestors of African-Americans into bondage in the Americas.  In fact, the international slave trade feeding slaves into the productive leg of the old Trade Triangle was created by the Portuguese colonization of Africa.  But, facts rarely enter into consideration where idealogy is concerned. Islam is a religion where the \"law (sunni)\" is part and parcel of everyday living, as it is in Judaism, (i.e., no division of 'church' and 'state') bespeaks of its desert origins based on a system of tribal ownership of wells.  My point is, the Black Moslem movement was a political movement (and largely, still is) where the religious component has been greatly misrepresented.  The misconception and misrepresentation of Islam as a Jihadic or militant religion persists today in the anti-Arab attitude reflected daily in our public news media.  Unfortunately, Malcom X's diatribes during that his political period did precious little to remedy the situation.  Sadly, only after Malcolm X had made his hajj, did he come to realize that people are people and the real monster is the hatred people create for other people. Spike Lee is a fine film maker.  In spite of its flaws, this is a fine presentation of the life of one of the most interesting men of our past century.",

            "content": "Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X\" is an ambitious biographical movie about the life of the titular human rights activist, a controversial figure whose influence has been considerable. Regardless of your opinion of the man, his life makes for a fascinating subject as we trace his early years as a criminal, his time with the Nation of Islam and his acrimonious break from that group, culminating in his violent death.First of all, Denzel Washington was made for the title role. He not only looked the part; he effortlessly captured the essence of what made Malcolm X a powerful presence. His Oscar-nominated performance was undoubtedly awards-worthy. There were also standout performances in supporting roles from the likes of Angela Bassett, Delroy Lindo & Albert Hall, among others.In the director's chair, Spike Lee successfully brought his vision of an epic biography to the screen. The varied cinematography of Ernest Dickerson and the evocative score by Terence Blanchard (both frequent collaborators of Lee's) were important contributions in this vein. Frankly, it's a bit of a head-scratcher that a film with such impeccable production values only garnered one Oscar nomination in the technical categories (in this case, for costume design). Even Spike Lee was unaccountably snubbed.With a runtime of over three hours, the script provides us with a story that's engrossing enough to captivate our attention from beginning to end. Some of the political viewpoints espoused are questionable to say the least but, ultimately, a compelling case is made for Malcolm X as a positive influence on civil rights. If anything, the openness to showing multiple sides of the man makes the film all the more intriguing.Overall, I think that \"Malcolm X\" is a fascinating epic character study in the tradition of \"Lawrence of Arabia\". Awards recognition may have been minimal at the time of release but I think that the movie has definitely stood the test of time, as its 2010 induction into the National Film Registry attests.",

Dont wanna talk about its historical accuracy but as a movie it did well enough for me to think about the speeches Malcolm X gave and int shouldve erpret on it. Spike Le does a fantastic job in binding the film toghether however he shouldve teimmed it down to about 170-180 mins.\nDenzel was on total fire and carried the entire movie on his shoulders .Maybe should have gotten the oscar nod over Pacino for tatally making it believable that he was indeed malcolm X. A solid 8/10 from me",

Although this movie is horribly long and may need to be paused a few times for breaks, it truly deserves a full watch. The audience learns so much about every character as the movie goes on, it brings the audience into the movie. I became so intrigued with the movie, I lost all concept of time as I sat there staring at the tv. The cinematography was stunning and blew other movies of it's time, out of the waters. The acting was phenomenal and very realistic, again you felt like you were apart of the movie. I'd definitely sit down with some snacks and give this movie a watch, you won't even realize you have been sitting there for 3 and a half hours.",

            "review_title": "Intelligence as Self-Awareness, Self-Awareness as Self-Defense, Self-Defense as Violence ...",
            "content": "\"Do The Right Thing\" ended with two quotations from Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. According to King, no circumstances could justify the use of violence but Malcolm X qualified violence as 'intelligence' when in case of self-defense. Three years later, Spike Lee's biopic confirmed the bias he had toward the Muslim leader's opinion and through a masterstroke of writing, provided an insightful explanation on the 'violence/intelligence' controversial equation.Like Malcolm X, Spike Lee immediately inspires negative reactions, in his depiction of racial realities, but only truth hurts, and any form of thinking is subversive or is not. Rarely inclined to neutrality, Lee points his finger on the pervert aspect of American Society that tends to judge the hate before judging the hate that produces the hate. In other words, Lee provocatively invites you to think why the opening image of a burning American Flag, shocked you most than the sight of a KKK cross burning in front of a Black family house.Malcolm's family was destroyed by racism, from the roots. Malcolm's mother inherited a light skin from a white man who raped her mother and as a rejection to her 'shameful' genes; she married a Minister with darker complexion. Malcolm's father was killed by the KKK and then killed again, symbolically, when his widow couldn't benefit from his two life insurance policies because the death was considered a suicide. She ended in a mental hospital. These painful wounds in Malcolm's heart forged his determination and encouraged him less to hate than to challenge white men with their very weapons, except for education. Malcolm proved to have a brilliant inclination for studies, but was advised to look for a more manual work. Malcolm abandoned his dreams of accomplishment \u0085 through a regular job.The movie opens with an unexpected gangster feel where Malcolm, a youthful looking Denzel Washington, is a small time hoodlum in an elegant zoot suit, with his inseparable friend and occasional hairdresser, Shorty, played by Spike Lee, together, they drink, they dance and seduce white women. Shorty regularly applies a softening lotion on Malcolm's hair with an immediate burning effect. This running gag reinforces Malcolm's rejection of his condition as a black man and eagerness to imitate the enemy to outperform his. His reddish hair establishes some natural dispositions whose pinnacle is reached with the ultimate middle finger gesture to the system: the blonde. In a memorable scene, Malcolm asks his girl to kiss his feet. The macho power he exudes is so powerful she just can't say no, this is not a man degrading a woman, but a man raising himself to his personal vision of self-accomplishment.Malcolm still has the charisma of Spike Lee's street-wise characters; something needs to get him to the stature we know. The key is education. When Malcolm is arrested and spends seven years in jail, he's initiated by one of the 'Nation of Islam' followers. Malcolm embraces Islam and develop a passion for reading and knowledge, his glasses and shorter hair transfigures his rebirth as an intellectual figure. Beyond the tremendous performance of Denzel Washington, Lee's thought-provoking script portrays the vitality of education for the Black movement, an indirect way to point out that the segregation was maintained because white men kept black poor and ignorant. Violence was intelligence as self-defense because violence was awareness. \"We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, Plymouth Rock landed on us\" The Black were not American because they didn't choose their destiny, their condition is the consequences of undesired actions, therefore, Black must take the lead of their destiny again. The price of this self-awareness was indeed a true hate against the White.In a short but significant scene, a young white woman asked Malcolm if she could do anything to his cause. Malcolm dryly replies 'no', leaving her totally embarrassed, as she felt, she was one of the White devils. As a follower of 'the honorable' Elijah Muhammad, remarkably played by Al Freeman Jr., Malcolm X's aura is stuck in the narrow walls of an orthodox sect-like organization. He studies more than anyone; he marries Betty, Angela Bassett in a powerful supporting role, founds a family, and dedicates his life to his cause. He starts to outshine the Master, and his own allegiance deteriorates when he learns about Elijah's accusation of fornication with his secretaries. Elijah justifying the actions as a God's prophet blasphemes the most sacred Islamic principle and reveals the alienation governing the Nation of Islam. After many ideological disagreements, Malcolm X quits and founds his own association. He signed his own death warrant by acting alone, but this is the great men's existential mark, the ability to act in total integrity.Through a pivotal pilgrimage to Mecca, he discovered that many cultures, colors of skins, and civilizations embraced Islam, and the Black vs. White antagonism became meaningless. At this point, maybe, Malcolm X understood that the fight, as necessary as it was, was only meant to restore pride and dignity to the African American. But Malcolm X was so blinded by a skin based antagonism that he didn't want to admit the possibility that he could be respected more by a white than a black man, or that a black man could kill him. History judged Malcolm X more harshly than Martin Luther King who was more a sort of Gandhi-like figure, but even King's peaceful nature didn't spare his life.King was a humanist, X was lucid, as carrying the light. His assassination didn't make him a martyr, but a legend whose pride speaks to all the black conscience in the world. \"I am Malcolm X\" shouts school-kids at the end of the film while the tribute from Ossie Davis is heard, every African American carries the heritage of a man who didn't reject a country but injected a dignity, intelligence, a pride that transcended any form of religious beliefs.",

As is visible, this movie has touched me in many ways. Denzel Washington's performance of the ex-Muslim leader is amazing. The only thing more amazing is the fact that he lost out in the Oscar race to Pacino, who portrayed a less important figure, by far. Angela Bassett, a beautiful black actress, plays his wife, Betty Shabazz, in a magnificent role. Delroy Lindo, Albert Hall, Al Freeman Jr., Theresa Randle, and Spike Lee himself all play great roles in the movie. Spike Lee was right.

            "content": "This review comes from the perspective of a white male who was raised in a predominately white, rural, and conservative Midwestern town. The history we were taught of the civil rights era in America seemed to skim over a lot of the perspectives of black activists at the time and shed perhaps a little bit too much self-indulgence on the \"good\" white people who helped end Jim Crow. It is breathtaking to watch all of this unfold and to learn a lot of truths and a perspective on racism in general that I lacked beforehand. I can understand Malcolm's (Denzel Washington) frustration with the white supremacist society that he lived in (something that I believe we are still under, albeit to a somewhat lesser extent today than back then). A lot of his teachings were completely contradictory to the myths that I had heard about him growing up; I was taught to think of him as something akin to the inverse of a white Klansman. Which is a bit silly when you think about how black people had been (and still continue to be) oppressed for so long in this country and most of what Malcolm preached was for black people to embrace self-love and dignity. He did preach a few things earlier on in his life that were slanderous of an entire group of people, but he made strides to amend those statements and came to a more refined and enlightened point-of-view towards the end.I wish that the movie contained a little bit more on his post-Mecca life, where he embraced true Islam and shed a lot of the cult-like legitimate white-hating beliefs that the Nation of Islam spread. That portion of his life admittedly only took up less than a year of his life, but it would have been interesting to see his \"the Ballot or the Bullet\" speech and his lone interaction with Martin Luther King. The movie's a little bit long in the front end and brushes through to finish.Denzel Washington is great. This is an amazing eye-opening biopic from the 1990s that is still very relevant today as America still deals with a lot of the same issues.",

            "content": "\"Malcolm X\" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the life story of Malcolm X. He was a legendary African American leader. He was born as Malcolm Little but he changed it to Malcolm X. When his father was killed by the Ku Klux Klan something changed him, he became a gangster and he spent some time in jail where he discovered Islam from the writings of Elijah Muhammad. He became a member of the Nation of Islam and he also visited Mecca.I liked this movie very much because it is based on the life of a very controversial person who also influenced a lot of people. The direction which was made by Spike Lee was simply outstanding and I enjoyed very much the way it was presented all the life events of Malcolm X, from his early life as a young boy to the time he became a member of the Nation of Islam. Regarding the interpretations, I have to admit that I had high expectations from Denzel Washington who played as Malcolm X and for one more time I wasn't disappointed at all because he was simply amazing on this role. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Angela Bassett's who played as Dr. Betty Shabazz, Albert Hall's who played as Baines and Delroy Lindo's who played as West Indian Archie.To sum up, I have to say that \"Malcolm X\" is a very good movie with a great plot based on the life events of Malcolm X, some great interpretations made by its cast especially Denzel Washington's and a story that will be in your mind for a lot of time. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that every person no matter the religion he/she believes in, he/she has something to gain by watching it. This movie will make you think a lot of things except religion and the story of Malcolm X, it will make you think about your life, your choices and also your legacy.",

One of the african american nation's biggest leaders deserves a well made movie and Spike Lee offers one. Denzel Washington proves again that he is among the best actors ever, I think I already said it before. The imagination between him and Malcolm X is crazy cause they look exactly like each other. Even Spike Lee appears for quite a while on screen. From how I see it, in my point of view. The movie is divided in to two parts: the first part of the film is the life of Malcolm before he turned to Islam and became a public figure and the second part of the film is when he already is a public figure till his death. I mostly love the second part of the film when you see Malcolm at the rise of power and how he has become one of the more famous public figures. How he gets in to arguments with the nation of Islam and his ultimate downfall. The cinematography was brilliant with a lot of great colors and dark light. I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would and learned more about the famous human rights activist than what I knew already. Even though his way and many of his acts were extreme, much of what he did was the opposite of other national leaders. I still find his character to be interesting and clever. Much thanks to the performance.",

            "content": "Spike Lee's masterpiece. An incredibly powerful film about an electric, complex man, beautifully told. Lee's filmmaking is fantastic, with wonderful period details, beautiful cinematography, and honest storytelling about an intelligent man who was flawed, but went through an incredible arc over his life. The film is true to 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' and every bit as intriguing. Denzel Washington turns in an extraordinary performance, truly evoking the man in all aspects - physically, his fiery oration, the depth of his thought, his integrity, and in stating his controversial views. The rest of the cast, including Angela Bassett as Betty Shabazz, is excellent too, and there were no false notes to me. Every single moment in this film, every frame, seems important, and the 201 minutes flew by.As for Malcolm X's views, I don't agree with all of them, and some are simply wrong (e.g. his misogynistic belief that women should be dominated), but he was so dead on in the gist of what he was fighting for, one of the earliest to yell WAKE UP to both black and white America, that he's an important figure, unfairly marginalized. He spoke about the whitewashing of history, 400 years of violent, brutal oppression, religion as a means of pacification, economic suppression, and yes, the evils committed by the white race all over the world. He spoke eloquently, truthfully, and with great courage. I was shocked by the callousness of his \"chickens coming home to roost\" comment after JFK's assassination when I first heard it, but if you look at his explanation, referencing America's (then) recent assassination of Patrice Lumumba and attempted assassinations of Fidel Castro, its history of violence to others, as well as its domestic terrorism, things that American history books have always downplayed (hence fueling the affront at what he was telling us), you can't help but see truth there.The fact is, Malcolm X was ahead of his time and spoke brutal, painful truths, those that white America in the 1950's did not want to confront or acknowledge, and which the country is still struggling with today. Spike Lee was also ahead of his time in making the film in 1992, and it's mind-boggling that he wasn't even nominated for best director, no doubt clouded by the haze of racism in this country, and how incendiary Malcolm X's views were to the status quo. Cleary, Lee and Washington should both have won Oscars. It's a legendary pairing of actor and director, an epic biography, and a very important film to this day.Some quotes from Malcom X, over the phases of his life; it would have been fascinating to see where his path would have led him had he not been tragically cut down at 39:\"Any person who claims to have deep feeling for other human beings should think a long, long time before he votes to have other men kept behind bars - caged. I am not saying there shouldn't be prisons, but there shouldn't be bars. Behind bars, a man never reforms. He will never forget. He will never get completely over the memory of the bars.\"\"For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, 'Do you hate me?' The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone else of hate!\"\"I read, I saw, how the white man never had gone among the non-white peoples bearing the Cross in the true manner and spirit of Christ's teachings - meek, humble and Christ-like.\"\"Well, I believe it's a crime for anyone who is being brutalized to continue to accept that brutality without doing something to defend himself. If that's how 'Christian' philosophy is interpreted, if that's what Gandhian philosophy teaches, well, then, I will call them criminal philosophies. ... If it must take violence to get the black man his human rights in this country, I'm for violence, exactly as you know the Irish, the Poles, or Jews would be if they were flagrantly discriminated against.\"\"In the past, yes, I have made sweeping indictments of all white people. I never will be guilty of that again - as I know now that some white people are truly sincere, that some truly are capable of being brotherly toward a black man. The true Islam has shown me that a blanket indictment of all white people is as wrong as when whites make blanket indictments against blacks.\"",

From the get go we cross to the police beating of Rodney King where the American flag is burnt into the shape of the letter X. It jumps to World War II era where we see a younger Malcolm X living as a hustler and see flashbacks of his parents where his father was murdered by the Klu Klux Klan. His hustling days turn into crime and imprisonment. In jail we see a transformation as he is introduced to Islam through the teachings of Elijah Muhammad. Rejecting his slave name, he adopts the name Malcolm X and once released from prison works with Elijah Muhammad and is a spokesman for the Nation of Islam. From here we see his marriage, his public speeches, the dissection within the Nation of Islam and his further transformation - renouncing his separatist beliefs and embarks on a pilgrimage to Mecca. During a speech in 1965 Malcolm X is assassinated.Now this is how you make a biopic, Lee's passion of this character definitely can be seen with over 3 hours long you can tell the director Lee gave it his all, it is literally his masterpiece with covering the relevant dressing, music compilation and the feel of what Harlem was during three different eras. The movie is controversial, bold and information - I didn't know the full details of Malcolm X but watching this movie with so much detail was enriching both at an entertainment point of view and at a spiritually sense where you see the transformation of one man's life from a street hustler to a separatist and finally overcoming his own prejudices and becoming a lifetime important leader, not just in the Afro-American groups but for everyone especially Muslims.Lee brings all manner of styles and tones in the chapters of Malcolm X from his troubled youth as Little and his other alias Detroit Red, his conversion to Islam and his transformation as Malcolm X, his ministry and his pilgrimage to Mecca. And Denzel delivers in all different stages of the life of Malcolm X. Lee's masterpiece is due to Denzel at the helm playing a complex individual at ease and convincing where at times I actually thought Malcolm X was Denzel Washington and the fact he lost the Oscar is shocking and amazes me the movie did not receive any other recognition. Through his performance you can see the internal struggle, the spiritual changes in one man's life, his inner fire, intellect, insecurity, pride and how one man doesn't let fate deal all of the cards but rather how each of us have the power to change our own lives - that is Malcolm X. Very inspirational and educational, a timeless movie for all time - overall 9/10.",

Unfortunately, Lee's ego gets in the way a couple of times... not enough to ruin the movie... but he does get the eyeballs to roll a couple of times. First off (let me get the bad stuff outta the way first), when is he gonna outgrow that infantile \"A Spike Lee Joint\" crap? It was cute for some of his wacky indie comedies... but not a \"real\" movie... come on now! Second, why does the movie have to start with Spike walking down the street pretending to be cool in his zoot suit? Is this \"The Spike Lee Story\"? Nope, it's \"Malcolm X\"... so cut out those first 2 minutes please and start the movie out in the barber shop! Third, that dance number at the start is kinda cool (even if it is totally unnecessary) but, for the love of Lean, does it have to end with Spike sliding down the floor towards the camera, beaming out at the audience like this is some cheesy music video? Okay... time to let it go... all the bad stuff is over with in the first twenty minutes... everything that follows is pretty dang cool (which just makes those three lapses in judgment all the more annoying). Denzel gives a great performance as Malcolm... definitely the only actor who could have done the role justice. The script is great... telling the whole story... from Malcolm's less auspicious beginnings... to the revelations he discovers in prison... to his eventual role as one of the most eloquent and powerful speakers that the world has ever known. You don't even have to agree with everything the man says to realize that the man had a gift... and a voice that the world will know forever.

This should have been a story of inclusiveness, concluding with a certain joy instead of this childish \"I am Malcolm X\" black hero c***. Malcolm is a hero for everyone, and should be praised by everyone for his angelic ability to accept and forgive the world that so often wronged him. Why do you think Elijah Muhammed had him killed? Because he didn't feed on hate anymore, and wanted others to feel the same way. That would have destroyed the Black Muslim message, the most blameful of heresies.

It's a movie that has just the right amount of nuance while still staying true to the man's ideologies and even his flaws. While on the one hand it brilliantly demonstrates Malcolm's evolving perspectives of the world he tries to change, it also shows how the commitment to one form of thinking that isolates anything foreign and discourages any bit of doubt could and would lead to the petty downfalls of ignorance.Malcolm X as a movie is all parts brilliance. The way in which the movie was written and how the life of Malcolm Little unfolds on screen is done so masterfully that the 202-minute runtime of the movie is barely noticeable. From the production design, to the makeups, to the costumes and even the color tones that contribute towards the building of this particular universe... it's every bit of detail crafted to perfection and should be commended greatly for that. What holds this movie up the most is certainly lead actor Denzel Washington himself, as I don't think there could have been a better actor to portray the revolutionary leader with as much power and nuance as was. The transformation from a more comically expressive Malcolm Little at the start of the movie to a leader who has realized the seriousness of his role in the world and has a much deeper understanding of the issues he finds himself trying to solve by the end of the movie... that's Denzel at his best.The true star of the movie though, is director Spike Lee; whose vision and style combined does great justice to Malcolm X's life and legacy. The movie screams Spike Lee throughout and yet in no way does that discount the scale and seriousness of the movie. It's a work of art that's every bit a tribute to Malcolm's legacy as well as every bit a testament to Spike Lee's prowess as a filmmaker and storyteller.Malcolm X is a movie I found to be truly inspiring about a leader I have the greatest respect for.

This is an actor who manages to embody the character, nearly disappearing into the role and making it come alive. Washington's skills at the pulpit highlight the ferocity of this character who inspires rebellion among his congregation. This is a resplendent film, well-mounted and carried out with conviction.

            "content": "I have been working on a book for some time now titled \"The Deification of the American Niggah: Whole Lotta Lies Don' Make No Truth\". The thesis is of the book is that the severe bigotry and injustice experienced by Negroes in America has been replaced by an equally inaccurate and unjust expectation of perfection. There is an attempt to correct the errors of slavery, prejudice and brutal discrimination by recreating reality in an equally tragically inaccurate set of expectations. Blacks have been miraculously transformed from ignorant, vile, sub-humans to noble, perfect, superior beings that have been unjustly suppressed for reasons of racist ambitions, greed, envy, etc. Neither of these depictions is accurate and both misconceptions degrade the social and economic ascendance that is the answer to the issues of black society.This film and its writers, producers, directors, critics, etc. are an example of the extremes to which myth has attempted to transplant error. The protagonist is depicted as a humble, gifted, noble and superior hero who conquered white oppression through \"self-enlightenment\". In reality, Malcolm Little was a felon, a convict and a miscreant who sought advancement through narcotics, prostitution and illegal gambling. His \"enlightenment\" through the spiritual experience of the Nation of Islam (Black Muslims) was depicted in his statement about President Kennedy's assassination \"\u0085the chickens would come home to roost\u0085.\" Malcolm's association with the Black Muslims ended in his own brutal assassination by other peaceful, enlightened members of the Nation of Islam.But Spike Lee directed this movie as a tribute to a hero who transcended racism though enlightenment and moral superiority. This is a terrible film not only because of its betrayal of reality but because it perpetuates the myths that are as evil as the bigotry and persecution that it assaults. There are no mythical heroes just as there are no sub-humans among the black races. Miraculous transformation of history does no more to elevate society than prejudice does. Greater lies cannot correct other lies.Richard Pryor made the best statement on reality I have ever heard. Its majesty lies in its simplicity and accuracy. On a trip to Africa he attended a large community celebration of ethnic music, dancing, revelry, etc. As he sat among the hundreds of revelers he thought to himself, \"Now look around you. Do you see any Niggahs here?\" He answered to himself, \"No, there aren't any. There never were any. Just people. That's all there ever were.\" In the same way, if the filmmakers as well as the multitudes of activists who advocate societal betterment would just see that all they have to deal with are people, the issues could begin to be resolved. Fantasies like this movie only prolong the hatred and incomprehension.",

I'll be the first to say that I'm not a fan of Spike Lee's earlier works but this one was splendid. I think he and Denzel Washington did an honorable job paying tribute to Malcolm X. It was important to see his transitions from early hoodlum, to prisoner, to Elijah acolyte, to independent man. He was a living example of what liberating one's mind can do for an individual.As a production, this was fantastic. There were a couple of Spike Lee-isms that could have been removed (e.g. himself as an actor and the invasive soundtrack at times) but overall I was pleased.

Washington does almost perfectly in every stage of Malcolm's life, particularly in the last stages of the film, where one can truly feel the struggles and evolution of this once poverty-stricken and also once at anotehr time violent man, becoming very senseful. The supporting cast is very good, especially Albert Hall and Spike Lee. Although very long, the film was done very well, and had very few flaws.

            "content": "The Civil Rights movement was such a broad area in history, and with the countless number of events that took place, such as the Montgomery bus boycott, the Freedom Rides, and the sit ins, it's a wonder why we haven't been bombarded with films focusing on those events. I have no doubt that one movie could possibly focus on everything that happened in the Civil Rights era, but I doubt it could do a very good job. Spike Lee has chosen one of the most unsung leaders of the movement, and has constructed, from the ground up, a film over three hours in length on him showing his humble beginnings, his rise to power, his self-assessment, and his tragic death.The leader is Malcolm X. But before he was an historical figure, he was Malcolm Little, a small-time thief who would concoct schemes to steal money with his best friend, Shorty. He was a smart boy, with a preacher for a father and a white woman for a mother. Despite being very smart, he was ostracized by white teachers who said that his dreams of becoming a lawyer wouldn't happen and that he should stick to \"working with his hands.\" Little's adolescence consisted of running around with white girls and devising burglaries with them and Shorty. This streak didn't last long, with Little and Shorty being arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison. Without a doubt, prison benefited Little in unlikely ways. He was taught the ways of Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam, and got help for his addiction to cocaine by a fellow inmate.Muhammad's teachings eventually inspired Malcolm to become a motivational speaker, before becoming one of the many voices in the Civil Rights movement. He adopts the name \"Malcolm X,\" he claims, because \"X\" in mathematics represents \"the unknown.\" For a while, X preached the direct opposite from Martin Luther King Jr. King believed in integration, that would hopefully result from a nonviolent practice. X thought integrating with \"the enemy\" was not intelligent, and questioned why would we want to integrate with a group that has subtracted our rights, raped our women, and has dehumanized us? For a while, the only thing X said he liked integrated was \"his coffee.\" I tried to put myself in the shoes of a middle aged African American, living in the south, in the 1960's, and contemplated who I, myself, would've sided with. King would probably have been the initial person I would've sided with, but after many months that proved little to no success, I would've likely started to follow X and his teachings of self defense and segregation.The entire film is marvelous in every sense of the word. Spike Lee has proved himself to be one of America's greatest directors with one stellar drama after another, focusing mainly on racial tensions. Here, he brilliantly documents an underrated leader whose philosophy may have been sketchy, but wrote speeches that were undeniably powerful.X is portrayed by Denzel Washington, who utters every line with sophistication and always occupies a convincing state. The whole tone of the film can be summed up in one scene that comes rather late in the film. It shows Malcolm X walking up the stairs to Columbia University, where he is stopped by a white woman asking what she could do to further his movement. He coldly replies \"nothing\" before marching on his way. The camera is left focusing on the frozen, heartbroken woman. The great thing about a scene like this is that it wasn't motivated by a comic relief. Lee adds hints of comedy throughout the film, but not many seeing as this is a touchy subject. He feels he should attack it with brutal honesty rather than turn the whole movement into a laugh riot. Other performances, like Angela Bassett as Malcolm's wife, and Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Muhammad, provide the film with some of its strongest material as well.I believe the reason the character of Malcolm X was so interesting is because he is capable of delivering self assessment and self criticism. Not many leaders are still developing their beliefs, but are rather wholly confident in what they preach. X finally realized he had flaws as a human, and went through a change of heart upon traveling to Mecca, an event that is captured beautifully in the film, and came back a whole different person. Instead of attacking Civil Rights leaders, mainly Martin Luther King Jr., and making them feel inferior, he agrees to work with them to pursue the dream of equality in the world.Malcolm X is one of the most surreal and extensive biopics I have yet to see. Its script is extremely powerful, and refuses to become dry and noneventful. Lee's direction is pitch perfect, and the tone either feels coldly realistic or unsettling even in when it reaches its brightest instances. Just like the man himself, Lee's film has proved to go under the radar, not boasting a great deal on the surface. But when put into an intricate focus and dissected delicately, it is one of the best films that deals with racial tensions, next to De Niro's A Bronx Tale, and one of the smartest films of the nineties decade.Starring: Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, and Al Freeman Jr. Directed by: Spike Lee.",

What one learns about this man from watching this film is NOT what many perceive, which is why this film is excellent in it's telling.\nThe story, adapted from Alex Haley's book is a realistic and biting view. It shows a man -- a very strong but conflicted man and his changes, but a man none the less who believed in what he believed in to the dismay of many in a time, not to long ago in America, where the voices and ideas of minorities were stiffled.The very important element of this film of course of the casting of Denzel Washington as Malcolm X. This is one of those rare instances where you forget about \"nice Denzel, the actor\" and he becomes that lead character. His Academy Award Nomination for this character was very well placed.Another rare and haunting roll was that of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad played by Al Freeman Jr. on the same Academy Award calibre as Denzel's performance. Spike Lee's direction (what a wonderful \"eye\" he has!), Ernest Dickerson's Cinematography, Production Design by Wynn Thomas, the Casting of Robbi Reed-Hume (who won the casting society's award for casting of Malcolm X and rightfully so!) and the acknowledgement of any and everyone to get this film COMPLETED is also what makes this an excellent achievement.Whatever YOU think of Malcolm X is your right. But this film does not make ANY opinions, it just goes through and presents. It's not a pretty life, there are racially charged as well as religiously charged points in this film and as I've written before, it will surprise those who think they knew what Malcolm X was \"all about\" and \"who\" killed him. It will be HARD to do films like Malcolm X in this day and time, being his \"being\" was controversial, but I am glad this one was accomplished by the team that did it.Beautifully made, painstakenly made, top notch performances by all actors and actresses, great production teams, great direction teams, excellent adaptation, excellent music...an excellent film.",

Having said that, I really felt that this movie provided an insight into the life and growth of a truly fascinating man, who was brought to life superbly by Denzel Washington. I have always enjoyed Denzel Washington's work, and think he's one of the finest actors in Hollywood today. This is perhaps the best performance I've seen from him in a lengthy list of great performances. It seemed to me as I watched that Washington was having an almost out of (his own) body experience, truly becoming Malcolm X, as Malcolm's life was traced from his childhood, as the son of a black preacher who was killed by the KKK, to life as a young man as a hoodlum, to time in prison where he converted to Islam, through to his ultra-black nationalist stage and finally to a more moderate point, in which he was willing to work with others (even whites) - which earned him the hatred of the radical Nation of Islam, and eventually led to his death.The supporting performances here were fine, but you won't really remember them. This is Denzel Washington's movie. There are a few scenes that perhaps go on a little bit too long, but there's not really very much to criticize here. 8/10",

As a person who studies American history, I was very interested in Malcolm X and how his personality is the exact opposite of another famed civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr.Spike Lee's film is obviously about the life of Malcolm X. This movie goes through the major changes of his life. This goes through his days as a guy on drugs and deals with gangs and ends up in jail to a guy who found his calling by joining a Muslim group led by Elijah Muhammad to a guy who found his true spiritual nature on his pilgrimage to Mecca.Denzel Washington is definitely the right man for the role. I don't think anyone else could have done this role. In fact, Denzel and Malcolm X look very similar to each other.Overall, this is a powerful, emotion-filled film with a strong message to it.

This movie goes deeply into the life of Malcolm X, and analyses the decisions he made in life that led him to be one of the most important figures in the American Civil Rights Movement. This movie does not shy away from discussing such important events as Malcolm's \"Chickens Coming Home to Roost\" speech regarding JFK's assassination, which resulted in him being silenced by Black Muslim leader Elijah Mohammed. Malcolm's pilgrimage to Mecca, his conversion to mainstream Islam, and his gradual realization that not all white men are evil, and that even Christianity need not be rejected as a spiritual guide for black people, was shown so subtly and gradually that the audience can accept such a transformation as credible. The audience sees Malcolm X's evolution as a human being and they are convinced that, while he was a genuine and powerful leader within the Black Muslim religion and a heartfelt spokesman for their cause, he was also a consistently evolving person, filled with self-doubt and prone to making mistakes. Spike Lee has done in excellent job in presenting the full story of the life of Malcolm X, while also humanizing him and even going so far as to counter the criticisms that Malcolm was a spokesman for \"violence\" and racial hatred, as opposed to Martin Luther King, Jr's message or racial equality and peaceful civil disobedience. The movie shows that Malcolm's sermons and viewpoints were much more complex than simply advocating racial separation. Spike Lee analyses Malcolm's views with such details that the viewer will at least empathize with Malcolm and understand his speeches and why he felt the way he felt.I highly recommend this movie for people interested in American history, or those who are simply fans of biopics.

A director's primary goal should be telling a good story. However, the very long running time isn't the only problem with \"Malcolm X\". The first half (the weaker half) is filled with distracting costumes, camera movement, dance numbers and endless cameos. For a while I thought this movie was going to have more cameos than \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\". Another problem is Spike Lee's misuse of music. It pops up at the wrong times and takes you out of the drama of the scene. On the plus side, the acting is very good. When this movie was released film critics Gene Siskel & Roger Ebert said that movie was made for all audiences. That not true. \"Malcolm X\" was made for a very specific, very small audience.

Is this down to Spike Lee's direction? or is it a result of what Denzel brings to a period drama? This film is Spike's only period drama. He tends to make social commentaries on contemporary society, but this installment was an exception. Denzel Washington has a natural home in period dramas ('A Soldier's Story', 'Cry Freedom', 'Glory'), and it was this project that enabled him to shine as a historical figure. If anyone else had played the role, then I don't think they would have captured Malcolm X in the same way. Therefore, I would say that this is a Denzel Washington film as opposed to a Spike Lee film because Denzel excels in period dramas whereas Spike is a social commentator on contemporary urban society.",

Malcolm X was a complicated personality -- an ex-con who became an effective religious proselytizer for the Nation of Islam, who eventually turned against its leader, Elijah Muhummad, and who dropped the anti-white rhetoric toward the end of his life, just prior to his murder, presumably by agents of the Nation of Islam. Washington captures Malcolm X's complexities and makes his transitional moments -- from jailbird to religious convert to eloquent spokesman to rebel to spokesman for a different vision of Islam -- seem very real indeed. Angela Bassett is a shining presence as Malcolm's wife, Betty Shabazz. The tense period leading up to Malcolm's assassination is rendered with great skill. The movie might have been considered too controversial for the Motion Picture Academy. Otherwise, it would surely have won Denzel Washington an Oscar.",

            "content": "The first hour of Malcolm X is absolutely electric, one of the few times where Spike Lee has come close to matching the energy of his masterpiece \"Do the Right Thing\". Essentially a gangster flick, complete with vibrant colours and a perfect soundtrack. Interspersed are constant reminders of the reality Malcolm lives in but tries to ignore; we cut from a freeze-frame of him sauntering down the street to a flashback of a Klan raid on his childhood home. We see his house being burned down and his father being murdered. The editing is impeccable throughout, as is the pacing - it may be a platitude to say at this point, but it is true of this film that it didn't \"feel\" 200 minutes long. Nary a moment that doesn't hold complete attention, even when it slips into a more standard biopic for two hours. Several montages are breathtaking: the sequence of Malcolm's speech over newsreels of police brutality, then his face as he watches MLK denounce violence; or scenes depicting his pilgrimage to Mecca in documentary-style black-and-white, intercut with Elijah Muhammad's demise. The success of the movie primarily comes down to the strength of Denzel Washington's performance and of Spike Lee's direction. The former is consistently stunning, and an obvious example of Oscar-robbery, and the latter is on top form, using every opportunity available to showcase his visual prowess. The gliding overhead shots, the Altman-esque sequence where the camera moves 360-degrees, picking up fragments of different NOI speakers until returning to Malcolm; the tracking shot of Lee chasing Washington, then him laying face-down in front of the screen, pretending to be shot dead in an ominous moment of foreshadowing - it's all pretty brilliant. VO narration often feels perfunctory, and in its admirable breadth the film occasionally feels impersonal w.r.t. To its titular protagonist, but who cares when it builds to a climax this amazing; the heartrending cutting between Malcolm's burning house and that of his father's from earlier signals the end is nigh, as does the beautiful sequence of Malcolm's family arriving at the venue of his murder, set to Sam Cooke's \"A Change is Gonna Come.\" The lengthy runtime helps us feel his tiredness, and by then we can sympathise with him standing still with the world moving forward regardless, and understand the acceptance in his eyes before his death. The last ten minutes are take-it-or-leave-it, a little out of place in this viewer's eyes but not overwhelmingly so - Lee's films are always about pushing a message for the current times, as shown straight away here with the opening image of a burning US flag, next to contemporaneous footage of the Rodney King beating. He has certainly made the link between film narrative and present-day moral takeaway through more clumsy and didactic means in his career, so the eulogy and Mandela tribute here hardly bothered me. A rousing, multifaceted portrayal of a significant historical figure, presented in epic fashion with a wonderful lead performance and wonderful directing, never once succumbing to the weight of its three-and-a-half hour running length.",

He doesn't just play X, he becomes X. It's scary how much he looks and sounds like the real Malcolm X.This is one of the best films of the 90's and a peak for both Lee and Washington.

            "content": "Disappointingly I felt, the majority of this film is devoted to the time of his life when Malcolm X was self-admittedly in error. In later years he was an inspirational man, but I spent most of the film hating him and the aggressive ideals he adopted for so long before his eventual renunciation. Unfortunately it seemed Lee was more interested in his dubious activities, instead of giving equal weight to BOTH sides of such a complex character.I understand that 'length' would have been a concern in evaluating this, but here is where I think Lee and his editor could have been more judicious in selecting crucial points of emphasis. They were certainly different men in a lot of ways, but in \"Ali\" I think Michael Mann did a much better job of capturing the overall essence of a person by zeroing in on pivotal moments and excising as much of what could be thought 'supplementary material' as possible. I still gave grudging respect to the composition even at times when I was dissatisfied with the path taken, though, because undeniably the scenes are exceptionally well-realised and blended together, throughout.If Spike had tried to balance it out and given more of the running time to Malcolm's conciliatory efforts then I would most likely be saying it was a masterpiece and calling it an honest and just portrait. When such a large amount of coverage is devoted to an 'unsavoury' element, it makes it seem almost as if 'extremism' is what we should most remember the man for. It isn't. I bitterly regret that what we were handed does not represent the 'even spread' that it should have.",

The fact that Malcolm X did that, and also did it in extraordinarily long fashion meant it was simply not going to be a film that I was going to love. The story is told well, and Denzel Washington is extraordinary in the role (how did he not win an Oscar for this performance?) However, I simply don't latch onto a film that goes into this kind of minutiae and takes three and a half hours to do it. That being said, I do think Malcolm X is an effective motion picture. It educated me on the history of Malcolm X, which I was never properly taught in school. I had a false impression of him, and appreciated that Spike Lee did his best to reveal the heart of this man that isn't celebrated as much as other figures in the Civil Rights movement. By the end, while I was definitely ready for the film to reach a conclusion, I was still heartbroken by what happened to him. I don't dare to guess how accurate Malcolm X might be to actual historical events, but it certainly felt like a faithful retelling of history. I appreciate the fact that Malcolm X impacted me and gave me a better understanding of the titular character, but it's not a movie I will ever want to watch again.",

            "content": "Before MLK, Before O, there was - X.MALCOLM X. A black man fighting for the black man in a white man's world.Denzel Washington is Malcolm Little (whom everyone calls \"Red\" for his conked red hair), a petty thief, cocaine addict, prostitute peddler, and all-round small-time gangsta before the term was invented. During the War Years, Malcolm falls in with West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo), plying his trade in Boston and New York, eventually being busted with his long-time friend and accomplice, Shorty (Spike Lee) and sent to jail.In jail, about the time that Jackie Robinson made the major leagues in baseball, Malcolm Little becomes Malcolm X, to shuck off his \"slave name.\" So begins the rise to power of one of America's great black leaders. But it is in jail that the movie MALCOLM X falters, as Malcolm's criminal outlook on life flip-flops to that of Islam, schooled by a pushy, annoying, racist fellow convict, Baines (Albert Hall). Malcolm leaves prison as one of Islam's greatest exponents, an articulate, intelligent, outspoken community leader, preaching fire and damnation against the White Man, causing so much civil discomfort (even whilst awakening the self-respect of the black community) that it leads to his assassination by the Nation of Islam.Proving my point about religious hypocrisy.As I write this in 2009, there are \"two\" Americas - pre-Obama and post-Obama. Films like MALCOLM X created righteous outrage - but in a post-Obama world that outrage is obviously diluted. The Dream has been realized - where else is there to go for the Black Man? Yes, there will be racism - always. The human animal is built that way. But what more can be done or said than achieving the highest post in the world? The point of films like X was to create righteous outrage so people would aspire to the goal of equality. To that point, X served its purpose bodaciously - in a pre-Obama world. In a post-Obama world, well, the struggle may not be over completely, but the \"outrage\" part surely must be. X opens with a burning American flag - power to the peeps an' all dat - but if you burn a flag NOW, isn't that just disrespect to the Black Man? Who happens to also be THE Man? Spike Lee directs MALCOLM X from The Autobiography of Malcolm X, as told to Alex Haley. Though it is not Lee's fault, Malcolm's messages were garbled in religious hypocrisy and overt racism, and the messenger himself precluded this movie becoming an epic due to his small-mindedness; due to not being King: He called the Kennedy assassination \"justice... the chickens coming home to roost,\" saying it didn't make him sad, but glad. He called for \"complete separation between the black race and the white race\" and subscribed to juvenile mythologies like the Tribe of Shabazz, an ancient race of black kings and queens from whom the Caucasian race descended. (Nowhere nearly as sensible as the Tribe of David where an olive-skinned virgin gave birth to Jesus the Magic Caucasian and started a white race of Christians even though he was a Jew...) Malcolm preaches, \"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us the white man is the devil.\" He doesn't say \"some white men\" - he says ALL white men are devils. These are the lessons he learns from that idiot Baines in jail. (I call him an idiot because religious fanaticism is a form of idiocy.) You could play a drinking game to this movie, on every time Malcolm X says, \"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad\" and by the end of the movie, you'll be drunk enough to convert to the Nation of Islam.The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, though treated like a deity, was a flesh-and-blood guy, supposedly the apex of spirituality, his exact words: \"I have built this nation under the divine guidance of Allah\" - but the old Honorable Elijah Muhammad turns out not so honorable when news is leaked of two teenage girls who have sired children through his heavenly sperm. Malcolm meets with the girls, learns the pornographic truth, and is so disappointed in the Honorable Elijah Muhammad that he splits with the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. (Jesus in Purgatory! Now he's got ME doing it!) Malcolm X was a fiery political leader - Denzel's sexuality and charisma are tuned to breaking point on the podium, a perfect role for a perfect black panther - but it's unfortunate he had to resort to the crutch of religion to unite people. After he splits with the Honorabl--yeh, that guy, he has to maintain that his words are now not the Honora-- geez, there's no escaping this guy-- and that his words are his own. Why couldn't he do that from the start? Was Malcolm that weak-minded he needed to lean on the platitudes of a philandering old goat to unite people under a false aegis? Spike Lee's movie-making is stupendous, Denzel's performance, electric. Malcolm X was charisma and brimstone and an inspiration for the black movement. But his message of Islam was plain stupid. I don't take away from the man - he is greater than I will ever be - but the delusion of religion obfuscated his underlying messages and this movie is shot through the prism of Malcolm's religious journey, which weakens the movie.Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in Manhattan's Audubon Ballroom the same faction who called him a religious hypocrite for splitting from them, The Nation of Islam \"under the divine guidance of Allah.\" Need I say more about religious hypocrisy, the godlike manner in which they silenced him, or the Honorable Elijah Muhammad? A messianic eulogy ends this powerful film. But it's too late. I'm already drunk.--Poffy The Cucumber",

Lee had never made anything even close to this good before it, and will likely never make anything this good in the future. His low-budget films are usually watchable, but ultimately too self-indulgent to really hit the mark completely. Malcolm X however is nothing short of great film-making. Denzel Washington couldn't have done it any better as allows the slain civil rights activist to in essence rise from the dead and acquaint himself with a whole new generation.The film clocks in at an amazing 202 minutes. That's three hours and twenty-two minutes for those who might not be used to seeing films longer than an hour and a half. Despite the film's length, it is so well made that none of it really causes the viewer to daydream. Maybe we didn't need to see so much of Malcolm's life prior to his conversion to Islam, but I did not regret seeing so much of it. We see almost everything illegal from his past: drugs, robbery, racketeering, you name it. Malcolm was into some serious stuff in his youth. The film hits it's stride once he's sent to prison and meets up with one of the higher-ups from the Nation of Islam. We see Malcolm take to his new religion like a fish to water, and once he gets out of jail, he's preaching the gospel of the honorable Elijah Muhammad to anyone who'll listen.Over time, we see Malcolm rise to great prominence within the Nation, until he eventually runs afoul of the leadership and has to start his own ministry. Once this happens, Malcolm is a marked man, and his violent demise is just a matter of time. Malcolm only lived to age 39, and Spike Lee shows us just about everything of note within his lifespan.The film has numerous strengths. It is incredibly well directed, acted, written, and photographed. The supporting cast all hit the right notes with their roles. Delroy Lindo plays Malcolm's old number running boss. Albert Hall is cold and stoic as the man who introduces Malcolm to Islam, then later turns against him. Angela Basset is typically outstanding as Malcolm's wife Betty. Has this woman ever given a bad performance in anything? Al Freman Jr. is also quite memorable as Elijah Muhammad. When all is said and done, he is the character we the audience wish to know more about. Spike Lee is also there as you might expect in the early scenes as Malcolm's hustler friend Shorty.This film belongs to Washington, though. Many who remembered the real Malcolm X claim his performance is right on in physical and spoken terms. Washington was nominated, but lost out to Al Pacino (Scent of a Woman) for the Best Actor nod. Was this justified? Hard to say. Al can be tough to beat.The film was a decent enough success at the box office to the point where you would have thought Lee would try bigger films like this more often. He hasn't produced anything nearly as good since, but he's his own man and he's presumably making the kinds of films he wants to.By all means necessary, Malcolm X is worth 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

            "content": "I had the privilege to finally have the chance to view Spike Lee's film on the controversial black Nationalist Leader Malcolm X. The film is near a 3 1/2 hour biopic of the man named Malcom X who in 1960 opposed Martin Luther King Jr as one of the most important civil rights leader. With the controversial director Spike Lee behind the camera and Denzel Washington giving it his all on the screen, Malcolm X has stood the test of time since its release in 1992 and was a privilege to watch for me.As stated above, the film is a biopic of Malcolm X. The story starts with his early 20's. He is a junkie, a thief, and a criminal in all aspects of life. The film has many flashbacks to give us an idea of his childhood and what he has endured thus far and why he is where he is. Soon he is sent to jail where he maintains his hostility towards life and all other people. But a transformation is on its way, one that will put him into the public spotlight and become one of the most influential members of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's.Now I usually don't watch many Spike Lee films. I respect his work and I have seen some of his work but I tend to not watch his films. Don't know why. Malcolm X to me is the best of his work I have seen. He tells a story, he doesn't lie to the viewers or tone anything down, he tells the story exactly how it was. This has drawn heavy criticism from the white community which views this film as a tad bit demeaning to their race and along with some racial overtones. I myself am I white male and I did not find the movie to be racist. Yes there are the use of the word n*gger and several other racist names but these are not intended to single out an audience, it is part of the story. Spike Lee is a controversial director because he does not use stereotypes. He portrays people exactly how they are/were in life. He shows that not all white people in life are good, he shows not all black people in life are good. There is no controversy in my mind in this film.Denzel Washington is... how can I put it into words... MAGNIFICENT. His portrayal of Malcolm X is exactly how I picture the man to have been and that is human. A man who had the will to never give up and the ability to overcome any obstacle thrown at him in order to achieve his goal in life, to obtain equal rights for African Americans. Denzel shows all of this on screen through brilliant acting and character typing, something very hard to achieve.At first I found the film to be a bit choppy. One second you're in one place, the next you're some place else. Characters coming in left and right, all within the first 20 minutes. It is quite confusing in the first 20 minutes. I do realize that Malcolm X's early days were confusing and he was probably trying to obtain that with the audience in order to relate to him but I still found the start to be a little much. But after the first 20 minutes, the film is spectacular. The emotion behind Denzel's words and the support of the rest of the cast makes the acting in this some of the best I've seen. The cinematography and sets are top notch in their own respective areas. The film does go slow at a few parts near the middle and the end. It does grab your attention though when it needs you with a powerful montage of scenes to close out the film.4/5 stars",

So when Malcolm X was referred to by African staying in UK as one of the most influential thinker, I thought let me see this movie.The movie is based on the \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" co-written by Alex Haley and published in 1966 one year after Malcolm X's murder. Denzel Washington plays Malcolm X.The movie narrates the story of a kid Malcolm, as a bright student who is not allowed to study further due to people's prejudice towards black. As a youth Malcolm leads a smoke, drug, alcohol, sex and burglary life that lands him in prison. In prison, he is influenced by a man named Bimbi, and the teachings of Islam through a prophet Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm studies and graduates from prison and joins Nation of Islam organisation of Elijah Muhammad. Here he takes the causes of African people, preachers and gives speeches against the atrocities of white people. He demands the right of African people who are here in American by default and not their own will. His daring outspokenness makes him popular among Africans and controvesial figure, but this also isolates him from everyone. He is thrown out of Nation of Islam and after a pilgrimage to Mecca his outlook changes a little bit and he starts his own organisation Muslim Mosque Inc. Within a few months he is shot dead.This is a very good movie to understand who was Malcolm X? If someone does not want to read his life story and get incite in 3 hours. Hats off and kudos to Spike Lee, who undertook this daring project of great scale and magnitude, when he was only 35 years of age. No doubt that Spike Lee is considered one the best directors of Hollywood. Denzel Washington is so authentic in the role of Malcolm X, that it is hard to believe anyone else in that role. He lives the role to its cells. There is also an uncanny resemblance of Denzel with Malcolm X. Brilliant! It is so sad that Denzel did not win an Oscar that year \u0096 may be a reality check on his being black!!? One gets a very good idea of Malcolm X through this movie. He was a confused person, and one gets an impression that as lots of lost minds, he too got a hook in to cling on. Like Christianity, Judiasm, Hinduism, Nationalism etc. Malcolm also found his hook called Islam. Many things he spoke were so true and he dared to speak it out loud and clear. The only problem was he became mis-represented because he was wearing a garb of Black Muslim in American society.The build up to the movie is slow and it takes nearly 1 hour for the movie to actually take hold of one's attention. The editing could have had been more tight. The most diluting part of the movie was its ending where Spike tried to normalize his life to a caricature black leader. Spike showed a street named Malcolm X, he made Nelson Mandela speak for Malcolm X, he made small children rant \u0096 \"I am Malcolm X\" and it was so sorry and laughable to see that at the end of such a wonderful and dramatic life story.I think there was no need to explain or justify Malcolm X, the presentation of his life's story was in itself enough. That's all \u0096 nothing more. Like any other leader we see \u0096 Malcolm X was also a great confused leader.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)",

Above anything else, \"Malcom X\" feels like a character piece considering the film's fine attention to the character's gradual and believable change throughout the movie. Helmed by Spike Lee, this nearly three and a half hour film covers Malcom X's life as a public figure on race, supremacy, and then equality. The audience is treated to one of the best and most devoted Denzel Washington performances ever put to celluloid and solid acting from the rest of the cast. While the film takes a few liberties and might feel biased at times, the epic dives into several important aspects of the character's life which makes this a character piece above anything else. Yes the film explores race in an in-depth and thorough way. Anyone interested in an epic and historical look at one of the most controversial figures in U.S. history, \"Malcom X\" offers a one of a kind experience that is unforgettable.",

Bassett, another fine actress is good as his wife, but she really doesn't do too much in a role that was underwritten.Al Freeman makes a fine Elijah Muhammad, first as Malcom's tutor and mentor until his break with him after he finds out he fas fathered illegitimate children.The film deals honestly and intelligently with the aspects and times of the civil rights struggle of the era. It really does not gloss over anything to present the facts they occurred during this recent-and shameful period of our history.Washingington, one of Americas best actor is thoroughly convincing and believable in the role.We get to see how-and why he went from a small time criminal, through prison and his rebirth as the controversial leader.Rest of cast is uniformly fine with several activists -like Al Sharpton and William Kuntsler in \"cameo\" roles. In its broadest sense, it also can be viewed as an American success story. The only things that work against the film are the opening scenes of an American flag burning and the Rodney King beating. The closing scenes features school children saying \"I am Malcolm X\" al la the ending of \"Spartacus\". Maybe Lee is just rubbibg our faces in these scenes, but they are unnecessary. They also tend to add an amateurish touch to what essentially is a fine film.My 9 star rating is based upon this. A film EVERYONE should see- and discuss.",

            "content": "In this film, Spike Lee tells the story of Malcolm X (Denzel Washington), touching lightly on his younger years, and detailing the change going to prison brought on in him, and the change leaving Elijah Muhammad's (Al Freeman Jr.) Nation of Islam to become orthodox.  We also get to see X's private life away from the camera's, from the influence Baines (Albert Hall) had on him to the life he lived with his wife Betty (Angela Basset).I was already familiar with Spike Lee's work before this film, but this is the movie that turned me into a Denzel Washington fan.  Before I saw this, I brushed him off as another star gliding by on his looks - not because of his choice of roles or anything, but because I had never seen him in any films and tend to be skeptical about everything.  When I saw this, I realized what a powerful presence he has.  The glimpse we get of Malcolm X's transformation has Washington virtually portraying three completely different people.  The scene where he breaks down when he meets Elijah Muhammad for the first time is one of the most powerful moments on film.  I suppose the soundtrack helped that scene, but both Washington and Freeman Jr. were breathtaking there.Basset was great, but she always is.  Not to diminish her talent, but to be honest, I haven't seen her give a merely average performance yet, much less a poor one.  So, I wasn't expecting any less of her.  Lee was very unbiased in his portrayal of X, showing the audience how angry he was, and how when he first converted to Islam, he didn't do it because of religion - he did it almost as a means of channeling his anger.  I also like how Lee shows him eating with white Muslims in Mecca at the end.  Some of my family adhere to the Nation of Islam, and they seem to forget that Malcolm quit hating white people near the end of his life.  It is just too bad that his life was ended by other black nationalists.  In Islam we have something called maktoub - you cannot escape fate.  So, I suppose he was meant to go down for taking a stand.  Very sad, yes, but out of all the ways to die, it's probably the most honorable.Both Lee and Washington were amazing here.  I used to keep up to date with Oscar nominations (until films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan started sweeping the awards - they were good, but not the best), and out of the 1991-2000 decade, Washington's nomination for Best Male Actor was probably the biggest snub.  But, who cares.  It's a good film on it's own, one all people should see.",

            "review_title": "Climate of Malcolm X Times",
            "content": "The life of Malcolm X revolves around two of the most highly charged subjects in American consciousness. Those subjects being Sex and Race. Here in America, the strain of hypocrisy that runs throughout these issues is astonishing and makes objective analysis a formidable and daunting task.People tend to forget that all this started when a journeyman writer working for Playboy magazine landed an interview with this firebrand only then beginning to come into renown. That writer was Alex Haley who, in my opinion, later went on to be for African American History what Homer has become for Greek History. Haley explained to his audiences and me, a cocky and arrogant high school playwright at the time whom he wanted to take down a peg, how hard it was to get Malcolm to open up and speak freely about his life. At the outset, Malcolm presented himself as the proselytizer of the honorable Elijah Muhammud and prefaced many of his statements to Haley with the Spiritual Leader's name. During one of these interviews, Malcolm reminisced about his times as a Lindy Hopper in the dance halls of Harlem and apparently the memory was so vivid he got up out of his seat and started to cut a rug with a few steps. Haley recounted this incident as a breakthrough in the course of the interviews and after that, it was much easier to get Malcolm to talk about his earlier life.This series of interviews became, to a large extent, the basis for THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X, later published by Grove Press. You'll notice in the beginning of Spike Lee's MALCOLM X prominent footage is given to Malcolm X's days as a Lindy Hopper and that this is where the narrative seems to take off. The thing that is interesting to me is how Alex Haley, a paid representative of an organ spearheading the Sexual Revolution, ends up encountering a representative of the Black Cultural Revolution and the phenomena this eventually produces.There is more to the equation than this. Before Spike Lee, writers like myself loved to juxtapose the careers of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King for insights and enlightenment and fascinating parallels can be drawn between these two iconic leaders. In fact, I was surprised that the photograph of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King meeting each other that was so prominently displayed at the end of DO THE RIGHT THING didn't find its way underneath the flaming flag at the beginning of MALCOLM X. What is of interest here is how these two extraordinary individuals appeared poles apart on the issue of how to defend self determination or achieve greater human freedom and yet end up as martyrs for the cause. The theme of nation building which Elijah Muhammud was espousing on a rudimentary basis is to be found within the nexus of their relationship.Spike Lee tells the story of MALCOLM X with a sweep and a verve and a heartfelt vitality and wit. You can sense how much he loves his subject when, as playing Shorty, he asks Malcolm played by Denzel Washington, whether or not he really put a loaded pistol to his head playing Russian roulette or palmed the bullets beforehand. It is like a question he always really wanted to ask this figure and now finally gets a chance to do so in his film. This scene reeks of hero worship and yet is oddly endearing.I also would have liked to have seen an ending something like that of Hype Williams' film BELLY grafted onto the end of MALCOLM X suggesting that the time was well nigh for black men to stopping killing black men under any pretext. This, and a moment of silence, as the film faded to black with Nina Simone singing 'TO BE YOUNG, GIFTED AND BLACK' to better discharge the process of catharsis. I would have preferred this to Lee's homage to SPARTACUS with school kids chanting \"I AM MALCOLM X!\".That being said, the process of how MALCOLM X came to be made is almost as adventuresome as the life of Malcolm X himself. It is amazing how many talented people came together within the artistic community to make this particular phenomenon happen. The ensemble achieves true synergy more often than not and the chemistry between characters on all levels is real and palpable. MALCOLM X comes across as a great show despite the fact that Lee succumbs to the temptation to make white folks the Indians and black folks the Cowboys and a beautiful white woman ends up kissing a black man's dirty foot.",

You learn about his young beginnings, youthful upbringing, how he became transformed into the Islamic leader, then his eventual disillusionment and further transformation.This story was a fascinating view with strong acting by Denzel. He seems to thrive in characters where he can go a little over the top though, and at times, that can get a bit tiring, much like in the more recent Fences, where his non-stop action is something you cannot keep up with. Malcolm X was a bit like that, but you saw that Malcolm had a deliberateness and an immediacy to his actions that pushed action.The setting was inner city with excellent costumes. His friend shorty and his other crew grew up to support and eventually adore Malcolm, but he also gained enemies. As his views started to venture from the strict Islam line, he created enemies. The film got a bit slow at times, but Angela Basset as his girl helped bring a nice evenness to the plot by solidly standing by her man thru thick and thin. This movie was a fascinating view of how a person can change colors, while always still doing the right thing according to their convictions. Such morals as Islam play a big role in our world today. Watching Malcolm X will help you understand how there can be good parts to it, but also abuses of it that are not good.I hope you enjoy Malcolm X.",

However, I feel it is necessary to tell people that the novel written by Alex Haley with the help of Malcolm X is even more important than Lee's spectacular movie. In Lee's film, Malcolm never reaches the level of honesty that he does in the novel. Instead, Lee uses everything else in his arsenal to tell this compelling story. He tells most of Malcolm young life through flashbacks that just don't seem authentic and they feel rushed, but at the same time his use of color, lighting, and sound is phenomenal. The first third or so of the movie it runs through Malcolm's life as a hustler and during this time Lee uses very bright lighting and colors to give this part of the film a feeling of joy and it almost feels like it is to good to be true. However, in the novel there is a completely different feeling when reading it. You feel sorry for everything Malcolm had to go through as a child and reading about him making bad choices never really feels happy at all. Along with the color, Lee does an amazing job in large crowds. There is a scene when Malcolm arrives in New York and there is a huge gathering in the street and the camera zooms out but you never lose sight of Malcolm because he is the only one wearing somewhat bright clothes. Lee take on Malcolm being this beacon of light perhaps? If you are thinking about watching this movie I highly recommend it and it shouldn't be missed, but you shouldn't miss out on the novel as well. Each are very important stories told in different, but honest, ways.",

This film is an excellent example of what a director like Spike Lee is capable of when he is willing to set aside his agenda and simply tell a story about people, places, and moments that are very meaningful to him. Malcolm X is at once one of the best among biographical and spiritual films (And spiritual without shoving religion down the viewer's throat.) and is perhaps the most enlightening film I've ever seen.  This film has everything.  Great photography by Ernest Dickerson who has worked with Lee on many previous productions, but seems to be even better here, a terrific screenplay, astounding performances by Denzel Washington and Angela Basset, and all of it comes together brilliantly to encompass an individual's life in a way that perhaps other productions have never as fully succeeded. Throughout the course of the film though you may not always agree with Malcolm's philosophies, actions, and words you can at least appreciate the metamorphosis he goes through.  I don't know if I've ever seen or heard of an individual growing as much as Malcolm X does in this film, constantly transcending yesterday's mold and always aspiring to something greater. This is truly a great film.  Lots of films have style, some have content, few have depth, but this one is an amazing amalgamation of all three and is a great tribute not only to Malcolm X, the makers of the film, but to the indomitable spirit of humanity.",

Spike Lee gives a great analysis of Malcolm X and doesn't stoop to making him a heroic myth but rather portrays the truth and contrary to most critics he doesn't put in his racial bias.. When a white student asks Malcolm if she could help him with his struggles, he replies no and walks away but instead of just ending it there we see the hurt look on the student as he walks away.. It's a great movie and a great tribute to a great man and the speeches in the movie tremble with fury and grasp u.. the prologue has got to be a highlight..

Utterly engaging central performance by Washington.At first (once Malcolm X gets to prison and meets Brother Baines) one is impressed by the power of the arguments used, and the value of truly understanding the history of black repression.  Your heart goes out to Malcolm because of what he is trying to achieve, which is that the African Americans take control of their own destiny and make their own prosperity, by eschewing crime and drugs and all the other easy escapes, and instead to promote a moral life of education and achievement.  Then, gradually, almost without you noticing it, the other aspects of Malcolm X's views come out: the sexism, the Anti-Semitism, the segregationism.  This is what I meant by my subtitle.  This film does not compromise in its portrait of a figure it admires - it does not sweep the uncomfortable facts under the carpet.  I also like the way the film sees everything from X's viewpoint.  We don't find out about Elijah Muhammed's shenanigans until Malcolm X does, and there is only the slightest hint that the NoI leadership had turned against X before he finds out the full shocking truth.If Spike Lee has a fault, however, it is in not allowing powerful images to speak for themselves.  The demonstration outside the police station comes to an abrupt end when X raises his hand and points:  everyone shuts up and quietly shuffles off.  A brilliant scene with an unmistakable message.  So unmistakable, in fact, that the police chief, Peter Boyle repeats it for our benefit: \"That's too much power for one man to have.\"  Hey, Spike!  Malcolm demonstrated the power of the masses, and his own power over them, in a brilliant, non-violent way.  We got it!Of course the most egregious example of this was the coda, which repeatedly told us that Malcolm X is a much-denigrated figure who nevertheless deserves our honour and respect.  Well, why did Lee spend millions of dollars making a 3 hour film about him then?  Did he suddenly lose all his confidence as a filmmaker?  Did he think that, having sat through all three hours, we would still not quite understand whether Malcolm X was admirable or not?  Hey, Spike!  Anyone can put together a montage with an upright-sounding voiceover.  Only Spike Lee can make \"Malcolm X\".  You did a good job, leave it alone!",

            "content": "Malcolm X is considered one of the most influential and brave individuals recorded in history. After being dead for more than twenty years, he has been brought back by a stunning and electrifying performance by Denzel Washington. Not only has Denzel proved to be one of the best actors in Hollywood, but he also can make any person believe in him.The movie is well-researched and well captured by Spike Lee. It covered a whole lot in the three hour and twenty minute film from Malcolm's youth to his assassination. The costume design by Ruth E. Carter added much to the authenticity of the time period. The work of editing and cinematography was also a nice addition to the film.Despite such authenticity and a performance by Denzel, it does not make it a classic. Even though much is covered in the film, it got boring. The first hour covers his youth as a pimp, gambler, drug abuser, and sex addict. Nothing really exciting happens until he is sent to prison and learns of the Muslim religion. From there on, it kicks off.But after awhile, even his role in politics gets dull. As I said, Denzel is powerful in his performance, but yet I can't help but see him as a shouting figurehead in when he delivers his speeches. I've seen documented footage of Malcolm X, and he did have an accelerated voice. Denzel really made the movie, but he kind of went a bit over the top.It's not a bad movie, but not great either. 7/10",

            "content": "Spike Lee is an uneven filmmaker: some of his films are great, some are, well, not. This is one of the great ones, probably the greatest.The performances in this movie are tremendous, led by Denzel Washington. What makes his achievement particularly impressive is that he essentially has to play two completely different characters. First, Malcolm Little, the fast-talking petty thief and hustler who travels back and forth from Boston to New York. And second, Malcolm X, the serious (but human) preacher and public face for the Nation of Islam. Both are utterly believable and essential for the success of the film. Secondary parts are also uniformly excellent.The story of the film is very detailed. The movie follows the Alex Haley book pretty faithfully. Sure, there are a few things added to move things along. For instance, Malcolm's conversion in prison wasn't quite as dramatic as portrayed in the film (he had originally heard about Islam in letters from his family in Michigan, for instance). But by and large it was pretty close to the book. Perhaps even too faithful, considering that the movie clocks in at over 3 hours long. I think there may have been some things he could have taken out.Malcolm X was a complex man. For good or ill, Malcolm X was not someone to do things with a partial effort. When he was a criminal, he was a determined, almost crazy criminal. When he converted to Elijah Muhammed's Nation of Islam, he believed in his heart and soul in that, and preached the NOI party line even though he himself was obviously a natural leader. When Elijah Muhammed betrayed him, he became a more orthodox Muslim and preached that with equal vigor. Hate him or love him (and over the years, he said many things which deservedly were met with scorn by blacks and whites alike), he was a force to be reckoned with, and this film does an admirable job of bringing that out.",

Spike Lee did a better job here with the storytelling, the plot was more polished and the message was clear. If Do the Right Thing left me with mixed feelings, then Malcolm X made me respect Spike Lee's work. I might not agree with every decision he made but I can respect him now. I talked about this movie with some of my friends and, to my luck, one of them actually met Spike Lee when he spoke at my friend's university. Spike Lee talked about how hard it was to make this movie. Tackling a historical figure is always hard but the graphic historical situation of Malcolm X and his civil rights movement proposes a few extra challenges as well.Denzel Washington's performance was spectacular in this movie. I've seen a few of his films, mostly action flicks, and I never knew of his acting capabilities as a spokesman. Some of the language coming from his mouth surprised me too. At least he made the 3-hour runtime interesting. Spike Lee had a smaller role in this movie but he used his screentime well. Or at least he didn't have enough screentime to piss me off this time. The scenes with a large number of people were the most impressive ones",

I was watching a documentary on Muhammad Ali on TV two days ago so one thing led to another therefore I was watching this. Spike Lee is a very weird director. I've seen a couple of his films like Inside Man, He Got Game and Clockers. All these films were watchable but they were made with such weird techniques.So initially you get that Spike Lee smear when you watch the first hour of this film which chronicled Malcolm's teenage years in Boston and Harlem. However when you think about it was filmed that way just to indicate how buck wild the young Malcolm was.Once the movie enters the stage of Malcolm's incarceration and transformation that's when you see less of Spike's running gags and more substance from the man Denzel himself.Great film, I learned what I needed to know about the most complicated figure in the Civil Rights Movement.",

No argument here, I agree, it's a truly great piece of filmed cinema.I don't think I can overstate what a powerful and influential Film this was when it was released, a cultural phenomenon that influenced and re-directed social thoughts of teens and young adults at the time; an intense, adamant and passionate re-direction. I don't think it can be overstated. And now that it has been over 30 years, it's good to see the Film is still revered as a Masterpiece.It stars Denzel Washington, alongside Albert Hall and Angela Bassett. Bassett and Hall do good in the Film, delivering good Performances.The rest of the cast delivers as well in their smaller but important roles. Spike Lee, who Directed the Film, even does very good in his smaller role; and Al Freeman knocks it out of the park in his amazingly important role, captivating, subtle, dainty, dynamic-flat out works. The legendary Christopher Plummer has a small part, and as I would expect, he's brilliant in his role, and watching Denzel and Plummer together is an absolute treat, 2 Masters going at it, with neither over-reaching but somehow creating intensity, what those 2 do together simply can't be taught. It's a treat. Then there's Delroy Lindo, and he absolutely turns in an amazing Performance that is pivotal in bringing depth to the Film, a Film that was already layers deep without him. He commands the screen and I can't take my eyes off of him in his smaller but amazing role.I'll get to Denzel Washington later, but then there's the Directing of Spike Lee; brilliantly captured and Directed by Lee, envisioned and passionate Directing. He nails it, usually does, and this Film is no exclusion. He's had such a great career as a Director to this point, including Masterpieces like She's Gotta Have It (1986), Do The Right Thing (1989), Crooklyn (1994), Get On The Bus (1996), 25th Hour (2002), Inside Man (2006) & Blackkklansman (2018), to name a handful. This is a student of Directing, with a deep respect for the craft, with the passion and ability and greatness to capture the delivery there of.Then there's Denzel Washington. He is absolutely captivating in this Performance, an absolute Masterful Delivery with nuances and intricacies that few Actor's in history could deliver. He can Perform between the tip of his nose and his chin as well as some some capable Actor's can with their entire being, but we don't just see the bottom of his face, we get to see his entire body.Every generation, if we're lucky, a talent like Denzel Washington comes along, an emotionally dynamic Performer that captivates.I think Denzel is one of the 10 best Actor's in history. It's an impossible list as there are 50 I want to have in my Top 10; but I would say these are the 10 best Actors in history (listed in order from oldest to newest):Charlie Chaplin, Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, Daniel Day-Lewis, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Joaquin Phoenix, Leonardo DiCaprio, Philip Seymour Hoffman & Shia LaBeouf.Most Film Historians would say that Denzel Washington has starred in 15-20 Masterpieces thus far during his career. I believe if I talked to the 100 most respected Film Historians around the World, naturally they would all have slightly different lists, but I believe if they came to a consensus, this would be Historians Top 10:1. Glory (1989) 2. Much Ado About Nothing (1993) 3. Malcolm X (1992) 4. The Tragedy Of Macbeth (2021) 5. Inside Man (2006) 6. American Gangster (2007) 7. The Hurricane (1999) 8. Fences (2016) 9. Philadelphia (1993) 10. Crimson Tide (1995)I would have a slightly different looking list, my list would also include this Film. My Top 10:1. Fences (2016) 2. American Gangster (2007) 3.

            "content": "It was almost inevitable that any work that attempted to tell the story of a personality as large as that of Malcolm X would fall into larger-than-life schematics and all too many Steven Spielburg skies. So it is particularly fitting that the first major film work done on the life of Malcolm, Spike Lee's MALCOLM X, was generated by one of U.S. film making's most controversial talents. MALCOLM X was released at a time when all too many Black Americans were hungry for work about African American icons that stepped outside of the Budweiser Corporation type representation of Black experience seen on tavern walls, so it shouldn't surprise that the first Black film maker to take on so ambitious a project sometimes fell into spectaclist technique. People need legends and heroes, and Malcolm is certainly a heroic figure.Malcolm's story has become increasingly familiar to people outside the Black community. A man with a strong sense of self-identification from his youth, he moved through several identity changes, from shoeshine hustler to railroad porter to borderline gangster to convict to minister and organizer of the Nation of Islam, to the dynamic articulator of African American struggle that he was in his final push for the Organization of African American Unity. His life was the flip side of what is called the American Dream, and when he was murdered at the age of 39 in 1965, he was well on his way to becoming the leader of a revolutionary democratic insurgence in the United States. In short, his life was the stuff of legend.So along comes Spike Lee, and assembles this remarkable cast in telling the story of his life: Denzel Washington as Malcolm, Angela Basset as Dr. Betty Shabazz, Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Mohammed, Delroy Lindo as Malcolm's street \"mentor\" West Indian Archie, Albert Hall as his prison associate, Brother Baines, and Giancarlo Esposito as one of Malcolm's assassins, Thomas Hayer. There are numerous cameos from Hollywood glitterati, and even unlikely personalities such as the late and notorious radical attorney William Kuntsler appears in this film as the judge who sentences Malcolm to his prison term. There are also a number of clever black and white footages that, when shot, bore so close a resemblance to the newsreels some of us grew up with, they become difficult to tell from the originals. Denzel comes that close to the real man's carriage and timbre.I do regret that Spike Lee did not feel the need to acknowledge the contributions made to his screenplay posthumously by James Baldwin. It seems to me several portions of this film are loosely lifted from Baldwin's stillborn film biography of Malcolm, ONE DAY WHEN I WAS LOST. But I suppose that's an issue for the legatees of Baldwin's estate to work out with Lee.The bottom line is that this was a timely film (1992), Disney-like crescendos and all. The movie was released in the wake of the Los Angeles Riots that followed the verdict on the LAPD beating of Rodney King. The work gave younger and older Black people an event to talk about and do some mutually respectful sharing of ideas about cultural integrity and critique, and if that's all Spike Lee accomplished with MALCOLM X, that's good enough for me.",

This is just another example of his talents. I know they had to go through a lot to have this movie made. It's truly ashame it didn't get best picture or best actor at the Academy's. It is truly.

Needless to say, I did not have a paper to turn in. I just did not think (and still do not think) that Malcolm X was a very pleasant person. Like Jerry Falwell, and Louie Farakhan, he had a tendency to push the wrong buttons in the statements he made. He seemed to be driven by pure hatred most of the time. And even after his conversion to orthodox Islam, following his Hajj, currents of racism still remained in his philosophy. That is what the Black Nationalist movement is/was. Keep blackie in one corner of the room, keep whitey out. That isn't reconcilation. That is segregation. What a way to move forward! But I saw the movie again on BSTRZ and imagine my surprise...I enjoyed the heck out of it. It is completely uncompromising unlike the pathetic \"Hurricane\", which tries to sanctify an unpleasant person who was probably a murderer. Malcolm X presents the man as he was, based on what he said, what he did. It does not pull any punches. Most people will not come away from this with a greater sense of respect for Malcolm. Unless you believe in the things he said. Apparently, Spike Lee does, yet, he does not attempt to whitewash (pardon the pun) this controversial figure. And in that sense, this film is very enjoyable, historically accurate and heck, it is quite moving too. I did find myself thinking a bit differently about some issues.",

At the beginning of the movie, before Malcolm becomes politically aware, we see Malcolm and his friends, seemingly happy, emulating the larger societies dress and mannerisms. Is this a statement about the times? Personally, I noticed a parallel between these fawning citizens of the past, and contemporary, going along, happy whites of today -er of 1992.Was this Lees point?Malcolm himself becomes politically aware, and thinks back about his relationships with whites. Realizing, at best, he's simply been used by them. He decides to join the black Muslims. The movie follows him on his rise to prominence, \"That's too much power for one man to have\".I remember when this movie came out. Everyone was wearing Malcolm X T-shirts and Malcolm X hats. I'd never seen anything like it before. Malcolm X's influence and legacy loom larger than ever. Certainly large in 1992.What is Malcolm X's legacy tho?Was he just a tool used to pacify the underclass - when they wouldn't trust the media, the government, academia, their women, or whites?Is his legacy the opposite? One of keeping resistance alive? Certainly people of all kinds seem angrier now than ever. Do the powers-that-be simply think we work harder when we're angry? Or is this resistance needed now more than ever?Is Malcolm X's religious vision the most true worship of God, and is this his legacy?Did Malcolm X create his own legacy. . . ? In the movie, Lee focuses intensely on the scene where Malcolm and his friend (Shorty?), and their girlfriends, play a game of Russian Roulette that Malcolm forces on them. Malcolm is a bad-character at this time, but he becomes aware of the effect this gun and his attitude have on his surrounding friends. . . Is this his legacy?The problem is. . .

The book to me is a masterpiece, a very well done and important work. However, the movie is none of these. Many scenes are doctored and a few major characters are completely invented. And the ending goes Schindler's List on us and stops being a movie. Apparently Michael Jordan wearing an \"X\" hat is something we all must see to understand Malcolm. This movie deserves to be redone, and if its done right, could be phenomenal.",

Iam so happy to see an important point in this film that it showed the turning point of his life after his entry in the Islamic religion and this religion is the great cause of entering and recording his name in the pages of eternity and that is the evidence for western people around the world that Islam is the religion of building not a religion of destroy, the film said that between their scenes that the thermometer of making the goodness or badness for anything the humans by the bad use of Loniga Mohamed the religion for his special principles and Malcolm x understood the factual core of Islam after his journey to the holly land in Meca at the occasion of Haj and for the Egyptian land an the rest of countries in Islamic world and the scene of his praying in mosque of Mohamed Ali in Cairo is looks like the factual photograph in reality.At the end after the assassination scene The cleverness of film s, stuff that they choose Nelson Mandela the great leader of Africa and the icon of freedom that he said his principles that the legacy of humanity said that we are in equilibrium by living in one land with the same tools and principles without making any racism between different colors and at the end all children in the school said in one tung and quote (Iam Malcolm X).",

What movie teams up the greatest director (Spike Lee) with the greatest actor (Denzel Washington) in a story about controversial black activist Malcolm X? And it doesn't stop there, it is backed up by a superb supporting cast (Angela Bassett, Al Freeman Jr. need I say more?) This whole film was adapted from the novel The Autobiography of Malcolm X written by Alex Haley. \"Malcolm X\" shows us how Malcolm Little became Malcolm X and his departure from the Nation of Islam and how they played a role in his assassination. The score by Terence Blanchard is incredible. The eulogy by Ossie Davis, classic. \"Malcolm X\" is a masterpiece. Spike Lee's hard work was never recognized by the Academy, and he was not nominated for a Best Director award. \"Malcolm X\" won for best costume design and Best Actor nominee Denzel Washington was snubbed. This is the definitive film of the 20th Century. But it is sad that it is not recognized the way it should be.Malcolm X- rated PG-13 ***** (the only five star rating I will give out)",

Thematically similar and with the same fire-and-fury be-damned-to-you attitude as Do The Right Thing (a far more visually creative, quick-paced, lively, idiosyncratic, stylized cultural landmark), this one is a lot more straightforward, and the only thing that really keeps it afloat is Washington's embodiement of Malcolm. It's fairly serviceable, but feels like it could've been made by anyone - it doesn't have that Spike Lee vibe that even his bad movies have - though at least here, he's pretty restrained and tones down his trademark over-the-top Spike-isms to deliver one of his more coherent and concise movies. A pretty typical biopic, though by no means a bad one, and relatively solid for a director whose entire body of work is a mixed bag. Despite some of its flatness, its still in the upper tier of his work. A fine watch, but not much more.",

            "review_title": "Malcolm X: Still relevant to young people today?",
            "content": "I must say, I've had very high expectations of this film because it was one of the most ambitious projects ever to represent Malcolm X on film. I dare say no other film, video, and even documentary came close to the sheer magnitude in terms of production values, publicity as well as commercial and critical success. Nor does any other \u0091attempts' on making \u0091Malcolm X' came close in terms of the controversy generated. \u0091Malcolm X' by Spike Lee is a fine piece of work, but I'm sure many will agree that it is not without it's flaws. Warning: Spoilers ahead\tSpike Lee had said that he wanted to target the young audience, especially black youths; that is why he wanted the film to be rated PG 13. But I'm not sure whether that intention has led to some of the problems that I have with the film. For example, I personally think that the first act in reenacting the story of young Malcolm, with all the \u0091Jitterbug' dancing, the love scene on the beach, and supporting characters like \u0091Shorty' (played by Spike Lee himself), felt some what contrived. I was lost in the midst of all the colors, music and dancing. It makes me feel like I'm watching a Broadway show rather than a Bio pic, and no amount of suspension of disbelief is going to convince me that this is even remotely close to the recreation and depiction of young Malcolm's life. Despite a high-spirited performance by Denzel Washington, it is simply unconvincing to see a middle aged man (Denzel was about 38 then) playing a juvenile delinquent.\tHaving prior knowledge about Malcolm X before watching the film didn't help either. For instance, the autobiography, which the film is based on, did not confirm that Clansmen murder Malcolm's father, but the film seems to portray that as a fact. I have doubts as to whether other facts have been manipulated by the film to tell the story, especially towards the more ambiguous early history on Malcolm's life. \tHowever, I do find the stylized gangster treatment on Malcolm's hustling days to be tasteful, with a very noir look and feel to it. The period when Malcolm was incarcerated, although falling somewhat short in length, is adequate in serving as a transition between the different periods and getting it's messages across. The second stretch of the film, documenting Malcolm's rise as a Minister in the Nation of Islam, was impressive, mainly due to the great performance of Denzel Washington in portraying the Malcolm of this middle period. I take for granted many of the quotes and things said by Denzel are verbatim of the real Malcolm, which all the more accentuate the effects that you are watching the real Malcolm in action.\n\tThe last act of the film, which Malcolm X went through great turmoil after realizing the truths behind the deceptions that he had been living upon, his subsequent religious and spiritual redemption, and the final scene of the inevitable assassination all happen in quick succession within the film. Contrary to what many critics feel about this act in not deliberating long enough, I think it is again the choice of the filmmaker to cater to the film's target audience. Already stretching beyond 3 hours, it is hard to expect young people to remain seated and captivated if the story of Malcolm X is not condensed. I also feel that the quick pacing towards the end somewhat mirrors the real life of Malcolm X, because he did not stay alive for more than 100 days after his return from his pilgrimage to Mecca. The focus is more on his internal struggles, contrasting with the escalating events surrounding him, and I feel that the film deserves credit for its chosen treatment on the subject. Lastly, I was incredibly overwhelmed by the juxtaposition of the archival images of the real Malcolm X with the eulogy recited by Ozzie Davis at the end of the film. It has been quite a long time since cinema had such a cathartic effect on me, especially with simple words like `How can you judge a man like Malcolm X? Do you know him\u0085Have you spoken with him?' The finishing coda that follows, with a surprise entry of Nelson Mandela giving one of Malcolm's X speech which bears the infamous `by all means necessary', and the kids unanimous responses, again was overdone and portentous. If only there is another more creative way of relating the messages across that ties what Malcolm X represents to today's youth.",

The second time, I read the autobiography first, then re-watched the movie, and really enjoyed it. The recently released special edition 2-DVD set has a really good making of featurette, plus a 90-minute documentary made in 1972 on Malcolm's life. All were quite good. But, back to the movie.This is, by most accounts, a sprawling epic. Spike Lee wanted to make a movie on the scale of Laurence of Arabia (itself nearly 4 hours long), and felt that Malcolm X had enough subject matter to do so. After reading the autobiography, that makes sense. Some have issues with the first hour, since it details Malcolm's life before he enters jail and gets static. In this case, Spike follows the book quite well, because the book is very detailed BEFORE Malcolm enters jail. I had no real problems with it, although I was surprised that it was an hour before the change started. But Spike gave a great picture of what Malcolm's life was like before he converted to Islam, which was important to see the transformation. And, if nothing else, Malcolm's life was transforming fast.The politics of the film (that the Nation of Islam doesn't receive the blunt of the attack) deserve a comment. Reading the book made me understand that Malcolm would not completely shun the entire Black Muslim movement because those tenets brought him out of misery and gave him a new life. With that type of history, a person as self-educated as Malcolm would understand that he can't just dismiss those who helped him out. Hindsight is 20/20, which some critics didn't totally realize.The Oscar question...this movie suffered two major snubs. Spike Lee should have at least been nominated for best director. Knowing the story of making the film should have appealed to the emotions of the academy, along with the scope of the story. And Denzel Washington was robbed, which is common knowledge at this point. I watched the 1972 Malcolm X documentary, and there are times where you think Malcolm X was doing a Denzel impression...that's how good Denzel is in this movie. Right up there with the transformations of Jamie Foxx in Ray and Val Kilmer in The Doors. Essentially, Denzel didn't win because the academy had somehow managed not to give Al Pacino an Oscar for works such as, oh, I don't know, THE GODFATHER 1/2, SERPICO, DOG DAY AFTERNOON etc. So Denzel wins best actor later for Training Day, even though Russell Crowe probably deserved it more in Beautiful Mind. But then, Crowe won for Gladiator the year before even though Tom Hanks (Cast Away) or Ed Harris (Pollock) was more deserving. The Oscars can be a nasty cycle.I've said enough. I look forward to your comments.",

They get obsessed with power. They don't use the power, the power starts using them.Now lets get to the movie. The director is Spike Lee and therefore naturally, the movie has an aggressive touch to it. There is also an aggressivity to the screenplay as well. However, regarding the days that Malcolm X has lived through, this can be understood.Denzel Washington is one my favorite actors today and the reason is he is incredibly capable of wearing the pants of the character he is to play. He has done a great job in this movie and in others as well. It is a great pleasure to watch him featuring as Malcolm X himself.In fact there is not much needed to be said.

With them, you saw the two different sides of black manhood--the pacifist and the firebrand--on their own terms and not of those created or caricatured by whites.Potent and relevant, Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X\" is a must see by every American intent on learning about an oft-misunderstood individual.

Probably the movie would have been more exciting and would have kept my attention more if I had watched the movie first.While the book is a life changing one (nominated by The Times as one of the 10 most important books of the 20th century) the movie has more and less successful parts in portraying Malcolm's life.While it catches your attention and does a great job showing the youth of Malcolm, in my opinion it fails to present the many long years he spent in prison and developed a widespread knowledge that allowed him to become a great debater from close to no education before and only showed flashes from his 12 years spent in the Nation of Islam. Still, the movie's 3,5 hour long - little too long for me.After reading the book I felt he was a great teacher and fighter for human and minority rights while after watching the movie I had the feeling that he indeed preached hate - as many of his critics claimed.",

To my surprise, the much publicized and long awaited biopic painted such a vivid picture about the legend behind the man. The combination of Denzel's accurate portrayal of the slain civil rights leader, complementing Spike Lee's shrewd direction made this film one of my all time favorites.  Denzel is surrounded, much to his benefit, by a great cast of actors such as Delroy Lindo and a wholesome Angela Bassett. Malcolm X also benefits from a well paced story that becomes more engaging with every minute.  This film is a must see for all who appreciate a great movie and exceptional movie-making!!",

He was the black product of the centuries of racism and opression that blacks endured.  His father was murdered by the Klan. His mother couldn't understandably handle the stress and ended up in a mental institution(That part was in the book by Alex haley The Autiobiography of Malcolm X on which the movie was based) him and his siblings were split up by the state. Malcolm once told his teacher that he wanted to be a lawyer and his white teacher told him that it wasn't a black man's profession and that he should be a carpenter or plasterer(I forget which). If most men faced what young malcolm did by their 21st birthday most would have gone mad. true he was also a criminal in his youth and went to prison which was a saving point in his life. He then does a complete 180 degree turn in prison and gives his life to Islam.Although he hated whites during his NOI days he goes to the Mecca and sees Muslims of all races and starts to lose his hatred for whites. Case in point is that Malcolm's life was about constant change. Without change we cannot adapt and thus cannot hope to survive.",

I am not a big Spike Lee fan but this movie was able to really showcase the greatness of Malcolm X.Malcolm X is a hero not only to blacks but all people of color. He found enlightenment after years of doing wrong. Unfortunately, he went with a crooked organization in the Nation of Islam. However, through them he discovered the truth and later broke free from their clutches to see the true light.Whites of European descent have long wanted to control the narrative. Films have been a big way for their to push their version of America into popular culture. It is always great to see movies that start to showcase the real America.The issue with racism that engulfs American society is a white European problem. It is not a problem created by people of color. As America evolves into a country with a majority of people of color by 2041, whites will have to own up and fix their issues. How they do this is up to them and will determine how their future in America will be.The negative reviews on here are mainly those who want everything to be \"all inclusive.\" The same people who push out an \"All Lives Matter\" narrative to take steam away from a real movement with real merit.These people tend to live in bubbles and want to push myths and lies to the masses. Their purpose to hijack important messages to play in their favor.This movie showcases the importance for people of color to unite. The importance of orators with profound messages to speak to the masses. The importance of not relying on white European allies and instead the importance of bringing people of color together.The one part I wish they spent more time on, is Malcolm's realization that all people of color are connected. No matter if one is African, Asian, Hispanic, or Native, they all share a common reality. Once people of color in America unite, there is no hope for injustice and inequality that has been pushed to these people for centuries.A great movie and message. 10/10.",

Sure, there would be protests, but the theater owners would not have put their livelihoods on the line.Today, this movie would be a cog in the cycle of the movie year.How times have changed.Watching Malcolm X today (5/20/06) for the umpteenth time, I was struck by how timeless it is. Made in 1992, it still plays as a current film. It is an outstanding movie; one that is studied and will continue to be studied for ages.Regardless of your politics, the life and times of Malcolm Little as portrayed in Malcolm X is a true American story. In a capsule--suppression, poverty, education then success. His life was the triumph of an individual above all odds. The film celebrates the cognitive revelation of a truly exceptional person that changed not only the United States, but also the world for the better.Purists will surely take umbrage with the liberal telling of his life story, but that is sour grapes. Malcolm X captures the essence of Malcolm Little as a man with a pure message.

A youthful, yet powerful portrayal of Malcolm Little / El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz / Malcolm X, Washington does indeed carry this movie with bold monologues and in the way in which his mannerisms and movements are such accurate depictions of the real-life character.There are some hugely provocative and contraversial lines in the movie - adding to the notion that Malcolm X did indeed follow a long and winding road through his religious and political ideologies. Look out for a description for 'how he likes his coffee' at the height of the Nation of Islam propaganda.However, and although not a particularly highbrow criticism, I would disagree with the sentiment that this motion picture was particulalry well-paced. It is nearly 3.5 hours in length and, even with that being the case, the editing (for me) is lazy in parts and watching it, my interest did dissuade in parts. Music doesn't really play a huge part in the movie - which I feel is a huge missed trick when you consider all of the possible options which Spike Lee had at his disposal.A great springboard performance from Denzel and a tough subect-matter to cover - but to rate this movie a 9 or 10 / 10 is overly-complimentary for me.",

However, it did not have a major affect on me until years later when I watched it again at home. Only then did I realize exactly what Mr. Lee was trying to achieve in this movie. Those who know little outside of media information about Malcolm X need to see this movie. It brings Malcolm X to light--by showing the audience a phenom, someone who finally understood his life. Someone who was never allowed to realize their full potential. There are many movies about this man but none portray him as he truly was. What I find most heartbreaking(but not surprising) however, is the total lack of media-praise for this movie. This film was not just for African Americans. This movie is about a part of American History. Here is why I can say this:  I noticed when I was on my way out of the theater there were more whites present than there were blacks. Most of the whites were old enough to remember Malcolm X being alive. The look many had on their faces at the end of the film surprised me. I took note of a range of emotions; mostly sadness but best of all--enlightenment. It did my heart good to see this becuase the film accomplished exactly what it was supposed to. Not create more hate but to show one man's transition from being a victim of racial hatred to pro-actively findng a way to end it-- by creating an attitude for African Americans that up until that past few decades was not allowed: Self sufficiency, self pride, high standards of education, and love for ourselves. If there is ever any doubt in your mind that Malcolm X was not a thinker, philosopher, healer, and one of the greatest men that have ever lived, then please see this movie. I am only sorry that I never knew him personally. I am not sorry that someone took the time to introduce us via film.",

            "content": "Meaningful. I want to discuss and debate so much the movie designed by Spike Lee, and discover what he is able to teach us, the character of this movie's title. Malcolm X. This time Denzel Washington was not a policeman, he portrayed a sinner in the abrahamic religions sense of the term, who has become almost a saint, demonstrating that the Afro-American community has his own destiny to draw, and can get out of the fate that the WASPs have created for them into the United States society. His belief, the religion revealed to him, made him born again and at last a martyr for all the causes he has defended for his conception of justice, as Islam and Afro-American community civil and political rights. This man have inspired so many men and women, in the twentieth century it has begun with Garvey and Earl Little, his father, and it continues with King, Park, Mandela, the Black Panthers, the Afro-Americans, the Africans of all tribes till now, and another cultures. Faithful combat, spiritually and ideologically\u00a0; black nationalism, panafricanism. I loved when he talked about mental and cultural colonization of Afro-Americans and Africans, and the mental and cultural migration from America to Africa.\u00a0I was also impressed by how he was depicted in the second part of the movie, rightful in all means, the type of man who was not perfect but seemed perfect, a true leader, someone who would have been necessary for a time like our. A man who have transformed many lives for their own reconstructions as individuals.But there is a contradiction when he said that, while he talked about, after his pilgrimage, to have all races, one humanity connected to one god. Nation of Islam and Sunnism were wrong, because the true religion of Africans, are ethnics religions, all expressed with different languages in each geographical place. Not an universalism like Islam, and the language who had served itself to colonize the non-Arabs, and non-Muslims, because the said holy language was the Arabic. And before the slavery of black people processed by Europeans, Turks, Arabs and Persians have made exactly the same, and they were all Muslims. The true language of Malcolm X must have been one of the thousand from the thousand ethnies and lands of West Africa. And because his ancestors were natives of certain lands of Africa, he was a native of the nature which makes these lands, any dualist-transcendental-metaphysical-idealistic thing.Moreover, some like Black Panthers have understood that capitalism was also a colonization and that is for that reason that the situation cannot change in Africa\u00a0: Private interests conduced by business and occidental states are stealing their lands, all their resources. They pay African people for nothing, but sell it for much. The militaries or politicians are receiving by them all power and money in exchange of the control of their people, within national borders made by these occidental states long before the said independence of Africa. The brains are going to occidental universities, are abandoning their own languages for English or french language, and became alienated by the market and western values, while the poorest try to survive in his own country with hungry, sickness, death, wars, or to pass the sea to European Union abandoning his own culture in the depth of the sea or in an occidental city ghetto.What do you think it's teaching us? The mental and cultural colonization of Afro-Americans and Africans, and the mental and cultural migration from America to Africa.",

            "content": "Making a Biopic is hard. The movie always is judged by the opinion critics have about the central character in study, not the movie itself. Most of the past reviews have tried to assess this movie from what Malcolm X should've been and not what kind of person he was. It seems that many people (\"the good, compassionate\" white folks) were depressed that Malcolm was shown as a racist. They also wanted more harsher criticism of NOI. They all wanted to see Malcolm X discovering the 'truth' that white men can be his brothers. Sadly, if they want this movie to be true, they wouldn't get a chance to see all that.I've heard from Malcolm's own words - speeches, interviews that his trip to Mecca and his experience with 'blond haired, blue eyed men who called (him) brother' NEVER changed his opinion about the race relations in America. He still believed that the only way blacks could gain their human rights was to lead their struggle themselves. He held this view till the day he died. In his own words after the pilgrimage,\"No religion will ever make me forget the sufferings of my people\". I have to say, to the chagrin of many readers here, that Malcolm X did not become another Martin Luther King before he died. A month before he was killed in a meeting he asked the whites sympathizers what he had asked always - to stay out of the black revolution - and if possible, convince the black man that he has to fight this revolution himself.This movie made Malcolm X a cult figure. Many learned about him after watching it. He went from a forgotten black separatist activist to an icon appearing on posters and in rap lyrics. The imperialists now adopted Malcolm, made him their own - one who they could institutionalize, merchandize and at last use to counter struggles of living men today.Malcolm as a person sure deserves admiration for his conviction, clear goals and for his struggles against adversity in life. But the ideas he espoused are much greater. It's certainly not the movie's fault, but these ideas were lost somewhere in the hype.",

            "content": "\"Malcolm X\" is a three and a half hour historical epic from legendary filmmaker, Spike Lee. The film is a retelling of the life and legacy of American civil rights activist, Malcolm X. It's based on \"The Autobiography of Malcom X,\" co-written by Malcolm X and journalist Alex Haley. Denzel Washington leads the cast as the titular role. The supporting cast features Angela Bassett as Betty Shabazz (wife of Malcolm X), Albert Hall as Baines (Malcolm X's mentor), Al Freeman Jr. As Elijah Muhammad, Delroy Lindo as West Indian Archie (Malcolm's former gang mentor), Kate Vernon as Sophia (Malcolm's former love interest), and Spike Lee as Shorty (Malcolm's childhood friend). \"Malcolm X\" is Spike Lee's sixth movie - and one of his greatest achievements as a filmmaker.Denzel Washington is the star of this film. By a large margin, Denzel leads the cast with such courage and grace that echoes the aura of Malcolm X. Denzel is unyielding in his portrayal. His delivery is stern and bold. He steals each scene. As an actor, Denzel successfully conveys Malcolm's progression throughout the different stages of his life. As younger Malcolm, Denzel embues immaturity. His delivery of lines is light. There's no strength or bass in his voice. His posture is more soft. In contrast, as Malcolm progresses into the Muslim activist recognized throughout the annals of American history, Denzel evolves. His demeanor is unshaken. His posture is intense. His delivery is strong. He transforms into the muse of empowerment that Malcolm X was. Angela Bassett holds her own with Denzel. Her potrayal of Betty Shabazz compliments the titular character. She is soft, yet not meek. Strong in every essence. Bassett's portrayal of Betty is a match to Denzel's portrayal of Malcolm. She exudes elegance and beauty in each scene. Simply put, Denzel and Bassett are a match made in heaven. The supporting cast a fine pieces to Lee's greatest puzzle. They each lend a sensation of authenticity needed to speak on the amazing life of such an influential figure.This movie is epic. Each stage within the film is projected with accuracy - and once again, authenticity. From Malcolm's childhood living in a small home - you feel the isolation and terror he experienced. Malcolm's childhood is associated with the helplessness that comes with being a young victim of racism. Spike Lee and cinematographer Ernest Dickerson successfully capture the horror of prejudice. Malcolm's years as a young adult are showcased through the wonder and spectacle the Harlem Renaissance. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter use of hue on the clothing within this period is amazing. The use of bright colors and lively jazz makes the first hour of the film hard to step away from. The streets of Harlem feel like they were ripped right out of a 1950's technicolor musical. This portion of Malcolm's life is vibrant, yet chaotic because of his immaturity. Lee and Dickerson showcase this by making this time in Malcolm's life feel like a party that went entirely too long. The after party is not pretty. Malcolm's stint in jail is portrayed as another period of isolation - however this time its isolation for the sake of consequence and self-growth. The film transforms Malcolm from an immature street gangster into the legend he's recognized for being. This period is portrayed as very dull and bare. It feels like a period of introspection. Lee and Dickerson succesfully capture this by making scenes feel small and less grandeous. The shots are tight - and at certain times, the setting feels suffocating. When Malcolm goes from little to X, the world and scope of the film becomes bigger. The set feels full. The cast feels grand. The stakes feel much higher. Malcolm transforms into a bombastic figure - at times iconic. One of the film's best moments are the scenes in Mecca. Being the first flim ever shot in Mecca, \"Malcolm X\" portrays the Islamic faith as a religion of beauty and brotherhood. These scenes felt as epic as watching \"Lawrence of Arabia\" for the first time. Lee and Dickerson made this film a visual mastercraft. Epic is an understatement.Thematically, \"Malcolm X\" touches on many hard topics. Race is the centerpiece of the narrative. Spike Lee addresses race in a manner that is tangible. He does not aim to guilt, nor finger point. Rather, he highlights an ugly time in American history. It's an honest portrayal of race and racism in America. He uses the different stages of Malcolm's life to reflect the different stages associated with racial consciousness. Malcolm starts his journey assimilated into white culture. Overtime, he grows to resent whites. By the end of the movie, he accepts white people and opens up his mind to the concept of racial equity and harmony. The progression is natural and poetic. The film addresses Malcolm's flaws and strengths with truth. Religion is another topic discussed within the film. Lee juxtaposes Malcolm's muslim faith with the systemic teachings of Christianity. Often, Lee showcases the practice of the islamic faith with grace. He also addresses the hypocrisy associated with organized religions in general. Religion is a core part of the film - and it never feels offensive, nor inauthentic. Largely, \"Malcolm X\" was written with a mature audience in mind. It opens discussion for the rational - yet leaves much room for interpretation and contrarian viewpoints.Overall, \"Malcolm X\" is the quintessential Black history film. It's unwavering in its portrayal of many ugly American truths. It's a visual monument to one of America's greatest historical figures. Undoubtedly one of Spike Lee's greatest contributions to cinema. It's Black high art that polishes the legacy of an icon - who built a bridge between race and religion By Any Means Necessary.",

If you didn't read the book or know too much about Malcolm X and how he accomplished the things he did and what he stood for, you would be pretty lost. BUT the film does an excellent job at reiterating the emotional impact of Malcolm's accomplishments and opinions in a powerful way. Spike Lee brings the viewer through Malcolm's journey starting with his life as a hustler. Lee does not dive to deeply into the fine details of this part of Malcolm's life but gives a good overview of the delusional world Malcolm lived. Lee's use of vibrant color, constant jazz, and the recurring theme of death throughout this portion of the film followed by his pivotal time in jail provides the viewer with a better understanding of how important his time in jail was. A few key scenes resonated with me:The dramatically low-key lighting in the solitary confinement scene portrays Malcolm at his lowest point; his disillusionment. The pan shot over the black inmates faces as they are being told of the atrocities committed by the white man in the prison courtyard. The final scene: Malcolm's assassination. The combination of the sound of Betty Shabazz's wailing, the omniscient editing, and the compilation of clips of Malcolm (not Denzel), Nelson Mendela, and students shouting \"I am Malcolm X!\" following was an amazing moment in the film. The emotion of that scene overcame you whether you welcomed it or not. Overall- great film. Watch it if you know a bit about Malcolm X. If you don't know anything about Malcolm X, get off your ignorant derri\u00e8re and learn something!",

It has become time for Washington to rise up to the level he has in Malcolm X again!

Which is OK when politicians address the masses convincing that the they have the only worthy cause at hand, however this is not proper for a movie.

            "content": "It's a biography showing how an Afro American subjected to ultimate discrimination was initially saved from the world of crime and prejudice by a \"missinterpreted\" Islam and became a leader to which a \"Nation of Islam\" was grown and a new perspective and respect gained to those once oppressed people.. However, this version of him was mislead into believing that prophet Muhammed (PBUH) was actually guiding him - resurrected from death and living amongst them as a black man. Consequently, all his charisma was directed against the whites believing that Islam came to empower blacks and that Allah's prophet was black and that it was time for them to rise after 400 years of suppression. His followers increased by time and his word became highly credible and this caused envy and divisions within this \"Nation of Islam\" where the so-claimed Muhamed started tensing things up with him after once appointing him to be his voice to the people. It was then that Malcolm started doubting the beliefs he taught and that this man to whom he was ready to sacrifice himself was no more than a hypocrite; therefore, he split from the group, publicly announcing his independence as a leader and his formulating an Islamic group of his own to which he would lead after fulfilling his pilgrimage duties. Nonetheless, his trip to Mecca was the actual light that lit his path back from where he was deviating. Once back at America, his preaches took a different direction and he started preaching of equality rather than supremacy, and it was then that he proclaimed his errors and tried to call for real peace. Unfortunately, it was too late.. The diversities within what was once one group calling for their rights to breathe the same air were exploded with the intrusion of power and the fight over the spotlight. Malcolm's verdict was now defined and he was assassinated in front of his family in one of his preaches in New York. However, his death that day was the birth of hope; it was a significance of how one man could rise from the dumps and choose to fall and meet his death so that others could forever value their gift of life and to search for truth rather than live blind folded under others' rules.",

Lee is known for having a very unique style of filming and his style is very well known. Denzel does a fantastic job of playing Malcom X and should have won an award for his performance. The film did a great job of matching up the book but I wish they would have talked more about his childhood because it seemed that was very important part of Malcoms life and that could shown you how he became the man he ended up being. I liked how when Malcom and Shorty who is played by Lee are walking out with their fancy suits it shows them as sticking out with their color while everything else is plain in the backdrop. Lee does a great job of showing Malcoms life from his days as a hustler in Harlem to his days as a minister for the Nation of Islam and to the final days and his brutal and tragic death. The film could have been a little bit shorter but it had to be long to show you how his life was. i would recommend this film to everyone and i would say that people of all ages should see it because it is a piece of American history",

            "content": "Spike Lee was right to say Malcolm X was \"the picture he was born to make.\" Lee directed a film in 1992, which in 2014 and as long as humans exist, will be prevalent in time. It allows the audience to witness the connectedness of the black community while also displaying the disunity. After a fantastical long opening shot with Malcolm parading through the streets of Harlem in his new and vibrant zoot suit the viewer is placed into a magnificent room with what seems to be at least a hundred black men and women dancing, carefree. The camera continually focuses on Malcolm, or another couple dancing, and then zooms out to see most or all of the room, as a whole. The energy and vast shot gives an enormous sense of unity. Similarly, in the beginning scenes of Malcolm coming to be apart of Elijah Muhammad's teachings in prison, the links between the black men with him become apparent. As Bibi's voice tells of the horrors the white men have committed and the reasons they must break away from them, the camera pans across countless black men's sorrowful faces laid over mournful music. The close ups powerfully demonstrate the true feelings, for the words being said, and the enlightenment they have received. In contrast the unity between the black community, the scene and moment in Malcolm's life which tells him he cannot be \"anything he wants to be\" is very effective. Malcolm's White teacher stands in the front of the row of desks Malcolm sits in. However, Malcolm is in the very last seat. The distance between the two seems to grow as the teacher scoffs at the idea of Malcolm becoming a lawyer and the cuts between the two reveal the many desks and space separating them.Most importantly, Lee portrays Malcolm as he truly was. He was not an advocate of violence, as many believe. This is presented best when he leads Muslims to the police station after one of their brothers was hurt and arrested. They march in twos and are militant, but reserved. The long shot confirms there is no violence about them, only the angry observers who joined and followed. When they received entry to see him and called an ambulance they then marched once again, peacefully. Although the film can seem long at times, the momentum never fails to pick up with quick cuts and gripping acting from Denzel Washington and the rest of the cast. No one's \"Black History,\" let alone American History is complete without the visual, sound, and knowledge that comes with this film.",

            "content": "**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**Spike Lee has beautifully captured the aesthetic essence of Malcolm X's journey throughout his life with his technical cinematic choices. Spike Lee has a gift of knowing how to draw audiences into the scene that he has beautifully crafted for them. In the beginning of the movie, he makes sure to give Malcolm's boisterous life as a hustler a dream-like luster by using many soft focus shots as well as soft lighting to really accentuate vibrant colors in the background and in the wardrobe of the characters. To highlight Malcolm's hustling lifestyle even further, many of the shots used contain constant movement, and upbeat music. Whether it be the camera moving or the subjects in the shot moving, there is always movement to make the audience feel like they're living this fast-paced life alongside Malcolm Little accompanied by a soundtrack to set the mood. However, Spike Lee throws the audience into a wall after Malcolm is arrested. Each shot becomes longer, the focus becomes sharper, and high-key lighting is used to painfully chisel out every expression on each character's face. This dramatic shift in aesthetic lets the audience know that this is where Malcolm Little begins his ascension to becoming Malcolm X. Up until Malcolm starts to run into some real adversity with the Nation of Islam, each shot moves with Malcolm in its focus to help portray his new focused and centered state of mind, his maturity. Once he reaches the point where he has become a target of the general public as well as the Nation of Islam, Lee uses low key lighting to produce shadows on the characters and their surroundings, making each scene more suspenseful leading up to Malcolm X's death. After Malcolm X is killed, Spike Lee chooses to bring the message of Malcolm X into a more contemporary scene, using children repeating the words \"I am Malcolm X\" straight into the camera, as well as a cameo of Nelson Mandela reciting some words of wisdom at the very end. Many may think that the ending of the movie is excessive, however I believe that Spike Lee does this on purpose to make sure that the legacy of Malcolm X resonates among his audiences by using the same methodology we are taught in school, \"If you say it/write it enough times, you'll remember it.\" Though I have read the book before watching the movie, I give it a 9 out of 10 based on Spike Lee's ability to take so much information about a great man's life, artistically compile it into a movie that is a little over three hours, and still convey an important message about Malcolm X's life. Well done.",

Although it does it very differently from the book, I would say it does a better job. The book is honest and helps you get to know Malcolm and understand his point of view, and why he is who he is. While the movie captures the emotion and shows what an inspirational figure Malcolm X really is. Spike Lee does a great job of staying true to the story, but at the same time you like Malcolm more in the movie. Lee uses a lot of Lowkey lighting in the first half of the movie and filters to give this Hollywood-Esq feel to the movie. Personally I did not find this effective and thought the movie lacked a lot of content at the beginning. The way his childhood flashbacks were showed was not effective as well. Quick transitions into them and very fast pacing during them. Its not until Malcolm goes to jail when the movie becomes alive. The intense natural lighting with the darks, reflects Malcolm's mood as he is lost in life and wonders what is next in life for him. Spike Lee's most noticeable technique is his very long movement shots. The shot were brother Bane is talking to the inmates in Jail outside was one of the best shots in the whole movie in my opinion. Its a long tracking shot going left to right, as he speaks to them. Its a medium shot that views only their face and some of their body language. It is very effective as you view how Bane's words affect these inmates. Although the first half was questionable, the second half of the movie does a spectacular job of recovering and I think you can easily look past it.",

            "review_title": "Transcends the Written Autobiography",
            "content": "Spike Lee brings several of the very important themes and ideas that appear in The Autobiography of Malcolm X into focus and to a new level in his epic biography Malcolm X. In the autobiography, as told to Alex Haley, readers typically only experience events through Malcolm's eyes as he goes through his every day life, seeing what Malcolm sees and hearing his thoughts. The film, on the other hand, transcends Malcolm's mind and not only gives viewers his take on the world but also provides perspectives and emotions from multiple points of view, which pushes viewers to a deeper understanding of Malcolm X's positions and more direct confrontation of the tensions of race conflicts in the USA. In the film, Lee spends the first portion of the movie glorifying Malcolm's hustler life through exaggerated composition to highlight the contrast between reality, shown in flashbacks, and the pretend world of the hustle. The characters' movements, the almost constant upbeat and jazzy non-diegetic music, the soft focus background, and the surrounding calm and happy colors with an almost orange filter almost make the scenes look unrealistic. Lee's creative use of this exaggerated composition helps to set up the delusion of the white world \"hustler Malcolm\" lives in. For instance in one scene, Washington (Malcolm) and Lee himself (Shorty) are running through the park enclosed by soft and happy colors and non-diegetic jazzy music with their conked hair and zoot suits, adopting white mainstream cultural influences with pretending to be \" Cops and Robbers\" and taking on the roles of white actors of the time. Lee's composition in these scenes purposefully contrasts with the reality of Malcolm's real, early-life experiences. The only time the viewers get a hint of the reality of Malcolm's actual past is when Lee cuts to choppy, fast, and somewhat confusing scenes flashback scenes. In these flashbacks the viewers get thrown into a direct contrast to the previous shots of the hustler life Malcolm was living and his future life as a Muslim minister. There is more low-key lighting and a darker, vintage filter, helping viewers understand that these shots are serious and realistic and they present what Lee wants the audience to understand that Malcolm is running away from. Moreover, the only time the non-diegetic sound (upbeat soundtrack) stops in the flashbacks and viewers are left with the somber feeling created by the uncomfortable diegetic sound. Spike Lee also does an amazing job of juxtaposing Malcolm's false hustler reality with the flashback of his father's death, an actual event. Viewers get a clip of a long angle and medium shot of Malcolm's father's battered and bloody face surrounded by low-key lighting except for the line of light coming from the train. The viewers see the fear and pain in his face as the whistle of the speeding train rushes toward him causing his demise. The use of these contrasting techniques serves to exaggerate the idea that Malcolm is living in a false world as a hustler. Likewise, later depictions in the film of Malcolm's life after jail, the shots, filters, and sound continue to contrast with Lee's use of them in the \"hustler days\" part of the film. Lee's use of these contrasting techniques is not simply to speed along the story for the purposes of fitting it into a movie. Instead, Lee masterfully uses the techniques to symbolically demonstrate that by attempting to live in a white man's world and being forced to respond to the systemic racism in society, Malcolm had to pretend to be something and someone he was not until he came to understand that he needed to fight that pressure. Overall, Lee's Malcolm X is extraordinarily effective in bringing The Autobiography of Malcolm X to life for viewers. Lee's techniques throughout the film evoke a strong emotional response and resonance for viewers that the written autobiography cannot.",

            "content": "While the unrelenting candor of The Autobiography of Malcolm X as told to Alex Haley is powerful and unmatched, Spike Lee's film Malcolm X establishes an emotional connection that was neglected in the book due to the poor quality of writing. Lee begins his film in Malcolm's teenage years and intersperses short, quick sequences illustrating memories from Malcolm's childhood with the now colorful, extravagant life he has gone on to lead as a hustler in Boston and Harlem. Lee's fast-paced recollection of Malcolm's childhood combined with the hazy filter Lee uses to film Malcolm's memories ultimately fails to encapsulate the authenticity of the horrors that occurred to Malcolm and his family as a child. Without a proper representation of Malcolm's past, Lee struggles to engender the feeling that everything in Malcolm's life was a result of prior events and that Malcolm's future was inevitable given the limitations imposed on him as a boy. On the other hand, Lee does a remarkable job of mirroring the transition in Malcolm's life when Malcolm is locked in his prison cell for a week. After using an assortment of colors throughout Malcolm's life as a hustler, Lee makes the entire screen black for this shot, forcing the viewer to only feel Malcolm's agony as he howls in pain. Then, Lee shines a sliver of light from above onto Malcolm, which parallels Malcolm's soon-to-be religious discovery of the honorable Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam. Lee's composition and colors from this point on match Malcolm's new somber and serious attitude. Lee's transition in the middle of film is effective and powerful. This success enhances the viewer's connection with Malcolm on an emotional level. Lee then takes on a more narrative tone until Malcolm is cast out of the Nation of Islam and makes his pilgrimage to Mecca. Lee illustrates the variety of races in Mecca, but uses extreme long shots throughout Malcolm's hajj to demonstrate the unity of Islam and to put things in perspective for Malcolm. Finally, the movie culminates with Lee's famous double dolly shot as Malcolm unknowingly walks to his death. While Malcolm himself is stationary, his surroundings are still moving, almost as if his head is floating in the air. This technique finally sends the message that Malcolm's future is subject to the events going on around him. Lee's juxtaposition of Malcolm's newfound empathy and the unfortunate timing of his death really allows the viewer to sympathize with Malcolm. Although Lee's film does not employ the same unrelenting honesty as Malcolm's autobiography, Lee's usage of several film techniques still successfully portrays Malcolm X and his quest for understanding.",

The events that take place throughout the film depict Malcolm's journey to becoming one of the most famous leaders in history. The film begins by glamorizing Malcolm's life as a hustler on the streets of Boston. Spike Lee's use of color and music in the night club scenes help embody the essence of the time period. The use of tracking shots, and long shots capture the energy of the city during this time. As the film progresses, viewers watch as Malcolm's life as a hustler is disrupted when he is sentenced to prison. When Malcolm refuses to state his identification number, he is thrown into solitary confinement by the prison guards. For the first time throughout the film there is no light in the scene where Malcolm is alone in solitary confinement. The loss of light helps enhance Malcolm's isolation from the world. After being released from solitude, Malcolm interacts with another prisoner by the name of, Baines. Baines introduces Malcolm to the Nation of Islam; however Malcolm is resistant at first. As Baines and Malcolm continue to converse about the Nation of Islam, and the nation's leader, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm slowly begins to embrace the Islamic faith. Baines shares his knowledge of Elijah Muhammad's wisdom, and informs Malcolm that Elijah Muhammad can lead Malcolm to the light. Once Malcolm is released from prison, he becomes a minister and spokesman for the Nation of Islam. Malcolm captures the attention of many people after joining the nation, and later decides to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca. It is in Mecca, where Malcolm experiences racial unity for the first time in his life. Many long shots are filmed in Mecca to visually showcase the unity, and acceptance of others that Malcom witnesses. Spike Lee ensures that every minute of this movie counts by specifically deciding the colors, music, events, camera angles, and editing that are used to create an inspirational documentary that tells the life of an inspirational and dedicated man by the name of Malcolm X.",

Malcolm X is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is amazing not only because of the performances that the actors gave, but because Spike Lee uses some techniques and makes some choices that turn this movie from a good one to an amazing one. The movie starts off when Malcolm is enjoying the life of a hustler, and Lee uses a soft focus and jazz soundtrack that is present in every scene to glorify Malcolm's exploits at this time in his life. The soft focus and constant jazz also make the movie feel just like some classic Hollywood ones such as \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and other movies from that time period. However, things take a turn for the worse and Malcolm ends up in prison. All of a sudden the shots become sharp and have a high contrast between light and dark and the jazz grinds to a halt leaving you to only hear diegetic sound. This sudden and turn towards the grittier side of movies really emphasises the importance of what is about to happen to Malcolm. The rest of the movie continues to be gritty and dark, but you never feel depressed or uncomfortable because of it. Lee does an amazing job at making Malcolm X's story something that not only everyone would enjoy, but something that everyone should see. So you are probably thinking why only 9/10 not 10? I will tell you why. The beginning of the movie was effective at making the rest of the movie seem more important, and making the viewer feel as though they have been hit in the face with reality at the same point that Malcolm did but the soft focus and constant jazz make it hard to watch and I did not like it at all. And that is the only reason that i think this movie is not perfect.",

In the scene where Malcolm and shorty are playing in the park, the scene begins with the camera floating directly above Malcolm and Shorty. and moving all the away above while lowering eye level to Malcolm's face. It was a long shot added just so the viewer sees the effort made in to putting together this film. Another reoccurring aspect of the film is when the color would change to black and white. The color would change when switching from on shot to another. When the white man comes to Malcolm's house, thy threw Molotov cocktails through the windows and the house caught fire. the camera crew came there and that's when the color changed to black and white. any time the color changes, that's when the camera crew would be following Malcolm at that time, not he camera crew from the Filmer's of the movie but the camera crew with the paparazzi and all that. spike lee did this because he wanted to put the viewer back in Malcolm's time where they did not have color television or anything like that.
