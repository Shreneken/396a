            "content": "After Fi, I started with a low expectation and continued with admiration. Hakan G\u00fcnday and Azra Kohen are not comparable to each other. There is no need to look for flaws in Sahsiyet. Thanks to Puhu TV, quality in the Turkish series sector has risen so much. Sahsiyet's story is a bit like Breaking Bad, a bit of a Dexter mix, much more different and much more intimate.Sahsiyet's greatest trump card; Behind the screen are two successful names such as Hakan Gunday and Onur Saylak. Hakan Gunday, one of the greatest writers that Turkish literature has recently released, writes the screenplay of Sahsiyet. The scenarios in each section are overly pleasing. Those who know their books, I am sure they felt this.The second biggest trump card in the series is the Haluk Bilginer factor. As for the Cansu Dere... Everyone has a prejudice against her. But I do not think it's bad. I did not see an exaggeration. Exceptionally lean, understated, with a moderate performance on display, without too much trouble. Only the character Nevra, a little too American. The Turkish police is like a Behzat \u00c7. Police office looks like the American Police Department in Sahsiyet. It's a very successful mini-series. I wish it was a few seasons. 10/10",

But then, I increased pace and completed the entire season in 2 days; 2 days because i needed some sleep so as to grasp and catch hold of the sequences.Sahsiyet gets my applause. It has well deserved cinematography, appeal, timing, and pace. It is slow at times, and yet thoughtful and decisive. Bravo its creators, director, and actors.The main lead, Agah, is impressive and quirky. Really, his timings at times made me into thinking like he was really suffering with Alzihmers. How well executed. The other actors also did a great job.Above all, the last two episodes had a dreadful atmosphere, and i think, that was something which sums up to all the reasons the firsts ten episodes left an impression on me; and definitely the other audiences who watched this show. Unsettling, nervebreaking and tear jerkers. Maybe through a fictional way, the creators wanted to showcase the brutal reality of our \"world\".Don't miss this if you love mystery, thrill, and an impeccable creativity.",

Agah Beyoglu's attitude of \"not even hurting the ant\" learns that his life is going to change, on the contrary it is just a summary of human being's evolution. Nevertheless, she never gave up on her characteristic of valuing women because the people she killed were from people who had been violent to women. Is it really a single diagnosis of Alzheimer's causing murder? Why do we like Agah even though he is a serial killer?",

These are the only negative critiques that I can say. Except these critiques, every part was totally flawless. I have finished this series in 3 days, it was so fast-moving.

Pretty much everything is revealed to us viewers except how will they catch him and more importantly- why is he doing this. The \"why\" will keep you glued to your seat, make you assume and connect these men in your head. And once you think you've got the hangs of it the story turns upside down and leaves you speechless. Seriously, I did not expect *that* at all\nThe finale is easily 11/10 but it takes a while to get thereAround first 5 or 6 episodes I found everyone who is not Agah very boring, almost a snooze fest which I have to go trough in order to understand what's going on. Especially Nevra, who seemed like your typical idealistic protagonist with added struggle of a woman in man's world. Agah carries that first half of the series, he's pretty funny guy actually. Follow him on his quest of revisiting old friends while Nevra slowly takes bigger and bigger role and very sharply becomes the focus of the story. Wait and see what all of those 53 similar looking men did to deserve the sticker on the forehead. You won't be dissappointed. I mean, you will detest them even if they're fictional but it makes a great story\nAvoid the spoilers like a plague and take the story as It goes. Warning -it's a lot. It's heavy, it's scary, it leaves a knot somewhere inside that hard to untangle. Because it is very much real. It certainly happened in the past,\nAnd it might as well be happening right now. And although this series ends on a positive note, justice isn't that common in the real world sadly.",

The writing in the series is phenomenal... one perfect crime drama with brilliant story, great screenplay, great direction, amazing cinematography, class soundtrack and top-notch acting by all the cast members. The framing, cuts end edits, the music, colours; all of them complement and support the setting beautifully. The performance from the whole cast is just flawless.In the whole series, I loved the character 'Nevra Elmas' perfectly portrayed by \"Cansu Dere\". She is one good person and a good cop; She's dedicated, intelligent, vulnerable and most importantly, a proper badass. Obviously, 'Ag\u00e2h Beyoglu' portrayed by \"Haluk Bilginer\" is phenomenal. He is impeccable in his role. The regular cat and mouse chase is made really captivating with is brilliant writing. Sahsiyet is fresh and original. The motive of the series is just superb. The storytelling is brilliant and I really loved how the series unfolds the mystery that has been maintaining from the first episode. And the last episode does justice for the whole series. It is a highly original and inventive story, which builds to a deeply affecting conclusion.The series is filled with emotions and a fascinating storytelling from Hakan G\u00fcnday directed by Onur Saylak.

            "content": "In Sahsiyet, an elderly ex-court official newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's resolves to act as judge, jury and executioner before he completely loses his memory. The story also follows a female police investigator who must confront her own troubled past to uncover the dark secrets that drive the criminal's motivations and actions.The show adroitly handles and presents topics like the difference between law and justice, repression of past trauma, discrimination against foreigners, and the inequality of the sexes. The script too deserves praise for effectively weaving together poignant emotional moments, subtly humorous conversations as well as thought-provoking soliloquies. The cast's acting is wonderful with Haluk Bilginer's portrayal of the troubled and conflicted lead protagonist deserving special mention. Moreover, the setting is very realistically constructed be that in the layout of the sets or the music chosen for the scenes, increasing the intensity of the depiction.Insofar as criticisms go, a lot of them could stem from my unfamiliarity with Turkish culture; after all, Sahsiyet is the first Turkish television show I have watched. Perhaps this is why many of the subplots and secondary storylines tended not to engross me - none of Zulal's insecurities, Deva's rebelliousness, or even Neyra's fumbling progress captivated me as much as Agah's morally questionable enactment of justice. Considering the premise and plot, the show also felt drawn out in parts and may have benefitted from a tighter half dozen episodes and a more satisfying conclusion. Furthermore, some suspension of disbelief was necessary to explain away aspects like the utter incompetence of the authorities, the lack of public knowledge of a secret shared by almost an entire town, and the neat wrapping up of all loose ends. Finally, the Alzheimer's disease condition was disappointingly used more for characterization instead of playing an integral role in the events of the narrative itself.To sum up, I consider Sahsiyet an intriguing drama highlighting the promise and potential of Turkish television. The mystery is suspenseful, the themes are mature, the acting is excellent and the setting is vivid. While the show does not quite deliver on its premise and has some forgettable B-plots, it still makes for an entertaining and gripping watch that can be appreciated by an international audience.",

The rest of the cast with their brilliant acting also lifted up the series.\nBut all in all, as a high powered serial killer drama, the show lost its essence after the 7-8 episodes. You can actually tell the episodes being stretched and the plot getting mixed up, story losing its ground. With the suspense opening in the last episodes, everything started to get mediocre except the dialogues which were the one constant good thing throughout the series.\nI would say it couldn't do the justice to the plot that was so beautifully woven.

            "content": "I wouldn't want to get carried away with 'Sahsiyet'. Its 12 hour-long episodes make it quite heavy-going. There's actually a great storyline which becomes clear at the end, but I think it could have been dealt with much more quickly (6 long or 12 short episodes, would surely be enough?). I also found the characters quite difficult to get along with, even the more sympathetic ones like the woman police detective and her journalist boyfriend. In short, I was bored by a lot of 'Sahsiyet'. I struggled on, partly because of the time I'd invested, and there was just about enough to pique my interest. The central idea is intriguing, a man going on a killing spree as he loses his memory through Alzheimer's. Meantime, a strong cast of actors try to make things work (not their fault the writing often wasn't good enough), there are high-end production values which 'wow' occasionally, and Istanbul, of course, always interesting. Did anyone else notice how good the soundtrack was? There's clearly something about Turks and music, film makers who understand how to use it in drama. The series didn't really hang together for me, despite all these great 'elements'. The tempo is just too slow, not enough editing and cutting to sharpen the focus and heighten tension as events take place.Anyway, I'm glad I stuck with 'Sahsiyet' because it came good at the end. Look out for the amazing aquarium scene, a visual 'feast' and very surreal, typifying the best parts of this series. Just a long time getting there.",

            "content": "If I had to say something positive about this series, the first thing that comes to mind is the intro, which is incredibly atmospheric and visually stunning, although it hardly fits the series. Another positive thing is the music - it is varied but broadly speaking great, much of it being synth-based and reminiscent of something like \"Half-Life\"; however that cyberpunkishness, like the intro, doesn't feel like it quite belongs.This is a crime drama about a serial killer, where the murderer is the protagonist and the cops hunting him down are the secondary protagonists. However, even though the killer is with whom we spend the most time, the audience remains in the dark as for his motives and reasons until - literally - the last two episodes. Sure, we get some breadcrumbs in the meantime, but the logic of the narrative feels a bit disjointed, where we have no idea what Agah, the murderer, is after, and the cops follow up on leads quite arbitrarily. The whole plot is honestly a bit arbitrary, and a few plotlines just end without resolution or explanation. Others end with some explanation, but quite unsatisfactorily.The production values are quite cheap at times, and continuity is dreadfully overlooked: in the worst case, a character might warp from one side of the room to another from shot to shot, all within the same conversation. The at times just awful camerawork makes it even more confusing (seriously, almost half of the shots don't seem to have any particular reason behind them, as if the camera was placed on whatever spot a fly happened to land in the room). The series also suffers a bit from a certain prudishness, where they want to tease the audience with erotic shots of attractive female characters the way them western series do sometimes, but the most they can show is a bra, if that. Finally, the acting is hit or miss - while it's difficult to judge while watching with subtitles, quite a few scenes left me with a raised eyebrow or a felling of cringe instead of the desired emotion (ex. Agah's breakdown about the phonecall at the automechanic's).With all that said, the actors are generally charismatic and enjoyable to watch, and as a person quite distant from Turkish culture, getting a slice of life from Turkey and learning/unexpectedly recognising some Turkish words is an interesting thing by itself.(I've watched this series in Turkish with English subtitles)",

            "content": "When I first saw the cast and Onur Saylak as the director, I really had high expectations, but this series was far beyond anything I expected. This show is totally Turkish in the sense that it is based on a more complex view of Tirkish culture, moving beyond stereotypes.\nWhen one thinks of Turkish tv series, there are so many stereotypes that come to viewers' minds: family drama, intrigue, romance, tears, patriarchal marriage/household settings (Ottoman harem, traditional/modern big house located somewhere in Anatolia or Istanbul) that more or less openly promote male polygamy and female chastity, tears, guns, mafia, more romance, more intrigue, more guns, changed siblings, more tears and so forth. Yes, a standard episode lasts for about 100 minutes. And there is this longing for/hopelessness about seeing Turkish productions made in any of the Western (by Western, here I mean largely Hollywood) genres varying from action to crime, fantasy, science-fiction, horror, mystery, suspense and so on. Longing for: understandable given the situation. Although there have been many successful offbeat shows over the years (Behzat \u00c7 and Leyla ile Mecnun, to give two most popular examples), well, they largely remain marginal digressions. And then, there is this disappointment -and a mostly well-grounded one- that many Turkish viewers express on seeing the few attempts to produce Western/Hollywood style shows: we just can't do it, it looks really odd and pretentious when we take on those genres or themes. Nothing original. Doesn't suit our culture well. Then what suits our culture? Surely, it's not guns and polygamy dressed as marriage or intrigue? People sitting in big and fancy houses thinking all day nothing but pulling the ground off under their enemies' feet? Or shouldn't we perhaps leave those Hollywood dreams, which are more often than not full of stock elements and clich\u00e9s of their own, and start looking for something different?\nThis is where this show really strikes the viewer with its freshness. It reflects the complexity of contemporary Turkish society with characters who have psycho-social depth and variety (going again beyond eastern-western which too quickly turn into modern-traditional or secular-conservative binarisms) The values of chaotic cosmopolitan life are depicted with as much intricacy as those of the closed small town community. Universal themes like injustice, oppression and violence, core family dynamics and trauma are dealth with care, avoiding clich\u00e9s and never without humour too. Great acting, great scenes and great screen writing.",

            "content": "Visually stunning, character driven story is compelling, score of the movie is eurhythmical to thrilling twist. Persona is definitely worth your time.The main problem of the Turkish series based demographically on culture. People do not know much about modern Turkey. Their language does not come from any other umbrella term, it is original. Their religion once was shamanism. They are basically Asian nomads. But with the advent of settled life, Turks have changed and built empires. Ottoman Empire was one of the mightiest. You can even find traces in the Shakespeare's plays (e.g. Merchant of Venice), especially military power of Ottoman Empire is often praised. During 17. Century that empire was, most probably, the strongest of the world. Either way, age of empires is long gone, but descendants of the empire thought the world still revolves around them. Nonetheless, modern Turkey's population is only world's %1. People of Turkey do not seem to realize this now. Therefore, this misconception of \"us against the world\", find reflections in their works as well.Considering all these, Turkish shows commonly remain local. However, Persona is an exception. Rather than Haluk Bilginer's marvelous performance, the script has something universal this time. I think, this universality of the show is the most important aspect of it. Because, that's what distinguishes it from the common Turkish drama. In Persona, you can discover and experience death in a unique way, from a perspective of fading mind. So, if you think about it, are not our memories what make us; and thus, dying is not knowing anymore. This notion is both metaphorically (sickness) and physically (murders) embroidered. I definitely loved this concept.The second most significant value of the show is on the other hand, comparatively local. Even though, we see the modern face of Istanbul, there is a serious \"man-spreading\" issue going on. Despite all arrogant men's behaviors, we witness a young, independent woman's fight against them. This is not a first world country's problem anymore. Nevertheless, superficiality is. Young woman's struggle is supported by the colleagues of her, the media and men. However, do they really support her? Of course not.If you want to see a dark side of Istanbul, making an eerie voyage to walled city accompanied by a beautifully delivered picture with a compelling script, just watch this mini series and finish it at a weekend.",

The story itself is so captivating. It is about a 65 years old retired man who was diagnosed by his doctor as Alzheimer and knew that he would start to forget everything slowly. He decides to do the thing that he has always wanted to do but couldn't do because of his lack of courage! Killing guilty people... The story maybe comes to you familiar because we've seen some movies with the story similar to this one. In the beginning, I also thought like that but the handling of the story is really different and so convincing. I couldn't see any hero, extraordinary character in the story. The killer has a lot of weaknesses contrary to classical killer movies in which there is a killer who think every detail and a police (detective) who solves everything. The police reactions were totally the Turkish police reactions. When they experience a this kind of situation the Turkish police would give this reactions. In the movie, it is also emphasized that serial killer murder is an unexpected situation in Turkey. Every reactions that police and media gave is so natural. I felt as if I was in the film! Additionaly, the main message of the series is also very strong and you can not clearly see what is the point of all this murders until the end of the series. It has a very surprising ending.But I have some negative points about the film for example female main character Nevra (Cansu Dere). Her role is really important in the series. She is not only the main police who is trying to catch the killer but also the one who is in the center of the killing story. Maybe, this character is more important than Agah (Haluk Bilginer) for the story and the message of the film. Basically, while Agah was the brain of the story Nevra should have been the soul of the story. Nevertheless, I couldn't get this strong emotion from Nevra character although her story was perfectly written by scriptwriter. She should have been able to make us to drop our tears for her in the final scene. It was a very strong scene. If we had seen the remarkable performance by Cansu Dere like Haluk Bilginer's this series could have been one of the best in its category.But overall I advice you to watch this series if you haven't.

I only could not get a lot into the story of Nevra, Ates, and Tolga (I did not like the acting but they also were not bad but I just could not internalize them). But I understand those type of stories make the series sell to different audience also.\nThe names of characters all mean something, they are not given randomly. This makes the story more epic.\nThey show Agah representing conscious, somewhat snob, wise Istanbul gentlemen as one generation. They show Nevra, Firuz, Sebnem, Vural, Sefa as confused, somewhat lazy to fight for life and good, irresponsible (always accusing something on problems in life) as another generation (people in their 30s May think and can understand, maybe this is another thing that comes with age and this generation as late puberty).\nAnd there is the new generation with Deva, Suveyda and the girl at the park which has a totally different look into life, somewhat senseless, with loss for fear and pity coming with loss of respect to people ( as oldies say), values, culture.\nSo I found this series recommendable to anyone who likes thinking but not only after reset of their mind and spend only time.\nUnfortunately this is why such stories do not sell in TV but cheap and shallow series sell.\nI also congratulate Onur Saylak as a director unfortunately I could not stand any of the series he acted in (not because of his acting but the shallowness I mentioned in the series).

The others didn't have any chance and gave their best nevertheless. In some scenes, I could not shake off the feeling that the casting maybe could have been better - but since I am not in this industry - who am I to judge.. still.. the grandson would have had more potential and also the main female part could not express all that she was supposed to. But to be fair, in the final episode, she took her chances given and did not waste them.Not much I can complain about the plot - it is well written and executed, finally there are people who know how things are done.There was one change in pace in the 7th and 8th episode and I think it was intentional in order to pick and wrap up all open questions and twists happening towards the great finale.Watchable.",

            "content": "Let's broadcast the series series of the famous actress Onur Saylak, whose script was written by Hakan Gunday and whose directorial debut More was more. The series, which touches one of the bleeding wounds of our country, was appreciated with its original and innovative style and reached high viewing rates.Agah Beyoglu (Bilginer), who is in his 60s, is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. As everybody knows, patients who progress with gradually increasing forgetfulness do not remember what they are doing in the advanced stage of the disease and do not even know their closest relatives. When Agah Beyoglu realizes that his situation is inevitable, he begins to commit murder, trusting that he will forget. Nevra (Cansu Dere), on the other hand, can be struggled with prejudices and humiliations related to a pre-breed, and works for the murders that are required by the killer personally.Personality does not count as a serial killer story if Agah Bey is taken to use psychopathic personality traits that killed his victims with a rational aim. Agah Bey is a very original and well-written character, from colorful socks to his cold attitude towards his daughter and his measured kindness towards the opposite sex. Even the highlighter, rebellious explanation Hakan Gunday occasionally feeds into the scenario becomes paternal, natural and lovable from Bilginer's mouth, but does not lose them either. Undoubtedly, Haluk Bilginer.Unfortunately, there are some serious inconsistencies in the story of Agah Bey. The way that judicial records and evidence were obtained, the murder and the corpse transported inside the apartment, the unnecessary effort to get the fingerprint right next to it, the forgotten car, the encountered victim are the first ones that come to my mind. Moreover, Alzheimer's disease does not forget much until the last two episodes where you are Agah Bey.The story flows through the commissioner Nevra, where he is rechargeable. The details of being the only female police officer at the murder table are extremely well captured, but the scenes that tell Nevra about the torments made are as if a bit exaggerated. Just like Agah Bey's side, there are disruptions in the sense of plot and the disorganization in which there are many characters in detective cases. Necip Memili was a step up with his competent acting, despite his short time in these parts, which portrayed Commander-in-Chief Tolga. Cansu Dere is in my decision for some criticized evaluation because he is behind the rechargeable experienced cast. Nevra, as she interpreted, is an indecisive, insecure, tired of escaping, dull character. As for the side stories, the story of Ates (Metin Akd\u00fclger), who has a lot to say on the idealism of journalism and can be convincing to start shortly in romantic terms, finds the goal.Agah Bey's daughter Zuhal (Sebnem Bozoklu) and her granddaughter Deva (Recep Usta) used to hide herself, N\u00fckhet Hanim (Senay G\u00fcrler)It emphasizes Agah Bey's mentality, coolness and sociopathic quality. Although Black Mirrorvari has good scenes with his move, the series is a bit up in the air because it doesn't have time to focus on this story. When we look at the general, although all of them are played by master actors, the series, which contains many characters, has difficulty focusing while keeping a lot of time with these side views and stories, and the solution of the event necessarily leaves the last two sections. You change the great reason of the development of H\u00fcmeyra's great Flemish, that M\u00fcjde Arin, Sebnem Bozoklu, Senay G\u00fcrler, Selim Ileri and H\u00fcseyin Avni Danyal are acting with their acting.The personality is very original, detailed, and very creative in color use and works extremely well on the eyes. It is not as effective as cinematography in fiction. In my opinion, the scenes that briefly describe two independent events and that you choose one after another are necessary, not dynamic, but tiring. The original generics of the series that will bring stones to the foreign series, where it is very attentive, deserves praise.With his strong pen, Hakan G\u00fcnday signs his country's distorted point of view, neighborhood pressure, choose justice, immediately using his share, hypocrisy, favoritism and corruption, honesty, a bag of honesty, how the arm of the hand of justice is tied. However, some scenes scrutinize the muse of experienced actors and impress you, some scenes are just for advancing stories. The script contains realist to expect him to catch the same momentum on stage in the series, but this difference between the scenes of the Personality is perhaps a bit more pronounced as some episodes raise the bar a lot.The story we read in the newspapers, which is linked to a very sensitive subject that is branded, examines but ends with a questionable final. Personality says: Justice and law are different things. What do you call justice? Self-defense. Revenge is a late self-defense ...In fact, I think that the personality's point of view and affirmation on the son of the series is quite problematic, in particular, to use the choice of a solution for his son, his rightful criticism, his very good determination, not the individual justice, but the ability to run the system correctly.Despite everything Figures just extraordinary Haluk Bilginer revive protagonist is fun and it creates bile difference with image management, a very different vision, not exactly the sequence in Turkey heralds can say with complacency. It is highly recommended for those who want to face and catch a crime story that tells about the first serial participant in our TV series history.",

Some characters, events and situations are not realistic at all. That will be more apparent of course for those audience who know how things work in Turkey, especially in Istanbul. Unnecessary social messages, baseless philosophical remarks can be found throughout the story. It was entertaining nevertheless. It would not be so for me without Haluk Bilginer's performance though.",

If you are someone who cares about realism like me, you may have a concern and say \"I hope they won't turn someone who should be demented into a superhero.\"\nNow the spoiler part: They didn't. It was very well explained, all events took place logically and the mystery of the incident remained hidden until the last moment. They did a really good job! The plot did not disappoint me at all.I was unhopeful of the possibility of things like; the way the killer is murdering being stupid and unoriginal, the-where it came from is unclear-clues, the speed of the detectives solving the incident, the killer being too obvious, the killer being too irresistible, the killer's motive being absurd, and maybe the plot crumbling towards the end. Yet, none of them happened and it was really the opposite...\nI just don't like the fact that all the female characters in the series were wounded, broken and vulnerable. I expected a strong and self-complete woman mentor. For example Nevra's mother Nesrin was poor in character and acting of it was worse (even if M\u00fcjde Ar is one of the oldest actresses in Turkey).So the acting was almost perfect, Haluk Bilginer (Agah) and Cansu Dere (Nevra) were brilliant! I did not like Metin Akd\u00fclger (Ates), M\u00fcjde Ar (Nesrin), and Sebnem Bozoklu (Zuhal) at all, their characters seemed unnecessary and unexplained to me. For example Ates's death was realistic, but unnecessarily traumatic.I like the locations and shots and scenes from Istanbul, it was on point and not tourist compeller. I like the costumes, Agah and Feza's are my favorites. Dialogs and monologues are intelligently written, I like them so much.The ending was good. I don't understand why Nevra had a son, who was the father, if it was Ates then it could be more apparent. Also some questions remained; \"what happened to the fans of murderer, did his daughter find out about it, what happened to his daughter after returning to her abusive husband...\"Still, congratulations to Onur Saylak and rest of the team for making the best Turkish crime story ever.",

He is amazing on all his acts .And i cannot help myself to stop saying how much lack of act the Nevra character has,why so?It is not enough to create a perception for just the main character,the rest of the cast need more details ,too.What's more,description of the place related to all events happening for should be more detailed instead of being a symbol.Generally i liked this tv series and it gives remarkable hope for Turkish productions,it is worth to watch because it is more than just a serial killer movie,it is more like a psychonarration.",
