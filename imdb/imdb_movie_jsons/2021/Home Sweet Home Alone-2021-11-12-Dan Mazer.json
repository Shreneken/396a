First off the kid was awful the character is so un likeable what a brat. The bandits are not really bandits there just stupid people. The supporting characters are also bad they try so hard to be like the original characters. The plot is the worse there's no character development. The effects are so bad too at night you can tel it's cgi. The traps are also so bad. Just an awful film.",

            "content": "It may end up looking better than both the 4th and 5th adaptation (yes there are 6 of these movies now), but Home Sweet Home Alone lacks any charisma, wit, or charm that made the original films so enjoyable and ends up feeling like an incredibly pointless and quite dated forced reboot comedy. The first thing that sticks out to me so clearly about this film is how painfully unfunny it is. Almost every minute of this film they try so hard to make each joke work and nothing ever lands, and instead your stuck watching the awkwardness unfold slower and slower until you can hardly stand to take it anymore. The actors are thankfully better than the last two adaptations, with some big names to star, however that doesn't mean they are by any means good in their roles- and again feels like the film missed a major opportunity. So many huge comedic stars, you think you would be able to get one laugh out of them, but sadly not. Pete Holmes and Ellie Kemper deserve better than this. The film is decently filmed, hardly feeling stale or fake like the forced Christmas atmosphere of the last two flicks, but despite the snowy setting and some decent shots- there is little to be joyful about in this miserable adaptation. The script and story is down right diabolical at times, hurtful, and just sad to watch. Not to mention lead child actor Archie Yates is justb a total brat and honestly makes me wonder who the hell we were supposed to root for throughout this film. In the end, Home Sweet Home Alone takes the franchise up a very slight notch, but it is obviously no where close to as good as the first 2 films, or even the third. Its forced sense of humor and misuse of talent should be a learning point for many Hollywood films here on- simply on how to not make a star-studded comedy. It's about as disappointing as they come, and as forgettable and frustrating as a film can possibly be.My Rating: 1.5/10.",

They could head in so many directions and even use original casting to bring the franchise back but once again they've dug up an old title and made a hollow, soulless movie.. it looks and feels like a low budget sitcom. Director, cast and production all just dreadful. File this one under \"should not have happened\" but again in todays industry its about quantity not quality. Everyone involved got paid well but they'll probably regret doing this one later on in their careers..",

The Buzz cameo is kinda great, though.",

            "content": "It's hard to really rage over HOME SWEET HOME ALONE because I am 99% convinced Disney never intended for this thing to be good or even an alternative to the original HOME ALONE. They needed more content for the Disney + subscription service, no matter how insipid or cheap, and so here we are.There's really not much to say about it-- it looks cheap, the acting is bad, and the writing is beyond hope. They try twisting on the usual formula by making the burglars sympathetic but this actually works against what has made the original HOME ALONE so popular over the last 30 years. Harry and Marv were absolutely in the wrong, and they were at the bare minimum a threat should they catch Kevin (I absolutely believe Joe Pesci when he threatens to bite that kid's fingers off), so all those gloriously violent booby trap sequences are way more fun. Here, my sympathy is with the thieves, who receive far more development than the main character, so it isn't fun watching them get hurt.Also-- and this might be just me-- but is anyone else sick of the thick layers of Joss Whedon-esque irony that suffuses so many American movies now? It was funny and fresh in small doses years ago, but it's gotten old already. The dialogue in this movie is made even more obnoxious by the fact that everyone, from the kids to the Gen X adults, talk like stereotypes of millenials/Gen Z-ers-- you know, \"Oh wow, we left the kid home alone, hashtag reboot.\"",

            "content": "\"Home Sweet Home Alone\" isn't just the one of the worst titles in the series, it's one of the worst films in the seriesLet me start off with the good. There is some decent comedy sprinkled here and there. Archie Yates give's a good enough performance, but doesn't come close to being as good as Macaulay Culkin. The two burglars are also kinda funny, and I liked how you kinda sympathize with them.Aside from that though this a very dull movie that features boring characters, and weird pacing. This movie steals many things from the original, but never does anything with them. Also the kid in the movie while not badly portrayed is very unlikable. He isn't given enough character to make him interesting, and he's kinda the villain of the movie. Everything here feels like a carbon copy of the original. Also the trap sequence is very unsatisfying. They feel mean considering that we kinda sympathize with these people. Besides the trap sequence is like 15 minutes. That's it. It takes an hour for the movie to finally start, but then we get kinda boring traps. And finally this movie basically isn't even a sequel. The only reason is cause Buzz from the original makes one cameo, but honestly he doesn't even need to be there. He's in the move for like 3 minutes.Overall \"Home Sweet Home Alone\" isn't the worst of the series, but it's definitely one of the most dull. It has slow pacing, dull characters, strange story decisions, and just a lack of true joy that it was just really bad.",

If i had great ideas, hollywood should have them to. Come on the classic movie can never bee done again with the same story but different actors as they have made Hone alone 3,4 and 5.

            "content": "The original two Home Alone movies that starred\nthe charismatic Macaulay Culkin and the legendary Joe Pesci have been staples of Christmas movies now for more than a generation of children and adults alike. The central concept of a child being left at home and enjoying the freedom while at the same time having to stop his house from being robbed by two wannabe thieves trying to hit it big in the very nice neighbourhood. The second movie takes the core concept and twists it and has Kevin McCallister alone in New York City, the stakes are raised and the bumbling theives are back to exact there revenge on Kevin. The films are also peppered with feel good moments and interesting side characters and lessons about caring for your family.So why make another movie??? What made the original movies so good was that the stories were unique and special at thr time. Also they had many excellent actresses and actors that brought the idea to life.... The story has been told. Nothing unique to the core story comes from this new movie. The only original characrer it has is Buzz who was a minor character before (and he was good)..... One can say that yes this movie uses new tricks that Kevin wouldn't have had in 1990. Yet just changing up that alone doesn't warrant a new movie and the story is nowhere near as good as the original two. You would wonder why Disney doesn't try to create something new and special for new generations of kids to hold on to. Instead of recycled ideas that weren't requested by annyone. So 1 out of 10... I don't blame the actors and actresses here. They're ok at their portrayal of the characters. But regardless the story underneath is like a thinly gold plated copper ring while the true 24 carat gold movie came out in 1990. Just avoid this movie, watch the amazing originals like I do each year or see some amazing content from elsewhere.",

All they did was have different actors and bad acting with the traps not making sense.So now we have the 6th movie in the Home Alone series called Home Sweet Home Alone (Home Alone 6), and I thought it was...I thought this movie wasn't that good, which is weird when it has good actors and at least it has some good scenes but that was overthrown by bad moments.The movie is mostly focused on the couple that is trying to steal back a valuable heirloom thinking the main kid stole it from them, but the more you focus on them the more you feel bad for them because of the problems in their life.The main kid who is home alone and setting up the traps in the house is played by a good actor, but they make the kid really unlikable when he is hurting the couple with the traps even though they aren't that bad.The traps are creative and interesting, but when the couple are being hurt and effected by them you just feel bad for them and it makes it hard to watch seeing them in pain.They made the robbers played by good actors seem like the good guys and the main kid as the bad guy, I don't understand why they did that.Other than there being some references to the original I didn't really find it funny or that much entertaining.

It doesn't give you a clear hero and villain which can be good but I don't know if that was the writer's intention. It's just like muddy. The main kid is an absolute brat. I would have left him home alone. And the \"Villains\" are decent people.The type of story telling that I hate the most is \"whoops! It was all a big misunderstanding\" because when it's over you feel like you just wasted your time. If people had made \"human\" decisions to begin with the film wouldn't have had to happen so it seems like it was all for nothing. It's like full of air. Which it's a kids movie so I can't complain too much.The ending is really sickly sweet which isn't my thing. I know that makes me sound harsh but I just don't love it when an ending is too saccharine. And like I said, the ending feels like you wasted an hour and a half because the issue could have been resolved in like 10 minutes.The acting is fine and there was thought put into the script. I could feel Mikey Day in the script, if that's a good thing I don't know. But I could definitely hear him in it.It's probably fine for kids, they might laugh when people fart in it?

Now I gave the story credit for trying to be different, and not be a carbon copy of the first film, and. Ellie Kemper and Rob Delaney play a good comedic team pretty well, has a couple trying to save there family home. But the kid Max played by Archie Yates, is just unbearable and unlike Kevin, no ways wants to root for him. But not Yates fault, just how he was written. Aisling Bea doesn't really give off much has Max's mother unlike Catherine O' Hara, seems like she is sleepwalking through this.Jokes don't really hit, trap gags just become reminders that you've watch them in better movies, and Max's family are just there no other reason, unlike the first two.

Another reason was that I had already watched all the previous movies of \"Home Alone\" and except the two first original movies all the other were simply average or even below average. The direction which was made by Dan Mazer was not the best but at least he tried to connect his movie with the original \"Home Alone\" movie of 1990. The interpretation of Archie Yates who played as Max Mercer was simple but good while the rest of the cast did not reach their potential but even if they would I doubt that they could save this movie.

What made the original \" Home Alone\" great was Catherine O' Hara, she showed a real genuine love to get home to her son. Yes, this had the same cookie cutter plot, without believing that mother really wants to get to Chicago.Home Alone, original, was not a ' great\" movie by any standard, but it is iconic.

            "content": "Was I expecting anything from 'Home Sweet Home Alone'? Not really but I felt an obligation to see it. That's how we are in this endless parade of nostalgic revisits. I wanted it to succeed because I love the original 'Home Alone'. It's a cliche to say but I never miss it around Christmas. It's hard to say where 'Home Sweet Home Alone' goes wrong (or for that matter where the classic original went right). 'Home Sweet Home Alone' is a tired retread that goes through the motions but that isn't the most offensive thing about it. I actually hate the new things that it tries even more than any of the blatant cynical nostalgia.It's hard to dissect why 'Home Alone' works so well. It's a movie that really shouldn't because it is so outlandish and contradictory in the emotional appeals to the audience. We get brutal slapstick and over the top humor and yet never does it interfere with the grounded appealing characters. It is funny and bizarre and heart warming. I imagine it's very tempting to think that you can rip it off. 'Home Sweet Home Alone' certainly tries in a half hearted way. It thinks that the John Williams motifs, the traps, and the gooey holiday sentimentality is what makes a 'Home Alone' movie. There's no earnestness or honesty here though. The entire cast spends the movie grinning and gawking at the audience as if they are in on some giant joke. \"Hey, look at us! We're doing 'Home Alone'! Isn't it funny to remember?\" No, it isn't. I'd much rather watch the original. They even do the meta commentary about pointing out how reboots suck and are never as good as the original. Yes, you're right Disney. Why spend all this time advertising how you have no passion for the material in the middle of the movie you are producing?This approach to the classic material is bad but if it had just been a carbon copy the film would have just been forgettable. The problem is the development of our new generation of bandits and how they contrast with the \"hero\". Ellie Kemper and Rob Delaney star as the McKenzies, a couple who are in dire financial straits during the holidays while their rich relatives cruelly shove their good fortune down their throats. The McKenzies are about to lose their house when they find out they have a priceless doll in their collection that can save them. Enter Archie Yate's Max Mercer who supposedly steals the doll before his family leaves him home alone in 2021 (with cellphones, the internet, and post-9/11 airport security) I do not want to pile down on Yates who is only a child and gave a great performance in 'JoJo Rabbit. I will say that he is completely wrong and too old for this material and that he is poorly directed by Don Mazer. Culkin was spunky as Kevin McCalister but he was never obnoxious. Max supposedly steals the doll and thus the plot is set in motion. The thing that saves 'Home Sweet Home Alone' from a turkey rating is that I like the McKenzies and the performances. Kemper especially is lovable and sympathetic. The Mercer's are extravagantly rich and live in a giant castle. Max doesn't need any ingenuity or cleverness to put his traps together, the apps and expensive equipment do it for him. And so the movie boils down to a rich spoiled kid torturing a family trying to do right by their kids at Christmas.How tone deaf can you possibly get Disney?I don't know how to resurrect 'Home Alone'. It probably shouldn't be resurrected. I won't be watching whatever comes next unless they bring back Culkin, Pesci, and Stern. I'm sure even that would be a failure but if you have to create a cynical nostalgia trip then bring back who I have nostalgia for. Although if there were to be a sequel I'd love to see the McKenzies sue the Mercers...",

            "content": "Sadly this movies biggest fault is also its biggest draw. I can't say the trailer made me excited for this film, but it was the names attached that did. The movie stars Rob Delaney and Ellie Kemper as the robbers (both of whom are extremely hilarious) Archie Yates fresh off of his role in Jojo Rabbit, Aisling Bea from Living with Yourself. Not to mention Pete Holmes, Kenan Thompson, Chris Parnell, Timothy Simmons, and even bringing back Devin Ratray shows some level of fun for the franchise. However what I was most excited about for this film, were its writers. Mikey Day and Streeter Seidel have killed it on SNL for years as both a cast member and writer respectively, so it's safe to say they know humor, penning the David Pumpkins Sketch, Rap Song, and even the Close Encounters bit. The movie however squanders all of its potential with the most simple of decisions. Taking focus off of the kid and sympathizing with the robbers. On paper this is not necessarily a terrible idea, it's also different and new, but the issue is it ruins who we are supposed to root for and watching good people get hurt purely on a misunderstanding can be funny but it grades after a while. Because of this the film isn't exactly cut and paste but we also lose the charm of Home Alone by taking out the most simple of formulas. The characters are bland and the story is the same. I hate faulting the film because I love the talent behind it, and I just love Home Alone at Christmas time. You won't lose any holiday cheer from this film, but take my advice just stick to the originals, there classic and fun. I just wish this film could've been the same.",

            "content": "(Minor tiny spoilers mainly to set up the would-be plot of this...)My expectations for this film were lower than dirt anyway but I watched it. If I wound up liking it, then I would say so. Because I can even say that I like \"Home Alone 3\" a little bit while acknowledging that it's mediocre at best. Prior to watching this I've only seen the first three movies. It should've stayed that way. I'll start with the few commendable things about it. I thought the acting was fine by everyone. Mentioning Archie Yates separately, he was solid as the lead. Or was he the lead? You'll see what I mean in a bit. And lastly, I did laugh at one of the dumb set-ups towards Rob Delaney's character involving a VR headset because it was so stupid to where the payoff just admittedly made me laugh. Oh, another lastly: BUZZ! Now here's where we shift gears. This is the fourth Home Alone film that I've seen in full out of the now six films and it is far and away the worst out of the entire bunch. Nothing that I am getting ready to say is me trying to look through \"nostalgia goggles\" or whatever the correct term may be. I just didn't enjoy this at all. I mentioned Home Alone 3 in my title for this because of three reasons. Reason #1: Despite its reception, I always liked it as a kid and don't mind it much now (the original is king, of course). #2: The protagonists in that film and this film aren't Kevin, but Alex was still a more likeable character than Max is by miles. And #3: IT HAD UNSYMPATHETIC VILLAINS, JUST LIKE THE FIRST TWO!!!!!! In fact, why even bother calling these two villains at all? They're really not. Ellie Kemper and Rob Delaney play a married couple named Pam and Jeff who are going through hard financial times and need to sell their home because of it. They have these dolls, and when they find out one of them is worth a lot of money they intend to sell it so they won't have to put their house on the market. But when it goes missing, they believe that Max stole it. So their intentions are to break in to get it back. Their actions are still wrong, but they acted only because they kind of had to. So even though these are good people breaking in, Max assumes that they're not (I don't blame him to be honest because they're intruding). And he misinterpreted something that he hears them say so that leads him to believe they're a threat. Honestly, my thoughts are jumbled with this movie I hate it that much. I sympathized with our two \"thieves\". That is a huge problem in of itself. It's not fun to watch the main character setting up traps and stuff hurting people when you feel bad for the people, especially when the movie spends so much time setting up their plight. That's what I meant when I questioned the lead status of Archie Yates in the movie. Pam and Jeff get a lot of screen time. Jeff's brother brings his wife and their kids to spend Christmas with them in their house, and they don't know about their financial situation. Didn't like their characters, especially Jeff's sister-in-law Mei. She's annoying but I disliked her especially when she completely undermines Pam's authority in front of her daughter at one point when she wants an expensive dress that they can't afford to pay for, so she buys it. And I can already hear people going \"People always say that they want something different, and then they complain about it when they get it\". For starters, when people say that they usually don't mean unnecessary remakes. Also, different does not automatically make it good, and it's not that different other than humanizing the would-be antagonists. I liked them more than the main kid. Back to Max, he's the worst front man in the series for me. Kevin was smart, charming, and a little bratty but in a more likeable way. I don't blame Archie Yates for that for a second, and that's not me trying to give him a break. I fault the material. His \"moment\" for missing his family isn't even earned to me. It feels like they just came around to having him miss his parents because that happens in the original film, and they took so much time to focus on Pam and Jeff that they had to remember to do that in this movie. And I didn't like Max's family either. Now, I said Max has parents, as in two of them. This movie seems to forget that an awful lot. He has a father. He's barely in the film. You'd think that they were separated. As for the traps, most of them aren't really that great. Even the best of what's here has been done better in the first 2 movies, and even 3. And the ending of this movie pretty much tells me, and perhaps you should you dare to watch this mess, why this movie was called this. This is not a Home Alone movie. The newest Chase commercials featuring Catherine O'Hara and Kevin Hart, as well as the Google commercial with Macaulay Culkin are far more faithful to Home Alone and more respectful then this movie is even trying to be.

So-called \"Home Alone 6\", the franchise that keeps being added to for reasons that nobody can remember.Released on so-called \"Disney+ Day\" as a Disney+ Original, Home Sweet Home Alone to give it its actual title does what it says on the tin - a boy is left home alone by accident (through parents having made a hash of planning/leaving/rounding everybody up and then not noticing for quite some time they're missing a body. Meanwhile said kid ends up having to to booby trap the whole establishment to inflict some pain on some intruders.Regrettably if this is designed to entice people into Disney+ then you can probably be forgiven for thinking Disney+ is full of this sort of material, the rehashing of \"classics\" and the butchering of archive material. But that's for another day.Archie Yates gets the mantel for the lead character in a Home Alone (titled) film (probably off the back of his appearance in JoJo Rabbit), and does a decent effort with the material he's been served, but realistically even if Macaulay Culkin was still ten years old today he'd struggle to do much with this as well. I dare say any child actor who was cast would create a miracle out of the script.Unfortunately adding John Williams' Home Alone score and music cues doesn't make it a Home Alone movie, neither does sticking booby traps in a house, some bad guys and an insane amount of pain. No there has to be something else. This doesn't have it, and so it'll just be the latest in the line of dreary Home Alone wannabes without any concept of what made the first (and second) film work.On the positive side, this is still better than the fourth film (which is hardly difficult), but it sits in my eyes quality wise between the fourth and fifth film. I believe I said in a previous review (for the fifth film) something along the lines of \"this doesn't get anywhere near Home Alone 1 and 2 and I'll be surprised if any future additions to this franchise get anywhere near them\".

The casting of a British family and a lead who is uncharismatic as it gets is the films biggest fault. It simply doesn't work at all and as a character he has zero redeeming feature and doesn't have the cute appeal Macaulay had in abundance. Max as a character is awful. He goes through the motions but it all feels forced and you kind of hope they wring his neck! Even the stunts are appalling, which is mad considering it's a full 30 years after the original where it was deemed a stunt masterclass for it's day!Simply avoid it, it won't make you feel chrismassy nor will it give you that nice heartwarming glow the first (and second one) did. Save your time and revisit the originals as after multiple viewings you'll still laugh more than you will at this.",

            "content": "The Good: This movie literally has me wondering if good writing and sensible filmic decisions have gone out the window. It seems like the idea of a \"timeless\" children's classic is getting further and further away from us. Aside from Frozen, I really can't think of another children's film that has stood the test of time, and that includes Pixar films. This movie at least prompted a reflection of the sad state of mainstream Hollywood filmmaking, I guess.Ellie Kemper is also too charismatic not to be funny.The Bad: You can generally tell how bad or good a film is by how much twisting the writers do to make the plot work and how consistent the characters act. If that's the standard to apply...this movie might be the worst of the year.We begin with Max, a precocious, annoying, whiny, selfish little brat, who we're expected to root for. He can't bare the wait getting to his McMansion to use the washroom, so forces his mother to stop at a random open house. He uses the washroom and proceeds to insult the homeowner, a man named Jeff (played by Ron Delaney) about an antique doll collection he owns. Understandably offended by this little twerp, he drinks a soft drink in front of him without offering. We are led to believe Max steals one of the dolls in retaliation.We come to learn that Jeff and his wife, played by Ellie Kemper, are in serious financial distress and are being pressured to sell their home. They have two children, who understandably don't want to leave their home. When Jeff discovers that the doll in his closet is worth $200K and that it is likely that Max stole it, he and Ellie (I'm really not going to remember the her character's name) embark to retrieve it. You know, his OWN property stolen by this kid.HSHA flips the script, whether intentionally or not, to make the bandits more sympathetic than the rich, annoying British kid. We see as he torments these people with traps that feel like kid versions of Saw traps. Quite bizarre. As such, this movie isn't as much \"fun,\" as it is a frustrating exercise to get through. The problem is so unbelievably easy to solve, yet we see two grown adults engage in the dumbest behaviour possible for absolutely no reason. This by itself, makes this movie absolute garbage.But on top of that, the movie looks TERRIBLE. Remember the warmth cinematic quality of the original? This one looks like a TV show. Remember the fantastic score? This one sounds like the dollar store version. Remember the funny jokes and sensible characters? Nope. Let's have Ally Wong play annoying stepmom and people fart on each other. Great.The Ugly: The audacity of this film is that it tries to shoehorn in a happy ending, one that comes out of absolutely nowhere. The Home Alone theme swells and you may briefly feel something. Don't be fooled. This movie sucks.",

            "content": "Being roughly Macaulay Culkin's age, I fully remember the impact that Home Alone had on kids at the time. It's perfect balance of sentimentality and slapstick made it an event upon it's release and endlessly re-watchable when it would inevitably pop up on cable each Christmas. It's goofy, but well made enough that it stands the test of time, and I can't imagine why any modern kid would be pinning for an update, unless they seriously just can't imagine a world without an Alexa. Which begs the question of who this remake is even for, when old folks like me long grew out of it and knew well enough to stay away from the endless sequels that trickled out over the years.But for anyone who seems visibly angered by this films existence, I urge you to consider this: Home Sweet Home Alone didn't even have a theatrical release, so no one forced you to spend 15 bucks to sit in a dark room giving it your undivided attention. If you have Disney+, it just appeared one day for free, and it was obvious what it was gonna be; holiday fluff you could stick on in the background and still be able to follow while you finish some Christmas chores or nurse an eggnog hangover.Sure, making the burglars sympathetic doesn't work as well as real bad guys, but there's literally 3 other movies that you already didn't watch that have that exact premise, so at least they tried something new. Sure, she's no Joe Pesci, but Ellie Kemper's patented over acting does fit the intended cartoonish tone. Sure there are some childish jokes and stretches of logic, but this is a Home Alone movie after all. It's got a bigger budget than the last two, so it doesn't reek of \"made for TV movie\". There's a couple easter eggs that nod towards the first film, and their incorporation of the John Williams score does trigger some nostalgia.If you want a timeless family classic, just watch the original, again. If you've seen it too recently and want some light Yuletide pablum that tells a familiar story without challenging your brain in any way, well then this exists.",

            "content": "I just saw Home Sweet Home Alone last night, and to put it bluntly, it is terrible, both as a standalone movie and especially as a sequel. I give it two stars, one for at least feeling more like a Home Alone movie (unlike Home Alone 4), and another for at least trying to shake up the status quo (granted they failed, but they at least made an attempt, so that counts for something). If you're looking at it as a stand alone movie, then it's basically a 90 minute snooze fest with uninteresting characters, and a nonsensical plot. If you are looking at it as a Home Alone movie, then it is far, far, worse. Strap yourselves in folks, as I will be going in to a lot of detail with this review.So to start things off, I'll talk about all of the good things about it, don't worry it won't be too long. For starters, they actually got the premise of being truly alone for an extended period of time, something the 3-5 instalments failed to do. It also feels more like a Home alone movie than the other 3 movies, but that's like saying stubbing your toe is better than breaking your leg, it still hurts. The appearance of Buzz McCallister as a police officer is also a nice nod to the original Home Alone movies, and it has a better sense of feeling like a sequel unlike Home Alone 4, and especially 3 and 5 (3 and 5 are pretty much in name only sequels given that the only thing tying it to the franchise is the title, and the broad premise). The cinematography is also a huge step up, even if it is to be expected. The music is also more true to the original home alone, and the traps are a huge improvement over Home Alone 4, since he made them himself instead of them being built into the house. I also like how they didn't go with the bad guys go to jail cliche, which I liked the idea of, but its execution was problematic, but more on that later.Unfortunately, that is where all the positives of this movie end. Now, let's start out with the comedy. Now while what you find funny is subjective, the way comedy works isn't, and the comedy does not work in this movie. It has a couple of good jokes, but often times, it tries too hard to be hip and cool with modern culture, and other unfunny moments, like Jeff farting on Pam's face, and a guy sleeping on Carol in a creepy way just to name a couple. And the comedy just won't stop, and it failed to entertain me for the most part.The next problem is that the characters act in nonsensical ways. Like for instance, Jeff and Pam, have this dumb and completely unfounded accusation that Max \"stole\" a doll. Instead of reasonably talking to his parents by phone or email and explaining the situation to them, they break in to his house, which causes Max to get defensive over his life, causing the house to get trashed in the process. And again, instead of talking to Max and asking for it back, they try to pretend to be Santa. Even if he did steal, breaking into a house is not the right way to get something back. Also, after they find out all that was going on was Max took a soda can, nobody gets any consequences (at least on screen) for what happened after every part of Jeff's accusation was completely wrong, and they all just walk away Scott free. And remember how the not going to jail cliche? Well, I like the idea of it, but the problem comes from how they don't reasonably ask for their property back by contacting his parents or knocking on the house, and then Max gets no consequences for trashing the house. Even for home alone, the violence is really The ending is not awful, it's good they find friends in each other, but it definitely falls short of the first two endings, and it doesn't have the same magic.The third problem comes from how technology is portrayed. For example, Carol says they don't have a land line, but surely they have a computer he could use to stay in contact with his mother, because they have a gaming console, a vr, and a virtual assistant. Are you seriously telling me, that they have smart phones and all of this other unnecessary technology, but they don't have a computer????!!!! I know it is fiction, but this is ridiculous, what situation is it where you have a vr headset and gaming consoles, but you don't have a computer for office related stuff? I wanted to say to Carol, \"Why don't you, oh I don't know, SEND MAX AN EMAIL OF THE SITUATION WHEN HE IS NEXT ON THE COMPUTER (which is pretty soon for people these days) SO HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON AND BUY HIM A TICKET?\" Seriously, they have everything except a computer, which is another annoying plot convenience.The fourth problem is the product placement, my gosh, they will not let you forget that this a movie that takes place in the 2020s, and it has product placement all over. From Nintendo to Lego to Nerf, you'd have to try to not find some sort of product placement in here. They clearly did not learn their lesson from Home Alone 4 with all the technology placement and it shows, in a couple of years, this movie is already going to be dated because of this, mark my words. The reason the first two movies worked so well was because it wasn't focused on current trends or popular culture, just simply what any kid would do in a situation Kevin is in. I get that that these are pretty standard items to have in a house with kids nowadays, but they should have toned it down a little bit because it is way too excessive and will cause it to age badly.The fifth problem is that they introduce these characters you could really could not care less about, the old lady, while she is a nice woman, she is never seen again, unlike the pigeon lady and the snow shovel man from the first two movies, and we Never find out much about her, so she just comes off as plot exposition. The real estate guy is forgettable, as are most of his cousins and siblings, (granted they aren't much memorable in the first two movies either but at least they put some time into showing their personalities and interactions).The final, but definitely not the only, problem with this movie is a huge Disney trying to sell you this with nostalgia bait, while the scene with Buzz and the music and the traps are nice, every time it gives a reference, I roll my eyes, because this encapsulates Disney now. They are mostly creatively bankrupt now, and now they are on a quest to recycle stuff already done from Fox and themselves, and it comes off as poor taste. I also love the irony that Disney allowed the line of remakes not being as good as the original to slip into the movie because that's exactly the problem. It's the exact same thing, but somehow made to be boring and unappealing, and they have no self awareness of this. If this movie is anything to go by, this proves Disney doesn't think of 20th Century Fox as a studio with a lot of creative works of art, they only think of it as a studio with a lot of cash cows, and they are hellbent on milking them for all their worth to satisfy their unsatisfiable greed, and I am so sick of it!Ultimately, Home Sweet Home Alone is a better movie than the fourth and fifth movie, but it still is a disgrace to the first two movies that desperately relies on pop culture references, product placement, and nostalgia bait that ends up feeling lackluster and shallow. I only saw this movie out of curiosity because I already had access to Disney Plus, if my only option was to watch this in movies, I wouldn't have paid a single cent to see it. So, if you are interested in watching the Home Alone movies, I would I highly recommend you check out the first two movies, and stay away from 3-5, and especially stay away from this hot garbage, this doesn't even deserve the Home Alone name, I just hope that one day, ONE DAY, this movie gets a proper continuation, but after seeing this movie, that probably won't happen. Disney could have made a proper continuation to Home Alone 2, and revived the franchise, but instead they squandered it and that is what hurts most. This could have been an amazing movie, but it was squandered, that money was more important than a kid, just trying to protect his home from Harry and Marv.",

I reckon because they couldn't get McCaulkey himself ... neither of them actually, they went for someone else.It is not his fault the movie is being so ill received. It has something to do that the villains here are being made human. Well simple minded, totally ridiculous ones, that are borderline kids when it comes to certain situations they find themselves in, but likeable ones because their quest is pure. Well it involves breaking and entering (no matter what the main character says about having the key and sometimes remembering the alarm code or not, conveniently I might add), so maybe not entirely pure, but you get the gist.But if that is what breaks the movie for you - well you have quite the romantic view of the original. Kevin was not a good kid by any mean of that word. And he was just as vile if not even more - especially in the sequel. Yes he might have looked cuter than the \"Kevin\" of this movie (he has a different name, I forgot it, sorry), but he isn't. At all! Having said that, you may feel different and that is ok. If you do not like this - it is so. It is just a shame that a movie that is overall similar, in tone, jokes and traps, gets so much hate, when it isn't that different from the original.

Oh boy, this movie is even worse than you can possibly imagine. It's one of the worst movies I've watched all year.The original Home Alone works because it's this great adventure-like story of a kid being left home alone and the sort of things he gets into. Then he encounters these burglars who are bad people and want to break in to rob his house. He then takes measures to protect it and because these burglars are bad people we enjoy watching them fall into the traps and get hurt. Not only that, but it's a great movie about family trying to be together for Christmas. It's filled with great themes and has a great heart.Home Sweet Home Alone forgets all of this and makes a completely joyless movie that doesn't work at all.Instead of the movie focusing on Max Mercer being \"home alone\" the movie instead focuses mainly on the two \"burglar\" characters. They are the ones we follow. They are the ones we care about. The movie isn't about the kid being home alone, it's about these two burglar characters being in bad place in life and making a poor decision. However, because of the way the movie portrays everything, we're not really rooting against the burglars! We almost agree with what they're doing. The movie is basically propelled forward because of a misunderstanding. So when the \"burglars\" are getting hurt and caught in the trap it's not really enjoyable at all. We're not rooting for the kid. We're almost rooting against him and thats not what you want from a Home Alone movie!There's no adventure for a kid being left home alone. We get a two minute montage of him playing in the house and eating junk food...but thats it! There's no scenes. Of him going shopping, decorating the house, doing adult chores. Thats some of the charm of the original. Watching a kid be responsible. Here we get nothing. We don't follow the kid at all! He's a supporting character. Why call the movie Home Sweet HOME ALONE if you're not evem following the kid who is HOME ALONE?We don't even get to know the family at all. We get maybe two to three scenes of the mom trying to get back and that's it. There's no scene of regret from the mom, no character growth for the mom. There's just no characters at all in the family. They're just people that are there.Archie Yates is good in the movie. I think he's a talented child actor. He was fantastic in Jojo Rabbit, but unfortunately he's given nothing to work with here. Elle Kemper is good, as is Rob Delaney, but again their talent is wasted in this abysmal movie.The best part of this movie is the cameo from Buzz McCallister. He has a great scene in the movie that actually made me laugh. It was a clever scene and one that I rewound to watch again because of how good it was.Overall. This movie is a complete disaster.

            "content": "The original Home Alone has become one of most iconic and beloved Christmas films of all time. What followed was a barrage of sequels that, with the exception of HA2, sucked pretty bad. And, although the second film was nowhere near as good as the first, it was, at the very least, an entertaining and occasionally funny follow up. So, now we have Home Sweet Home Alone. And there are not enough negative adjectives in the English language to desribe it. Awful, terrible, awfully terrible (or terribly awful, if you prefer), crap show, dumpster fire, and so on and so forth. HSHA is a text book example of a production company seeing just how far they'll stoop, while making a mockery of, and stomping the hell out of the childhood of many people. And it's all in the name of making quality pictures...just kidding. We all know that it's all in the name of $$$. It's so disappointing. It is becoming more and more obvious that executives of the \"super-production\" companies don't give a damn about striving to make quality films. They'll hijack any successful film or film series, hire writers and directors who will give said executives whatever the hell kind of movie they want, even at the expense of making them badly. HSHA is devoid of any sort of original thought or circumstance. It also completely misses the point of the original, or of part 2 for that matter. The kid is barely likeable. The so-called intruders are just completely misunderstood, and the sense of urgency exhibited by the mother character has no real emotional impact. Almost every bit of fan service...every bit of nostalgia...all of it only exists in such a way, that one could almost picture the executives and the production team making sure that all the proverbial boxes had been checked. Jokes that harken back to HA '90, gags that do the same...all present in a way that illustrates duplication, not admiration. Even the performance of the, usually solid, actress and comedian Ellie Kemper. She falls a bit flat here, but that has more to do with the poorly written dialogue, storyline, and direction, than with her acting ability. And there are past performances of Kemper on the t.v. Show The Office and in the film Bridesmaids that prove she can, with the right screenplay or teleplay, and the right direction, be an effective actress. So, if you've already seen HSHA, then I can't help you. But if you haven't seen it yet, then you are envied by the lot of us who have seen it. As always, this is just my opinion.",

But this movie doesn't care to make anything new out of Home Alone that's actually about the future of Kevin and his family. Instead, this movie regards to be trendy for the children with modern technology and toys. Since this is a reboot to Home Alone, it's no surprise the story is lazily written. The characters are all annoying and their connection is illogical. All we see the \"villains\" of the movie we see is just break into Max's house just for a valuable doll. Seriously, there are much better ways to make the villains that's not the McKenzies. And the big problem, the humor. I think this has the worst comedy of the year. The movie would supply pop culture references, gross jokes, repeated jokes and a large amount of slapstick. Do I really need to make a recommendation? Just skip this film and go with the first two. Even if the second was the same as the first, at least it was much more tolerable than the other reboots like this one. I thought America The Motion Picture wasn't funny, but this film take the cake as the most unfunny movie of the year. At this rate, Fox should hold down from making anymore Home Alone movies.",

He had zero charisma and his personality made me root against him the entire movie. I don't who the \"good guy\" is supposed to be in this movie. The McKenzies are too nice to be villains, but too dumb to be heroes. Regardless, when they are subjected to the booby traps, the slapstick is more sad than funny.

Immediately that makes it lack the same appeal as the original, which was a kid fighting back against robbers trying to steal his family's possessions.Everything about it feels forced.

The rest of Maxs family are vapid, just like Rob McKenzies brothers family, reminiscent of National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. Even the presence of SNL stalwart Kenan Thompson can't bring it up.The premise is much the same as previous iterations; extended family goes on holiday, forget the son who wishes to be on their own and shenanigans ensue. But given all the family development, the house defence gets barely any time. The cameos by a series alum gets about as much time!Maybe a good Disney+ content filler, but the series is continuing its quality decline.",

At least Pam and Jeff had a very justifiable and very Christmas perfect reason to need to break into Max's house. It feels like they tried to tone down the punishment, but I don't see how you can make this kind of movie without someone getting hurt bad, which is done on a less cartoonish effect but still...Well at best this was a decent Christmas movie that came way too early proving how we are totally trying to wipe out Thanksgiving.",

Obscenely rich kid steals from middle class family losing their home. Not funny. Annoying kid assaults them over and over as they try to reclaim stolen property. Again not funny.

Why would one make a modern day adaptation of an all-time classic? Maybe to appeal to the current generation of kids and give them ideas on how to target intruders or just to mint money. Thank god this was an direct to OTT release because this would have bombed big time if it was not.Set during Christmas, the Mercer family are on their way to Tokyo for the holidays. They leave a young sleepy kid, Max Mercer behind; all alone at home. Enter Jeff & Pam; parents who are struggling financially. They suspect that Max has stolen a prized doll from their open house and try to take it back by breaking and entering. And yes, Max's mom rushes back from Tokyo.If you are adapting the movie for the current generation, make some significant changes at least. The major change we see here is the motivation of the intruders. They are not thieves. They just want what is theirs. This is a typical Disney move; everyone has a backstory; in this case a sob story. There is also the accent. Basically, mommy Mercer & Max Mercer are British. Yes, that makes a lot of difference!Max Mercer is played by Archie Yates of Jojo Rabbit fame. He is a kid alright but it is quite difficult not to compare him to Macaulay Culkin. The two intruders are played by Ellie Kemper & Rob Delaney. Both usually have excellent comic timing. But the slapstic routine doesn't work for them. Nevertheless, it is always fun to watch them in action.We also get a peek into what McCallister is doing now with Buzz McCallister's character making an appearance as a cop.Home Sweet Home Alone is a failed attempt at recreating an all-time holiday classic for the current generation. The thing is; the original is an evergreen classic. It works for every generation. Disney, you are better than this!",

Why would any descent people with slightest intelligence want to hurt them with the cruel and deadly traps in a movie like this? I certainly wouldn't let my kids watch the film.

The writing, the direction, the characters, the performances, they were all waste, good actors given such a terrible script. 31 years after the holiday classic of a kid foiling two robbers was a cinematic milestone, and after four sequels that failed to surpass it, we have one that I have so little respect for and the worst one since Home Alone 4, this is the 6th film in the franchise and the first Disney after Disney brought FOX, so from out of nowhere, we got the Home Alone movie nobody asked for.Max Mercer, a mischievous and resourceful young boy, has been left behind while his family is in Japan for the holidays. So when a married couple attempting to reactive a priceless heirloom sets their sights on the Mercer family's home, it's up to Max to protect it from the trespassers, and he will do whatever it takes to keep them out.So that's Home Sweet Home Alone in a nutshell. Fixing what isn't broken is a tired old cliche by this point for Disney, first they remake and ruin most of their cherished animated classics, then they buy Star Wars and ruin for the fans, and now they will anger the Home Alone fans with this crap. This was just painful to get through.This is a reboot to be honest and rebooting movies in this day and age is more than likely to be absolutely unnecessary. Considering that the original movie was already a classic that didn't need to be remade and also the fact the franchise stopped being good after the first two movies, as the sequels ended up being poorly-received amongst fans.Here, the humor in this film sucks and even the traps aren't quite as funny or as original. There's even parts where the robbers are getting hit in the groin and or having sharp objects on their feet, and some of the traps appear to be dangerous.The other characters aside from Max are also bland and unlikable too. The actors did a terrible job, but I do see that they are talented in some way.So Home Sweet Home Alone finds new ways to fail and fall flat on it's face and it's a mess for the Home Alone fans. Aside from Buzz's cameo, there's nothing in this movie I would recommend to you. If you have Disney+, skip it. If you do have Disney+ don't bother paying for it. It's just another reminder you can watch the original and have a Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays. Not the worst Home Alone movie I've ever considering the fourth film was a complete fail, but this one came VERY close to beating it. Don't bother if you are a fan of the original Home Alone.2/10.",

This quasi-remake, \"Home Sweet Home Alone,\" keeps the basic storyline about a child accidentally left behind who defends his home from would-be burglars with complicated contraptions. It even includes an actor from the original, and a child slapping his cheeks in astonishment, the original's iconic image. But it misses the key elements that made both the slapstick and the sentiment of the 1990 version appealing. Yates' nicely understated delivery is not used as effectively here as it was in \"JoJo Rabbit.\" To get away from his extended family, Max goes to the garage and climbs into the back seat of the car to watch Road Runner cartoons (a clear inspiration for all of the \"Home Alone\" movies). Instead of the cartoonishly bumbling robbers of the original film, who made it easy to enjoy their downfall, the \"home sweet home\" is just as important to this film's intruders, a married couple played by the endlessly likeable Ellie Kemper (Pam) and Rob Delaney (Jeff). They are under a lot of financial stress because Jeff has lost his job as a data migration expert. The way he and Pam refer to \"the cloud\" as the reason he is out of work is probably the movie's best joke. Jeff's obnoxious show-off brother Hunter (Timothy Simons, underused) and his wife and son arrive to make Jeff feel even worse about not providing for his family. As ridiculous as it is for Pam and Jeff to try to break into Max's house to retrieve the doll, we want them to get it back so they can stay in their home. And as ridiculous as it is for Max to set up booby traps that would impress both Rube Goldberg and Navy Seals, we can understand that he feels vulnerable and is trying to do what he can to stay safe. The original film had a genuinely touching subplot of family reconciliation to add tenderness to the over-the-top pratfalls. This one only gestures feebly at the kind of cozy connections that made the conclusion of the earlier film comforting and even meaningful.",

Ellie kemper is the star and glue that holds it together, whilst the dad (rob) was poorly cast and with a funnier more natural actor would've been better. It's genuinely entertaining. The hate was always going to exist even if they'd have won Oscars. The nods to the original like the music and Kevin's older brother were great.The only issue really was being slow to get going and casting, the kid was an awful choice, no charisma, no humour and failed to portray any emotion, going \"yes\" after traps worked even felt forced, if they try again and I hope they do work harder on focus groups to get a hood kid actor .

What's his motive though? The married couple is trying to take a valuable doll that the kid \"stole.\" Yeah, not very good.The humor is also extremely bad. It's awkwardly unfunny and stupid. This entire script felt like it was written by a guy who had to ask his kids what slang words are popular, and what a \"Fortnite\" is. There is a joke at the beginning of a movie where the family is watching an 'Angels with filthy souls' remake. (The fake movie in the original Home Alone with Johnny and Snakes) The dad then says \"Why do they remake the classics, they're never as good as the original.\" Haha. Good one Disney. Meta does not equal funny.The traps as well are absolutely awful. It's just slapstick repeats of the original ones but modernized to cause more carnage. The kid puts a VR headset onto one of the burglars, and makes it look like he's in more danger than he really is.Finally, this movie just doesn't work. What makes the original Home Alone movies so good, is that they came out just before cell phones became a thing. If this scenario were to happen in real life, it would be solved instantly. Overall, this is just a garbage movie made by Disney to rake in the most amount of money by trying as little as possible, and pandering to the fans of the originals. Buzz is in this as a cop and is absolutely insufferable. He's a dumb failure of a cop that is only here to connect both movies and talk about Kevin in one scene.Wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you're a fan of bad movies. 1/10 would give 0 if I could.",

However, the break in was instigated by a nice couple that were only trying to regain stolen property to save their family home. The kid was attacking them based upon miscommunication, which leads to a nice couple getting brutally attacked by a psycho kid. Instead of laughing at the duo's pain, I inwardly cringed and felt sorry for them, which essentially just ruins the film. And instead of the couple being arrested for breaking and entering, or the kid being arressted for assault, they all just laughed at the miscommunication and spent future christmases together like besties, which of course, is just ridiculous. The one man, Jeff, likely got brain damage from the pool ball injuries and the woman, Pam, was set on FIRE. But apparently that leads to bygones?

I'm giving it a high rating, so go ahead and be a troll and give me a thumbs down and tell me my review isn't helpful because yall don't agree with me.When I saw the trailer, I did roll my eyes and didn't care much for the kid, but when I watched it, he grew on me a little bit. This new installment in the Home Alone series (We're up to the 6th one now) is a LOT better then the previous two films, but it's still not as good as the original. To me, this feels like the true 'Home Alone 3' because one of the original stars from the originals makes an appearance, and they use the classic John Williams theme music. I was intrigued by the story, and it managed to make me feel nostalgic, especially when they play 'Somewhere in my Memory' This time, we get to know the burglars, and come to care for them and why they're doing the robbing.Meet Pam and Jeff McKenzie, a down-on-their-luck couple who have to sell their house because it's getting too expensive to live there. They haven't told their children yet. During an open house, they run into 10-year old Max Mercer and his mom, Carol. They're only there because Max needed to stop and use the bathroom. On the way out, Max notices an ugly doll with an upside-down face. Max and Jeff have words over it and they finally leave. That night, Jeff researches the doll and finds that it's extremely rare and worth a lot. The only problem is that the doll is now missing.The next day, Max's family is on the way to the airport to Japan, and of course, Max gets left home alone. He reacts the same way Kevin McCallister did, then he gets bored and lonely. Pam and Jeff assume that Max took the doll, and track him to his house and try to get it back. Max unfortunately misunderstands their intentions and begins his battle plan to strike back against the burglars.I honestly feel that this movie is worthy of the Home Alone name. It gave me nostalgic feels like the first two, it has the classic John Williams music and it gave me a few laughs. I wouldn't mind watching it again. There are other easter eggs and nods to the original classic, too. If you love the franchise, I would highly recommend HOME SWEET HOME ALONE!!!",

Home sweet home alone (2021) remake of Home alone directed by chris columbus, (1990), is a movie that drops from the premise; \"a spoiled little boy and only son of a single and not at all nice mom obsessed with work has to stop two moronic idiots who thought he had a valuable maggifin for the resolution of a conflict that nobody is interested in getting into their house\". From the script, this movie is total crap, but more importantly, because it makes no sense, we shouldn't care so much about it, at least not enough to watch it once, and never see it again in the little or much time we have to live; being that both the original and the sequel are more than Christmas classics of all the times, you can see for miles what immediately makes it a clumsy insult, full of commercial brands and out-of-place jokes. Every character that appears here is either a poorly made copy of the original, or a malicious modern reinterpretation of it, but hiding under ideals of intent and insertion. What's worse, having a bad character who wants to give himself a better life than he has on his own merits, or a brainless person who tries to give free rein to his means just for a selfish situation that could have been solved in the right way more than easily, and even more having technological tools at hand?.... In short, it's mixing the first and the third movie, or rather making a pseudo remake of the third movie with elements of the first one so that the audience feels it was worth watching, which leaves down to the ground any desire to recommend it not only to a casual audience, but even to any child fan of the last seasons of south park or merry melodies. It assembles a bunch of comic actors with nothing to do, with a script written in a day and a half or two, along with all the technical luxuries that disney can offer to two sloppy directors whose success resides in writing for films that are not tied to a conventional plot and the result is absurd in a bad way, a mockery of the comedy of the original, a spit of red-green that thinks it is more imaginative and aggressive, but fails in so many ways, it is simply unbelievable that it has come out at all. This film makes everything that followed after 1992 look like a masterpiece.

I don't see any enjoyment watching two people (who didn't do anything bad after all) getting tortured by an eight year old - hell, it might even be cringe worthy for little kids. It's generally not a film that has received positive criticism from the majority of the viewers and critics, and I can see why. The 10 star reviews here are just some rare exceptions, or maybe people who don't know what they're saying - I personally found no enjoyment while watching this.Just don't do watch it - the plot doesn't make any sense and the characters are either dull or idiotic. You may enjoy the traps in the third act (Maybe, although I doubt since the burglars are quite sympathetic here) along with some jokes here and there, but that's it. Just watch the first three movies - I find them a lot better than this cringe worthy sequel.",

It does have quite a few nods to the original film, but for a fan of the franchise as a whole, like myself, there are also nods to the other films as well. A trap from \"Home Alone 3\" here, even a slight \"Home Alone 4\" nod there.But back to the originality. ALL of the other five films feature bumbling, but professional thieves attempting to break into a house to steal something. That's not the case here, and it's VERY refreshing. A simple misunderstanding leads to the trap scene. That scene, as well as the rest of the film is also quite funny, which is always a win for a comedy.I admit that I went into it with low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised and will be throwing it into the Christmas film rotation in the coming years.",

Aside from the first two beloved classics, I saw the 3rd and I was horrified at how bad it was. Why on Earth would I watch the 4th and 5th? Now Disney acquires 20th Century Fox and makes a 6th!!!!!! I saw the trailer and it was enough to nail that door shut in perpetuity because you know another and another will keep coming BECAUSE PEOPLE WATCH THEM!!! (Whether out of curiosity or, well, who knows). Disney gets new subscribers for it and people watch it.If you really liked it and/or the kids did, awesome, it was worth your time and expense if you subscribed for the first time. Everyone is allowed their opinion. We all have different tastes. But if you went in knowing you would hate it but curious, then don't complain it's a crime against the originals. Disney wins. Nearly 12k rated this, some were probably new. Imagine how many actually watched it and hated it??I get the service because I love the live action from the 60's and 70's, the classic Christmas and Halloween movies, Pixar and the Simpsons. I have seen the Marvel movies and the series'. I, however, will not pay the premium for some of the new movies. That's absurd. I can wait.I really hope most of the parents have introduced the originals, though. They are a treasure. My husband was at the grocery store today and I was on the phone making dinner. There was a little boy about Kevin's age who come up to the checkout behind him with a small cart. He was wearing winterwear with a pompom-topped stocking cap. He put the separation bar down and my husband looked at him and said to the checker, \"Kevin McCallister\". She apparently gave him a dumbfounded look. He said to me he was waiting for him to take a Stouffer's Mac and Cheese out of the cart. (Yes, the mother was there, she ran back to get something.). So sad, a young person not knowing who Kevin is.\ud83d\ude31I digress...if you know you are going to hate it, then don't watch it and then b**** about it.

They go to his house to get the doll back and, instead of asking them why they're there, he resorts to using a violent fantasy to virtually kill them.The kid goes so far as to give the mother third degree burns on her feet, forcing her to then walk on legos, and then shooting her with tacked darts, leaving small stab wounds along her body.If I could give this movie 0 stars, I would. It is nothing more than Mikey Day's rich kid fantasy of violently hurting poor people. If anything, this should make us concerned about his mental well-being. The traps in this movie are not fun as in the 1990 film, but rather grotesque and borderline torturous upon a family that has had something valuable stolen from them by a rich prick, with serial killer tendencies, and just want it back. Making a movie that centers around violently maiming, and making fun of, a poor family in 2021 when over 40% of Americans live under the poverty line is absolutely revolting.

            "content": "Before I watched Home Sweet Home Alone, I thought that its plot will be exactly like any previous movie in the series, which is that a bunch of thieves try to steal or get something from a house, and the kid in that house has to stop them from doing this whatever it costs. At the end, the thieves are cought by the police, end of story. But when I watched this movie, I got so surprised and stunned because this wasn't the case.From my own point of view, Home Sweet Home Alone is the best, or one of the best, movie in the Home Alone series. It is even better than the first installment when it comes to some sides. For example, this movie introduces us to the thieves characters more closely and lets us know more about the details of their lives and why they are going to invade Max's (the main kid character) house. Not only this, but also, it makes us sympathize with them even more than Max in some situations.Also, one of the good sides of Home Sweet Home Alone is that the relationship between Max, Jeff, and Pam was not just a relationship of a kid who just wanted to stop two thieves from invading his house. There was a lot more than that because in the movie, we can see how they get to know each other more, what each person wants and how each person thinks about the other.But for me, the best part of Home Sweet Home Alone was the ending. Instead of giving us the traditional happy ending in which the thieves are defeated, the police arrive, and the thieves are cought by the police, they give us a \"happier ending\" in which Max knows that Jeff and Pam are not invading his house to kidnap and sell him. They are doing this only to retrieve the doll whom they think that he stole from them, and they become friends after clearing up the misunderstanding and knowing that he is home alone and currently has no one to be with on Christmas Eve, especially when discovering that he didn't even steal the doll from them. It was in their house after all. What I mean by this is that the theme of the police arresting the thieves at the end was abandoned in this movie. They wanted to bring a new idea. If it came only to the ending, I would give the movie 10 out of 10.There are also some other positive sides in Home Sweet Home Alone like the clever booby traps, the performances of Delaney and Kemper, and igniting the Home Alone franchise nostalgia once again.When it comes to the flaws, at least from my own point of view, this movie has two flaws. It would have been better if the doll was replaced by something which is \"really priceless, too much expensive, and of a high value\". Also, I saw that the rest of the cast performances other than Delaney's and Kemper's are very very normal. They have nothing special in them.When it comes to the score, I gladly give Home Sweet Home Alone 8 out of 10.",

Second you have to ban obviously paid studio shills trying to pretend this is a great film and raise the ratings.I decided to start this review 20 minutes into the \"move\" and I use the term loosely as it should be called an ugly disaster and huge waste of film stock. HOW did it get a rating as high as 3.5Whoever the writers were obviously wanted to be blacklisted from Hollywood or why else would they have written something this god awful.The director as well was obviously not on set and directed this from home using ZOOM. It was written he was in negotiations to direct the movie. I'd be negotiating one thing: KEEP MY NAME OFF OF IT AND I GET TWICE MY USUAL FEE.Every single person in this so far is incredibly unlikeable and the characters. All of them come across as having a COMBINED IQ or 23.The English mom and chubbo English brat, er I mean yung kid start arguing in a strangers house and you know the kid is a thief. AND this English kid is so freaking horrible and unlikeable I am rooting for whoever takes has his pranks backfire IN THE MOVIE and sends him to the hospital where they declare this franchise DOA.He is NOT funny, he is a rude little creep and the family should have sold him. I detest him beyond belief and has anyone EVER met a ten year old who talks like this?FURTHER...Hollywood STOP making every kid in movies rude, sullen and stop making them running amok funning into adults and pushing them out of the way, throwing things at the adults and each other, yelling and screaming. I have NEVER seen this and as a military brat and later family man we saw a lot of parties, large families. Once upon a time children were portrayed realistically. Not anyore.STOP making kids like this. I know it is SUPPOSED to be a comedy but all it does is make the adults and most kids think WHY are they raised to be total little monsters in every movie.FURTHER stop making the dads so freaking stupid.AND this little bit really ticked me off. WHY is the family afraid to tell their own children they are selling the house and why? WHEN did kids run households in movies.Further when the kids ask who the real estate agent is, IF they wanted to make up a story WHERE THE HELL DID THEY COME UP WITH HE IS DAD'S PERSONAL TRAINER. How about just saying he is a new fried of the dads????The kids would not care at all. They would be introduced and both would say nice to meet you and the kids would be off.Besides my son, I also raised my two nieces and we moved three times to better homes for my extended family over the years and not ONCE did the girls or my son throw temper tantrums to make the family afraid. Moving is a part of life for most Americans and every kid I've known besides my three charges, first thing was 'Where we moving to\" When we moving and it became and adventure.This movie is a prime example of making those two points WORSE THAN EVER. Why does Hollywood INSIST on doing this. Just like they make ever man in the movies and TV have a permanent 4 day beard growth and they ALL look alike now I always thought it made them look like bums who needed to wash their faces. BUT I DIGRESS.The plotline is a weak as anything Hollywood has ever come up with. It makes PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE look like Star Wars.The plot is beyond stupid. Seriously. The first family selling the home, think the obnoxious little English brat stole a valuable doll and head over to where the brat lives. They see the family all getting ready to leave.AND INSTEAD OF JUST WALKING UP AND SAYING \"We think your kid may have taken one of our antique dolls and would like to get it back\". AS ANY ADULT WOULD DO...except in lame Disney movies.NO they plot to break in and steal it back and as a result the English brat pulls all the usual BUT idiotically different stunts as the original movie to thwart the \"robbers\"BUT like all Disney movies the whole thing is cleared up and everyone hugs and kisses and they all have holidays together and like all Disney movies dad gets a new job with AND God I just cannot go on.All I can say is.AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE YOU WOULD COVID 19.",

Unlike the original home alone, his family doesn't bully him, there's like one scene where he's written off because of all the chaos and any sympathy you feel for him is gone when he bothers his mom on the phone with the airlines. Any part I laughed at was more because of cringe and not because the joke was actually funny. Also there's at least two scenes of an actors face full on showing you the mashed up food in their mouth, it's weird. Anyways the kid is the real villain, the \"heroes\" are just an idiot couple.

The problem with this approach, is that it makes the viewer way more sympathetic to these characters, who aren't Eagle Scouts, but lack any actual malice. So it's not fun to watch them get hurt by the traps, it's just sad.Another problem is that this leaves Max very under-developed and much less the sympathetic underdog that Kevin was. The actor is clearly older, and never really seems scared or worried about his predicament. His Family is also very under-developed. If you blink you'll miss his Dad, it's not clear who everyone in the Family even is. You never see a Cousin or Sibling ever being mean to him or worry about him being home alone. Basically, Max has a little fun in the house, then gets bored, and starts to miss his family a bit. This is like 10 minutes tops of screen time.So, despite some attempts to shake things up, the only thing this changes from the original is that it makes the Kid less likable and the Burglars more sympathetic, so it's not clear who we're even supposed to be rooting for.The film did have some funny moments, and I thought the cast did the best they could.

            "content": "Okay so I'll start with the positives. This film decides to focus on the robbers and make them the good guys. This film's version of Kevin (I think his name was Max) allegedly stole something from the robbers and they just wanted to take it back. Unfortunately, the kid thinks they are breaking in to kidnap him and sets up traps. This focus on multiple sides to the same story by showing different perspectives is an interesting new concept for Home Alone films. I also love all the callbacks and references. For example, the alarm code is 1112 and a character makes a joke that that is her anniversary. This film is a Disney+ original and Disney+ launched on November 12. Also a sign outside their house indicates \"Protected by McCallister Home Security\" and a grown up Buzz (Officer McCallister) is a police officer who directly mentions Kevin and his security company by name.Alright now let's get the issues. The dialogue sucks. The writers were trying to be relatable, funny, and relevant so lines are all slang, Illtimed jokes, or adults trying to be cool. It really comes off as cringe and shows how out of touch big studios can be. Also every freaking character is a blabbering idiot. Cartoon slapstick violence is to be expected during the break in, but the entire film characters are slipping, letting their pants fall down, etc. Characters fall for the dumbest things. Because of the writing teams decision to mix it up and make the robbers the good guys, the traps aren't funny. You don't like watching the robbers get hurt. And to make the robbers look justified, they make the kid a spoiled brat.It doesn't have any of the heart of the original nor the genius storytelling. However I do like the departure from the formula and it was a solid way to spend two hours.",

            "content": "As someone who grew up on the original Home Alone movies, even watching the third, fourth and remembering snippets of the fifth movie, I found that the series only survived off of McCulkin's acting and his charisma as a child actor.I do think the cinematography and acting in this one is better than the last few renditions, I feel that the lazy script, rushed pacing, nonsensical character actions and overall forced conflict is what drags down this movie for me.The actors did the best they could with their roles and the kid who plays Max is a good kid actor, but his character was so awful to almost everyone around him and he was simply a spoiled brat. He whines and complains about everything, gets mad when his mom won't humor him when she's on a phone call, he mocks the husband, one of the thieves in this movie, for having dolls but is okay wearing his mom's clothes, which seemed very off to me and he was going to take toys meant for less privileged children for himself, and even tricked an old woman with his fake sob story. I'm sorry but how am I supposed to like him? Not to mention he gets less screen time than the antagonists of this movie and that worked against him as well.He's simply an annoying brat who pouts when he doesn't get his way and he seems to have a normal family unlike Kevin's who's family were jerks to him even when he was just ten. You can say I'm romanticizing the old movies, but in those you actively rooted for Kevin to beat Harry and Marv and his family didn't do much to really show them in a good light. Meanwhile Max is shown to have decent parents, well his mom at the very least, and he doesn't have it all that bad either, so beats me as to why he's so mopey all the time.The couple, Pam and Jeff, ironically enough were the most likable in the film, and that really gave the movie a really confusing and borderline toxic message. By making us sympathize with the two who are looking to sell their house, since Jeff is losing his job, you inadvertently make them less of a threat that the Wet Bandits were in the original movies. That being said, these two are likable, but they make the dumbest leaps in logic I've ever seen in a film. This movie didn't need to happen, all Pam and Jeff had to do were to ring the doorbell and ask Max if he had the doll they were looking for, as simple as that.They could have even waited until the family came back to ask, but their logic is so messed up that it makes no sense. They act so incredulous and make the stupidest mistakes that you wonder if them getting hurt by all the traps makes you feel bad or want to see them get hurt for all their idiocy. When I say the conflict is contrived, this is what I mean. Pam seemed to have the most smarts to her, but she loses all her brain cells when they actually get to the house, Jeff flubs up the most, but these two are concerned about going to jail, but say screw logic and break and enter into someone's home anyway because they need that doll dang it.What really bothers me about these two is that they get off way too easy for a simple misunderstanding that they could have avoided if they simply acted like rational adults and waited for the family to come back or even asked Max if he had it by walking up to the door and ringing the bell. It's like the script forced them to avoid taking the logical route for this convoluted series of shenanigans to happen. You mean to tell me that these two have a family to care for, but are willing to risk jail time for this doll they have no idea if this kid even stole, unbelievable, especially when it's revealed that their nephew took the doll, so their efforts were in vain.No amount of references is gonna save this film either, just because you put a grown up Buzz in the movie doesn't make it any better. He ended up serving no purpose in the film other than to give a cheesy call back and since the couple don't really face any major consequences aside from footing the bill to help fix the house, his presence as a cop is null and void.Imagine if Harry and Marv got off all because they didn't want to kill Kevin, but wanted him to be safe or escort him to his family and meant well, it'd ruin the charm.The traps were in the home alone vein and I liked them a lot, they were very creative and the one liners from the kid and the couple were funny. I do think all this trap making was once again, all in vain because the couple and Max could have simply talked and avoided this altercation altogether. Kevin knew that there was no compromising with the thieves since they'd double cross him, but in this movie's case, Pam and Jeff were made sympathetic which just makes Max look like even more of a sociopath than Kevin. Max may have been a brat, but he's no way unreasonable, so the traps which are the hallmark of these movies are made gratuitous when all of this stemmed from a silly misunderstanding that could have been resolved had the couple acted like adults.I'm rambling but yeah, this movie deserved the bad reviews it got from everyone, to the ones who gave it good reviews, good for you I guess? I just didn't like it, and no cheeky comments about remakes and reboots being trash is gonna make it any better, its lame.",

The acting was actually decent and not some cheesy b movie acting level. The amount of well known actors/actresses that know how to act also helped carry the film.

I kept thinking that there had to be a smarter way they could get that doll back.I dont care how the movie ends ir if the boy did any traps like Kevin did, I'm going to try and forget about it.",

He steals a priceless doll from a family and when they attempt to \"steal\" the doll back, he calls the cops and blames them. Now to the main character himself, He is an ugly, fat, disgusting, spoiled kid that is a thief and a total loser.The so called \"bad guys\" in the movie are literally a married couple that are trying to make life good for their kids, the doll that the kid steals from them is priceless and since he stole it, they have a chance at losing their home because they aren't doing too well money-wise.Not only does the kid steal the doll from the family that is struggling, but he also literally calls the cops on them when they come to take it back stating that he thought they were \"suspicious\".To Conclude this essay, the new Home Alone movie is a cash grab and nothing more, the \"traps\" that the kid sets have a more horror movie style than a family movie style. This is by far the worst of the Home Alone movies and should not be watched if you don't want to lose braincells, the only reason you should watch it is to be like me and write a horrible review of the movie afterwards.

Of course I wish it had more of original actors coming back, but I got to say the best part of this movie is seeing Buzz again all grown-up. The original actor still plays him the same way! Which I appreciated way more than I thought I would! Now for the elephant in the room. I will say the only huge downside of this new film is the fact that they victimize the bad guys, and make them look innocent and justified. Also I know this sounds corny, but I would've enjoyed the classic trope of this kid being Kevin's son in this movie or something rather than this being a completely different family altogether. I know they did that in the third and fourth films as well but I think it really would've been better off in this film versus those movies if they at least had a cameo for Macaulay Culkin in this! Like I said it's not terrible, and it's not disappointing. It's just a completely different time and family now in this film. I would still recommend giving it a try but it's not gonna be the original.",

There's taking elements from the original (like the force awakens and the last Jedi take from empire strikes back) and then there is just blatant copying. I wouldn't have a major problem with that however if they had actually got it right. This film is butchered from the beginning by changing the concept to make it so that the villains have a moral compass and have the right intentions. This in theory sounds good, but what it actually does is make us like the villains. Moreover, we want them to actually succeed. This therefore ruins the central aspect of the film as in the third act where we traditionally see the burglars get badly injured by the booby traps set by the hero we can't enjoy it or laugh, we know these people don't deserve it and that they are only trying to help their family. Even during the sequence multiple times they ask the kid to stop and say they just want to talk. The boy ignores them and keeps shooting pool balls at them. This also further reinforces to us that the so called hero is really rude and takes happiness from others misfortune (Unintentionally he was characterised this way).

Period. And maybe the third one.The kid was obnoxious in this movie, and completely lacks that Kevin's charm, the kid from the third one is much cooler than this one, to be fair.The movie is not funny, and you are just staring at it without having bit of fun.The entire movie is lacking that Home Alone comedy and vibe... it is hollow...\nThe booby traps are not as smart as they were on the other ones, and here they just feel rehashed.It's a No.",

            "content": "Besides the kid being brattier and FAR more disrespectful than your typical Home Alone protagonist (and yes. More than Kevin. You heard me) and generally merely a tolerable character, this just didn't feel like a Home Alone movie.For one, I get that the other three (we are NOT taking the fourth and fifth into account) were made in the 90s, but this one was painfully, tackily modern - from architecture and furniture to costuming and product placement. At times, the movie felt like one giant ad. I can't explain what made the product placement more prominent than a typical movie, but this one had a few scenes that were shot like ads for car companies.Most of the jokes are great - each break-in scene had me in TEARS laughing - but there are too many quippy Disney-brand one-liners that just don't land.You don't spend enough time with the family, not even the mother. I don't even remember who the father was because he had next to no lines and was just one of the mass of relatives Max had staying with them. The mom is genuine but has very few scenes, so you find it hard to empathize with her, which really is a problem with most of the characters throughout the movie.However, the main problem is the antagonists, who are arguably the protagonists. Pam and - was it Jeff? I had to look it up. It was Jeff - her husband are the part that make this movie feel like it wasn't part of the franchise. I'm not talking about the actors; they played the parts as best they could, but the problem is that you empathize with them. Every home alone movie is clear-cut, black and white, good vs evil. The antagonists are villains that have no sympathetic motivations, and the kid just wants to protect himself and his home from evil people that want to hurt him for profit. That's why they work - that's why you can watch a kid giving grown adults major injuries and laughing about it, and laugh about it yourself. They \"deserve\" it.Pam and Jeff do not. They just want to keep their family afloat, and they don't even intend to harm the kid - in fact, they struggle a lot with the implications of their unlawful actions! This makes watching them slip, slide, burn, and break bones simply painful. Sure, it's hilarious, but you can't get the horror of watching this happen to the protagonists out of your mind while it's happening. Because really, they are the protagonists. You spend just as much time, if not more, with them as you do with Max, and you understand and care about them much more!The resolution is painful to watch as well - you're telling me you befriended the kid that just spent hours putting you in the hospital? You're telling me you spend Christmas together??? No. Nope.Altogether, it's cute, but that's about it. That and the humor win it 3 stars for me, but my nephews loved it enough that I have to give it 4.",

It's no more absurd than the original two (perhaps at points less so).I was surprised it was still almost as jovially violent as the original, which added to the enjoyment - and there were many moments that made me laugh out loud. There is also some disguised adult humour, which I won't spoil by quoting here, particularly with the Smart-device in the home.Great cameo from the actor who played Kevin's brother Buzz in the original too - and this wasn't just a nod, it actually significantly added to the panning out of the plot.All round very entertaining for all ages, and I'd recommend :-)",

As well as the Buzz's revelation that Kevin enjoyed making prank Police calls to Officer Buzz pretending there was a child left home alone at the same address in reference to the two times he was separated from his family during the Christmas holiday.Other than that bit of nostalgia, this movie was not worth watching. It was an extremely poor attempt at reviving a classic which simply cannot be outdone. There will NEVER be another Kevin McCallister, Buzz McCallister, McCallister FAMILY or Marv and Harry.

This is a story arc and illicites feeling for her character, this element is completely missing in this version, she has a Karen, gets a flight and hates the fat guy next to her on the flight home.Just do yourself a favour and watch our 1990 version and feel good about yourself and your family!",

They are not in self-defense, they are out of ignorance posing as self-defense. It makes the movie incredibly difficult to watch. There is no balance in the characters. Sure, Kevin McAllister was no angel, of course, but his badness was outweighed and even made necessary by the evilness of the two Chicago thugs trying to rob his house and kill him.That made all those gags bearable to watch. That made Kevin sympathetic and impressive, even though he was doing bad things. He was doing bad things because he had to and he was a kid processing a survival scenario the only way he knew how.This movie muddled all of that. There's no balance in it. The kid is disproportionately evil in this case, and it doesn't matter that he does something nice for them in the end. You can't even make it through to that part (I had to fast forward). I expected better from Mikey and Streeter. I trusted them to remake this classic and do it justice and what a major let down. Now, I'll know to skip their next film. My creative heart is broken on so many levels right now. I'm not even mad, I'm just disappointed.",

Home Sweet Home Alone Is funny has a great story, great acting & I was so excited that they brought back a main character from Home Alone 1 & 2 & they make many references to part 1 & 2.If you're a fan of Home Alone 1 & 2 then you will love Home Sweet Home Alone.Like Home Alone 1 & 2 Home Sweet Home Alone will become a part of my yearly Home Alone Christmas movies.

If you want to give a little \"wink\" to the source material, you cannot spit on the concept - spoiled brat, clumsy criminals, mysterious figure, which is not as bad as it seems (1 - the neighbour, 2 - pigeon lady). You cannot simply enjoy environment, the characters, the story, if it\u00b4s so weak. The end of the movie was so cheesy (\"criminals\" turned to good) it makes you wanna vomit.All you can do with this movie is the same as with nuclear waste - bury deep and forgot it ever existed.",

            "content": "When I first saw the trailer for this movie, the kid didn't strike me as very interesting - no charisma to speak of, no charm or anything I could really grab onto that would make me want to see more. Still, I assumed when I watched the full movie, more of his character would come through because how could it not? \"Oh, now I get what the filmmakers saw in him\" I'd no doubt be saying. Well, whatever it was never made it on screen. It seems that the people behind this movie accidentally thought that turning the formula on its head would make up for the lack of originality inherent in doing a reboot - that is, they made the criminals the protagonists. Consequently, there's more attention given to the burglers and making them sympathetic and the kid is more one-dimensional and there just to fulfill the minimum requirement of the premise and set some house traps. There aren't really many scenes devoted to get to know him or get a sense of his perspective on the world, so there's nothing that makes you root for him.There are also a number of things that just seem to fill time and don't really go anywhere. The kid wanted some McDonalds early on in the movie and was denied, so you might figure when he's on his own, there will be a shot in the montage where he's eating some McDonalds or maybe a scene where he ventures out and has an amusing exchange with a McDonalds cashier or Doordash driver. Nope. Nothing. Granted, those wouldn't be great jokes or anything, but this movie is too stupid to even attempt paying off its own dumb setups. Then there was something about a teenage girl (the burgler couple's daughter I think) getting some expensive dress that showed a lot of shoulder. So you'd think maybe she'll get some kind of arc and learn something about being materialistic or trying to impress people. No. She just kind of wears it to a performance and then nothing at all happens. Why they heck did you even show me anything about this dress in the first place? Everything just fizzles out and goes nowhere.Back to characters though. Much of the humor in the original two movies was derived from characters. For instance, Uncle Frank trying to get his wife to steal the silverware on their flight. It's funny because you understand what kind of guy that is and how such a CHARACTER behaves in different situations. In this new one, all of the extended family are just quippy interchangeable nobodies with no discernible personalities or characterstics to speak of - apart from maybe you get the sense they were raised on sitcoms. I didn't look up who wrote this but it seems like it was probably a team of writers impressed with their own cleverness and they just switched over from twitter dot com to their screenwriting app for a few minutes and couldn't be bothered to switch up the style. There's room for a character like that, but having so much of the movie's jokes coming from self-impressed smug people trying to be funny instead of characters who are normal people reacting to crazy situations in funny ways really hurts this type of movie. The whole lot them cancel each other out and they become forgettable and tiresome.Along those same lines, there's a weird thing movies do nowadays where they have to draw attention to jokes and have the characters narrate to you in case you are too stupid to get it. Yes I understand that when your feet are on fire and then you are walking in the snow it is hot and then cold. I've seen fire and snow before. I know what happens there. Are you trying to think of how you'll phrase it on social media later or something? Film is a pretty visual medium and there's a lot to be said for showing rather than telling. Trust the audience a little more.I liked watching Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci get beat up more than I like seeing Ellie Kemper get beat up though. I'm more indifferent to Rob Delaney but these new people never threatened a kid and were made to be sympathetic, so the big payoff at the end is just not nearly as satisfying. Another thing on that note, I don't know what it was about these traps that made them forgettable but maybe part of it was you weren't really seeing bad guys get their comeuppance. It just felt sort of paint-by-numbers and uninspired.There was a scene where Ellie Kemper and Rob Delaney are arguing while performing music for some senior citizens. It was meant to be funny but it was just grating. And it just kept going. This goes for most comedy \"writing\" nowadays, but this seemingly-half-improvised, naturalistic overlapping dialogue stuff doesn't count as a joke. It isn't funny. Why do they keep doing it? It was kind of interesting once or twice fifteen years ago but now it just seems lazy - as if the things they are saying don't need to bother being funny, they just need to have enough syllables to fit the dialogue pattern rhythms.I probably missed something but how the heck did the mom know where to find the kid at the end? He couldn't have left a note because she didn't go home first. That was weird but maybe they explained that when I was out of the room.I guess that's all. It wasn't the worst thing of all time, I mean I did sit through the whole thing. But it's a contender for the most useless.",

But while watching this, I actually felt bad for the couple and that made the scenes so UNFUNNY! And what's worse, there was no sympathy for kid as a result.So the thieves aren't really thieves and the kid is not the innocent little protagonist we felt connected with in the prequels.Also, there was very little done by the actors to bring any authenticity to the story. The mother's reaction to knowing that her kid was home alone half way across the world didn't really feel like a mother's reaction and felt too made up. In the prequels (parts 1 & 2) the mother's struggle and journey to reunite with her kid was a side story that added so much depth to the story.

In the beginning, Max isn't that much of a likable character to the audience unlike the original Kevin, so it was harder to watch.

The music is familiar and there's a lot of Home Alone references in it which is cute.The iconic booby trap scene didn't have a lot of build up to it, it just felt kind of meh and wasn't OMG.

            "content": "To begin, since Disney had acquired 20th Century Fox Studio's rights, it means that they made their reboot of the classic movie from 1990 Home Alone. This complete classic has been disrespected by this poorly directed movie adaptation. The plot makes no sense since the structure of it is a mess. It is a mess thanks to the characters, who are different actors but basically the same roles, but the classical roles had been slightly changed because now the main protagonist kid is not Kevin anymore, it's Max, who is a lot more irritating and evil which is not part of the classic role that people, including me, are looking for as a \"replacement\" for Kevin. Not to mention the bad guys are NOT bad at all, they are not the evil on this movie since they only want to save their home by selling a super duper valuable toy who is conventionally there just right in the moment when the main protagonist visit their home and gets missing, making the whole plot of the movie just an inconvenience between a kid and 2 grown up adults making terrible choice that could get them arrest. So the whole entire plot is a waste of time and does not engaged you since you know what would happen by just saying \"mmm, they would know that Max didn't steal it\". But the scene doesn't save this movie to the end, it's painful to watch an evil kid \"defending his home\" from this 2 grown up adults who could easily tell Max \"HEY, DID YOU STOLE THAT ONE TOY THAT COULD SAVE OUR ECONOMIC LIFE\" and Max could easily said \"NOPE\" and the 2 grown up adults could go figure, but this is sincerely a waste of time since you know everything is alright and just boring jokes and scenes past by, making the story completely irrelevant.",

Heck, I would buy them the book!The protagonist commits an infraction with the theft of property from the antagonists. In an attempt to retrieve the stolen item, by the protagonist, the audience is forced to assume the offended couple is the \"bad guy/girl\" of the film. This is fundamentally problematic as it causes a lack of care for both the protagonist and antagonists. The protagonist commits an infraction, therefore the audience finds no sympathy for the bratty kid who is not charming nor comedic. The antagonists seek to retrieve the item to sell for the sake of saving their house due to the loss of employment by the data migration manager. There is an attempt to sympathize with the antagonists for their lifestyle situation. In the end, rather than creating a basic storytelling mechanic of character delineation and development, the characters are flattened into individuals that no one in the audience would care for. The actors merely reflect the writers failure to develop and delineate. The actors themselves were not bad they were given garbage writing and directing. A waste of family time.Apparently Disney has money to waste...",

At the same time, a married couple Pam and Jeff (Ellie Kemper and Rob Delaney) break into the boy's house to return a rare and expensive doll, which, according to the intruders, Max took. The boy believes that the robbers did not come for antiques, but for him, so he equips the house with a lot of traps and repels criminals.Chris Columbus' dilogy, which tells about young Kevin and his exciting adventures with robbers, still remains an indispensable Christmas attribute. It is worth saying that even the most loyal viewer does not risk reviewing the \"Home Alone\" franchise beyond the second film: from the inventive Hollywood comedy, the tapes about Kevin were increasingly turning into television trash, which clearly marked the border between good and bad taste. Therefore, the new version, staged by Dan Mazer, deliberately signed itself up for a strange, largely inglorious existence. Directly continuing the unsuccessful experience of the fifth film with the subtitle \"Holiday Robbery\", the Maser tape came straight to the TV screens - quite in the tradition of \"One House\", which for us has always remained a home pleasure, tied to the New Year holidays and a lazy January weekend.",

I watched the first twenty minutes of this atrocious movie and couldn't handle any more. I already had low expectations for this movie and somehow it was worse than I thought it would be. If I could give this movie 0 stars, I would. Just stick to the first 2 Home Alone movies - the classics. Heck even Home Alone 3 was 10 times better than this one.",

The absence of joy in the plot may have been due to the fact that the protagonist seemed like the kind of person the readers wouldn't want to support. I felt sick to my stomach the whole time watching the film because the antagonists were constantly challenged (even mentally) and had to endure the misery that comes with being misunderstood. If we were going to watch a Home Alone movie, we just assumed that the child is the protagonist and the invaders are the antagonists. Maybe, the writers meant to do it the opposite way around on this remake to become original. However, the actors couldn't get into character because of the script's fixation on overacting.How the makers of Home Sweet Home Alone thought they could recapture the spirit of Home Alone is beyond me even there was a cameo and some moments very similar to the original Home Alone movie. The story's characters almost made me feel so bad that I almost decided I didn't want to see another film made from the United Kingdom ever again. In the end, I came to the conclusion that the film was intentionally made as a teaching tool for those learning the art of filmmaking to exhibit how NOT to write a movie.",

On top of using the same exact plot they use a lot of the same sayings and dialogue. They should've just brought back the original cast and made a new movie and had Macaulay Culkin leave his kids at home. I don't understand why they keep making new home alone movies when the only movies that were good and did well were the original two. I know the 3rd one gets a lot of hate but compared to the other ones I think it's better than 4,5,6. Save yourself your time and don't watch this movie.",
