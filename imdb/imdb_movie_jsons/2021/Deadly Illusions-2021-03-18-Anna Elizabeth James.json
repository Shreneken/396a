It could have been a good psychological thriller but it ends up being a sometimes sexy and sometimes meh slasher flick.The \"villain's\" goals are unclear and nonsensical. The exposition of what makes the villain the villain is hamfisted and comes out of nowhere. The pieces of the early parts of the movie that is used as \"foreshadowing\" do not work.\nAnd in the end, as always, everything is blamed on a mental illness that the writers (and Hollywood really) don't seem to understand.I don't recommend watching this.",

The motives and background were definitely not in sync with the plot it meant to give.The acting was not helping either. When they supposed to be happy they didn't look sincere, when someone supposed to be in shock, they didn't even do what people supposed to do when they're shocked.I personally don't recommend it but go watch it if your day is so good and you need to balance it out by feeling upset a little bit.",

Who is Grace? And what's her background.?Mary the author finally gets over her writers block and begins to write her book.\nSome parts of this film reminded me of The Hand That Rocks The Cradle.\nSadly, there's no real substance in this film to really gather momentum or the viewers attention. The only time it got abit interesting was after Elaine , Mary's best friend was murdered. The story and acting picks up a little then. Overall, this film was too long, when it didn't need to be. The acting wasn't all that good either, the plot was way too over stretched and the story line and script was quite boring.\nI think maybe this film tried to use too many ideas and story lines, that ruined it. Like other reviews parts of the story resembled other films.\nI don't know why Netflix gave it so many stars. This film is silly and a waste of good actor time. Physco nanny and silly plot.",

Why did she remember slashing the bike tires? Why did the nanny slash the bike tires? Did she just feel like walking home? What the heck were the couple fighting about?? That argument came out of nowhere, referred to things that had never been mentioned before, and completely made no sense. I thought maybe I had memory loss too, because I must have forgotten the part where they explained this. What kind of parent has no idea how old their nanny is? Isn't this information people normally ask before hiring a stranger to look after their children? What the heck is with very loudly and casually discussing your fantasies of having sex with your -probably underage- nanny with your friend- who is also your psychiatrist!- at the gym??

I've seen disabled slugs move at a quicker rate than this. The film had no direction either, because literally nothing was happening you didn't know/ or care what was to happen next.The \"twist\" was just pointless. You knew it was coming and it was so cliche. Really wasn't inventive whatsoever and really did sum up this entire movie.Since this doesn't spoil anything I can say this. So a big part of this film is the fact she is writing a book and it really zones in on that aspect at times. Several scenes of her writing etc. DOESNT MEAN A DAMN THING. It doesn't change the plot or outcome, it serves absolutely no purpose. Why bother???Genuinely this is just awful.

In the end it is revealed that Grace is traumatized and therefore \"of course\" becomes an insane killer. I am genuinely angry that mental illnesses like schizophrenia and DID keep getting portrayed like something that makes a person dangerous. This kind of \"person ends up hurting others\"-stuff happens extremely rarely and people who suffer from these mental conditions will probably feel extremely uncomfortable about discussing them because WELL MOVIES LIKE THIS. Using mental illnesses and the incredibly misinformed stereotypes surrounding them as a way to make money is just plain stupid, especially when a movie where these would be corrected would most likely create a much better, well, movie.Also, the movie made it look like she was able to control her transformations, which is ridiculous, it's not like an on/off-switch you press. It happens through triggers. And she seemed to be able to hide the other personality of hers which, once again is completely unrealistic.The ending was confusing and the point where she walks out of the hospital is in my opinion completely unnecessary. I doubt anyone liked that part simply because it was such an obvious \"mysterious ending oooo\". I would have been a lot less disappointed if the movie had ended when they met each other at the hospital -- at least that would've indicated that Grace got help for her untreated illness.",

The premise of the film sees an author hire a young babysitter to watch her children, when the two of them start to build a friendship and connection.Main Character\nKristin Davis of Sex and The City fame plays the lead character here and she is just not very good. Her character is really bland and uninteresting with Davis delivering some really cringe worthy dialogue that made her a character that never connected in any way shape or form.Supporting Characters\nGreer Grammer plays the young girl that joins as the babysitter and she is also really bad here. She delivers line after line of awful dialogue and she just has some truly bad scenes that makes it hard for you to by anything in the film and the supposed chemistry between her and Davis which is never there. Dermot Mulroney plays Davis' husband in the film and he is literally just phoning it in and just playing the same character he does in every other project he is in. The rest of the cast offer nothing as well and the acting is just really bad.Story\nEver since Fatal Attraction was released, Hollywood has believed they can just churn out similar films for cheap with nothing unique and they are pretty much all bad and this one is no different. This film is laughably bad and throughout it does nothing interesting and then the last act happens and it is is just hilariously ridiculous and makes no sense.Script\nThe script is terrible, the dialogue is as mentioned above cringe. With drama, humour and romantic dialogue that are all terrible and the actors deliver it in such ways to make it seem even worse. Then someone wrote the ending of the film and they just had no clue what they were doing and maybe they should move into comedy.Style\nThe style of the film is awful, the pacing is so slow and literally nothing happens for ages and even when it does it is terrible. Plus this film is way too long, a film like this in 2021 should never be 2 hours long and it just keeps on going.Overall\nOverall, this is a truly awful film. Deadly Illusions is one of the worst films of the year so far and is one that should never be seen by anybody.Rating - 1/10.",

Speaking of sex, what I found alarmingly amusing was Dermot Mulroney diving under the sheets like a seal or a porpoise without one flicker of any kind of sexual excitement. Even the ending, which I won't get into here surely was in her imagination? This was telegraphed way back at the beginning when she talked about the \"episodes\" she has when she is writing her series of bestellers..And the acting was pitiful and the whole thing was very rushed. And the twins were so unequal in size as to lift the eyebrows a lot. Defo one of the worst of 2021 so far. Shame on you Netflix for throwing this garbage on our screens.",

This movie is stupid I almost broke the tv when the husband said \"there are only your fingerprints on the knife used on the bike\" Does he have a fingerprint analyst at home because how does he know? Why did he test that knife? When? So man questions.\nOnce again netflix top ranking sets me up. But this time I created my account here just to save other people. Actually ... the movie will be great if it was described as a COMEDY. Everything was ridiculous from the acting to the plot . And even if she was just crazy and grace never existed it is still very poorly expressed in the movie, and it will be more like you are forcing yourself to believe that to somehow give a little sense to the movie because never, you have a hint that she is grace. Let's suppose (again) that Grace was never there, Elaine was her psy ok but why Elaine will ask her to be careful because grace will steal her husband if she was grace? Is it not more important for her psy to focus on her not losing herself than an affair between her second personality and her husband? And why is she not in prison then one year later for killing Elaine? I mean this is what happen when you overthink on a bad and stupid movie. I wish I never watched it",

All the books she has written before are violent and this perhaps is her outlet to remain *normal* on the outside. But since we are seeing everything from Mary's POV we have to ultimately conclude that there IS NO GRACE. Mary is Grace. Through creating this character, a younger version of Mary who possibly was abused as a child herself, she is able to break free from her writer's block and function as a person. The end scene is confusing. She is wearing the same headscarf and coat that was seen on footage of the woman who slashed the throat of Mary's best friend, Elaine. So who is that person leaving the hospital after visiting Grace? I am not sure why the director left us guessing like this. I am also uncomfortable when mental illness is used as a vector to spread disinformation about people who suffer mentally. In the 1960s there was a film TWISTED NERVE that had an insane man commit gross murders. But he happened to have a younger brother with Downs Syndrome. The film alluded to the fact that this murderer had a damaged gene in his family. And Downs Syndrome was the connection. This is lazy and sloppy. I think Deadly Illusions fell into the same trap. I would have liked to have seen an intelligent portrayal of a deeply disturbed woman.",

There were very few scenes in which anyone acted appropriately to the situation. The dialog went from mediocre to atrocious scene to scene.This was recommended on Netflix and my wife and I thought we would give it a go.

So are we supposed to believe that she's imagining the events that follow? That would make more sense than accepting the preposterous behavior of the characters. Then in the climax everything is retrofitted to try to justify the ludicrous preceding 90 minutes but still doesn't make sense.\nAlso did Kristin Davis chip a tooth?

The only reason I spent two hours of my life on this loophole laden and at times, utterly predictable erotic thriller was only for my fave 'Sex and The City' star Kristin Davis. She plays a middle age novelist going through a writers block and to devote more time on work, hires a young nanny (Greer Grammer) to look after the kids. Not long before she starts sexually fantasizing about her sweet new employee and worse, unable to differentiate if this lesbian liaison is indeed her dream or the real world. Intense, eh?!!..you may ask.Nah, on the contrary, Deadly Illusions is like those typical B movies of Hollywood watched largely for guilt pleasure than anything else. The plot is unreal, the twists are laden with glaring loopholes and the climax (or anti-climax if you could call it that) is a huge let down with some unanswered questions. To put it bluntly, the film just crumbles in the last fifteen minutes. Sad to say this as there was a good concept here which got mauled and killed by inept execution.As for the ever charming Kristin, her performance is the best of the lot and you will actually sit through this muddle of a movie only if you love her. Others can skip it safely!!Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

There is no real babysitter as such. It's herself, the mother who will not have enough time for her kids. That's why the babysitter is such a clean type, called Grace, her age sometimes 20 but sometimes 40. She also is the main character of her new book. Things get messy. Keys to understand are scattered around in the movie, but it just never becomes clear for most viewers. The note about her illness, the slit wheel, her visit to Grace's schizophrenic relative etc. It would have been a more helpful ending to understand, if at the end she would visited 'Grace', they would played cards but looking into the room we would only have seen Mary.

            "review_title": "So disappointing",

The film's description says: After a bestselling novelist suffering from writer's block hires a new nanny for her children, the line between fiction and reality starts to blur. It's a psychological, erotic thriller that is so badly executed that I'm giving you fair warning here.THINGS I LIKED:\nFans of Sex and the City will be excited to see Kristin Davis starring in a feature film. Unfortunately, she's not a strong enough actress to save this film. Her character is conflicted in many ways. I thought it was sweet that, as a mom, she had different handshakes to say goodbye to each of her kids when she dropped them off at school.Greer Grammer stars in the movie and also produces it.I liked the original musical soundtrack by Drum & Lace.Every author's writing process is different. In the movie, we see Kristen Davis' character writing her book with pen and paper, rather than on a computer. I have some author clients who do that. We also see her create a storyboard on a big board, a technique I recommend to my clients because it really helps you \"see\" the story develop and allows you to be very intentional where you place certain scenes.Husbands and wives need to be extremely careful in order to protect their marriage from external relationships and impropriety. For example, my husband NEVER drove home our female babysitters. It wasn't that I didn't trust him or our sweet babysitters. Too many crazy things can happen based on what other people think could have happened, you know? It's just not worth it. No, people shouldn't assume or judge, yet they do.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nEven the title isn't original. So many books have been written with the same name.I'm surprised that Dermot Mulroney went for this script.Weird and creepy. I mean who takes a complete stranger bra shopping? That's the first scene when you realize the movie is ridiculous and it just gets worse.It's often hard to know what's really happening and what's fantasy. Of course, that's the point because the protagonist can't either. Then again, the execution and writing are so bad that it makes you wonder if the writer and director even knew.There are some really terrible acting moments.There's a terribly cliched flower moment.Lots of exposition.There are twists but they're ridiculous with so many details that don't make sense. We're left with more questions because Act 3 is a complete mess.There were some \"Gollum\" moments that made me laugh out loud. (The psycho hobbit in the Lord of the Rings)TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nThis movie is NOT appropriate for children. Plus, they'll be bored anyway.You see a married couple rolling around under the sheets. Then later, they do it in a kitchen closet.You see some skin when two best friends are in a spa sauna & shower.A pretty girl wears an immodest bathing suit. You see her in a bra many times.The mom smokes cigars as a symbol of her warped and developing manly obsessions of a young girl.A woman goes skinny dipping in the pool. Later, you see part of her naked chest in a bathtub.Tons of inappropriate sexual illusions.Two women kiss.You see some blood in a murder scene.Some profanity, crude language, and an F-bomb\nYou see the naked backside of a man in a shower\nViolence.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",

But, if that doesn't tell you all you need to know, then you need educating about film reviews...\nFor now, I'm going to assume the ending is predictable and lame. The first 1 hour and 45 minutes is, so I don't see why that would suddenly change.\nIn summary it's essentially a modern day remake of The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, an early 90's film that was good for its time. They've altered some aspects to modernise it, like make the live-in babysitters obsession with the mother become sexual, in addition to it being sexual with the husband. But otherwise it wanders no further from the hackneyed plot of \"obsessed outsider infiltrates and ruins family\".\nIt's one of those films that I think people in the industry still think they're right when they have meetings around tables and say things to each other like \"We're gonna show people how wealthy this family is because people love seeing opulence!\" When in actual fact that approach is dated and considered very unrelatable these days.\nIt kind of attempts to make you wonder whether the main female character or the babysitter character is the one causing the problems. But it just comes across as muddled and unclear. You get what might be flashbacks, might be memories, or visions from the main character of both herself and the babysitter doing terrible things, because apparently she \"gets very dark\" when she's writing... yawn. She gets so dark she randomly goes completely mental, dropping the f-bomb at the dining room table in front of her kids, after no hint whatsoever that she was about to lose the plot. And everyone reacts... as if it's fairly normal.\nSadly this film suffers far too much from those annoying experiences viewers have, such as saying to him/herself \"You wouldn't do that / say that.\" Or \"Why did she do / say that?\" many times throughout the film.\nUltimately, it bears little resemblance to normal people and normal everyday life, which is a shame because it's a straight up drama based on earth in 2021...",

Grace's motivations for killing off the family are never revealed, besides the fact that she says she is \"insane.\" Also, the children are absent for the majority of the movie when Grace was hired to be their caregiver. Lastly, my major bone to pick with this movie is its portrayal of DID, previously known as split personality. This movie further perpetuates the stereotypes associated with DID and continues to stigmatize the mental health disorder. The movie continues the harmful narrative that individuals with DID are \"crazy\" and prone to violent outbursts. In conclusion, not only does this movie contain terrible acting, cringeworthy dialogue, major plot holes, but it continues to demonize a real mental health disorder.",

While I was writing that I was thinking: \"I haven't seen Music or Deadly Illusions, so maybe it's not the worst?\" So, I gave one of these a try and immediately regretted it. This is far below a bad movie. This is an awful movie. The story has no clue what it wants to be. The acting is below mediocre. I laughed out loud multiple times about how bad the performances are. The dialog is not good. Its clich\u00e9 stuff and so on the nose that it hurts. Also, the technical aspects are so annoying. Why are there so many cross-fades? And was the audio doing to this poor actress voice in the end? The only reasons I'm not going below a one star, is because it kept me mildly intrigued. It kept me interested enough to not turn it off. But that third act oh my god. The ending is so badly executed that I wanted to get drunk, so I could forget it as fast as possible. I still have so many questions. It's very hard not to spoil the ending, but why did this person go through all the trouble to get there? There is no reasoning at all.

There can be a persectuors in a system, but these alters do not go out killing other people.\nAlso, what was up with the ending of Mary leaving the hospital wearing the same clothes from the police video???\nAnyways, the movie is absolutely terrible, and I do not recommend anyone to watch it even if it is in the top 10 movies in your country.",

A slack, pathologically unimaginative, non-Hitchcockian snoozer of the lowest order. Greer Grammer fortunately doesn't take after her father in the looks department, as she is the only fresh, fetching face you'll find here; unfortunately she doesn't take after him in the acting department either. She seems overly surprised, like she was just goosed, in most scenes. Sapphic picnic in the dead, khaki weeds by a river. A punctured tire wheezes. Lazy framing. Why? An inconsequential child plays a quick flute solo and fails to propel the plot. San Francisco in a Santa Fe soap bubble? Several grotesque shots of a somnolent, snake-skinned Kristin Davis (who plays a monosyllabic writer?!) smoking cigars. Why? Speaking of gross, Shameless Dermot Mulroney (I'm constantly confusing him with Dylan McDermott, though the latter can act some) gets some impromptu, much needed liposuction in one of the unintentionally funnier scenes. There is no mystery, everything is telegraphed and spoiled early on. Like who didn't know the killer would be female after a good scissoring? Shanola Hampton (also of Shameless fame) is the only actor who decided to show up. At least she knows shoot from, well, Shinola! Netflix hits a new nadir.

It's amazing that a movie can be almost 2 hours long and lack any actual character development and avoid moving the story forward whatsoever. Here is the entire movie:\n1. Movie opens and has a character explains who Kristin Davis is because they have no idea how to reveal it normally. 2. Husband \"makes a bad trade\" that you never know anything about and it's implied he loses half their money, though they are rich. You never see a lifestyle change or anything else come of this. This is revealed in a 2 minute scene on their patio and it's just over. 3. Kristin Davis has to write a new book now so she interviews nannies for a while until Greer Grammer shows up and gets the job. She spends the entire movie shopping and doing weird activities with the parents who never seem to spend any time with their kids. 4. Davis spends the whole movie telling everyone how \"weird\" she gets when she writes and you're not supposed to be able to tell if she's going crazy or if her affairs with Grammer are real or not. 5. Davis magically finds a family member of Greer two hours away and gets a dumb little traumatic backstory out of nowhere. 6. Davis' best friend is murdered, they think Davis did it but she can't be sure because she's sO cRaZy WhEn ShE WrItEs. 7. Greer is mentally ill and tries to murder the couple and locks the kids in a bedroom. 8. Davis wins the fight and Greer gets sent to an institution, but they're still friends and Davis visits her.

And not an interesting one. This movie barely if at all let who you know the characters which I understand isn't really developed fully in a movie, but this just barely scrapped the surface of anything that would want to keep you engaged. You don't even have to focus on this movie, more like slow background noise where half the movie was kind of silent. This is actually a reason I never got into watching movies, it's 1 1/2 - 3 hours of a forced plot, sometimes okay or even good, but there most the time seems as if writing these plot lines, even the writer would be best to serve his time doing something else. The acting was cringe worthy, awkward, and the part that bothered me the most was when they were having dinner, random scene again, and she told Grace basically I thought you said you didn't intrude on family time, but then Starr's screaming about her husband and Grace sleeping together, but yet the husband sat there as if he were gaslighting her as well. I mean so your telling me a couple who has a good marriage, has a nanny show up and she is sleeping with husband and wife for them to never know. And yet she got the nanny to cook, clean, and watch the kids but yet the nanny is hardly ever with them, she's what, giving massages by the pool or in the bath, and creeping about in a very drifting away movie.

            "content": "I think many of the low reviews are a result of misunderstanding the film's point. On first viewing, the ending can be very frustrating. If time is spent thinking about the plot and perhaps with a second viewing (I know! I know!), I think more viewers would find much less fault with the film. There are a few hints throughout that point to a logical conclusion (or two).I believe the entire film is just Mary's book plot. We see evidence to support this theory. THis does not imply, however, that Mary is a well-adjusted author; she is not. Towards the Deadly Illusions ending, a close-up of Mary's storyboard with many things that happen in the film are noted. For example, her fight with Tom is mentioned there. The police officer also states that many events that have happened in real life are in her manuscript as well.When we learn Elaine is Mary's therapist, her notes say that Mary loses time and she's worried about her mental state. Elaine also comes to see Tom to talk to him about Mary's mental state. We also have various quotes from Elaine implying that \"Grace\" isn't real. Elaine's worrying about Tom's infidelity with \"Grace\" could easily be Mary projecting her fears of Tom being unfaithful with Elaine in her fantasy conversations with Elaine.Mary continues to lose grip with reality, resulting in her murdering Elaine and using the nefarious \"Grace\" from her novel to take the blame. Personally, I think It seemed way too easy for Mary to leave the police station, so I don't believe she did. I believe she's arrested for Elaine's murder, tried, and sent to a psychiatric ward.The best proof, I think, that the plot is novelized is the scene that plays out late in the film with Grace getting angry after applying for a job at the nanny agency, then we see a do-over with her being calm about the rejection. That's Mary rewriting the scene in real time. She decided the angry and cursing depiction didn't fit Grace's character, and, thus, rewrites the scene..\nMary admits, on more than one occasion, that she gets messed up while writing and often can't tell fact from fantasy. This phenomenon is what makes it so confusing to viewers. How are we expected to know when she doesn't know herself? If she were, indeed, hospitalized after her arrest for Elaine's murder, then everything that happens afterward is imaginary-> Mary and Grace have merged.",

She announces that when she writes, she transforms into someone she herself cannot control, and therefore without a nanny, her children will face neglect. Her husband Tom (Dermot Mulroney) is a busy executive too, and both are delighted with Grace (Greer Grammer), a young girl who opts for the job and is an instant hit with the kids.Grace however, is more than a handful as she starts to take control over the household, enters a passionate and steamy relationship with Mary and even seduces Tom. The sudden murder of Elaine, Mary's closest friend, suddenly wakes Mary out of her stupor as Grace is a suspect. Mary soon discovers that Grace wasn't sent by the agency she had contracted for hiring the nanny and that she is a known patient of split personality and bipolar disorder. In the meanwhile, Grace attacks Tom viciously at home and leaves him bleeding profusely. Mary is able to save Tom, but Grace is sent to a mental rehabilitation center that Mary visits often. She is also able to complete her new novel that she dedicates to Elaine, whose murder remains shrouded in mystery.Deadly Illusions meanders midway and loses direction completely before pressing the accelerator again towards the finishing line rather abruptly. It leaves many loose ends in need of being tied and also has a rather underwhelming climax, open to interpretation much more than anticipated. As such, it is a rather insipid outing with oodles of opportunities lost in the procedure. Performances are listless too, as no sympathy gathers for anyone concerned.",

Anyway, I see this flick with Kristin Davis and wondered if it was that awful one where her character's name was \"Babette\" (seriously) just to hear KD annoyingly say that name again. (KD has an annoying voice to me since I first saw her on MelrosePlace.) Then it started playing and I thought her character was going to be blind and when she wasn't blind I just figured I'd watch it and if it got too awful I'd turn it off. But I didn't, unfortunately.All the other 1/10 reviews are accurate and fair. This is just plain atrocious. I thought it was going to have at least some potential, I mean KD and Dermot have been in the biz for decades, at least we'd see some decent acting. So, KD is a very wealthy famous writer who accepts a book deal because her trading/gambling husband just lost half their money in a poor trade. But when she writes books, she goes crazy or something not developed or explained. So she needs a nanny. If you get to that part, turn it off. It's as bad as you can imagine after that, and really it didn't make sense. KD hires this nanny who literally just shows up at her doorstep after a day of KD interviewing potentials from some agency. She hires her on the spot WITHOUT contacting the agency to find out more about her. Why would a very wealthy famous person with a husband and two kids not at least run a background check on her??? Anyway, this young woman is beautiful, and I was immediately getting lesbian vibes. Great, this will be a twist on THTRTCradle, possibly interesting. But... KD just hired her and is kind of crushing on her, and she takes her to some ladies store and is helping her pick out bras. Maybe I am totally clueless about women, and I think I'm tuned, but do women, especially a boss and her new young employee help each other put on bras that fasten in the FRONT??? I kind of thought that you would try on the bra YOURSELF to see if it fastens quickly/easily? And this wasn't even her best friend since childhood, so they weren't exactly \"sister from another mister\" level in their relationship. Anyway, it just gets weirder and weirder with the sexual stuff. Then of course this nubile young woman predictably seduces the husband, keeps drugging KD it appears, and then KD's actual bestie gets murdered. And the police already know that it's a slam dunk case against KD before they even question her. God I hate these movies where the cops act like this... and her husband is a tool and DOUBTS her. Uggh. And quel surprise we find out that it is, shocker, the NANNY that is crazy af. At the END. When she slashes the husband and tries to kill KD. And this whole movie KD is working on her new novel where her publishers wanted her to go in \"a different direction\" anyway, so I figured we'd get a final scene where KD's resumed writing career gets a major resurgence, but nope. She has a manuscript entitled \"Untitled\" or \"Unnecessary\" that she dedicates to Elaine her bestie. But the worst is, the final scene is KD actually VISITING this psycho in the hospital and hugs on her and plays cards with her and then walks out of the hospital. What in the actual heck? It made no sense.Really, don't waste your time. And this is like the 20th Netflix stinker I've seen, I just don't understand why these craptastic movies are given the green light. They are awful, but not even in a funny, campy way. A waste of time.I at least.",

I have no idea what Dermot's daytime job was but he seemed serious about it.That scene at the end was just stupid. Suddenly, Grace is a 10-year-old playing crazy eights?

That is a clean and boring movie and it we had had transitions showing her mind separating from reality it would not be a bad movie, just a boring one.The insane murderous nanny is another plot line hinted at in movie trailers and Grace is charming enough that possibly she could pull it off, but again the transitions and editing do not really deliver that theme through to the end.The last plot line included in this Deadly Illusion movie is usually one of my favorites that being the classic just who's reality are the characters living and acting within. And there is just not enough of the characters paths to discovering which reality is the one they are in here to warrant other than the star above.This is not as bad as the one and two star reviewers imply as we get a story told with care and intent--it is just not told well enough to follow. BUT this is not a good movie by any means no matter how it is being hyped and promoted as the trailer is all you really need to watch and then let your imagination run wild--that would be more rewarding.It is hip to include hinted at or actual lesbian scenes now so that is one more way to interpret this movie as a movie made to check off obligatory boxes in what one considers essential to a movie line. And if so, at least make it believable next time.Another way to review the movie is the stuff filmed in Albuquerque was awesome three stars for that setting and then zero for plot, acting, and compelling characters.",

Kristin Davis and Shanola Hampton would have ever done this is either they loved the idea of duality in horror (who doesn't?) or they made some pact with the devil in exchange for their talents. The script was really bad. I knew right away it was not going to be a solid pick, since the pacing almost felt like a Lifetime holiday film on a bad acid trip. The three listed above did their best with what they were given, especially Mulroney, but man, the direction and those horrible lines! Not to mention the plot holes were crater-sized and many of the characters' actions were implausible to anyone with common sense...and I have quite an imagination and can still not see anything like this going down in any circumstances. What was with the bra shopping? \"Oh, hi, I am your brand new boss, but I am going to take you bra shopping and GO IN THE DRESSING ROOM WITH YOU.\" Such a natural unfolding of events we have all experienced at sometime, amirite? Some other highlights include twin kids that look completely different ages, horrible acting by some secondary actors, a psychiatric disorder many doctors deny exist and a storyline that defies logic in any universe. I mean, where did the extra bike come from? If she \"hadn't done this in a long time\" (as in, riding a bike), why did she have a brand new adult bike just sitting around ready for them to go on a long, sensual ride to the lake (where they had a full spread with wine yet no character was seen going or coming back with any supplies)? It's little things like that, over and over again that just makes the viewer wish they had bowel problems so they could take a bathroom break to avoid another scene. Just don't watch it. It will make you depressed that actors like these are taking on projects like this. I was debating a 1, but gave it a 2 since you do get to see Mulroney's bare ass and that is never disagreeable as far as I am concerned. But someone's going to be up for a Razzie for this excrement and it will be well deserved. I wish Netflix refunded money for things they say are \"#3 watched in the nation\" but suck this bad. It's uncool to set viewers up like that.",

This is nothing against the actress but how the producer chose to display \"mental illness and/or trauma\" in a \"haunted shizophreniac\" way. It was also not well executed in my eyes but the major issue I have is the framing and not the execution. The creepy voice over was just the overkill and made me actually chuckle cause the whole movie all of a sudden felt more like a comedy with slight \"scary movie\" style.So overall I think there can be charme with this type of movies in 2021, as hommage to the evil nanny, what is real what is illusion genre, but sadly not in this case.",

Everyone has seen this trope before and, with no surprise at all, Netflix is pioneering in this lazy, unthoughtful and incorrect twist. The babysitter of the film, Grace, is the one who is supposed to have this mental illness, it's a shame that it was done so lazily.Warning: if you watch multiple movies like this you will receive a never ending headache.

It's around here where the acting really starts to drop off as well, it turns from a Riverdale quality film to a 2002 Disney channel, straight-to-TV quality film. The more absurd the plot gets they more the actors seem to with draw from their roles, like they really just don't care about putting the effort in anymore. The main actresses performances in particular go from good to desperately bad. From an action point no of the hits have impact, even the really violent scene are just so uneventful and you don't have much reason to care for the characters.In the end, the exploitative portrayal of dissociative identity disorder and the inclusion of a child abuse plot, which closely resembles the Turpin case to an uncomfortable degree, were the final nail in the coffin for this film.

I've seen worse movies and just click away without needing to rate it up or down. It wasn't just a formula film, it wasn't from Sundance but it is good. Just the very, very bad babysitter genre, one thinks, yet that's merely the surface framework. The writer stresses out over competing priorities when she has to work. Hence, her strong reluctance to consider writing again and refusal of book deal offers. She's really into to raising her kids, enjoying her wonderful family wants to put all that first. Unexpected occurrences lead her to cave-in to the pushy publishing agents and accept new work. The psychological hell of all the suspicions and doubts about hiring the perfect and pretty young nanny begin to arise. The low reveiwers, (not unlike anyone who falls unawares into mentally troubled waters) are titalated yet frustrated, just don't follow the pure, wordless dipiction of descent into mental illness. So one star givers, Get over it. And the film is perfectly fine for what it is, easy on the eyes, not escapist fare. An enjoyable, though predictable film that one should watch knowing that stylistically it's very, very obtuse, which isn't going to gain great acclaim. Not typical hollywood, but along with nice sets, great cinematography it's fine to spend an hour with if you're not doing anything else.

It's ungodly cringey and probably offensive to people. (That's not how DID works btw but sure let's just add to the stigma and misunderstanding of the disorder all together) Not only did they make Grace a character with DID, but for some reason also her aunt too?? Ok??Literally the only thing it adds to the plot is when Mary goes to visit her in a psychiatric facility, out of pity I presume. Only to be murdered and stripped of her clothing so Grace can wear them out of the building and escape. Which if the producer's were absolutely NEEDING that to be the end of the movie and couldn't possibly have it any other way, it could've easily been done without her having multiple personalities.In conclusion: Stupid, Boring, Uncomfortable Sexual Dynamic, Cliche, Slightly Offensive, and Poorly Done",
