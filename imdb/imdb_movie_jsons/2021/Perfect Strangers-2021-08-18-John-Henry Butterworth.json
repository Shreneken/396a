            "content": "Four strangers, a family of three, and a couple come to an unconventional wellness center run by a Russian immigrant (Nicole Kidman). She asks them to surrender their phones and be open-minded to a variety of therapies, and as the series plays out, we find out they're dealing with a number of issues, including death, substance abuse, bad relationships, anger, and crippling self-doubt. Kidman's character herself has been traumatized and is on a journey of her own, but as a therapist some of the techniques she employs teeter on the edge of being unethical and possibly harmful to her clients, so that even as they make progress, it's a conflicting, somewhat scary ride.At the heart of it for me, or at least what I thought was most successful, was the storyline revolving around the parents and their daughter who were trying to come to terms with the suicide of their son/brother. The feelings as they unraveled were truly touching, and the performances from Asher Keddie and Michael Shannon were excellent. Also wonderful were Melissa McCarthy and Bobby Cannavale who play an author and retired NFL athlete who start off detesting one another. It's a little predictable where their story is going, but it has nuance, humor, and a depth of feeling that kept it from becoming sappy.Less successful was the subplot with the married couple who've lost their sizzle (Samara Weaving and Melvin Gregg). Her self-esteem issues were the most well developed and held some interest, but it just didn't seem like enough was done with this pair. The guests are rounded out with a mother whose husband left her for a younger woman (Regina Hall), and an uncover reporter (Luke Evans). Hall's performance stands out for its intensity, and how her story intersects the therapist's adds a nice little wrinkle.Overall, it's a well-made production, with great cinematography, trippy effects, and nice soundtrack. The ending is overly rosy, but there was so much pain in the lives of these characters that I forgive the series (or the author) for that. It definitely held my interest and was fun to binge watch.",

            "content": "This series starts with such a bang and is promising and highly mysterious once the characters unfold, but from there on it's just a drag of the characters, the story goes in to lose its pace and strength. The worst is the ending where as if the writer was not sure which way to go but chose something that all will find appeasing. I don't know what genre to put this in as well. It's starts as a drama then starts to look like a drama thriller and then falls flat on its face. Bad script as well Sorry to all who have given high ratings, but I was totally disappointed and found it a waste of my time.",

Buoyed by some tremendous core performances but the plot wobbles often as the show leans far too heavily on the star power, sucking time away from Regina Hall's mesmerically volatile Carmel and making Ben & Jess seem hilariously superfluous in comparison to McCarthy, Kidman or Shannon. It's got some nice photography and it'll keep you guessing along the journey - but it doesn't particularly stick the landing.",

I hate the way this show ended - everyone accepting multiple boundary transgressions and believing that the ends justified the means. A therapist who does not let a patient lead, who pushes them out of comfort again and again, who puts them at risk for their own selfish needs is an abusive therapist. This would NOT heal people. It would traumatise them. Their loyalty to Masha was trauma bonding, not transcendence. We should not glorify cult leader tactics, they exist in the real world and have done great harm.",

            "content": "\"You have all come here to die. I will bring you back.\"Nine stressed city dwellers visit a boutique health-and-wellness resort that promises healing and transformation. The resort's director is a woman on a mission to reinvigorate their tired minds and bodies. Nine Perfect Strangers is another limited series by David E. Kelley, creator of Big Little Lies and Sharp Objects, based on the novel by Liane Moriarty, who also wrote the novel Big Little Lies. We're greeted with what we've seen before: big cast, impressive cinematography, and an intriguing mystery. The story may not be as fleshed out as the other shows, but the show is interesting enough to go all the way through. The cast is really what carries it. As strange as the casting may be, especially Nicole Kidman, they all end up fulfilling their characters. We reach into a different level of each character every episode. It can take a while to find a liking to all characters but by the last couple episodes we can gage who they are and how much we like them. Melissa McCarthy, Michael Shannon, Bobby Cannavale, and Tiffany Boone stood out from the whole ensemble. You can see definite growth. But the real star is Regina Hall as Carmel. From the start, she's the character we can sympathize the most with, but she has so much to give and she gives it her all!Continuing on with characters, part of the problem with the show is the characters. There's nine plus people we need to get through in a short period of time, and as you might have been able to tell, not all get the treatment needed. I feel bad for Samara Weaving and Melvin Gregg because they were so forgettable, maybe not Weaving as much. Their story is essentially thrown away by the end and they didn't do much for the story. The family that gets most of the time has an interesting arc, but it can be a little too much time when they come to a conclusion and then go back to it an episode later. Nicole Kidman's story ends up crossing paths with another and it's handle in a way that's so unsatisfying. Jonathan Levine could've raised the stakes with the way he directed it, but as a new genre for him I think he wanted to focus on other aspects. The first two episodes were very impressive and the ending didn't really nail it, but the others I liked. Episode 6 actually took my interest in how it was shown visually and written. The cinematography looks absolutely stunning, especially outside with the nature shots. You can see the inspiration taken from Midsommar. The overall aesthetic was great, and I think that's what they wanted to get at. I just wish they fleshed out the story much more. In the end, Nine Perfect Strangers is an entertaining watch, but nothing super captivating. Each episode has something interesting, but it doesn't quite lace everything together nicely.",

I only watched the last episode in fast-forward because otherwise I would probably have fallen asleep. Even for a feature film of normal length, the story about a Russian therapist who is primarily concerned with herself would have been too poor and too quickly transparent. Here you are tortured for 8 episodes, at a pace as if you were riding a tricycle along an interstate. Nicole Kidman in the lead role has the necessary skills, but her Masha is ultimately just a clich\u00e9 about Russian women - here, unfortunately, with too much Botox - and of the rest of the cast, only Melissa McCarthy can keep me from falling asleep to some extent. A series that completely wastes its potential.",

The most important thing to me is there isn't one bit of filler in this series, every minute and moment adds something interesting. Each character has their story, their secrets and their vices. As the show progresses and unfolds, the more info is divulged and unraveled, a surreal turn of events makes itself known.The cinematography and visuals are glorious, views are breathtaking. The contrast of the setting to the unraveling characters.The fruit smoothies look delicious.The Russian host (Nicole Kidman) has no need to be Russian, it adds nothing to the plot, and doesn't sound Russian, I am not sure why there needs to be an exotic host from somewhere that isn't the US.. it ends up sounding like a faux, generic European accent and it is annoying. She is very interesting without it, is the perfect ring leader of the ragtag group.It's hard to not be absorbed in this fascinating, riveting, and captivating series.Update. My initial review was about half way through the series. After watching the end it's definitely slower as far as pacing goes. Also Nicole Kidman is incredibly hard to watch in this just as she usually is in everything. The bad accent makes it worse.The momentum just falls off a bit, maybe could have been shortened by an episode? It's worth the watch but it's not groundbreaking by any means.",

My thoughts are why would they add that detail? Surely anyone can see that it's just terrible, so many options and making her a Russian adds little to the story.That being said not much happens in this resort retreat series. There is no drama, well maybe you could call a potato sack race tense. After 3 episodes there is nothing there, every show ends with a cliffhanger sentence to lure us to watch another episode.Even the title is misleading, as 3 of the 9 are family members. This is just bizarre that this got approved. 2 stars for the Australian scenery.",

Every character, except maybe Nicole Kidman, was amazing in this show. As the characters progressed, I felt myself liking each of them far more than I initially thought I would. The scenery is eerie and beautiful setting the landscape that things are not what they seem in this paradise-esqe, \"tranquil\" place. The show unfolded giving you just enough to remain vested, but I never really could figure out where it was going. Even one episode before the show ended I was still not sure which direction the show was heading. It seemed like the mystery of what was really going on was intentional and I appreciated that. Then when the show finally starts to come full circle, utter disappointment settled in because the ending was unfortunately significantly anticlimactic. Which was such a huge let down because it had all the tools to be great, except the most important part: the story. The ending could be considered \" happy\" and was intended to be satisfying, but if I'm honest, I was very annoyed. I can't say I regretted watching the show, it just could have been so much stronger and many elements that seemed like there were going to be of some significance to the overall story, fell completely flat. I can't say the show was terrible, but it wasn't all that good either.",

I'm not, never read it or thankfully non of the reviews on here prior to taking the plunge.See, as I'm usually the sort to despise pretentious garbage and the usual crowd of \"intellects\" that sing its praises to the rest of us lowly peasants; I tend to give more credence to honest reviews (most of which these days seem low).Most 9 or 10 star reviews on IMDB are from cast/crew of the films or their families/friends.On this occassion however, I'm genuinely surprised at the negativity for this show.This isn't a show I would usually go for but there was nothing else on and so I went for it. I'm five episodes in and find that despite it being a slow burning mystery and tale of intrigue, it actually does have a decent pace and isn't filled with long moments of artsy staring into the camera, deafening silences or angled shots of inanimate objects.Another reviewer stated Melissa Mcarthy is the only decent act in this show....?Erm, what? Whilst she definitely is great in this, they're all decent performances. Michael Shannon's is fantastic.Others saying Nicole Kidman's character is \"strange\", \"weird\", \"like an alien\" etc......\nI'm sorry for this but you're showing your IQ levels up a bit here; as she's MEANT to be like that....that's the POINT!Her accent? Meh......but I'm not gonna get hung up about it. She's not the first to mess up an accent, nor will she be the last. If you're the sort to let one little thing ruin everything for you, then good luck with that I guess.Overall I laughed out loud a few times and got a lump in my throat on others.I may be getting more soppy over my years but I find the gradual bond between the characters to be heart warming too.All the while the plot thickens and the boiling pot simmers in the background.I'm enjoying it a lot and I'm usually a tough-to-please member of the audience......Each to their own though......",

I can't believe it's the same guy.I'm sure the other actors are absolutely killing it.

So don't watch it if you're unwilling to go the distance, which isn't that far, just 8 episodes.At first, I thought it was going to have a \"White lotus\" type of ending, just some cliche finale where murder happened and the culprit is revealed, but not in a million years would I have guessed the direction the show was going even though there were several inklings along the way. I don't think it's the best show out there or anything, but it definitely doesn't deserve poor ratings; the first couple episodes weren't bad either, just left you a little all over the place because you don't get to piece together the full story yet, only that something unorthodox is happening so it's definitely worth a wait till the end before making up your mind about it.

The casting is quite different to what I'd imagine the characters to look like from the book, however I still thought the casting was great. Especially Melissa McCarthy, Bobby Canavale, and Regina Hall. Their characters were hilarious. I like that they made it quite funny; they mixed the drama with comedy wonderfully. They have changed quite a few things from the book, especially with Carmel's character. I preferred the book's plot which saw Masha having a heart attack from overworking rather than being shot. They changed the end with them being locked in the room...that scene should have been a lot longer, and the Marconi's were supposed to be in there. It's quite an important scene in the book and they're supposed to work together and figure out how to escape, there's so much more to that scene; it's so much more detailed in the novel and they made it almost insignificant in the show.

There's a lot of intense psychology, so maybe not for people who aren't into that kind of thing. It is also a mystery / thriller, as there seems to be an alternate story still waiting to be uncovered, especially with Kidman's character (who is a great character). It also probably won't sit well with religious types, given some of the themes.Much like the therapy endured by the guests, the show starts softer and lighter, them becomes more intense each episode. Sometimes it almost hints at mystical elements, but this is not a primary theme, merely a plot device. This show is rooted in science and psychology, not the supernatural. The most incredible thing it does is flesh out the characters; we start off thinking they are all deeply flawed, then come to understand their viewpoints. It's a sort of exercise in empathy, which is great for the times. I would definitely say it's worth the watch, if even just for the wonderful Melissa McCarthy.",

I love Luke Evans (Lars), he is such an underrated actor and he led me to watching 9 Perfect Strangers. After seeing the trailer I thought maybe the story would take a dark turn so I went on Goodreads for spoilers on the book.First let me say Nicole Kidman (Masha) has gotten more beautiful with age. I recently watched Malice and while she was cute she is definitely better now. Also I think she did a great job with the Russian accent.Michael Shannon was absolutely heartbreaking as Napoleon and he had me crying a few times. Every time Samara Weaving (Jessica) spoke I kept thinking of her character in the fourth season of the show No Activity. She was really good and so was the guy who played her husband.I just binge watched Black Monday starring Regina Hall as a badass Wall Street stockbroker in the eighties. After watching that then seeing her as Carmel I was struck by what an amazing actress she is. At one point she completely terrified me.My only complaint is the relationship between Frances (Melissa McCarthy) and Tony (Bobby Cannavale) as there was no chemistry whatsoever and the relationship felt forced.I doubt I would ever read the book but I did enjoy the series.",

I was hoping that the end would show the people who attended the retreat were wrong to trust Masha and that they'd be (rightly) traumatized from their experiences. But somehow their lives became perfect, complete with fairytale endings. Not only did Masha cross boundaries with the retreat goers, but she also had zero qualifications to be doing any sort of therapy, as far as the viewer knows. I was waiting for a character to ask for her credentials and push for it, but it never happened. To me, Masha came off as extremely sketchy, untrustworthy, and cult leader-ish, even and especially up until the end. It was sad that all of the retreat goers stopped questioning her insane tactics after a while. In reality, I do not believe any of these people would be cured by the extreme \"therapeutic\" methods, but would instead need to be healed all over again from the experiences they just had. Masha was painted in a far too sympathetic light. While the acting was great and somewhat moving at times, overall this show is promoting harmful ideas. That ruined it for me.",

The young couple are ignored and don't have any therapy at all. Nor does Lars. The other couple help each other. By the end, the whole thing is hopelessly contrived, ignorant and phony, and I despised the last five minutes.

I mean, I knew it was probably horrible a few episodes back, but I kept thinking the promise of the 1st episode would pan out. It didn't.Nicole Kidman's worst role, ever. Terrible fake Russian accent and just one dimensional. I usually like her, but in this role she couldn't take the leap. Mealy mouthed controlling guru person. Ewwwww.Way too, too much time spent on the grieving family. Episode after episode, same ol' stuff. None of that was ever resolved. Just bor-ring. The interesting InstaGirl and her husband could have been used more and had a good story line. Like do therapy on a social media addict!Ironic that Kidman would act in such a blatant condemnation of \"Western psychology\" after being married to Tom Cruise, who lectures about his Scientology beliefs that all psychiatry is bad. I just am shocked. Not to mention, it's incredibly irresponsible to even suggest that dosing people with mushrooms, LSD, Ecstasy, etc is even a good or therapeutic idea. I'm a psychonaut from the 60s, and still use mushrooms, but you have to take care, esp with LSD, etc. And what she did to them, leaving them, taking it herself, and all for a self-serving reason, is nothing a show should give an unclear message about. Esp a show dealing with suicide (not one, but TWO). Not to mention the way Carmel was treated. I realize that psychiatry is imperfect, but for the mentally ill (esp violent), you need something besides hallucinogens and vague, New Age mantras and silliness. I agree that psychedelics should be allowed to be researched and the laws relaxed, and they can help, in certain circumstances (NOT the truly mentally ill) to facilitate therapy, but this show was just WAY, way out there, and never did come down to Earth. Like a bunch of dumb 14yr olds making a show. In responsible hands (NOT Masha's), they can do good, but this is not it and just adds to the stigma it is seemingly trying to end.I don't know how to take this show. Is it a parody of amateur New Age gurus? Or is it being serious (with the lukewarm \"twist\" at the end)? Plea for greater acceptance of psychedelics? Or kind of horror? Or just trying to be edgy? I can't get a read on it at all and it's frustrating. I'm going to go take huge doses of magic mushrooms, LSD, Ecstasy, and DMT and think about it as I experience ego death with my guru... Seriously, I lost a sibling to suicide last Christmas, my best friend, and a parent to it some years ago, so it is just bizarre and troubling, suicide being the main thread through the episodes. How NOT to accept death that is already, by virtue of suicide, incredibly hard to grieve and accept. Obviously none of the series creators or writers have ever dealt with it themselves and if they have, then shame on them.",

The story itself centers on the spa guests' faults, regrets, transgressions, insecurities, etc, and the pace is pretty fast since we have to examine those elements for each of the nine in addition to several of the troubled staff loyal to Nicole's \"Masha\" character. I believe this was designed as a single-season mini-series so you're going to wish there was time/budget for a 13-ep run instead of the short-ish 8 eps. Especially since the final scene makes no sense, apparently was thrown together at the last minute, too bad, and those two things are why it's a 7 instead of an 8 or 9 for me.",

McCarty stands out because of this genre: it think she hasn't been funnier before and yet so lovable and real. Kidman adapts a thick accent, one could argue about it, but one could also see that she is again giving a wonderful character with emotional depth.A smart choice of the series was the way suspension was build. Not only does the viewer want to know what is keeping the characters stuck in pain, who shot Masha (Kidman), who is sending the threats, but also the series takes you to a point where you wonder if this kind of therapy is more damaging then healing and might even demand innocent victims. And who could imagine that at the end you would root for one of the more debatable characters. That's good storytelling to me. Love, love, loved it.",

            "content": "SummaryHeartless characters, a more theatrical than cinematic dynamic, repetitive and remanned situations, ineffective thriller ingredients and some scenes bordering on the ridiculous characterize this stretched miniseries that shows off some good performances, very good technical lines and the always interesting presence of Nicole Kidman , with a character that only she can sustain.ReviewA group of people attend Tranquillum, an expensive resort in the middle of the Californian hills that offers healing treatments and that is directed by Masha, a guru of Russian origin (Nicole Kidman), in order to overcome her traumas, which we will know sooner than late and that include (as usual) marital crises and breakdowns, creative crises, disappointments, losses and unresolved griefs.Tranquillum's gallery of \"nine perfect strangers\" and patients consists of a writer (Melissa McCarty), a divorcee (Bobby Cannevale), a gay journalist (Luke Evans), a young millionaire couple (Samara Weaving and Melvin Gregg), a fickle woman (Regina Hall) and a married couple with their teenage daughter (Asher Keddie, Michael Shannon and Grace Van Patten). The main staff of the retreat is made up of Masha and hers two young assistants of hers (Tiffany Boone and Manny Jacinto).Nine Perfect Strangers (9PS) suffers from many problems. In the first place, its soulless characters, whose problems (very common) are described and treated in a way that does not generate interest or empathy for them. More than passing things to them, the characters talk all the time about what happens to them and what happened to them. Although there are some good lines of dialogue, sustained by good performances, this theatrical stamp is not effective in this case. The same happens with the interactions between them, their frictions, approaches and distances, in a dance that becomes repetitive. On the other hand, the links between Masha and hers two of her assistants, and Masha's interventions as a \"therapist\" are more suggestive. Kidman marks very well the difference between her behavior with them and the \"professional\" with her patients.Added to this layer of drama is the thriller subplot, characteristic of Liane Moriarty's novels, related to Masha's past, certain strange behaviors of some characters and, above all, with the mystery of what are the hidden purposes of the character of Kidman and his curious treatments and of Tranquillum in general. Not coincidentally, this structure of unknown characters forced to live together in an isolated setting refers to the novels of Agatha Christie.The miniseries (and its conflicts) looks unnecessarily stretched and repetitive and abounds in situations that surround the ridiculous. Instead, the direction, the lighting, the photography and the beauty of the locations are to be highlighted. The actresses and actors do what they can with her soulless characters, surrounding an angelic, mysterious and perhaps Machiavellian Nicole Kidman who, as always, makes the most of her strange Masha. Only she can sustain such a character.",

It set up the intrigue well but didn't progress from that point on. I felt no empathy toward any of the characters. Their emotional travails was of no interest to me. Special mention needs to go out to Nicole Kidman who just came across as weird and creepy to me. Physically she reminded me of a Wraith, the life sucking half bug half human aliens featured in Stargate Atlantis. In my opinion the Wraith exhibited more personality than Kidman's character. Sad as I enjoyed her work at the beginning of her career.",

It happens to premiere mere days right after the jaw-dropping finale of \"The White Lotus,\" and so comparisons and expectations start to be made, being that both shows feature the idyllic backdrop of luxurious resorts. By episode 3, it becomes apparent that this is nowhere anything like \"The White Lotus,\" but perhaps more reminiscent of themes from \"Homecoming\" where Bobby Cannavale also stars in. At any rate, when that plot line is introduced, it feels very anti-climactic. The subplots don't deliver anything noteworthy either. I just enjoy the banter between Francis and Tony, Michael Shannon's acting range contribution, and of course Nicole Kidman's performance especially at the end. The rest of the \"strangers\" are rather forgettable. For example, the rich, young couple seems like they are just extra and are not really part of anything. Grace Van Patten, who reminds me of a young Shailene Woodley, clearly has a bright future ahead of her, but the storyline she is given here gets repetitive and a bit boring. Overall, this is worth-watching just to see the all-star cast bicker at each other, but don't expect anything satisfying at the end.",

I found myself hooked all the way through, and found the end to be quite interesting.The series makes a lot of statements -- more than appear at first glance. It's the kind of thing I'll probably be thinking about for several days now that I've finished it. Lots of \"life\" themes that really made me think about my own life and relationships, even though I have literally nothing in common, circumstantially, with any of the characters.All of the actors really brought their A game in my opinion. I love Melissa McCarthy in anything, I won't lie. She didn't disappoint here (she's not only funny -- the lady can act!). Michael Shannon: amazing. Luke Evans: what a textured character he played. I was not familiar with many of the other actors, but I thought they were amazing, from the spa guests to the staff. (I feel like I'm giving a Travelocity review, haha!) I used to detest Nicole Kidman, but she has grown to be one of my favorite actors over the years. Some have criticized her \"Russian\" accent in this. It won't win any awards, but it was fine. And overall her performance was outstanding.I agree with some reviewers who say this series may seem to glorify behavior that would be truly reprehensible in real life. I would recommend not watching it for \"real life\" but perhaps seeing if any of the themes hit upon something in your interior life. I would NOT be in favor of any of this stuff unfolding in the real world (I don't want to give spoilers, so I'm avoiding saying what \"this\" is) but I found myself deeply moved while watching the characters process so many of their issues.I thought it wrapped up just fine. It didn't go in the direction I personally expected it to go, but I didn't feel disappointed. It was neither too formulaic nor too dark (given the material that preceded it!). Queensryche's \"Silent Lucidty\" as the closing song on the last episode was the perfect touch.If you're going to watch it, I'd say watch it in its entirety and then judge it. It's a complete story, not a series of little stories contained within the episodes. Would definitely recommend!",

But then the minute they go in they act like they were there against their well and keep wanting to leave, and of course the retreat staff keep trying to convince them to stay.

Did I just miss her magical abilities somehow? All they do is drug people with psychedelics.This special super secret retreat is microdosing these very disturbed, depressed, unwell people, but only have a total of five people running the place. Depressed and violent people on psychedelics in a place with high cliffs and water all around. Yeah that sounds like a great idea. What could ever go wrong?Delilah (one of the people working in the retreat) looks concerned all the time and questions the doses about 5000 times in every episode.

Scene-stealing as well as filler performances were all on point in this 8-episode series - not sure if there's going to be a season 2.Nicole Kidman's Masha Dmitrichenko was a strange character and role, but appealing and enigmatic regardless. So many amazing A-listers graced this production, and they weren't just there for the popularity vote. They all did good work on this project. Shoutout to Melissa McCarthy's Frances Welty, Luke Evans's Lars Lee, Bobby Cannavale's Tony Hogburn, Samara Weaving's Jessica Chandler, Melvin Gregg's Ben Chandler, Asher Keddie's Heather Marconi, Michael Shannon's Napoleon Marconi, Grace Van Patten's Zoe Marconi, Regina Hall's Carmel Schneider, Manny Jacinto's Yao, and Tiffany Boone's Delilah.It was nice to watch how exceptionally these (and other) characters carried the plotline that lay at the core of \"Nine Perfect Strangers\" on Amazon Prime Video. Various writers came on board for sundry epis, and each one wrote wonderful scripts that revealed key tidbits only as and when needed - truly kept the mystery and tension going steady.Kudos to Jonathan Levine for being the best captain this ship could possibly have. Through 'nine perfect strangers', he managed to convey a sense of humanity, mystery, thrill, suspense, diversity, and deception, and he did it using elegantly crafted characters and superb timing.Marco Beltrami and Miles Hankins did good work on musical scoring for the entire show. Their work complemented several key scenes and sequences, to say nothing of those calm-and-cool reveals as the show went on.They also interspersed the episodes with some brilliant classic and relatively contemporary songs. My favourites were Peggy Lee \"It's A Good Day\", Gladys Knight and the Pips \"I've Got To Use My Imagination\", Gabriels \"Loyalty\", The Platters \"Only You\", Annie Lennox \"No More I Love Yous\", The Avalanches \"Running Red Lights\", Nicholas Godin \"What Makes Me Think About You\", Ronnie Milsap \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby\", Rihanna \"Love On The Brain\", Stevie Nicks & Don Henley \"Leather And Lace\", Dusty Springfield \"The Windmills Of Your Mind\", Audrey Hepburn \"Moon River\", and Olivia Newton-John \"Xanadu\".Yves B\u00e9langer's cinematography was a delicious blend of vivacity and character-centric focus. It was great to see the way he captured each performer in their best light. Outstanding costume, hair and makeup, art direction, and production design as well. They were all subtle and neat, with no tendency to excess. VFX and stunts were good, and 'coloured within the lines'.This series took an ordinary wellness centre - a 'transformation retreat' called Tranquillum in Cabrillo, California - and made it the centre of a not-so-wholesome conspiracy with sinister and mysterious goings-on. \"Nine Perfect Strangers\" was a bizarre show that broke a few conventions while delivering one of the most entertaining and variegated stories, with psychedelic twists, that I've seen so far in 2021.",

I was even pleased to see the guy from The Good PLace (Jacinto) onboard in a serious/mysterious role. But then halfway through the third episode I found myself watching the clock--that's a good barometer for me. My favorite shows zoom by: 60 minutes and bam--the credits sneak up on you. Some examples are The Sopranos, The Wire, Deadwood, Homeland, even the White Lotus, which many have already noted the similarities to this series. But White Lotus had some real stakes (death, possible incarceration) along with very funny self discovery. Anyway, thanks again, I won't be wasting any more of my time on this one.",

It would be a grave mistake to keep your mind closed and stay tightly opinionated before you've actually reached out and learned something new, something real, true, tested, and analyzed, something completely aside from your what your parents tried to scare you with. They certainly knew nothing different than what our trusted government and our traditional prescription based pharmacology (Big Pharma as we now call it, once we realized what kind of a machine it truly was) and medical professionals told them, and so societies developed a very one-sided, pre-conceived, view of consensus about psychotropic therapy. In fact, many even today dismiss its benefits offhand, assuming it's just another way for Stoners to try and justify their fix, and feed their dependencies without shame. And after all, who hasn't wondered at the irony, the lack of reason shown by an adult with their forth martini in hand lecturing their young about the evils of drugs, hammering at you about Cannibus being a gateway drug to heroin, in denial to this day, most likely, for societal norms and acceptance take a long time to change. Outdated ideas, truths, and morals literally have to die with their hosts, leaving way for a new generation to swing the pendulum back when it's their turn, and this can be maddeningly slow when it comes to our most obvious, urgent, and progressive ideas. Just look at how we are experiencing the ugly, cruel, and inhumane legacy of 400 years of slavery, bigotry, and systemic racism - even now, even still now, a century and a half since we fought the most costly and all-important civil war. Not since our war of independence have we had such an outright challenge to the democratic way of life, so closely linked and akin with what our two-party political system and former leader, a certifiable and self-serving megalomaniac in the time-honored Office of the Presidency, directing actions, which we now have proof in hand, that were intended as nothing short of a coup. But I digress... forgive me if the last four years and COVID have taken their toll on me.I ask you in all sincerity, where would mankind, medicine, industry, technology, and science be if not for those who rail against the system, asking the impertinent questions and demanding timely answers, answers that come with verifiable evidence, and satisfy the query? Much has been done, to be sure, but much more needs doing if we are to consider ourselves leaders amongst the worlds most powerful countries. If we are to grow beyond the limits of our imagination we must dare to do the unimaginable. We must not be afraid to ask why. Children aren't. Children in their first years are learning at an unprecedented rate, one we will never know again, and the whys come just as natural to them as breathing. So Why as adults have we stopped asking why, and why have we learned to accept no response to our questions? Or worse still, recycled rhetoric. It is precisely this attitude, and No Other, that will allow us to cure hunger, poverty, pollution, gain the upper hand in medicine and therapies, cure disease, conquer dementia, and yes, even tackle and reverse climate change. Because if we don't ask the questions, we'll get no answers, and That, my friends, That is the end of Everything!So in the tradition of every explorer, every inventor, professor, conquering king, pioneer, and spiritual guide, I give this film, a film which dares to push beyond the known limits into uncharted territory, I give it a 10. A 10 with a smile on my face, a spark of hope in my eyes, and a Great Big Thank You!",

It could have been so much more because the story was actually a pretty cool concept. Its problem was that it was poorly told. It was slow to evolve, and it caused my mind to wonder into the various ways it could go. Instead of making us wait until the last couple of episodes to inform us of the direction it was taking, it should have done so at the beginning. I am quite certain that many people found it boring and dropped out after the third or fourth episode. The only reason I stayed with it was because I had nothing better to do, and the acting was actually quite good. I rate the skills of the acting at 9 out of ten stars and the story an eight. The way the story was presented though is only worth a one. If that. So, eighteen divided by three gives a total of six stars.",

She is supposed to be from Russian descent, but the accent comes and goes. And what is supposed to be this larger than life intimidating figure, very quickly loses after the 1st episode.Michael Shannon on the other hand, impressed me - amazing range across the span of a few episodes.Quite a few clich\u00e9s in there - there's a romance brewing throughout the show which was incredibly obvious from episode 1; as is the character arc of Masha.Also disappointing was the actual \"therapy\" involved in the story. The show is supposed to take place in a one-of-kind wellness centre which gets amazing results through unorthodox methods. In what is at worse a mild spoiler, I was disappointed to find out this \"therapy\" consists only of drugs...All in all I think this show had the budget and talent to be much better; but fails to deliver on a promising trailer and plot (I can imagine the book it is based on must be great source material).And pales in comparison to how refreshing White Lotus was!",

I've seen most of what I think of as shows capitalizing on the Big Little Lies lightening-in-a-bottle success (The Undoing, Big Sky, Little Fires Everywhere, even Sharp Objects to some extent) and most of them sadly don't quite hit the mark. This is the best offering of the bunch so far, while having a unique enough story to be engaging. I enjoyed the first episodes very much, and am glad they dropped more than one!Positives so far:\n*Location and intrigue (I am avoiding book spoilers; I don't know where the story is going)\n*Good Pacing\n*Excellent Music and Cinematography\n*Every character is very interesting and I want to know more. On the surface they seem like caricatures of the kind of people to attend an expensive retreat but I'm not mad about it.*Casting is nearly perfectMy favorite actors/characters so far: The Good Place's Manny Jacinta, Bobby Cavale, Mellissa McCarthy, Tiffany Boone (young Mia from Little Fires Everywhere), and Samara Weaving.Negatives so far: (not much!)\n*Sadly, Nicole Kidman is the biggest negative here! I wish first and foremost they would have skipped the Russian part of her character as her fake accent is terribly inconsistent and distracting. Plus since it is a similar show to Big Little Lies, I only see Celeste all the time. Loved her as season one Celeste (though overall season two was a big letdown). She annoyed me in The Undoing, so maybe I'm just tired from the over-saturation of Nicole Kidman in these kinds of stories?*The only other negative at this time is some of the characters are a bit flat right now; but I do think that will change as the show progresses and they each get their moment. Need more from Luke Evans, Michael Shannon and his teen daughter, Samara Weaving's husband guy, and Regina King before making final verdicts on them.Overall, a great start! Probably an 8-9 rating at this point; I will update my rating after the show concludes. I recommend giving it a shot!",

I never read the book so I don't know how close it is to the novel. Apparently people didn't like Nicole Kidman's character? Not sure why, I thought she was one of the most interesting and mysterious characters in the show. There were moments that I was able to call ahead before it was actually revealed. The biggest one was how she was drugging everyone. I called it with-in the first episode and then the third or fourth episode she was forced to admit to it. So there were obviously predictable moments in the show, but I still really enjoyed the show. It's different from a lot of stuff out there. I think I liked it so much because I really loved the casting and their characters. It was deep and emotional.",

It happens to some folks who come here from other countries after they have been here awhile. It happens the other way around too. Americans in other countries start to pick up hints of their accent and blend it with their own. It will only be a distraction if you let it be and if you still choose to let the accent distract you, you will miss out on some great acting.Moving on... Kidman is wonderful in this role. She is supposed to be mysterious and intriguing and she is. Her expressions are perfect and that is one of the hallmarks of a truly mysterious person, they express more than they speak.All the other actors are top notch too and just as mysterious. I'm loving watching their layers fall away, exposing them for who they really are and why they are at the retreat in the first place.This is well worth the watch and I am eagerly awaiting the next five episodes.",

Melissa McCarthy plays a good part, maybe she should ditch the \"comedy\" roles as she is funny as a children's cancer ward.The plot, such as it exists, is paper thin. I hoped for some hint that things were not as they seem, that the group were at the health resort for some other reason than their health, that something sinister lay beneath. Sadly after 3 episodes nothing of the sort happens. The woman running the show, Nicole Kidman, gets some threatening text messages but these aren't made much of. The rest is just people whining, sorry, talking through their first world \"issues\" like how difficult it is to adjust to winning the lottery or the trails of being an Instagram Thot.I've no doubt that some will find it all fascinating, I suspect mostly women.

The characters often display verbal and physical abuse to self or even to others. But I think one of the therapy session, the \"fire therapy\" to simulate near death experience and stimulate vulnerability was a spot on when the conflict escalate.I like how all the characters develop, and even find love from each other.

(To say that is an understatement; My feelings for book-to-screen is VERY well-documented with MULTIPLE hours of ranting).Well, I guess I'll never question Hulu again! First of all, you have Melissa McCarthy. I have loved her since she was Sooki on Gilmore Girls 21 years ago (holy moly it really has been that long since GG aired). I've followed her career closely over the last two decades and have watched most of her performances. Here, they let Melissa be Melissa. She's well-composed, honest, and (no surprise) hilarious, delivering every line effortlessly and with humour. Right in the first episode, we get dramatic moments with her that are absolutely heart-wrenching and already showing the actress' incredible range. I was blown away.Then we got Nicole Kidman. Holy moly. If ever there was the perfect casting for a role, certainly this was it. Like in the book, the woman who runs the retreat is beautiful, mysterious, and absolutely enchanting. Kidman plays the role so well I'm breathless every time she's on screen.I see in some reviews people complain about the pacing. If you've ever read a Liane Moriarty book, you'll know that she does the \"slow burn\" very well. Her writing is in the complexity of her character and their relationships with one another. When watching the show, you should be asking yourself, \"What are they hiding?\" Because in a Moriarty book, no one is as they seem.I hope people enjoy this interpretation of Nine Perfect Strangers.

Marsha is a good person, in case you haven't noticed how kind she's been to all the guests (and no, I don't think she's faking it). I love Nicole's character in this- it has made me develop quite a crush on her. She's so nurturing and sweet, as well as beautiful as Marsha! Why so many complain about her accent and all, I can't understand- I love it!!As for the show itself, it is stunning; superb acting, visuals, dialogue, etc. It really keeps me interested, and it's a real treat for the eyes and ears. I was hooked from the very first time I heard the fabulous theme-song, and it's now my new favorite show! I love everything about this show. It's thrilling, mysterious, beautiful, and touching all at once. Highly recommended!",

If you have read it, you see that there is not much left of the story. The smoothies, fastening and not talking were really big aspects of at least the first half of the book. In the TV show they don't do the silence or fastening and you only notice the smoothies bc they were a big thing in the book. Also after 3 episodes they already reveal the big twist, which only happens in the book at like 90% of the story.. I get that they spiced the TV show up a bit for TV purposes, but why make a TV show based on a book of you're gonna ignore 75% of the story? I'm curious to see what they do in the remaining episodes, but so far I don't have much hope.",

There is no old house that took so many pages of the book, or the silence that took quite many chapters, or the gate that refused to open.There is a mystery to an extent, but there is no arc to it. There was no prime point in the series (until episode 5) where you would like to revisit and watch it. There are funny moments and light tones and that's about it. It's no salvation. The married couple looks married and nothing in their marriage is falling apart. Luke can conveniently hide stuff despite being watched under surveillance. You will not get the smiley tattoo or the bonding of Frances and Tony.The direction is horrid. It is only good as a college movie. Oh! And there was a GOAT! No metaphor, no symbolism, nothing. It was just a Goat!Characters are unwinding in a haste; Lacking to score the connection of empathy with the audience. The moment you decide to like a character or even feel sorry for it, it will transform into something it wasn't - blaming it on a smoothie!Leaving aside the book, even considering the multi-talented actors and giving the benefit to this show as an independent (of the book) project, it is still BAD.",

It is really distracting to look at and it does not serve her nor her work, which is such a loss.I was surprised by her failed Russian accent. She has been one of my favorite actors and I didn't believe a review that stated this fact until I heard it myself. It is really weak, not expected at all.The show has promise during all episodes. I was really interested in knowing how it would end and I can say that I was not expecting what I saw.As a therapist I have to say: Masha was a broken person from the start and people who are that much broken can not heal others. She mixes her own experiences with those around her, she is deeply manipulative. Both really off tools to be able to help anyone. Manipulate? Yes.Then there are the drugs. Please be aware.

HOWEVER, After the first few episodes the show bears little resemblance to the wonderful story from the book. Little tweaks and changes were not made but a sea change of plot points were ripped out and ruined. I am very disappointed with the direction of CARMEL and Masha as written (actors are amazing) because it unnecessary. Carmel is NOT a psychopath.

There are a few good moments; Melissa McCarthy as the washed up writer and Michael Shannon as the grief stricken dorky Dad have some strong scenes, but nowhere near enough to sustain you through 8 tedious episodes.

There are unanswered questions like was Masha guilty from the previous client that died in her facility? What did the police think about her drug affiliated tranquility resort? Was Masha getting shot have anything to do with losing her daughter? Where do they get her staff from and do they all sleep with Masha lol. I didn't mind the series but I was just expecting more. It kinda went flat by the end. I think if it didn't have known actors like it does, it might not have been popular at all. The scenery is beautiful.

The writers make a lot of good points by discussing how unhealthy drugs are even when prescribed by a physician. People have been helped by taking psychedelics dating back thousands of years. Many indigenous cultures used these drugs to treat spiritual issues and that's really what they did here. While it felt unsafe at times, life feels that way too. The main complaint I have is that the producers tried to fool viewers into believing that was California. We don't have banyan trees here.

Certainly should have dropped the Russian accent as it's hopelessly off.There is no suspense, and it's not thrilling. Gratuitous sex scenes repeatedly pad out the story.

Shannon is an impressive actor and I'm eager to discover more of his work. I didn't care for Kidman's character, I wish they had abandoned her Russian origins backstory even though it's in the book, because I couldn't buy it and it was distracting.

When you change THAT MUCH, why even bother making an adaptation at all? Just a sad grab for plot twists and clever writing that just fell short.",

Take people with pretty common personal dramas, avoid any complicated trauma with a subsequent deep analysis or something that could raise people's interest, just make it plain boring lives of the type \"I'm no longer a successful writer/football player/etc\" and you have these 9 people who you can't care less about. I have no idea of where this will go but I start feeling like I don't care anymore.

            "content": "\"Tranquilum\" is the resort to be in. It offers inner peace, rejuvenation, meditation and rediscovery of self and a promise that the guests, upon completion of their stay, will return with total transformation. It's exclusive, by invitation only, follows a strict selection procedure and is expensive, virtually a once in a lifetime opportunity. Masha (Nicole Kidman) is the spiritual healer here at Tranquilum and its chief architect, a woman of Russian lineage who personally oversees the operations and creates customised experiences for the guests. She is ethereal, shrouded in mystery and authoritative.So when a batch of nine guests from very diverse backgrounds get selected to attend a stay at the resort, the atmosphere is pensive as no one knows what to expect. Most people are there with a purpose to address - broken marriage, death of a loved one, depression, self pity, or dying romance, everyone has a reason, well almost. Their phones are confiscated right at the start to ensure that they don't face distraction and several of them get tested for blood! Strange, why would a resort prescribe blood tests? The guests are about to find out. Over the next few days, they go through a transformation of emotional states, to the discomfort of many, but not without some alignment with their individual objectives. They are also going to find out how Masha is achieving this, to their astonishment, and yet they decide to see this to the completion.Nine Perfect Strangers is a very unique experience, told vividly. With an ensemble cast led by Kidman and including stars like Michael Shannon, Melissa Mccarthy and Luke Evans, watch out for some exceptional performances and an intriguing plot that will keep you engaged through the eight episodes. Nicole Kidman is obviously top of the pick as she essays a role that is steeped in mystery, in total command and yet vulnerable. Michael Shannon and Melissa Mccarthy are fantastic too, and so are Tiffany Boone as Delilah and Grace Van Patten as Zoe Marconi. Don't miss this one directed by Jonathan Levine, and enjoy a beautiful backdrop, lovely music and a laid back discovery session.",

            "content": "Spoilers from the books... Which might not be spoilers for the show...I watched the first two episodes so far and I was mildly disappointed... it was nothing like the book. I personally loved the book, written by Liane Moriarty. She's incredible. The book was so descriptive and slow paced (which I loved) so when I started the first episode I was mildly let down with how fast paced it was. Obviously you can't include everything from the books but there wasn't many things similar between the two.First big difference is the location. The set is beautiful but it's nothing like how it was pictured in the book. When I read it it was described as an older Victorian building (at least from what I remember) and it's nothing like that. Masha's office was in a tower above the building but here it's just a normal room.Second, nothing is in order and many things were changed. Nobody sees Masha for a big part of the book, that's possibly once again because it's more slow paced but in the show she was introduced to other characters in the first ten minutes?Third, in the book Masha has a heart attack in an office and in the show she's shot...? And who is the girl in Masha's visions? I assume a daughter which would be another difference. Mashas child was only a baby in the books when she's talked about.Fourth, the relationships made so far didn't happen in the books which is fine just not what I expected. Lars and Zoe were never friends. Zoe and Francis were closer. Also Francis doesn't realize Tony is there for what felt like a long time. Also Carmel was not like how she's depicted in the show. She was depressed the whole book and was really quiet.Fifth, I'll stop soon, they took out the part where they can't talk for a few days which was a huge part of the book. Like at least 80 pages. They also didn't do the burying hole thing.Sixth, almost done, Masha was never like... romantic... with Yao until the end when everything goes wrong. Yao is the one with the crush on her.Seventh, last one I think, the room where they all gather is some big dome in the trees but in the book it was in a room in the mansion. It might not seem like to big of a problem but it kinda affects the whole main problem at the end of the books. In the books they are locked in the room and they are made to think that the mansion is burning down... how is that going to happen with it in some dome.Eighth, okay last thing for sure, since it's so fast paced it almost doesn't seem believable with how much power Masha has over the guests... like in the show she's making everyone like cry within the first few minutes of being with them? Like it just doesn't seem believable. That's why I think they should've done what happened in the book and not introduced Masha to the group until they've been broken down a bit. Cause in the book it's like they've already gone through so much and then they meet Masha and they're totally overtaken by her. I don't know if that made sense.Anyways I'll still obviously be watching it and I thought it was pretty enjoyable to watch regardless of it not really following the book and being fast paced. I guess I was just kind of expecting how close big little lies was to the book and how good it was all portrayed. That's why I think if I hadn't read the book before watching I would've definitely given it a ten because I wouldn't have had any expectations for it to follow certain story lines, etc. :)",

Her eyes are very expressive, and you can just see what a great actress she could have been, had she not destroyed her upper lip.If you can get past that, this is an excellent series. I can't imagine what they're going to do for the second season, as they covered the entire book, very thoroughly, from start to finish. What could be left?",

I like it.Zack is a fat emo kid - I like it.Lotto winning couple (can't think of their names) are mixed race couple and SHE looks the overdone plastic part she plays in the book to a T but her husband makes zero sense. Not because they are a mixed race couple - he's not even HOT. Like, at all. And she is all like \"please bang me again\" and it makes no sense lol.Tony is PERFECT I LOVE HIM.So Nicole Kidman isn't an ethereal being whatever it's finedefinitely like that they got rid of the Noble Silence because that would have been a boring showMelissa McCarthy wears a wetsuit in the pool and I cannot decide if it's a cop out or geniusBasically a lot more stuff is happening at the resort and I am into it.",

It would have been stronger to have each person more integral to each other, in one past moment that felt individual to each and initially unrelated and then to eventually understand their connection of that moment at the last episode. I watched the whole first season in one sitting. Overall I don't think I will watch it again as I didn't find anything deep enough, twisted or tricky enough to relate to or have to explore again later.

Are they just there to be the token pretty people?Not a fan of Carmel, but I think this was a casting stuff up. I much prefer Regina Hall as a comedic actress. I am hoping her character will get better and add to the storyline. Also....why the freaky eye? To make her look scarier/crazier?Overall the show drags on a bit, feel like we still don't know too much about anything really but I'm still hooked.

They may have benefited if they ever watched it past the first episode. Call me cynical but when suicide as a theme treated in this way, it's no wonder society sees rates increasing as superficial myths are perpetuated by lack of inconvenient truths. At the very least, the sister character should have been a twin brother and that may have helped drive a greater understanding for young male viewers but boys, as opposed to girls, wouldn't have been a bigger driver of subscriptions.Two jarring elements besides the entire drip-fed story lines - the inappropriate use of Xanadu music and the nerve wracking iPhone alarm sound. Yes, if you didn't need therapy after watching the entire 8 shows, then you sure did realise after Xanadu and being woken up for close to 10 minutes by the loud, jarring iPhone alarm, perhaps placed to wake up those put to sleep or dead from reaching the end of the Season 1, that the writers and those participating in this bad endeavour were in need of something far better in their lives.

I felt it distracted from her performance and even the character itself. The shows first (and only) season did not reveil clearly enough why she's here and where she's been. Unfortunately, this is true for all characters. A lot of time is lost on unimportant storytelling. The only story being really told is that of the Naploen, Heather and Zoe and it's full of amazing shot and acted scenes.

With a cast that boasts of Nicole Kidman, Melissa McCarthy, Michael Shannon, Luke Evans, Samara Weaving, Regina Hall, Bobby Cannavale, Manny Jacinto among others; the expectations were sky high! But the only thing or one \"high\" here is the cast. Kidman's Masha has a weird accent, Shannon seems out of place as the over enthusiastic father, Weaving is miscast as the beauty obsessed Jessica. McCarthy & Cannavale are the only ones who are bearable.Nine Perfect Strangers could have been so much better given the tepid source material. They could have improved it a lot given the immensely talented cast. Sadly, the creators manage to make it much worse than the book!Tranquillum House is our second mysterious (fictional) resort of 2021. But do steer clear!",

            "review_title": "Notes on therapy",
            "content": "There's a reason why most therapy, with or without psychedelic microdosing, is not carried out like this, as is there surely a reason why most set-ups like this in fiction devolve into nightmare cult scenarios. Whether those two reasons are precisely the same, the nightmare's ultimate failure to appear here (despite a little flirting with it to tease us) is, on paper at least, wildly implausible.Instead we get a fantasy of a total, highly accelerated, deep dive psychotherapy capable, in one week, of curing a murderous psychotic and totally repairing the family of a recent teen suicide. To achieve these and other miracles, the process here must dispense with the simple old therapist's tools of a long training, a quiet room, patience and close attention in favour of a luxury spa in a verdant paradise, wildly elaborate mind games, fasting, sweat lodges, hot springs, skinny dipping, primal screaming, violent acting out and, in particular, escalatingly drugged smoothies.(Wait, didn't we try all this in the '60s and find it bogus?!)It shouldn't work even in fiction any more than it probably would in real life, but somehow for me it did. I'm not totally sure why, but I think the point well made may simply be about how difficult it is to identify, share and finally unpick the tangles of knots in our own psyches and how that can certainly make such extreme measures feel desirable. Some of the more plausible group therapy scenes here reminded me a little of the old '60s films of Fritz Perls's gestalt therapy groups (several available free on YouTube), which appear similarly quick at getting to remarkable depths. I've often wondered watching those films whether there was a way to make that kind of material work in fiction. Nine Perfect Strangers sort of does it, though I'd like to see it handled much more austerely, without what one of the characters here calls the Instagram moments, which are perpetual (even if they're not allowed to share them on Instagram).It is, in the end, good to talk, good to engage with others and good to get past the resistances that prevent us from doing that vulnerably, humanely and honestly, and I liked this for the way it shows that. The drugs part is pure BS though, just another version of how narcotics both legal and illegal are so often resorted to as a shortcut. I know psychedelic microdosing is currently developing a lot of therapeutic cach\u00e9 and there may be something to that. I haven't looked into it yet, but I'll lay ten to one it's not being done like this, with the microdoses switching abruptly to macrodoses and delivering realistic hallucinations of dead loved ones.Meanwhile, what I do know of therapy can achieve strongly beneficial effects in terms of insight, relief and general happiness with no drugs at all. Gestalt is good (check out Perls's, Hefferline and Goodman's book 'Gestalt Psychotherapy'), but I think Transactional Analysis is even better (as laid out in Eric Berne's books) and have also got an invaluable address to anxiety from Hilary Jacob Hendel's book on a therapy called AEDP, 'It's Not Always Depression.'And here's the big problem with NPS's therapy if taken even half literally (and, yes, I realise I may be overthinking it): what you get from those books, what they understand, is that real therapy is madly tricky. It's not, as per the fantasy here, simply about 'healing' or crying it out or hugging it out or sharing our deepest hurts. Berne, in 'Games People Play' even identifies this kind of thing, in therapy groups, as a game, seductive but ineffective. He calls it 'hothouse' because it involves people bringing out their supposedly deepest wounds like rare orchids for everyone else to marvel at and coo over.Is that what I've been doing watching this show? I half suspect so. On the other hand, I read some of the more negative reviewers here dismissing it all as 'pointless' and similar and wonder if some of them aren't as closed into their shells as many of the characters here were very plausibly shown to be at the start.",

That lady can live characters so flawlessly.

The book has a very good finale(only good part) with a message, that was completely ruined in the series with hallucinating dead people.

            "content": "Nine seemingly well off participants walk into a retreat, and leave bonded for life. The tragedies that have befallen each individual reveal to the viewer (or reader, if you've also read the accompanying novel) the lack of care that trauma has in regards to societal class. Marta, an immigrant from eastern Europe, suffers unimaginable pain from the loss of her daughter. The Marconi family, a middle class family of three who are also suffering from the loss of a family member -- the son, Zach, who committed suicide. Every character has their story, and each is filled with grief, guilt, and a questioning of selfhood. There is a dramatic deviance from the people you see at the beginning of the show, who all present as rich, well taken care of characters who only wanted a weekend away. In reality, each person is dealing with massive internal damage, and were hand picked by Marta to live out that damage in hopes of repair. This show gives a unique view into mental and physical health, rejecting the frequently misunderstood prerogative that stability comes with wealth. No matter the class status of the individual, each and every one of them must come to terms with their inner demons. Although some of the characters seem higher class than others, like Lars or Masha, they are still able to experience the same amount of emotion as any of the other characters. As seen in the show, even though Masha seems so healthy and peaceful, her grief is even more extensive than that of the Marconi family, who is shown publicly falling apart beginning at their first scene. The notions of cultural stratification or status markers are all fabricated external validation directed at others. Internally, humans handle issues and emotional fatigue with similar psychological and physical responses. While the extent of the response may vary, internally we all understand in our own way fatigue, anxiety, grief, and burnout, among others. Pop culture is a reflection of our society's preoccupation with social stature, but the separation that our social standings create alter our perception of true human values and the inner self. The true self is vastly underrepresented both in the media and in daily interactions. Nine Perfect Strangers brings this idea into light, showing the viewer that age, gender, and social status do not create the barriers society tells us that they do.",

I could preach but the show paints a good enough picture for now. I for one hope this \"micro dosing\" is taken seriously and with great care because some of us did much more in effort to reclaim our lives.I can't tell you how many times I stood at a bridge ready to jump, I can't tell you the number of times I overdosed or this rage I harbor because of loss and pain. It's funny.. that I've seen this now... Because it's exactly what I would do, I mean, it's what I wanted to do... Lead meditation sessions while under the influence, it is how we should approach drug use. No one should be doing drugs alone but as the show points out or in a damn night club... It's a very dangerous and leads to all the heartache we now know.Anyways... Sure it seemed kinda silly at times, like it takes more than ten days to heal but life is silly and the people who actually brought about their own healing from this practice, did it under much worse circumstance.This show is for you who are searching for healing.

Some strange things happen and there is an immediate sense of conspiracy, but behind that there is much more to unravel, especially about the hosts and Masha. Love Melissa McCarthy in her role. Nicole Kidman is good as can be expected from here in her role of the mysterious and mystique woman. And have to say Michael Shannon is starting to steal the show at the end of episode 3.Some of the strange things that happen are simply not explained, or may take a while to have an explanation. I feel like you should go into a mystery show with some patience and be prepared that not everything will make sense or be explained soon or at all throughout the series. It also means that sometimes the plot moves very slowly, meanders and it's not clear where it's going. If you're not into that this show may not be for you. Excited to see where this is going!",

Nothing. Just a super boring story slowly developing and then slowly ending. While absolutely nothing happens.Vomit!! Pure vomit!! Off with their heads!! Whoever made this is a criminal!! I feel so bad for all these actors. They're all respectable actors with great careers. To have them waste their time like this? C'mon! You're criminals!!Criminals!!Maybe it was covid? Maybe their budget was super small and they didnt have money for a writer so they asked some kid to write this?

But I trust the process, the author Liane Moriarty is a producer on the show and I like that they've added in extra details that we would have never known from the book like showing more into Lars' childhood bullying.Another thing yes Nicole's russian accent is annoying but I'm seeing a lot of people who obviously haven't read the book keep asking in the reviews why the character is Russian at all. All the characters have been made American but they needed to keep Masha Russian because that's a big part of her character.

What's Masha's real game with these people's lives?Until we get to the final episode where it's revealed...\nMasha really was just a therapist who wanted to help her clients. And she probably broke the law a hundred times yet gets off scot-free. And everybody had a neat happy ending, as a result of a fake near-death experience given to them by the Tranquillium staff. Two of the main characters even went to work at Tranquillium somehow, while the murderous villain actually became a therapist and became in charge of administering therapy to others very shortly after?! Meanwhile, Delilah, the staff member who had been imprisoned at her workplace and had to drive through a fence to get out, happily reunited with her husband who collaborated in her imprisonment?!I felt that the focus on the Marconi family throughout at the expense of all the other characters was somewhat gratuitous and overblown. The trauma was interesting and well-acted, but it detracted from the storylines of some of the rest of the group, and consistently treating the family as a single unit devalued the individual members, especially given that they were all adults.On the positive side, all characters were well-acted and the cinematrography and stylization was excellent. The consistent eerie tone and suspicion-inducing soundtrack however turned out to be inappropriate for the ultimate tone of the series - a successful therapy session. The direction seemed instead to be hinting at a wider mystery - societal apocalypse, a mad science subplot etc. And that it was truly in the SF genre rather than essentially a simple surface level family/bereavement drama with additional drug themes.",

A big part of me also didn't have a lot of closure, which I don't always mind (Blunt Objects comes to mind, which isn't too dissimilar in atmosphere to this) but it was tiny things without much explanation that really just annoyed me. I thought Nicole Kidman was fine, I don't know what the bad criticism on her is about. Maybe not her best work, but certainly not her worst.I think overall the character build in general was a bit off or weak? I have so many questions and will most likely need to chat this through with someone because I constantly feel like I'm missing something and all the characters mainly annoyed me immensely at least once throughout.I'm also slightly worried about the blas\u00e9 drug taking. Drugs aren't good! I most certainly didn't feel like the show reflected how bad this kind of drug taking can seriously be damaging but of course I understand that art is objective but it just seemed a bit unrealistic.It was good, or was it? I certainly felt moved, or did I? I'm just not sure how I feel about it but I don't regret watching it. I think the budget probably pulled me though more than anything.",

            "content": "This series is a must. Each of the people are coming in with their own life tragedies, and have to work through their emotional issues at this retreat with Masha (Nicole Kidman) at the helm. From death to break-ups to drug addiction, each of these none people were somehow \"chosen\" by Masha (we don't know why), and there is some kind of sinister shennigans going on (it appears), by Masha who has a week to heal these people and renew their lives. But something isn't right, and it may be that Masha (who had died and come back to life from a gun shot wound) may be the one with the most emotional issues. Either way, the acting is good, and the issues are real. The interplay between the characters makes you feel as if you are there with them. This series has a lot of potential and pulls you in. We can't wait until episode 4 is released because you are left in suspense at the end of 3. I would categorize this as an emotional suspense possibly even thriller (depending on what happens to the nine strangers -- will it take a Ten Little Indians twist (eg and then there were none?)This series definitely has an Agatha Cristie feel to it, and the best part about it is you really have no idea where it is headed other than Masha is either an enlightened genius or certifiably crazy... For anyone on the fence with these series, its a must watch. Nicole Kidman is a superb actor. Melissa McCarthy injects natural humor into her sad mid life crisis situation. Luke Evans plays the bad boy with some kind of secret. Bobby Cannavele is an underrated great actor -- some of his scenes will be award worthy. Michael Shannon is a realistic dad of a suicidal teen and it brings the issue up for any parents out there who might forget to kiss their child on the forehead. I'm in for this roller coaster ... Definitely takes you away from current events in this country and the world...",

I know she felt they were in danger but it was well after the drugs had been taken and everything happened. They're adults they agreed to stay and do whatever was necessary to get to where they needed to be. I like how it ended where it actually helped everyone find their happiness and peace. I know Nicole Kidman was a bit annoying at times lol but in the end I was happy for her finding her daughter. I felt she gave the character what was needed to have sympathy for her. Do I believe she was using the family to help herself find her daughter? Yes. But in the end the family was helped and so was Masha. Frances was my favorite character and I knew the way her and Tony didn't like each other in the beginning they would fall in love. Was kinda obvious lol.

Based on the novel of the same name by Liane Moriarty, the show follows nine strangers who come together at a luxurious health resort in the hopes of improving their lives.The show is led by an impressive cast, including Nicole Kidman, Melissa McCarthy, Luke Evans, and Michael Shannon. Kidman plays Masha, the owner of the resort, who claims to have developed a revolutionary new method for improving people's lives. McCarthy plays Francis, a woman struggling with obesity and low self-esteem, while Evans plays Ben, a charming and successful writer who is struggling with writer's block. Shannon plays Tony, a gruff and skeptical man who is at the resort to support his wife, who is struggling with addiction.The other characters at the resort include Lars, a wealthy businessman who is struggling with a midlife crisis; Zoe, a young woman who is recovering from an eating disorder; Napoleon, a former soldier with PTSD; and Yvette, a woman who is dealing with the recent loss of her husband. Each of these characters has their own personal struggles and motivations for being at the resort, and as the show progresses, we see them all begin to confront and work through their issues.The show does an excellent job of exploring the complex and often conflicting emotions that each of the characters are dealing with. Through the use of flashbacks, we see glimpses of each character's past and the events that have led them to the resort. We also see the dynamic between the characters change and evolve as they begin to open up to one another and form unlikely friendships.One of the most compelling aspects of the show is the way it handles the issue of mental health. Each of the characters is struggling with some form of mental illness or emotional issue, and the show does an excellent job of depicting the challenges and stigma that often come with these issues. It also highlights the importance of seeking help and the transformative power of therapy and self-care.Another interesting aspect of the show is the way it explores the concept of wellness and the lengths people will go to in order to improve their lives. Masha's methods at the resort are unorthodox and often border on the extreme, and we see the characters struggle with whether or not to trust her and follow her teachings. The show does a good job of raising questions about the true nature of happiness and the extent to which we are willing to go to achieve it.Overall, Nine Perfect Strangers is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged television series that tackles important issues such as mental health and the pursuit of happiness. The strong performances from the cast and the well-written characters make it a must-watch for anyone interested in these themes.",

So casting bosses should either forego that aspect of a screenplay version of a book or cast a native. Since David E Kelley and Liane Moriarty are seemingly compelled to feature Nicole Kidman in anything and everything, and yes she was amazing in Big Little Lies and The Undoing, they should have stood back and realized she sounded like an Australian trying to fake a Russian accent, when she wasn't just giving into her native Australian. Maybe this sounds petty but since she is onscreen most of the 8 episodes, it becomes distracting. Ditto for her horrible blonde wig.Melissa McCarthy was wonderful.The sexual relationships between the 2 staff members and Masha as well as each other were confusing at best.The soundtrack was the coolest part of the series.

It'll be interesting to see what they do with the storyline, as the events so far in the series are not completely following the book(thankfully, again my preference of course), though the characters' stories do follow the book for the most part. Events that are taking place in the series did not happen in the book, and this series has left out some important pieces that are in the book, interestingly.

The ending is particularly weak; there the comic touches feel like an apology for failing to deliver a sharper and more satisfying end. It is set in a very Australian California - the series was filmed in Byron Bay New South Wales.",

Are good and make you change for the better.It wanted to be a coold blooded thriller comedy (which is apsurd in its own way) and faild at it.We can see a group of stranger became friend with a psycho who drugs them. Then they see visions togother and then change their life for the better. There is no twist no nothing. This is as boring as it gets.",

I guess after the success of Big Little Lies they thought thought her stories were golden. It's a great cast but it's hard to rescue such a stupid plot. Nicole Kidman's ridiculous Russian accent is comical.. I guess everyone lays an egg sometimes but this one takes the cake. Don't waste your time. Life is too short.",

This one started off well, with a lot of plot lines created. There was the requisite gay man as well as the requisite interracial couple. The married couple with the marriage issues. The drunk. The mole. Then, after 7 episodes, I heard to get ready for the final episode! What? How are they going to end this? They did it, wrapping up every strange mini plot in one last episode. It left a bad taste in my mouth.One more note: what was up with all of the clothes? In the sauna? Wearing clothes. In a natural springs pool in the middle of nowhere? Got their clothes on. Swimming in the infinity pool? Got their suits on. It just didn't feel natural. There was even a scene where a woman went into a sensory deprivation tank, and still was dressed from head to toe. I found this very strange. Anyways, a downer from Nicole Kidman (this time).",
