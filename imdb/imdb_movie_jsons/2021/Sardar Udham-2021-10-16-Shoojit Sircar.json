Vicky Kaushal is a rising star and his role of Sardar Udham showed us why he is a great contender for Bollywood's future.A dark tale of an individual, fighting for the freedom of the nation, in a different way, in a different nation is enthralling and at the same time, emotional and captivating as well. With a brilliant cinematography and strong dialogues added with terrific acting, Sardar Udham can be claimed as one of the best biopic on a freedom fighter that has ever been made.Hats off to the team of Sardar Udham, Shoojit Sircar, Vicky Kaushal and the entire cast that brought out such an outstanding example of Indian cinema with a compelling story about the struggles we had for the freedom of our nation. This is truly a remarkable on an international level and an oscar nomination worthy movie.My Rating : 10/10.",

Never ever has Jallianwala Baug massacre portrayed this way in history of cinema. This is however the most important film to come out in recent times.Yes this is about Sardar Udham Sign but it is also about millions of Indians who sacrificed themselves for the freedom we enjoy in modern India and take it for granted. It is very intelligently written, the production design is on a level Bollywood hasn't seen in a long long time. The sound design and background score is skillfully done and the editing is just how I like it. Shoojit Sircar has obviously worked with DoP to capture every frame masterfully. Technically this is near perfect.I would've given minus stars but didn't have heart to give it to the marketing department, producers and distributors. This movie should be screened in all the film festivals and has potential to be India's oscar entry for this year. Wake up people.Finally, I just want to say this movie should also be in British high school curriculum. Of course, it's wishful thinking.",

            "review_title": "Vicky Kaushal's Sardar Udham Is A Ticking Time Bomb Waiting To Explode !!!",
            "content": "The film pays tribute to an unsung hero - Sardar Udham Singh (Vicky Kaushal), an Indian revolutionary, who assassinated Michael O'Dwyer in London (in 1940), to avenge the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (of 1919). The former British colonial official was the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab (British India) at the time. Dwyer had said the killing of hundreds of protesters during a demonstration at Jallianwala Bagh in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, was justified.First things first - If you are looking for a talky film that can light the revolutionary fire in you, 'Sardar Udham' isn't it. Do not expect hard-hitting dialoguebaazi or emotional outbursts. The pre-independence drama based on true events, is a simmering observation of a man consumed by grief. The protagonist makes numbing pain his strength and silence, his voice. Loss and despair are so overpowering that avenging the barbaric crime he witnessed in his 20's, becomes the only reason for his existence, even 20 years later.Set at the onset of World War II, the film shuttles between past and present. The canvas is massive but meaty source material on the titular character, meagre. None of Udham Singh's chest-thumping slogans or writings (if any) was found. Here was a man, deeply scarred, who went about doing his job quietly. The challenge was to then connect the dots with whatever little information available and get into his psyche. Shoojit Sircar tries to decode the 'why' and not just how he ended up doing what he did. The aim is to understand the emotional arc of an innocent boy from Amristar who wouldn't hold a gun, let alone firing one. What led him to fire at Dwyer from point-blank range and not flee the spot? Was it driven by revenge? Why harbour the pain for two decades and not move on for good? Why is the same person a revolutionary and terrorist for different people?Shoojit SIrcar doesn't take a myopic look at heroism or freedom. His hero doesn't seem invincible or hero-like. Udham Singh didn't hate a man or his country who spurred the massacre. His fight was against the British ideology of conquering others' right to speak and live freely. Through an exhausting runtime of 2 Hr 42 Mins, Shoojit makes us meet Udham, a stoical man on a mission. He moves like a shadow, relentless in his pursuit of Dwyer and freedom from the oppressive British rule. For the longest time, we solely become a spectator of his painstaking journey. We don't feel invested enough. We see him landing odd jobs in London and being the centre of various unremarkable events leading up to the assassination.As much as we anticipate the volcano of his past to erupt eventually, the road to that heart-wrenching climax is tedious. Underplaying is an effective tool as long as it doesn't underwhelm. This film is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode but beware; the wait tries your patience. The intention is to give a lull before the storm treatment to storytelling. Silence is amplified so when Udham's inner turmoil finds an outlet, the impact reaches a crescendo. It's cleverly thought out but the execution yields mixed results. The non-linear, non-verbose narrative struggles to hold your attention even an hour into the movie. The re-enactment of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre is unsettling to watch and that is the very reason why this story needed to be told.Vicky Kaushal as Sardar Udham dips his toes into uncharted waters. He tries his best to get unspoken words across but a film like this needed an Irrfan to speak through his eyes. You can trust a seasoned actor to elevate portions that demand stillness. Vicky is remarkable in certain scenes though. A drunk scene in particular, his 20 something portrayal and his climactic conversation with a British investigator extract the best out of him as an actor. Him wondering, \"Mere jawani ka koi matlab bana?\" is heart-breaking. The writing tries to avoid clich\u00e9s but ends up sounding contemporary instead. Bhagat Singh's Hinglish dialogues like, \"Hum sirf exploitation ke against hai. Humein semi-independence nahi chahiye,\" sound out of place given the setting. The line that stays with you is Udham reminiscing his turbulent past and asking a British officer, \"What were you doing when you were 23?\"Sardar Udham's courage never roared. It whispered. This freedom fighter traversed continents, used aliases and lied low throughout his life. He was too possessed by his singular quest for equality to make a noise. If you are as passionately curious about his quiet existence, this film is for you.",

Every character is given ample amount of time, every scene is elaborated and the whole focus remains upon the subject. The creators have played the dice to showcase the actual events in reverse order, however, keeping in mind that no sequence remains unsitched.Moreover, I liked the depection of the first part of the 20th century, that is the locations, costumes, habits etc.Saying so, yaa, I did feel that in some places, it could have been a bit fast in pace and skipped a few incidents so as to reduce the time from 2 hrs 45 mins to like 2 hrs and 20 mins here and there. And that's where I would cut 2 points. But, a very good film and definitely watchable. Keep your patience and time with you, and you won't regret it.",

            "content": "Sardar Udham review :Of all the movies Shoojit Sircar has made till date, this has to be the most technically brilliant one. Capturing the landscape from Amristar to London, the shots appear like a beautiful painting on celluloid. The art design, recreating the 1930s and early '40s when most of this film is based, is top class. Sardar Udham is also the most unconventional historical movie made in Indian cinema. If you are looking for entertainment or patriotic jingoism here, sorry but this is just not the movie for you!!Indeed, Sardar Udham is a highly realistic and at times, harrowing depiction of the relatively unknown freedom fighter who decides to avenge the Jallianwala Baug massacre. Travelling all the way to London to execute the two officials responsible for the most inhuman act in British India, Udham Singh takes a long time to execute his plan. But he is successful at the end.Narrated non-linearly, the film may get tad difficult for the aam junta not used to such treatment as well as those who are not so well versed with the historical events of that period specially those second world war references and the communists' role in it. Udham Singh's torture scenes in British jail are also extremely discomforting to watch.Vicky Kaushal, in the titular role, delivers his career best performance. This one deserves a National award, no less!! Kirsty Averton as Eileen Palmer, Udham's sympathizer from the local Communist party, is a standout. The other firangi actors are earnest and thankfully, talk in English instead of that oh-so-familiar accented Hindi patented by Bob Christo.Sardar Udham reaches its pinnacle in the last forty minutes dedicated to the Jallianwala Baug tragedy. I have read and seen this event many times before but trust me, was never ever shaken so much!! It is a heart wrenching watch sure to move you to tears.Finally, films like Sardar Udham need to be made and the sacrifice of these great freedom fighters deserve much more attention than just a footnote accorded to them in our school history books.Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

            "review_title": "Yes, bollywood can make a patriotic film far away from dramatic jigoism like Hollywood Classics Patton and Schindler's List and Sardar Udham is our first impactful attempt.",
            "content": "Sardar Udham (2021) :\nMovie Review -I am not gonna write a regular review for this one which combines things like acting, writing, screenplay, music and direction because i don't really think this is a film made to glorify that hardcore patriotism from India's history. Making a commercial jiongism patterns like 'Border' (1997), 'Uri' (2019), and 'Shershaah' (2021) is easy and safe because you that our massy audience will fall for patriotic emotions and will forgive cinematic mistakes. But making a relevant and thought-provoking film like 'Haqeeqat' is still a dream for new generation filmmakers. Sardar Udham is high-end triggering drama with strong flavour of Shoojit Sircar style. Those who are expecting a quality cinema and are ready to wait for a while are welcome and those who want to whistle and scream during mass sequences are prohibited from viewing this movie. Sardar Udham is typical Shoojit Sircar style slow burn but moreover it attempts to rediscover patriotic biographical genre in Indian Cinema on the level of what Hollywood did with film like 'Patton' (1970) and 'Schindler's List' (1993).Jalianwala Bagh massacre is one of the most brutal events ever happened in the 20th century in any corner of the world. But how many times it has made you feel that pain even today except for Anniversary trends on social media and few glimpses in any freedom fighter's biopic in Indian Cinema? We have seen this particular event in many biopics from Bhagat Singh to Gandhi to Sardar Patel and few more but Sardar Udham is probably the only film which has made a big issue out of it to create an entire plot affected by that terrible masscare. I remember watching Soviet Filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein's film which showed one of that Russian Massacre in Brutal manners and who on earth knew that those scenes from a silent film made in 1920s decade would remain the most astonishing massacre scenes in cinema history. Sardar Udham might just become that for Bollywood Cinema. Especially those last 40 minutes where you feel the pain of Udham, a teenager, who didn't really understand what just happened and it kept him torturing for 2 decades. Finally, he took the revenge and yet it feels like a soft punishment because you hate British empire so much that even shooting a man dead in front of 50 people feels so less. British had killed hundreds brutally in Jalianwala Bagh massacre and any toughest punishment in the world can't justify that. Sardar Udham is about this ideology, not a revenge. There are thousands of revenge in the history of India but not all them became universal ideologies.One of the best thing i noticed in Sardar Udham is it shows that fatal state of mind British government during world war 2. You see, World War 2 is one of the major reason behind India's independence but our historians and filmmakers have always overlooked this fact. You gotta know that British saw it coming back what they did to India. In this movie there is a quote to explain this- \"Germany calling. The sun finally seems to setting at British Empire. Like an elephant, Indians never forget their enemies\" and the next two scenes when Udham Singh questions the Law twice, once in Courtroom before Judge and once during investigation in front of detective. Do you remember any Bollywood Film going in such details about ideology and morals? Leave that topic for further arguments later.So, overall Sardar Udham is quite a break from commercial potboilers and there are many reasons to make it a Must See in your watchlist as a true quality cinema lover. However, couple of flaws needs to be bashed equally as i praised good things. The film starts very slow, it looks scattered and irrelevant sometimes but maybe that's because the story of Udham never has enough documents and events available in public domain. I won't say much about acting and other aspects as said in the beginning but for Vicky Kaushal I say one thing that he has completely surrendered himself to director's uncompromised vision. I won't be surprised to see him taking a bunch of trophies home after the award ceremonies next year. Shoojit Sir, you have attempted something revolutionary and respect you for that. Nevertheless, i still say it could have been little better or a certain Classic. It misses that Mark by few inches though. Rest, highly recommended. A deserving tribute to underdog Udham Singh and his Friend, Brother and Idol 'Shaheed Bhagat Singh'.RATING - 7.5/10*",

He leverages it to astutely put across not just the freedom fighter's perspectives but that also of the British administration.While the British officers are often portrayed as evil, maniacal tropes in most freedom fighter movies, Sircar again refuses to follow the norm. Shaun Scott is terrific as the banal, even dispassionate Michael O'Dwyer while Stephen Hogan is impactful as the detective charged with extracting Udham's confession.Sardar Udham is a firm reminder that our country's freedom was won by a group of men and women who were made of sterner stuff, who sacrificed everything for their motherland.The film, at 2 hours and 42 minutes will require a patient watch. But I promise you, the experience is well worth it. Recommended!",

Vicky Kaushal gives a powerful performance here and is simply stunning in the sequences showing the aftermath of Jallianwala.I was in tears during the last one hour when the Jallianwala Bagh massacre is shown.

What an incredible piece of Cinema I have just been a witness of! I'm truly captivated by Sircar's direction and the way he addressed such a heroic act of patriotism. And I can't convey enough appreciation for representing such a fairly unknown story of the Martyr, Udham Singh; who against all the odds made the impossible. He shook the British empire to its core and sent out a decisive statement against their heinous colonialism.From a technical stance alone, I must admit, this was something very special! I had never seen a historical drama on such an enormous scale before. From the detailed set designs to the astounding Cinematography, the commendable art direction to the world-building; it has every right to be considered as a landmark in Indian filmography. Trust me, supervising any sets with that many people and intricacies; it's easier said than done. And this gets even more fascinating when you consider the restricted expenditures!Likewise, the performances leave quite an impression. Amongst the entire cast, Vicky Kaushal's act indisputably draws our attention the most. Particularly, towards the end. Where, in my opinion; he gives his absolute best. Speaking of the rest of the ensemble, I was amazed to observe such a capable group of foreign nationals playing their roles with utmost affection and integrity!My only criticisms are in regards to the comparatively long-winded screenplay and its Non-linear structure. Don't get me wrong, I'm all up for Non-linear storytelling, but I'm not sure whether it was an absolute necessity in this case.Even though I gotta say, that whole Jallianwala Bagh massacre sequence is no less than a cinematic brilliance. No matter, how tough you deem yourself to be, remember the words; it's gonna break your heart. If it was up to me, I would have probably inaugurated the film with this portion rather than placing it near the climax. That way, I guess the impact would have been far greater.Lastly, I just wanna thank all the people who have contributed to such an ambitious endeavour and I wanna give my regards to Mr Shoojit Sircar as he's done plentiful to denote the atrocities of British Imperialism. Innumerable manslaughters, abscondings, tortures; the British without any question, shares a dark & sinful past with our country and its people.My heartiest admiration goes to all the martyrs and their families who sacrificed everything just to break the shackles and to get our much-awaited Sovereignty & Freedom. And most importantly they did all that while being unified, irrespective of class, religion or Identity.Today's generation should learn a thing or two!",

It starts from mid way of Udham's life and moves forward from there and what follows is all events being slowly unraveled through investigations and through udham singh's confessions. It takes a different non linear way of presenting the events rather than the stereotypical cliche bollywood style.YES IT IS SLOW BUT YOU DONT HAVE THE AUDACITY TO COMPLAIN! If you are new to watching Shoojit's films dare not complain instead go watch his previous works first but if you are a follower of his films, you wont complain as you know you are well prepared for a film of this pace.Set designs --> havent seen such in Bollywood ever. Straight out of a Hollywood production house it seems like. Brilliant! Vicky Kaushal doesnt really have too many dialogues he's almost like a silent killer. His emotions his eyes do the talking.At 2hr 40 mins, the level of detailing is phenomenal. Making a film with lots of trivia detailing like the radio talking about Irish revolution, WW2 etc is very difficult considering your main topic is different but it sets up the mood right and makes sure you feel you are in the 1930s. Some details about Bhagat Singh's movement are there too.Undoubtedly the most haunting part comes in the last 1 hour. Brace yourselves for the long sequence that comes in the last 1 hour.Vicky as i talked has done a good job! Amol Parashar as Bhagat Singh is okayish we have seen better portrayals in other films dedicated to him completely . Banita Sandhu is only in a cameo in a forced love angle that the film could have avoided or i really dont know if it was true.AN UNMISSABLE FILM!",

The movie tracks his journey as a youngster to the rebel he finally becomes.The narrative can be broadly categorised into three segments, although there is no differentiation from the makers. The first half an hour is the execution. It shows the struggle of Udham Singh to reach London and then proceeds to the fateful day of the assassination.That's when the second segment begins. It is the lengthiest one, focusing on how Udham Singh achieved what he set out to do. It deals with the recce work of Udham and what he did he do over the years until the fateful day.And the third segment deals with the reason for the change of heart in a young Udham Singh. Shoojit Sircar depicts the most gruesome portrayal of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in the final half an hour.Vicky Kaushal is the heart and soul of Sardar Udham. He has given it all to the role, which offers him ample scope to show his dramatic skills. The pain in his eyes is palpable when he recollects the injustice meted out to Indian's in India by the British. Similarly, anger and aggression are naturally portrayed.The background score by Shantanu Moitra is decent. The cinematography by Avik Mukhopadhyay is brilliant. The pre-Independence era is exquisitely captured and recreated along with the help of the art department.The film, at 2 hours and 42 minutes will require a patient watch. But I promise you, the experience is well worth it. Recommended!",

            "content": "When it comes to Bollywood biopics, most filmmakers often have this tendency of hyping up the protagonist long before digging into their humanity or mindset or environment or events that shaped their destiny. And it only worsens if the subject is a freedom fighter as it leads to them playing the jingoistic tune & dialling up the melodrama. And this is where Sardar Udham sets itself apart.Directed by Shoojit Sircar, the story is devoid of all the chest-thumping, flag-waving exhibition of nationalist pride and unravels like a noir-soaked, silently escalating period piece that's firmly grounded and is all about the man than his legend. Sircar gets the assassination scene out of the way early, for the planning & execution is secondary to the why behind Udham's vengeful action. And the third act answers exactly that.The story isn't without its issues as the back n forth narration isn't streamlined enough, plus the dialogues are diluted with English vocabulary for few scenes that don't warrant any dilution. On the plus side, the colonial setting feels authentic, camerawork is slick and performances are strong. However, it is the film's powerful, haunting & gut-wrenching final hour that lends ample weight & credibility to its earlier events and is shot with searing intensity.Overall, Sardar Udham is inarguably one of the better biopics to surface in Hindi cinema and is crafted with restraint & sophistication. The non-linear arrangement does require getting used to, pacing also falters at times but the emotional jolt delivered by the unflinchingly raw brutality of its Jallianwala Bagh massacre & aftermath segments linger long after the credits and give us an essential insight into the eponymous revolutionary's trauma which in effect puts everything in perspective.",

The film is really very perfect at all aspects..actually this film is made for only those who are really serious in watching films_making notes : classy audience. I think everyone should watch atleast this film first 30 minutes and last 41 minutes. Sardam Udham is definitely masterpiece undoubtedly..shoijit sircar never dissapoint his audience.Que -Why this film belongs to the masterpiece category?1) Cinematography - Sardar Udham approach really hearttouching and serious..the set designing and costumes department desrve a grand salute. The film is undoubtedly indian 'The Pianist'\n2) Characterisation - Character portrait is speechless. I think the best character portrail in indian cinema after 'vikram vedha'\n3) Thrilling Sequences - Everyone know 'The Godfather'. Film has really awesome scenes..one takes and many symbolism too. This film is also like this..if we compare Michael scene in 'The Godfather' with Udham scene in hall killing scene at 30min est. Both scene look a like copy to each other or just amazing. Film pictured really heartfelling yet horrifying scenes at torture in English survellian. Film get more intense at the end like evergreen 'The Shawshank Redemption.Approach - Sardam Udham didn't tell you story it tell you an era and information about the scenario. Many Indian as well as Hollywood films creating false character portrait but this film didn't do it either.Decoding ?? How??This film had many epic scenes. There are many scenes which capture something unnoticable at every time. The quality about the content is we know how the film end..we know what will happen!! But we didn't know Why?? This film tell you why and fulfill your satisfaction.I know I mentioned many the greatest all time top movies above but this film deserve a comparison atleast cause this film is an example to hollywood that our indian films are also matches the hollywood society!!Thank you!",

            "content": "Sardar Udham, the latest offering from the ace director Shoojit Sircar is a heart wrenching tale of the sacrifices of one of the forgotten heroes of our freedom struggle- Sardar Udham Singh. It is a poignant saga of a martyr seldom remembered for his valor, determination or devotion to his motherland. India's inability to make biopics sans unnecessary emotions or well researched set pieces is well known. But Sardar Udham breaks the barrier and presents before us a creation that should be hailed for its dogged determination in denying the norms and for depicting a story which needed extensive study, unbiased sentiments and unabashed truthfulness.The cardinal parts of the protagonist's life from during the repercussions of the Jalliwanwala Bag massacre to his eventual execution in the hands of the British imperialists form the core of the story. The nucleus of course is the vengeance he took on the soil of the Britishers. Throughout the journey, we are presented with so many facts hitherto unknown to the most. In an age of History courses taught through FB or WhatsApp posts, director Shoojit Sircar takes a U-turn and works on several important issues deliberately untold before. It takes tremendous courage to portray the political orientation of Sardar Udham or his friend-cum-brother-cum-political mentor Bhagat Singh. The political ideology of HSRA has been depicted without any penchant for being partisan to gain any political mileage for the movie, a common trait these days. Another aspect of the movie is its bravery to show how Indians irrespective of their religions were used to suppress their own fellows during those tumultuous days. Keeping the dialogues mostly in English or Punjabi instead of ludicrously pronounced Hindi by the Britishers adds to the genuineness of intentions of the creator.The film, however, has its own share of flaws. The makeup is not classy and looks artificial at times. The lad who donned the role of Bhagat Singh does not look convincing. The undulating movements of the time frames become monotonous at certain points. Certain unnecessary flashbacks could have been avoided. The runtime of more than 160 minutes is a bit irksome and at least thirty minutes could have been trimmed to maintain the tempo. The climax does not yield enough dividends for the patience held for so long.If we can ignore the minor flaws, Sardar Udham has the potentials to become a classic in the coming years. Vicky Kaushal as the vengeful protagonist is a treat to watch. In a metaphorical scene at the Freedom of Speech squad, he delivers a monologue that knocks you down for his sheer timing and brilliant expressions. Did the director take a dig at something at that scene? Vicky is terrific throughout and he is one reason you should not miss this movie. Stephen Hogan as the detective inspector John Swain is smooth in essaying a tough role that demanded dutifulness and softness. Amol Parashar as Bhagat Singh as already mentioned lacks the confidence. Shaun Scott as Michael O'dwyer is believable and Kirsty Averton as Eileen is expressive.The movie has the ideological presence of the great martyr Bhagat Singh throughout and that maybe a good lesson for many who idolize him without having any respect for the ideals he promoted. The massacre scene of Jalliwanwala Bagh is gruesome, horrific and presents the true magnitude of violence inflicted by the Britishers on our countrymen during those days. The scene is long, raw and uncompromising, a train not common in our movie industry where nothing is done without glamorizing. Sardar Udham does not for a moment try to add any glamour to a story which needed truthfulness, honesty and a heart clear of any partisan feelings.Watch this movie if you want to revisit those days. Watch this movie if you consider yourself non-judgmental. Watch this for the man who needs to be championed for his sheer patriotism, unabated spirit of equality and unhindered love for his countrymen.My rating- 9 out of 10.",

A guy , who considers Bhagat Singh as his idol took 21 years to take revenge by killing General Dyer , who ordered the massacre at Jalianwala Bagh . Udham's 21 years of journey has been seemed in meticulously and his ideology of attaining freedom has been penned in every frame .Beautiful Banita Sandhu expressed everything without a dialogue. The British actors were perfectly handled. Shantanu Moitra background score matches with the period perfectly.

Shoojit da should get all the praises for the flawless direction, the impeccable grand production design those classic Contessas on the vintage England streets to the factories and the docks from that era shown spot on. It literally takes us back to time and shook us by giving a reality check on the Britishers bullying nature.

            "content": "Sardar udham is a biographical historical drama directed by shoojit sircar. Here are the positives and negatives:Performances-the performances are epic to be honest. Vicky kaushal has given a lifetime of a performance. He has given it everything literally everything. Starting from expressions to demeaner to dialogue delivery he has given an awards worthy performance. Banita sandhu in her brief period brings the sweetness in the rather melancholic picture. Her eyes are beautiful and expressive. Amol parashar as 'bhagat singh' is lively and lovely.English actors-the english actors also have done a commendable job. Thanks to the casting agency that they hired good english actors in an indian film. Shaun scott and kirsten averton are my favourites. I really liked eileen and udham's chemistry specially in the last scene. Other english characters hv done a good job too.Cinematography-the cinematography is world class. Avik mukhopadhyay has captured it beautifully. He has given a masterclass on cinematography. The handheld camera, the closeups, he has done it wonderfully.Dialogues-if i start talking about dialogues i wouldn't stop so let me just brief it. The dialoges are a revolution in itself. Insightful, deep and tragic at the same time. Vicky has got the best dialogues and he has nailed it.Colour grading-the colour grading is brilliant. The yellow tone used in the punjab scenes representing the fiery attitude during the pre-independence and the greyish blue tone in the english sequences representative of the sunless and lightless world. Its brilliant.Jallianwala bagh massacre-has the massacre been portrayed so brilliantly and been gruesome at the same time? My answer is yes\n. This is excellent writing and staging. The sequemce is 20 minutes long but does not feel slack at any moment. Its gruesome, bloody and horrific. Body parts detached, men moaning and screaming in pain, you would get teary eyed for sure.Screenplay and length-who were the people saying that it was long. I didn't feel it for a minute. The screenplay is so beautifully written and staged that you would not want it to stop. The length is proper and just. Those kind of people don't deserve these kind of films.Guilt does not justify crimes towards a country. It may relieve you of the pain but does not justify the crime. Men who dream of greater heights do not rest util death. Sardar udham singh is one just personality. This is one oscar worthy performance. Its a must must watch. I rate it 10 out of 10.",

It's a movie with a rare excellence at least for a Bollywood team to assemble a production of this magnitude and with such a well done effort. I am hugely impressed by the cinematography, editing and the screenplay, making it a very well made movie. Of course, credit goes to the director in his brilliant work of assembling and executing this project in such a watchable and enjoyable movie. For me, this movie remains a great movie that has done quiet some research and worked well in term of production design, making it hugely successful project. The lead, Vicky added a new update in his portfolio that keeps him shining for a long run. Overall, a movie that deserves appreciation and should be considered for the Oscar contender from India for not only its subject matter but the execution. I don't think there has been any movies from India that has been par this execution level, if any very few.What did not work:\nI would not have wanted to see the full fletched tragic scenes portrayed at the last 30 minutes of the movie. It made it hard to see , not because it was not shot right. On the contrary, it was a difficult watch and very tragic, making it hard. Or maybe that's what was intended and a trigger for the main character which demanded long shots of the event. Either way, it was successful.Final verdict: highly recommended.",

            "content": "\"Let the world know, I was a revolutionary\"In the recent years we experienced numerous movies, either some over dramatic biopic or extreme patriotic melodrama, are coming out with the same silly prototype to capture a certain portion of audience. Some are decent, some are below average & most of them are unbearable with otherworldly odd vfx and whatsapp status special love songs no one asked for! In this suffocating condition of biographical movies, to break the sinister prototype skeleton, a cinematic revolution was much needed; Shoojit Sircar brought it with a masterstroke named Sardar Udham!Inspite of the promise shown by the film, I didn't expect that it can avoid the typical bollywood biography making formula completely and masterfully! I am not sure what to say and what not about this technically supreme work. From the colour and cinematography to the recreation of historically accurate scenes; from the extraordinary score to the blazing screenplay; everything was so technical that it demands a separate writing.There is no need of any forcibly induced emotional scenes or jingoistic dialogues when you have a strong story in hand and technical men at office. In this type of work, the rawness should be evident to justify the actions. Director did exactly the same. He kept the raw tone intact and treated it with a no nonsense approach.The movie did exceptionally well with some dicision making. Use of original languages and not hindi in abnormal accent was one of the main reason why the movie feels so original. The story telling technique was also authentic. Special mention to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre recreation; it was so detailed, raw and moving that we can feel ourselves there!Vicky Kaushal added another feather in his cap delivering a composed, mature yet breathtaking performance as Udham Singh. Supporting casts were brilliant and apt. The unbiased development of characters was also superb. Actually there were hardly anything to complain about in this masterfully crafted movie.Sircar's Sardar Udham is the only biographical work coming out from Bollywood in recent years, which is able to break the rusty prototype and create a benchmark which will surely bring a wave of making serious movies devoid off the business model approach!

            "content": "Outside of India, it's doubtful many people even know about the massacre that took place at Jallianwalla Bagh in 1919. I certainly didn't until I became aware of this film. The horror of that massacre will remain for all who see this picture, as it is recreated in horrific detail in the latter third of the movie, as the story's protagonist, Udham Singh (Vicky Kaushal) valiantly attempts to save as many fellow citizens as he can who barely survived the terrible onslaught of the British soldiers led by Brigadier General Reginald Dyer (Andrew Havill). In that regard, Dyer's rationale for ordering the executions struck me as no better than those of Nazi concentration camp prison guards, who maintained that they were just following orders. For twenty years, Udham Singh plotted the manner in which he would seek his revenge over the event that haunted his existence, finding his target in the form of the former Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, Michael O'Dwyer (Shaun Scott), who ordered General Dyer to use any means necessary to prevent a Sikh uprising. As the story unfolds from the beginning, one will have to consider whether the actions of Singh were those of a terrorist or a revolutionary, a point whose relevance may be questioned even today, although one's sympathies will almost assuredly lie with the man who felt justified in taking one life against roughly four hundred who died that day in 1919. If nothing else, the movie, particularly with it's recreation of the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre, will have you painfully and thoughtfully considering the horror of man's inhumanity toward fellow man.",

            "content": "Biopics on political revolutionaries of pre partition struggle are not many, and such movies are welcome. Since the canvas of such stories is wide, there may be many subplots and there is comparatively more explaining to do. Additionally there is hardly any scope to include romance, dance, comedy, action, melodrama etc and therefore there is a tendency by the director to end up making a documentary even though it is unintended. Such films invariably have a running time in excess of two and a half hours. A feature film has necessarily to be in a two hour format and entertaining for common audiences. There is therefore a challenge to the director of the movie of this genre.After seeing this film, it is clear that Shoojit Sarkar and Vicky Kaushal are both world class. Both have been doing very well so far in any case. The film is a gripping depiction of the incidents of that period and the locales of Afghanistan, Russia and England are authentically shown. The film is a triumph for the director and his crew for capturing the atmosphere of that time so admirably . The claustrophobic prison cells, the London streets, the factories, the people all ring true. The extended scene of Jallianwala bagh massacre has been shot and presented superbly. The moments after the firing with hundreds killed and injured is poignant, sorrowful and has heart wrenching visuals. Chilling no doubt, it will stay with you long after the movie .The four main characters Uddham, the investigating inspector , Michael O'Dwyer, and Reginald Dyer are depicted realistically all expressing their individualistic points of view.Direction is top class and Vicky Kaushal gets an opportunity to put up a superb performance. There is some memorable top class dialogue spoken both by the British officers and revolutionary Udham.The negative point of the movie is the running time over two and a half hours due to which the film drags at places. It is too long and too slow. The film could easily be reduced by 30 minutes and this must be done if it gets selected for Oscar awards.Some trivia as per the film. Did you know that Udham had a weakness for laddoos ( Indian sweet), he had a girlfriend who was dumb, he took alcohol and got high at times and he took oath on the book \" Heer Ranjha\" in court?",

Ajay Devgan walking like a macho man arm in arm with his friends talking about patriotism in a visceral sense.The Bhagat Singh that we see in Sardar Udham is a vigorous young man who identifies himself as a revolutionary socialist, who wishes to free the entire world of imperialism and oppression.He is shown as a humanist who talked at length about the difference between the violence inflicted by revolutionaries and terrorists, about symbolic acts which could make the oppressors realise about the oppression they are committing, and not with an intention to hurt anyone.The movie stands out as the best movie I have watched on India's independence movement. It shows the spine-chilling and heart-wrenching absolute horror of the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh.It has amazing narration and cinematography intensifying the struggle and transformation of the orphan Udham Singh from a naive lad to a staunch revolutionary.The non-sequential narration of the story actually abstracts many a detail from the viewer, but it essentially shows the core emotions that the protagonist goes through.The governor Dwyer is not shown a demonic villain but a man who is philosophically flawed by the ideology of his colonial times.Udham Singh's experience of the massacre is the central theme of the movie and it is extraordinarily portrayed.",

They must have omitted it. Nobody wants to be remembered by their dark past; but it does help you stay grounded.The movie is about an inhumane and merciless shooting that took place in Amritsar, India, where hundreds of innocent people(gathered peacefully) were shot to death in an open-fire. The scene was really barbaric, and perhaps the first time portrayed so visually gruesome in our movie industry. Bullets flying, parts of body tearing apart, and people being killed left and right--those tried to escape the bloody arena--where gunned down against that wall they tried to jump over. Oh, I have no words to describe it. I cried through out the whole ending. Now, imagine someone pulled the surviving one(in so much pain), being dragged and carried on to nearest medical facility. Amidst such chaos, Sardar Udham was that angel who saved many lives. He plans a revenge, and this is his life-story which many of us aren't even aware of.

Knowing this, I was still very disappointed and hurt about one important factor in the movie, the extremely awkward and inaccurate casting of Shaheed Bhagat Singh. Goof- He was hung cropped. And I can't believe they agreed to cast this actor. Huge huge mistake. Took away what could had been really impactful scenes when Shaheed Bhagat was in the frame.. for me personally, this was a huge letdown. Especially when you're portraying the two bravest Sikhs to ever live. Ever..However. Taking that one flaw out, this movie is what Bollywood needs now.

The writers Ritesh Shah and Shubhendu Bhattacharya have created a non-linear screenplay that goes back and forth several times from the present to the past, while this worked to a large extent, it's perhaps a bit overused to being exhausting after a point. Technically the movie is almost flawless, rarely have I seen such exemplary cinematography and production design in a bollywood movie that is neither grand or over the top but just accurate, and that's absolutely what was needed here. Shantanu Moitra's score is beautiful and haunting at times. Shoojit Sircar the Captain of the ship yet again delivers, but perhaps the ship's main engine is the wonder boy Vicky Kaushal, who delivers his career best performance yet, he literally breathes life into a character that many of us were unaware of. Irrfan was supposed to play this role, and I'm sure he is somewhere there very proud of both Vicky and Shoojit. In the end would just like to salute the spirit of Udham Singh, may his fight for freedom and justice inspire us present generation to make a change. Inquilab Zindabad!",

It's slow burn nature is appropriate for the type of freedom fighter the biopic details: Sir Sardar Udham was not one who operated in the open, but rather was covert in his actions. I really liked the addition of an innocent romance, which was only given a small amount of screen time to really highlight the pain and suffering Sir Udham Singh underwent. The dialogues were extremely powerful, especially in the court scene, and the depiction of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre is among the most traumatising scenes in film history.The set design was simply impeccable, and the attention to detail was superb (in the later years of the biopic, Udham Singh's English skills are good, whereas in the early years of the movie his skills are not so good). Some scenes which people pass off as 'redundant' serve as symbolism for what Udham Singh wanted (i.e the scene with the English drunkard shows how he did not hate English people, he only hated imperialism). Overall, 10/10 and more. A must-watch, once in a generation masterpiece.",

Best thing about this movie is, it doesn't shows patriotism by just heavy dailogue or emotional songs, its the atmosphere which does the work. It Brilliantly shows the tyranny to british govt towards india & how british govt still has not apolozised for this horrific incident.Sad part is, indian jury not sending this movie for oscar nomination coz they think it shows hatred towards british, which infact the movie shows the reality of british imperialism & tyrany toward indians & yet jury thinks that \"British bura maan jayengey\" infact brits still have this colonial mindsets towards india. Anyways!A MUST WATCH MOVIE FOR EVERY INDIAN.",

I loved this movie very, very much, even though it was long and some of its scenes sometimes made you tired, but not tired of moving the film forward ,No, you'd be tired of all the cruelty you're seeing.2. Vicky's act was great \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb was extremely cheesy and classy with proper re-action and act-to-fit and just very good himself into the role\n3. The director had come to inform about the oppression that had been inflicted on his people, and this oppression was inflicted not only on the People of India, but also to the entire population of the Middle East, including Iran,afghanistan,... during World War I and II, which he displayed very well and, of course, painfully.And he had the right choice in choosing the actor, I think and Vicky had played really well and had replaced Irfan Khan to fill somewhat well ...\nP. N: Irfan Khan was supposed to be starring in the film, but his illness caused him to not do the film.4. The first half of the film is a little slow and bored, but the second half of the film while being very painful and sad, so if you don't have the heart to see the heartbreaking scenes don't see!!I'll add something, friends who saw Rang de basanti from Aamir Khan and liked it, they'd definitely like this movie because the space for the two films is about the same as everyone.Finally, if you're not interested in the historical-political genre, this movie is no good to you.Thanks.",

No song has in it ; I'm bit of dissatisfied, may be, it doesn't urged any song.

Conversely hate has gradually increased towards the bloody demonic Britishers ; how brutally murdered our sisters n brothers, created river of blood. In my views, What Udham Singh had done in their own territory is absolutely right. Tit for tat. I watched the whole film with the great touching of my heart. I loved it.Every characters are looking quite convincing in their role except Bhagat Singh. This character could be a little better. Doesn't suit that guy who has been casted for it. Anyway, Vicky's acting is quite hard to follow ; so natural. Nailed it. Others are also very good.My rating for this film 10/10.To you,\nGo for it, it's a good film extremely worthwhile.",

            "content": "Shoojit Sircar always stunned us with his beautiful works like Vicky Donor, Madras Cafe, Piku, October, and now he came back with his new one Sardar Udham, a biopic about revolutionary Udham Singh. We all witnessed many films regarding the freedom struggle in India, Sardar Udham also shows the freedom struggles and the colonized vision of the British empire. We can note the storyline in one word because this is the story of revenge. It invites us into 1919; the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and Udham Singh's journey to assassin the man behind the massacre, Micheal O'dwyer. The film goes in a non-linear pattern where we are seeing Udham in his fourties and then straight him as a teenager. He planned to kill Dwyer, worked as his assistant but waited for 21 years to take his revenge. This is quite a strange thing because we all have that question, why doesn't he kill him early? The answer is that he wants to take his revenge in public because Dwyer has also done the same. I can remember the face of Udham Singh while he come out from the Caxton Hall when he took his revenge. He doesn't feel any kind of guilty even he smiles when he accompanies the policemen. That was the most memorable moment in the film. The last part of the film is also brilliant where Sircar shows the activities that happened at Jallianwala Bagh. It was so intense, so violent and I hesitate to open my eyes for that 30 minutes long 'massacre scene'. It was so disturbing one. There lies the true intention of Udham Singh to take his revenge. All the technical aspects of the film are top-notch. The length of the film seems a little long even the director can short some 15-20 minutes without affecting the film. Anyway I'm not using this platform for the negatives I like the film very much and it is watchable.",

Scenes of Jallianwala Bagh massacre make your hearts bleed. Vicky Kaushal, in my humble view, is at par with acting stalwarts like Irrfan Khan, Nasseeruddin Shah.

            "content": "As an Indian history nerd and cinephile, I have been dying for a movie to portray the era leading up to Indian independence without the lens of Bollywood patriotism or Gandhi's way of looking away from anything violent and show exactly what happened.This movie (mostly) set in the early-to-late 30s in Imperial Britain manages to do so on many fronts. Ongoing revolutions against the British empire, the rise of communism in the eastern Europe and the impending World War II set the backdrop for the movie. O Dwyer's proud speeches on his leadership, Churchill's cold-heartedness, Bhagat Singh's ideology and Gandhi's relentless fight can all be found in parts.On the technical front, the set design and cinematography are nearly flawless, while the sound design and the lighting really help these \"troubling\" times come to life. The attention to detail you see in each scene is encouraging to say the least.The direction of proven creator Sircar really shines in this gloomy affair. The timeline he chooses to show different events is extremely effective. The acting is great throughout. Vicky's portrayal of a man staring at death in the past, fighting alone in the present for even a slightly better future, is impeccable. While his scenes with Bhagat Singh give an insight on the playfulness of their brotherhood, his trying and failing efforts to re-build his organization is disheartening and his interactions with O Dwyer are absolutely gut wrenching. The acting by supporting cast is also amazing, especially the actor portraying O Dwyer.The massacre itself is captured in all its brutality. The leading circumstances to the inhumane order, followed by the aftermath straight form the eyes of a certain Udham is likely to give you nightmares, and for good reason.On negatives, the movie might be too long for its own good, but in my opinion it utilizes that time really effectively. Maybe some unnecessary scenes which don't move the plot could be cut but I am really nit-picking here.In conclusion, to anyone who happened to read this, I hope you can dedicate 3 hours of your time to this story of a common man standing up to his circumstances. I believe you won't be disappointed!",

Every single frame shown, all the dialogues delivered takes you deep inside the soul of the story.Hats off to the director. From Vicky Donor, Piku, October, now Shoojit Sircar has reached a Mel Gibson level direction. (I'm not kidding). The massacre of Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, was only a one-page article in my textbook. But the way they narrated, easily took me back to that period and understand their plight. The incredible, horrific, cinematic expression of that tragedy will always remain in my mind.

The scale and the depth in which they have captured the horrific event is truly phenomenal.The cinematography and music are beatiful and goes hand in hand throughout the movie, which makes sure to transport us into the time the incident took place.Vicky Kaushal has given his best performance to portray Sardam Udham singh.It would have been even great if we would have been able to experience this movie on the big screen of theatre.Kudos to the whole crew for making such a great attempt in making this wonderful movie.",

The dark tone of the movie reminds us about the dark fates our VEER SWATANTRA SENANI smilingly embraced as a result of which we are living a colourful and joyous life.

Next national award for best actor doesn't go to Vicky kaushal and the national awards loose their credentials for me. All the supporting cast were perfect.I would specially mention about the mentions and presentation of veer bhagat singh in this movie, its very short like not more than 3 minutes, but we get an insight of his personality and philosophical aspect better than we get in the ajay devgan film, I love that movie but we have to give we're credits are due.At last the hero of this movie sujeet sirkar, I wasn't expecting anything less than this.A very well made movie.",

Shoojit sir is one of the best directors we have in this generation and Avik sir's cinematography gives you Hollywood cinema experience. Amol's acting as Sardar bhagat singh is just just outstanding and Banita Sandhu is so mesmerizing...we really need her more in movies! But my god!!! VICKY KAUSHAL hands down Mann!! What an actor, he portrayed the young as well as 40 yr old man with such an ease that it really makes you think what intense he has as an actor! Every second is worth appreciation and it's his eyes that deserves another best supporting award !!!! Who says we can't make a movie like Schindler's list ???? Hats off to the brilliant team!!

Courtesy editing, the director and cinematographer manage to save the movie more than once in the first half. The storytelling improves in the second half but not enough to save the movie entirely.

The cinematography is top notch, locations are top notch, art direction was authentic capturing that era very well. Coming to performances, barring Vicky kaushal and banita sandhu, there are not any familiar faces here. All the actors have performed well including the British actors. The actor who played dwyer looks like male tilda swinton. The last act is horrific and disturbing as it not just captures a massacre but also its aftermath.But the film runs at a slow pace which might test your patience.

            "content": "Shoojit Sircar returns with his dream project; Sardar Udham. Shoojit shuffles between two genres primarily: Slice of life & Biopics/Historical films. Udham belongs to the latter. Sardar Udham is the story of Udham Singh, a revolutionary known for assassinating Michael O'Dwyer to avenge the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The film follows Udham from the day before the massacre to the day he is hanged to death. The meticulous planning he puts in place to orchestrate the assassination is phenomenal!With Shoojit Sircar at the helm, you are guaranteed something extraordinary at the very least. Sardar Udham exceeds expectations with a scintillating Vicky Kaushal in the lead. There are no words to describe his committed performance. His character is a man of few words but his expressions and actions speak volumes (post massacre scenes). The era in which the film is set (from 1919 to 1940) is perfectly captured & one can't praise the cinematographer, #avikmukhopadhyay enough for his beautiful work. The supporting cast do not have much to do but they fit in perfectly. We do not have any cringe worthy Hindi speaking Brits like other pre-independence set films.Sardar Udham is a masterpiece. It is one of the most authentic; well researched biopics made till date in India and it adopts the non-linear narrative in the best possible way. It saves the massacre bit till the very end for effect. There isn't a better depiction of the same onscreen. The horrors of that incident reverberate even today. Sardar Udham moves at a snail's pace; something the film calls for. So build up your patience and savour this biopic that you will not forget anytime soon.",

Just the story of a man Whose aim was to take Kill Something What was the Abaft the death of his Hundreds of Countrymen. Since I optically canvassed #VickyKaushal in Masaan I ken there was something special in this man and I became his astronomically immense, but this time he surprised me everybody by giving one of the best performance in the history of indian cinema. It doesn't seems akin to he's acting he looks so authentic, Impeccable, Effortlessly he has distributed such arduous performance. The Jalian wala bag Massacre Track of the movie is the most heartbreaking Emotional scene in the history of indian cinema. Especially that scene Where Udham is Shouting \" Is anyone alive \" looking around for availing Wounded ones with Hundreds of dead bodies lying down made me cry. The background score is great, Kudos to Soorjit Sircar For such a brilliant direction. Writers Deserve the appreciation for inditing The authentic things not integrating any Massy Things Make it Better Than All the Biopics Made in Bollywood till Now.

Thank god, they choose good English actors.

            "content": "Usually a key event of a biopic is shown at the end for maximum impact, but with Sardar Udham, Shoojit Sarkar has taken a nonlinear approach and the death of Michael O'Dwyer is shown randomly at the beginning and from there on the story unfolds. Some people have criticized the nonlinear form of storytelling, but I found it to be quite exciting because you don't know what to expect from the next scene. We all know what Sardar Udham did, but we don't know anything about him, his journey, so the director's focus was on Sardar Udham and not on the event that he is famous for.THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THIS FILM :1. Great acting by Vicky Kaushal. If an actor makes a role memorable despite barely speaking in a film then you know that he has done a truly outstanding job in it. Vicky had to express mostly through his facial expressions and body language and he managed to do it with full believability. The climax portion of the film required a thin young boy and I am really glad that Vicky did it that role. The physical transformation that he undertook for that role was truly praiseworthy. During that 45 minute long sequence, he truly immersed himself into the character and the screenplay. It felt like he was actually in the middle of tragedy and trying to fight it out with the best of his abilities. Truly remarkable performance!2. The research and detailing in the film is extremely good. From showing every sequence of how a trunk call was made and processed during those times to the depiction of Jallianwala Bagh massacre, everything is spot on. Indian cinema has never seen depiction of a tragedy like it was done in this film. 30 minutes were dedicated to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and its aftermath, and it's not easy to watch. Eyes being shot, twisting of arms, breaking of bones, children getting killed off, hundreds of innocent people getting trampled over, heavily injured people seeking help with only dead bodies around them, blood flowing like water on the stairs of a house....it was a horror show like we have never seen before. Hollywood has never shied away from showing gore and violence, but Indian movies have always stayed away from going too deep into any such event. The agony and hardships that follow a tragedy are no less painful than the tragedy itself, and Sardar Udham has captured those sequences and emotions like never before.3. The cinematography of the film is extremely beautiful. Avik Mukhopadhyay has done a tremendous job in capturing the beautiful locations, but the climax is where he has truly outdone himself. The lighting and camerawork of the Jallianwala Bagh sequence is spectacular. Filmed at night and yet everything is visible crystal clear.4. There are no songs in the film. It's rare to see an Indian film with no songs, but in Sardar Udham it works. The focus is always on the proceedings and there are no unnecessary distractions. Some critics have said that there should have been a song at the end, a theme song that summarizes Sardar Udham's journey or an emotional song. But in my opinion, they are wrong because they have completely missed the point. After the unbearable and agonizing screams of people massacred at the Jallianwala Bagh, small children crying out for help with no one to answer, children trying to wake up their dead parents, parents trying to search and revive their dead children, what kind of music would have possibly satisfied anyone? Why would anyone even need a song there? Silence was all that was required, and that was the choice the director made.5. Banita Sandhu did not speak a single word in the film, but you will remember her after watching the film. Her expressions, behavior, smile, everything leaves a mark. Her presence made the film beautiful.6. The selection of foreign actors was done very well. Normally any white person is selected to play the role of foreigners, because it doesn't really matter. I can't blame them, because people don't see Indian films to see the white actors and you have to pay them much more considering the difference between Indian Rupee and American Dollar or Euro or Pound. So why would an Indian producer pay more money for actors that won't even be relevant to anyone ultimately. But somehow this film has managed to get decent white actors and actresses and all of them have left their mark.7. The movie is quite clear in its ideology. Sardar Udham avenges the death of innocent Indian people at the Jallianwala Bagh by assassinating General D'wyer. Sardar Udham gives him the punishment that he always deserved, but never received. But for the crime committed by a Britisher, Udham does not hate the entire British community. He made friends with the white people, he developed a special relationship with a white girl, so quite clearly he was not carrying hatred in his heart, he had no intention of hurting innocent souls, and he was not a terrorist, even though British history might make you believe otherwise.8. More than 50 percent of the film is in English, because that's the language in which the British people talk. Usually, the white people are made to speak Hindi, which is understandable because the movie is being made for Indians and not everyone understands English, but it removes the believability from that scene and more often than not makes it look funny. This movie takes care of that aspect.9. This movie highlights what Sardar Udham Singh stood for, what his beliefs were, which is extremely important because they are relevant even today, more than ever. Sardar Udham had more faith in love than any religion, that's why when he was asked to take an oath inside the court, he requested for 'Heer', a poetic love story by Waris Shah, instead of any religious book. Inside the prison, he called himself Ram Mohammad Singh Azad, a name that brought together the three main religions of India, Hinduism, Islam and Sikhism. People need to remember Sardar Udham, not only for what he did but also for what his principles and beliefs were.In conclusion, all that is left to say is that Sardar Udham was a revolutionary and not a terrorist, while Britain needs to apologize for the massacre done by their government at Jallianwala Bagh, a small gesture that is still waiting to happen for the last 102 years, a not so 'great' feat of Britain.",

The question is if this is a compelling story or more importantly, a compelling movie. It does get a bit repetitive in the middle after the assassinations. The structure of the movie is slightly problematic. This is really a character study of the lead character. It needs to show the massacre first and give context to his drive.

One of the most striking things about this film is its incredible production values. All of the historical settings are convincingly brought to life and portrayed with flawless dark cinematography, fully immersing us in the circumstances of the day. The other striking aspect of the film is the unfortunately accurate portrayal of the massacre. It really does not shy away from showing massive showers of blood and gore that simply go on and on without pause. Even after it is over, the film lingers on the rescue of the survivors among the piles of corpses. The impact of the final moments truly pay off the extended build up.",

The film can be termed as a masterpiece primarily because of the research conducted to make the film. The film portrays the perfect description of the changes in the life of Shaheed Udham Singh after the brutal massacre which eventually forces him to take the revenge by killing Michael O'Dwyer.Vicky Kaushal is one of the best actors in Indian film industry currently and his best part is that he adapt the characters so intensely that it seems that we are seeing the character himself.The screenplay of the film is slow but is very effective and the last hour of the film is probably the most difficult to watch. The best part of the film is that the film is kept mostly near to the reality and no unnecessary masala is added to the film and the originality maintained.The climax of the film is thought provoking and gives a great closure to the film.

            "content": "Sardar Udham Singh starts slowly, jumping timelines and taking time to lay the groundwork for the second half and climax of the movie, and the payoff is a haunting and gut-wrenching movie watching experience.Despite our history books containing very scarce information about Sardar Udham Singh, the movie does a commendable job of outlining his character and also establishes his camaraderie with other freedom fighters of the time.But it's the second half of the movie that will stay with you. I don't remember watching any movie or documentary that has done justice to what happened on that infamous day of April 13, 1919. A crowd of innocent, unarmed men, women and children were mercilessly fired upon by the white supremacists of British imperialism. That the British are yet to tender an official apology for this crime against humanity proves that the evil of racism and supremacist ideology is well and alive.The movie also a makes a smart but subtle point of how the British were fighting the scourge of Nazism in Europe while at the same time enslaving millions of Indians and trampling upon their rights, while having no shame in asking for Indian soldiers to fight their enemies in Europe.The writing of the movie deserves a special mention as it does not resort to jingoism or song and dance to make a point for patriotism.This is by no doubt Vicky Kaushal's best performance till date. He carries the whole film and by the end of it becomes the character.Personally, have never cried watching a patriotic movie, but I couldn't stop my tears at the Jallianwala Bagh scene. And it is not anger that you feel, it's a kind of helplessness and sadness, and shock that humans can think of so little of other humans just because of their skin colour and a false sense of superiority that they think it's justified to massacre them in this manner.",

            "content": "A loose retelling of events in the life of Udham Singh (Vicky Kaushal) from 1919 until his execution in 1940.On the 13th April 1919, Colonel Reginald Dyer (Andrew Havill) ordered his men to open fire on thousands of unarmed civilians at a peaceful protest at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar. He was given the go ahead for this use of force by Sir Michael O'Dwyer (Shaun Scott) - the then Lieutenant Governor of Punjab. This resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children - later known as the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.Udham Singh was a member of anti-colonial movements in India, and when these revolutionary groups were squashed, he travelled to London to regroup with members there. In 1940 he took it him on himself to assassinate Michael O'Dywer during a speech he was giving at Caxton Hall.Udham Singh was tried and executed for his actions.The film is a non-linear retelling of this story. And whilst it has romanticised some of the aspects, it holds mostly true in with the facts that are of the most important - namely British hypocrisy and the brutality of colonial rule in India.This film was indirectly shunned by Western award nominations for its anti-capitalism and anti-British sentiments - however it simply asked questions everyone should be asking about British history and its exploitation and indifference to lives in India.It exposes that conceit colonialism - claiming everyone who doesn't live by British standards (and pays into Britain) are savages. It exposes British hypocrisy - the British were happy to commit acts of brutal crimes and murder - but lambast anyone who would to act this way against them. The British are happy to use fear as a deterrent, but blame terrorists for the same behaviour.The massacre scenes at the end was pretty carnal - savage viewing - however the reality was that the British signed off on the murder of thousands of men, women and children in a tight area by gunfire - hard to see how this ending was \"over the top\".Worth a watch for the beautiful cinematography, its wide use of locations, and its non-linear editing which makes the expected and known story come alive more.",

Example - how did he get a job at the former Punjab's governors house? It must have been very interesting. Details are missing at the critical moments. It's not as bad as Akshay Kumar's non-fiction crap (that guy literally takes a super good story- destroys it , takes the money and moves on to the next one. No respect for real life characters. I am pretty sure the real life protagonist in 'Padman' did not look anything like Akshay Kumar). Watch it , but at the end you just end up feeling unsatisfied.

I like the way that they show the story or background of character only when the main character wanted to tell it.MOTIVATIONAL - in first half, i got so much motivated by watching the dedication, patience and hardwork of the main character sardar udham singh. Seriously it is so energetic.BRUTALITY - as i said earlier, this movie is different from other bollywood nationalist movies because, this movie wasn't hesitate to show the brutality. I mean to say that, other movies didn't show the blood and violence due to censorship, but this movie has courage to show that gore scenes openly.CINEMATOGRAPHY - the combination of cinematography, Lighting & colours is quite good especially in jallianwala bagh massacre. Those frames are directed well.NATIONALISM - after watching the movie, you will definitely get a sense of nationalism in your heart, by watching that, how those freedom fighters works hard with full dedication for independent india. And nowadays, we are unable to understand the value of that freedom which we received from hardwork or even death of freedom fighters.Negatives :-LENGTHY - this movie has so many filler scenes which increase its length. The second half is so slow paced, like i have to skip some frames. And also i don't have a habit of watching a movie of 3hrs.Movie creators can cut some scenes to make it short, but They extend it unnecessarily.",

The locations, sets, clothing all give the feel of watching history as it happened. D of P and then camerawork is so outstanding. The massacre scene and aftermath are shown realistically, but not gory, instead, one feels the sadness and gravity of the entire India situation.A great, great film that should be seen by most people in the UK.

I can't talk enough about it, the cinematography was the factor that attracted me the most after I watched the trailer but when I went into the movie, every single thing was just perfectly synchronized, the production, the score, the screenplay, the direction, the acting every single thing just made this a perfect treat for me and I think for most of the movie lovers. I've heard people found the first part slow but I think it was at a suitable pace, more speediness could've made it another Bollywood masala movie which was not good for the story it was pursuing. I remember when I first saw Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, I was just fascinated with everything even when it was \"Bollywoody\" sometimes, but this one just surpassed it. Kudos to the making team and specially Shoojit Sircar and love for Vicky Kaushal.",

For someone who knows nothing about the Jalianwala Bagh Massacre and the attached revolutionist acts the first half would be very very confusing. But the second half complete made up for the weaknesses of first half.This movie deserves to be watched by everyone. Everyone deserves to see the real face of the pathetic Sadist 'Michael O'Dwyer', whom, instead of giving a death penalty, British Government awarded the title 'Sir'.",

But it is new, it is really a brilliant piece by Shoojit Sircar , especially the details it has got right, how the radio in the background is telling the events of the WW2 , the representation of the curfew imposed at the time of massacre , it's brilliant. Most importantly the conversation feels realistic as it is in British English and not in some form of anglicised Hindi \ud83d\ude05 which we have been used to hearing in most of Bollywood movies. The last few minutes of the movie stays with you , makes you think again ,what did it cost us to get our freedom back .Most importantly the phrase \"white Man's Burden \" , kept coming in the movie and kept on reminding you what it was actually. This is really a wonderful creation and the character of Martyr Sardar Udham Singh is portrayed brilliantly by Vicky Kaushal , a true versatile actor which Bollywood needs desperately.

            "content": "Shoojit Sircar has always been sort of an anomaly in Bollywood. His movies have a touch of reality that is rarely seen these days on silver screen. Bollywood, in general, is pretty bad in this regard as any connection to reality is dispensed in favor of some forced drama, ill-fitted romance or untimely comedy. Sardar Udham is head and shoulders above those Bollywood movies.The biopic almost plays like a documentary, following Udham on his life-defining actions. But you will never be fooled into thinking it's a documentary because of how cinematic it looks. The movie jumps back and forth to the present and some past event in his life, either seen through flashes of his own memories or through third person. It also feels very well researched. I'm in no way an expert on the subject but the dialogues don't feel out of context or exaggerated. Most conversations are like one would expect during those moments.Another great thing about the movie is that it sheds some light on how brutal British colonization of India was. You hear a lot about world war and there are at least a dozen hollywood and western movies each year on the subject but you don't see really well researched movies like this on the British colonization. Movies like these deserve to be seen by a wider audience but it's only possible if it's (somewhat) based on reality. I'm glad that Shoojit Sircar and his team have managed to do that. As with most Bollywood movies, it is on the longer side and does feel a bit dry at times but there weren't any scenes that felt unnecessary. Overall, a solid Biopic - definitely the best Indian one. 9 out of 10.",

There is not even accurate information whether they were ever put in same jail. There are some freedom fighters of India that we do not have information about them which unfortunately includes Shaheed Udham Singh but Indian Directors try to add some 'Masala' just to make a 2-3 hour movie. They add a title 'Based on true events' just to attract audience. It's so sad when I watch such kind of cinema. I request people to please read about Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh and you will observe discrepancies in the events shown in Shaheed's Udham Singh so called true movie. People who do not have time to read will believe that some of the events are true. Directors' should let people know that they add their own stuff.Just agree that we do not have much information about Udham Singh. I want to let people know that Udham Singh's family financial conditions are very bad. His grand kids are doing labor work.

Screenplay, art direction, editing, action, costumes, casting, sound track, topped by a brilliant performance by Vicky Kaushal. All put together into a superb masterpiece by Shoojit. The effort taken to create London and India of early 1900's, the cars, buildings, costumes, the props and the attention to detail ranks with the best in the world. The central premise (Jalianwala Baug Massacre) around which the film is based on, is chilling, brutal and realistically executed. You really feel the raw pain, shock and grief of Udham Singh when he's in Jalianwala Baug, and then you understand his resolve and determination to avenge the dastardly act after 21 long years. It should be the only contender from India for Oscars 2022. An unknown story, fabulously told. Take a bow Shoojit Sircar.",

Never mind that momentary compulsion of Shoojit to make Bhagat Singh clarify the difference between a terrorist and a revolutionery!You can watch Sardar Udham for its climax alone - probably among the most disturbing and gut-wrenching massacre sequences ever filmed in Indian cinema. Richard Attenborough's Jaliawala bagh sequence in Gandhi must have dwelled for long in Shoojit's head.Must watch!You'll be shocked to realize how thanklessly brazen have we become in handling our freedom.",

In addition to it some of the scenes of Jaliwanwala massacre were repeated and though he tried to bring resemblance of Nolan's work it lacked the completeness. Amol Parashar as Bhagat Singh was not convincing as he often was going back to his TVF accent from the fake Punjabi accent he tried so hard.

Truly a classic cinema which did not win the hearts of as many audience which it truly deserved. Be a stronghearted person when you watch the scene of Jalianwalabagh incident. Definitely a must watch to get a sense of Independence story which was untold so far until Sardar Udham was watched.",

What has the killing of a man ever actually achieved? It never makes anything any better. It serves to galvanise both sides and retrench enmities and bitterness that can take many years to wain. This film depicts one such story. That of a man who also passionately believed it was acceptable to take a life. His motives appear demonstrably justifiable as we watch this beautifully shot, frequently harrowing, depiction of the lead up to the atrocity of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919. It is told through the eyes of the assassin - Udham Singh (Vicky Kaushal) and over the course of the next two hours, we are exposed to the events that drove a decent man to commit the ultimate sin, and to pay the ultimate penalty. Whilst it does take a little while to get going, Shoojit Sircar develops a story replete with conflicting emotions, that offers a critique on the prevailing imperial attitudes and on the very value of life itself. It clearly, and succinctly, exemplifies the cruelty visited on people who just wanted to be left to govern themselves; and of the shockingly arrogant superiority complex of those who believed these people to be little more capable of such aspirations than pets, or sheep. The film looks stunning - the imagery of India from grand scale to violent aftermath; the settings in London - all add hugely to the gusty integrity of this story. As with so much about the man himself, much is still be be made public about these events and about the true intent of the vice-regal, or British, government in making an example of these unarmed protesters - but this surmising offers an entirely plausible assessment of man's inhumanity to man - and sadly, over 100 years on from this - we appear to have learned little about the merits of killing another human being - friend or foe.",

I'm so curious as to what they teach their children in schools, this is outrageous.This may be shallow but when I saw the trailer I wanted to watch the movie because ofcourse I was curious about the history but also because of the beauty of london during that era and the cinematography (which I must say did not disappoint). While I did enjoy seeing the buildings and the how london was depicted. I did not feel any Indian places lacking in beauty anywhere. And that's the beauty of this movie.

This movie will definitely give an opportunity to young India to understand the scenarios during the colonial rule.Our historians (or the history books) always granted importance to few selected leaders and younger generation may not be aware that thousands of people were subjected to inhuman torture and sacrificed their lives for the sake of the country's freedom.So thanks a lot, to the director for these great initiatives and rating is for that. We badly need this kind of movies to communicate to our new generation as well as rest of the world that what Britishers did to us.

Excellent directing and production gave the Udham Singh story the loneliness and isolation I sadly think he endured during his short life.

Even those who played the British characters, it's rare that in a Bollywood movie they'll allow British actors or characters to shine. Vicky Kaushal's best performance after the great Masaan. And the final act is just truly mind blowing, those last 40mins was so uneasy & disturbing to watch. Brilliantly shot, staged & directed in such a way that felt real as if someone went back in time and put invisible cameras in between. The only thing that's bad or doesn't go well with the film is its editing, very odd, at times cutting between different angles abruptly, and stretched, could have been shortened.Shoojit Sircar probably the best director in Bollywood today, best at biopics and someone who can make Bollywood movies without its hallmark songs/dances and this is what the industry needs. Truly deserved to be selected for Oscars from India and the jury didn't send it by saying \"it has too much hatred for British\" lol, and they call themselves Indians or filmmakers and give lectures in film schools. Still they expect British Govt to officially apologise for their acts, when the sense of ownership is lost in what's rightfully yours...",

The story telling that the director and the writers Shubhendu Bhattacharya and Ritesh Shah adopted was very unique and gripping. We have seen in Bollywood whenever films are made on India's freedom struggle or depicting the life of any freedom fighter the approach is quite different. Too much of jingoism is usually fed to the audience in the name of patriotism. But this film is completely different and not for a second will take that road. Top notch cinematography, very authentic visuals of the 1930-40s London will only make the film too realistic and grounded. Overall this has to be the best film made in India this year.

            "content": "Shoojit Sircar is a film director who has always attempted to make different films on a variety of subjects from the very first film of his career. He has tried to explore not so much talked about the topic of sperm donation in the film Vicky Donor. Piku is a heartwarming film about the problem of constipation - it is a film that explored different nuances of a father-daughter relationship. Madras Cafe is an intriguing political thriller. October shows a man's obsession towards a dying woman. Gulabo Sitabo is a social satire. Sardar Udham is his first endeavour to make a patriotic film. He could have easily chosen the loud, melodramatic template followed by other Bollywood nationalistic films. But he has chosen a toned-down approach to tell the story of Sardar Udham Singh in a much humane and pragmatic way. After seeing this film, I do not doubt saying Shoojit Sircar is one of the best directors of the country. I would like to congratulate the director for putting out a strong statement through his nuanced and subtle filmmaking.The movie starts on a captivating note with multiple time jumps in the first half an hour only. You may feel a little disconnected at the beginning. But the screenplay slowly sucks you into the world. It has all the ingredients to keep you engaged throughout the 2 hours 40 minutes stint of the film. The last 45 minutes hits you hard in the gut. It is really difficult to sit through the entire massacre chapter. People may complain that this chapter is unnecessarily long. In my opinion, it was required to establish the haunting impact the tragedy had on Udham's soul which he had to carry till the end of his life.Vicky Kaushal has improved his acting to a great extent. This role was originally written for Irrfan Khan. To get into the shoes of Irrfan Khan is not easy job. Vicky Kaushal's clinical performance pays a heartfelt tribute to Irrfan Khan - his facial expressions, expressive eyes, body language are incredible in the movie.Technically the film is nearly flawless. Abhik Mukhopadhyay, the national award-winning cinematographer, does an invigorating job recreating 1919 Punjab and England of the 1930s and 40s. Each frame has been designed with absolute precision. Background score by Shantanu Moitra adds a different dimension to the narrative. Editing is slightly out of the place. The film could have been trimmed a bit.The supporting actors have done a decent job. Amol Parashar plays the role of Bhagat Singh - he has broken all the stereotypical portrayals of the character. He has approached the role with a different point of view and brings out much-needed freshness. Banita Sandhu plays a small role with conviction as well.The last five minutes of the film will leave you speechless. I watched the film on a Saturday night. I was struggling to sleep on that day. Even the film kept coming to my mind next few days as well. I think you have already watched the film, if not do watch it at the earliest.",

Some are decent, some are below average & most of them are unbearable with otherworldly odd vfx and whatsapp status special love songs no one asked for! In this suffocating condition of biographical movies, to break the sinister prototype skeleton, a cinematic revolution was much needed; Shoojit Sircar brought it with a masterstroke named Sardar Udham!Inspite of the promise shown by the film, I didn't expect that it can avoid the typical bollywood biography making formula completely and masterfully! I am not sure what to say and what not about this technically supreme work. From the colour and cinematography to the recreation of historically accurate scenes; from the extraordinary score to the blazing screenplay; everything was so technical that it demands a separate writing.There is no need of any forcibly induced emotional scenes or jingoistic dialogues when you have a strong story in hand and technical men at office. In this type of work, the rawness should be evident to justify the actions. Director did exactly the same. He kept the raw tone intact and treated it with a no nonsense approach.The movie did exceptionally well with some decision making. Use of original languages and not hindi in abnormal accent was one of the main reason why the movie feels so original. The story telling technique was also authentic. Special mention to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre recreation; it was so detailed, raw and moving that we can feel ourselves there!Vicky Kaushal added another feather in his cap delivering a composed, mature yet breathtaking performance as Udham Singh. Supporting casts were brilliant and apt. The unbiased development of characters was also superb. Actually there were hardly anything to complain about in this masterfully crafted movie.Sircar's Sardar Udham is the only biographical work coming out from Bollywood in recent years, which is able to break the rusty prototype and create a benchmark which will surely bring a wave of making serious movies devoid off the business model approach! Remarkable..@Review.",

            "content": "Indian Cinema has seen quite a lot of films set in the colonial milieu espousing the freedom struggle, but what sets apart Sardar Udham from the rest is its interesting treatment of the revenge drama trope complimented well by the rich production design, staying clear of the usual stereotypes with dramatization and expressional typecasting of Western artistes.Set in the backdrop of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the film explores the motivations for the Indian Revolutionary Udham Singh for deciding to avenge the act committed during the British rule. At its heart, the film wishes for the audience to empathize with the victims and realize the value of the revenge that was taken, as does many others. Munich comes to mind immediately that handled the arc so very well and succeeded in creating the kind of impact. This one too does, but rather than setting the anger seethe in the audience in the initial moments to be pacified later through revenge, the screenplay of Sardhar Udham takes us on a deep-dive into the psyche of protagonist, the act of revenge and his modus operandi before unleashing the bloody act bare on the screen. The result is that it leaves a larger impact on us that lingers for a long time even after the movie is over.The film also deserves appreciation for not being too preachy and resists from the popular temptation to drive home the communist doctrines of the protagonist outside the context of freedom struggle. There is just one instance of a clash he has with his supervisor that comes close, but largely the film stays clear of influencing political opinions and staying matter of fact to the characters' stances. Melodrama too is largely adequate and doesn't go overboard except towards the last portion of the movie wherein a little sense of repetition creeps in, though not to the extent of diluting the impact. What is more astounding about the movie is how well the narration travels back and forth time in sync with that Udham undergoes during the investigation, without them necessarily being a narration from the characters themselves. The supporting characters - from the one who plays Bhagat Singh, Scotland Yard policemen, the communist leader, Udham's accomplices, his love interest to the villains of the act, all get utilized just to play their parts, being significant without being loud.As far as performances go, Vicky Kaushal hits it out of the park. And so do every other supporting artiste, including the non-Indian performers, whose expressions have remained more native than artificial as it usually has been in other Indian period dramas. Technically, the production value for bringing out the setting for this historical drama is tremendous and never really gets itself self-promoted to shout its significance. The Britain of 1920's has never been shown with such authenticity in Indian cinema before, as I recollect. Cinematography too was exquisite, however felt the hand-held movements were over done in some places, specifically the interrogation scenes. Editing played a significant part in elevating the screenplay travels during the narration and as far as the drag in the last section goes, the blame doesn't lie as much in editing as it does on the deliberate intention in the writing.Overall - one of the finest movies to come out in recent times. Go watch it.",

Editing is top notch. Background score is haunting. Cinematography is on par with some of the best war movies produced. 30 minutes in one would forget if this is an Indian Bollywood movie or an international movie - that too directed by an Indian director. Its that damn good.Part of me was glad that the movie didn't start with the Jallianwala massacre because I wasn't ready for it. May be because it has been portrayed in several movies by now. But by the end I was proven wrong. Never ever has the story of what unfolded on that dreadful day in 1919 been told with this boldness. It's not for faint hearted. But it's a must see for every Indian.Don't read those reviews from guardian. News18 and others. They are trying to bring down a masterpiece as they don't want the world to see the genocide British government officials committed and went unpunished for a century.It's been 102 years since then and as the movie says at the end we Indians are still waiting for an official apology from British government.Must watch for every Indian living on the planet. Even if you are not an Indian watch it to witness the brilliance of the character and atrocities the nation and its citizens had gone through in just a slice of what was the freedom movement.Thank you Sircar and Vicky for the brilliant masterpiece.

However, I was wronged, when saw \"Sardar Udham (2021)\" on Amazon Prime, and was struck deeply by the silent-to-the-world aftermath of Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, which is rarely discussed in History Books but shown loud and clear in the movie. I can't do justice in this small review with limited words about how perfectly the time period between 1920s to 1940s is shown in the movie. The sets, backgrounds, incidents, screenplay, dialogue and costumes are so well researched (this thing is missed in most bollywood historical movies), I praise everyone who were behind it. Vicky Kaushal gives his 100% and successfully justifies great \"Shaheed Udham Singh\" ji. Other than him, rest of the cast are also impactful.Now, coming to the core story, the best thing about \"Sardar Udham\" is that it not just tells you a story and gives you a 'history lesson', but makes you ask questions about everyone's actions involved, and through its non-linear story, gives you answers of them one by one. This makes it A MUST WATCH!Lastly, I want to say that this movie matches the level of Spielberg's Schindler's List, which is hardest to match (also, which is my favorite movie).

            "content": "Have grown up reading about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in school and hearing the infamous mention of this piece of history, in many a patriotic film, but never ever, I imagined the brutality of the bloodbath, the massacre, so vividly and in such a horrific way, as it is shown in Shoojit Sircar's Sardar Udham. It makes you sit up and realize and understand the enormity of all that happened on a dreadful day. The 15-20 minutes of the Jallianwala bagh sequence is disturbing, to say the least, with thousands of bodies piled up, blood everywhere, people moaning in pain, and Sardar Udham shouting in angst - koi Zinda hai (is anyone alive)? Is enough to send chills down the spine and give you goosebumps. That one scene will definitely stay with you for a long time, leaving you teary-eyed and tugging at your heartstrings! It makes you feel helpless, fills you up with rage, makes you want to go down on your knees and pray for the people suffering and empathize with them!No doubt, there have been many patriotic films that leave a mark on you but somehow I felt, one way or the other, it always got bogged down by the eternal Bollywood-ism of loud music or unnecessary dialogues, trying to make the film or the protagonist larger than life, but Sardar Udham strictly refrains from toeing the treaded Bollywood line! It is unrelenting, non-apologetic in its premise of showing the true events, as is, without taking too many cinematic liberties. Shoojit Sircar's grip on the screenplay is so taut, that even at 2.45 hours of screentime, you cannot take yourself away from it all. Helping him in this is the wonderful cinematography of Avik Mukhopadhyay, which sets the tone for the film. Be it the misty Punjab farms, the snowcapped Russia, the bloodbath at the JB, everything lends authenticity to the plot.Vicky Kaushal's given a stellar performance from being a young boy unable to fathom what's going on to becoming totally stoic after seeing so many deaths to being totally focussed single-mindedly about avenging the JB massacre, in other words, he need not even ask - how's the josh? He practically lives Sardar Udham and fills you up with josh with his measured performance. Amol Parashar, Banita Sandhu, and Kristy Everton make an impression too, even though their roles being small.As said earlier too, Sardar Udham does not tread the familiar line, hence you do not have any gora talking in anglicized Hindi and all, (thank God and Shoojit) and thus you have Shaun Scott and Stephen Hogan again bringing authenticity to the table.Sardar Udham has a lot to offer in terms of the narrative, the cinematography, the action and it impacts you deeply and leaves you in a contemplative mood, long after you finish watching the movie. As Sardar Udham says \"probably for you JB is a footnote, written somewhere in fine print\" it was the same for me too until Shoojit Sircar decided to bring it on the canvas in such an explicit way, that now am able to comprehend and acknowledge the tragedy that was Jallianwala bagh in all its brutality!Sardar Udham is one movie that you are not going to forget in a hurry! Go for it!",

The cinematography is brilliant and the jumping timelines isn't confusing and that's a great way of storytelling. Especially those last 30 minutes of the movie is still haunting me and giving me chills even while I'm writing this. That last sequence was very long but it was necessary. Vicky Kaushal's acting is top notch. All my favourite actors now look insignificantly small after watching Vicky's performance in this movie because he lived the character. I know what Jallianwalabagh massacre is and I learnt about that in school. But I never knew that it was this brutal and the impact was this much until I watched this. I think nobody could have told the story better than Shoojit Sircar. Hats off to him. Thank you for this masterpiece.",

What an incredible piece of Cinema I have just been a witness of! I'm truly captivated by Sircar's direction and the way he addressed such a heroic act of patriotism. And I can't convey enough appreciation for representing such a fairly unknown story of the Martyr, Udham Singh; who against all the odds made the impossible. He shook the British empire to its core and sent out a decisive statement against their heinous colonialism.From a technical stance alone, I must admit, this was something very special! I had never seen a historical drama on such an enormous scale before. From the detailed set designs to the astounding Cinematography, the commendable art direction to the world-building; it has every right to be considered as a landmark in Indian filmography. Trust me, supervising any sets with that many people and intricacies; it's easier said than done. And this gets even more fascinating when you consider the restricted expenditures!Likewise, the performances leave quite an impression. Amongst the entire cast, Vicky Kaushal's act indisputably draws our attention the most. Particularly, towards the end. Where, in my opinion; he gives his absolute best. Speaking of the rest of the ensemble, I was amazed to observe such a capable group of foreign nationals playing their roles with utmost affection and integrity!My only criticisms are in regards to the comparatively long-winded screenplay and its Non-linear structure. Don't get me wrong, I'm all up for Non-linear storytelling, but I'm not sure whether it was an absolute necessity in this case.Even though I gotta say, that whole Jallianwala Bagh massacre sequence is no less than a cinematic brilliance. No matter, how tough you deem yourself to be, remember the words; it's gonna break your heart. If it was up to me, I would have probably inaugurated the film with this portion rather than placing it near the climax. That way, I guess the impact would have been far greater.Lastly, I just wanna thank all the people who have contributed to such an ambitious endeavour and I wanna give my regards to Mr Shoojit Sircar as he's done plentiful to denote the atrocities of British Imperialism. Innumerable manslaughters, abscondings, tortures; the British without any question, shares a dark & sinful past with our country and its people.My heartiest admiration goes to all the martyrs and their families who sacrificed everything just to break the shackles and to get our much-awaited Sovereignty & Freedom. And most importantly they did all that while being unified, irrespective of class, religion or Identity.",

Personally, I think movies like Border and Gadar spoiled the movie makers and audience about how a historical movie should be made. It stays close to historical facts, particularly the ideological commitments of our revolutionaries. The vision of India sans jingoism, refreshing indeed.The technical aspect of the film was on a whole another level altogether. The production design, costume design, cinematography, background music (not a single Bollywood song), and set designs are astounding. Truly a landmark in Hindi Cinema and the gold standard to beat in Indian cinema!Last 30 mins...Goosebumps GUARANTEED.",

Some are decent, some are below average & most of them are unbearable with otherworldly odd vfx and whatsapp status special love songs no one asked for! In this suffocating condition of biographical movies, to break the sinister prototype skeleton, a cinematic revolution was much needed; Shoojit Sircar brought it with a masterstroke named Sardar Udham!Inspite of the promise shown by the film, I didn't expect that it can avoid the typical bollywood biography making formula completely and masterfully! I am not sure what to say and what not about this technically supreme work. From the colour and cinematography to the recreation of historically accurate scenes; from the extraordinary score to the blazing screenplay; everything was so technical that it demands a separate writing.There is no need of any forcibly induced emotional scenes or jingoistic dialogues when you have a strong story in hand and technical men at office. In this type of work, the rawness should be evident to justify the actions. Director did exactly the same. He kept the raw tone intact and treated it with a no nonsense approach.The movie did exceptionally well with some dicision making. Use of original languages and not hindi in abnormal accent was one of the main reason why the movie feels so original. The story telling technique was also authentic. Special mention to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre recreation; it was so detailed, raw and moving that we can feel ourselves there!Vicky Kaushal added another feather in his cap delivering a composed, mature yet breathtaking performance as Udham Singh. Supporting casts were brilliant and apt. The unbiased development of characters was also superb. Actually there were hardly anything to complain about in this masterfully crafted movie.Sircar's Sardar Udham is the only biographical work coming out from Bollywood in recent years, which is able to break the rusty prototype and create a benchmark which will surely bring a wave of making serious movies devoid off the business model approach!

In the climax, there's just people in interrogation rooms being asked the same questions in 10 different scenes, them saying a predictable NO. At the end we just see people being shot, and dead. The ending legit lasts for 20 minutes. He is then hanged. This is the most, by date, boring movie I've ever seen.

            "content": "This movie is truly a depiction of what it must have been during the so called 'empire' of the British. Many were running and crying while others standing to protect them. I didn't want to watch it first, but as I kept diving in, I felt like being burdened with more and more responsibility. Responsibility of realization, responsibility of celebration, responsibility of acceptance, of the sacrifice we made, of the sacrifice my own grandfather, my own great grandfather made. I must not forget what was brought upon them. My responsibility has suddenly increased from just living for others to make a better world to work for it not just live, to put the true effort I have been avoiding. This was the impact of the movie. It brought me the true feeling of being a part of the rebellion, a rebellion for justice, freedom, equality, even though I contributed nothing in it.Movie especially in the second half told me the feeling of carrying the weight of thousands on shoulder in probably the best way possible.The movie kept me engaged and showed me how brutal the force were at that time, the dark times. No fancy words! I was captivated the whole time. Before this, the only movie about Indian struggle I liked the most was Kranti (1975), despite belonging to the Generation Z (being born in 2001). Now I put this movie equal to that movie.I will like to end this review with a quote of Michael O'Dwyer from the movie itself which relates to a controversy related to this movie you can find on Internet [Hint: Oscar Awards Nominations]. He said,\"This is one thing I like in Indians, they are always eager to please!\"\nLet it not be true anymore. Live for the nation...Jai Hind!!",

But the MASSACRE that happened there in 1919 left an irreparable SCAR on the face of British Rule and gave a TANGO TWIST to the India's freedom fight across the country.The DYRE and DWYRE combo choose to create DIRE situation at Amritsar which resulted in a relentless firing on a HARMLESS protestors, in which thousands of ARMLESS people DIED and many injuered. By doing this they both decided to TEACH a LESSON to the revolutionary and LESSEN the impact of freedom fight. However, there was one man who survived during this brutal massacre, decided to TEACH BACK the LESSON in the same language during a felicitation SESSION by shooting DWYRE. This is the story of SARDAR UDHAM SINGH and it took him 21 years to take the REVENGE. However, as a typical Indian, UDHAM had checked whether he holds any regret for being responsible for the massacre and takes this step only after knowing that Dwyre is unapologetic about that incident.The movie at times looks like a documentary. But it is powerful enough to give the feeling of \"not so nice\" experiences of the past. Probably instead of OTT, if this movie would have been released in Theatres, it would have been more impactful on the audience. Nevertheless, the last one hour makes you angry and the replica of the incident shown will boil your BLOOD as you see BLOOD Bath and DEAD BODIES Path.Vicky Kaushal is at his Best. He smiles (apart from the Romantic scenes) only once when he says, \"when I go to heaven, I want to ask my teacher WHETHER I gave my YOUTH any meaning or let it to WITHER\". He has not just acted but lived through the character of UDHAM. Amol Parashar as Bhagath Singh too impresses during his short appearence. Shoojit Sircar has once again proves his brilliance in showcasing the subject by giving his midas touch. The early 19th century has been replicated with all the props and costumes to make it look authentic. Shantanu Moitra uses silence at many places to bring the emotions which could have been spoiled otherwise with some background music. One of the UNSUNG Hero's UNTOLD story is presented to understand what all sacrifices it took to get us the Independence when someone recently heard saying British were respectful to Indians during their rule.Last Line:The Detective talks lightly on Bhagath Singh. UDHAM asks him, what was he doing when he was 23 years old. The British officer tells he was married, was expecting a kid and was the youngest detective at that time. UDHAM replies \"So, don't talk about 23 year old Bhagath Singh. You won't understand his CONTRIBUTION to the COUNTRY\" Hmmmm...The current lot of 23 years old are just Kids.",

            "content": "One of the best thing i noticed in Sardar Udham is it shows that fatal state of mind British government during world war 2. You see, World War 2 is one of the major reason behind India's independence but our historians and filmmakers have always overlooked this fact. You gotta know that British saw it coming back what they did to India. In this movie there is a quote to explain this- \"Germany calling. The sun finally seems to setting at British Empire. Like an elephant, Indians never forget their enemies\" and the next two scenes when Udham Singh questions the Law twice, once in Courtroom before Judge and once during investigation in front of detective. Do you remember any Bollywood Film going in such details about ideology and morals? Leave that topic for further arguments later.So, overall Sardar Udham is quite a break from commercial potboilers and there are many reasons to make it a Must See in your watchlist as a true quality cinema lover. However, couple of flaws needs to be bashed equally as i praised good things. The film starts very slow, it looks scattered and irrelevant sometimes but maybe that's because the story of Udham never has enough documents and events available in public domain. I won't say much about acting and other aspects as said in the beginning but for Vicky Kaushal I say one thing that he has completely surrendered himself to director's uncompromised vision. I won't be surprised to see him taking a bunch of trophies home after the award ceremonies next year. Shoojit Sir, you have attempted something revolutionary and respect you for that. Nevertheless, i still say it could have been little better or a certain Classic. It misses that Mark by few inches though. Rest, highly recommended. A deserving tribute to underdog Udham Singh and his Friend, Brother and Idol 'Shaheed Bhagat Singh'.",

The climax of this story was the not the assassination but it was what happened on that day. Amazing Acting by Vicky Kaushal, made the person feel connected to the story. Great direction as well. Some people are saying that film moving back fourth with time was bad, but I like it because that made the massacre of Jallianwala Bagh the highlight of the story. And don't think it is boring because there was not much action it, be patient because that man also waited 21 years. I think it is the closest thing we will get to see what happened on that awful. It will also helps people experience and understand what happen at Jallianwala Bagh and how it happened. The film and had great teaching and quotes from revolutionaries. I would encourage youngsters to watch this movie to not only know what Udham Singh did but also to and learn from the wonderful ideology of Bhagat Singh and Udham Singh.",

The way the story goes from start to the end, is simply amazing.3)This movie is brutal, the scene where people were killed under the orders of commander dyer, and the part where Udham Singh carries the people (victims of the massacre) to the hospital is truly traumatising and to be honest as a weird dude who doesn't respond to gore stuff, i didn't felt to be affected by that scene but it was really well made. And it showed the how brutal the british was before independence in a fantastic manner.This movie will be talked about years from now, and it will remain as one of the best movies india has ever made. I did try to find faults in this movie but, i do not know if it is my incapability as a critic or the movie truly has no faults.In short it is indeed an fantastic movie 10/10.",

But at this point the movie starts to raise doubts, is this killing, is just a revenge, or an act of terror or a revolution? Right at this point some background of Udham Singh, working with Bhagat Singh is shown where Bhagat Singh defines what's a revolution. Udham Singh is arrested on the spot and a formal investigation starts in the movie, which shows more background on the events that lead from Jallianwala Bagh Massacre till this day.The movie shows how Udham Singh, having multiple chances to kill Michael O Dwyer, won't kill him just like that. He tries to understand O Dwyer's views, on how he felt about the Jallianwala Bagh, was it justified, with having a concealed gun in his hand and Dwyer casually drinking. The movie drop hints on PTSD faced by Udham Singh adds another dimension to the tragedy of the survivors.The best part of the movie is the sequence in which events are shown. It does shows the actual brutality but at the very end of the movie so as to not overwhelm the viewers with anger and anguish right from the beginning and give viewers a chance to see the real Udham Singh.The movie makes perfect sense in today's world, where mob-lynchings are getting comfortably justified rather than considering it as an act of terror. There is an urgent need of publicising adopting the right ideology of Bhagat Singh, and letting the people decide if there is unnecessary fear being instigated in the society by some people who then take advantage of this fear Or if the society is actually inspired.Thanks.",

It means they did not tell us the story in the actual sequence of the events rather they started by showing us the aftermath of the Jaliyan wala bagh massacre and through flashbacks showed the incidents which took place before the massacre. They showed the Massacre scene in the last. The story has developed very well throughout the whole movie but the speed of the movie is very slow. The visuals of this movie is of very high quality, comparable to the Hollywood movies. Oppressed India and old London has been portrayed very well in this movie. The visuals in the last massacre scene is on another level. The bgm used in this movie gave each scene more depth ,intensity and thrill and worked so well all together. But the problem with this movie , as per my point view, is the lack of intense acting and dramatic scenes. It lacks imaginative scenes and dialogues. It portrayed the incidents as it is and added no masala to it. If it was a documentary, then it's ok. But as it is a big-screen movie, little spicy drama is expected. There are not lot of impressive acting scene excluding the court room scene and massacre scene in the end. All over this movie deserve a high rating because of its compelling storytelling, impressive visuals , great direction and top-notch background score. But this movie is not for all kinds of audience because most of the lines are in British English and patience is needed to go through the storyline of the movie and slowly understanding every scene. Inspite of being patriotic, this movie does not contain any high level fighting scene and will not create any josh in you. It is emotional movie in the end to make us feel what our ancestors went through to give us freedom so that we don't use it in vain.",

How many scenes do we need, every 3 minutes we are in a different scenario! I originally thought this was to portray the hectic life of sardar, but I think it was more the director didn't know how to efficiently show sardars life in a few important scenes.

The quality of filmmaking made me forget the fact it was an Indian movie and not a Hollywood or a BBC featurette. They showed all the relevant angles and even showed the British government's brutality towards the Irish. Actual English actors were casted instead of cheap replacements and the lead roles were quite engaging and genuine to the script. This is the kind of movie Bhagat Singh deserved instead of that Ajay Devgan starrer troll. This movie deserved better publicity. Highly underated hidden gem.",

How he could he hold his anger for 21 long years and then take his revenge is telling of Indian Civilization itself. It lies low for thousand years, but refuses to forget, refuses to give up. Elephantine memory, to quote from the movie. It is slightly difficult for other cultures to appreciate this movie (probably that is the reason for not being selected for Oscar). The Jalianawallah Bagh may appear too long. But, it should be seen, frame by frame, without skipping and all the pain should be absorbed to understand. 1919 incident was watershed moment in Indian history. Best picturaization was from Richard Attenborough's Gandhi. Indian versions lacked imagination, resources or both.If we need understand Udham Singh's pursuit of 21 long year pursuit, and his decision to make it sign of protest against imperialism rather than of personal revenge, we need to patiently go through Jalianawallah Bagh scene. Yes, it does not provide any extra information, but conditions the heart.Though it does not contain against British culture per se (rather you do develop admiration for their structured governance), the pain, the anguish the sheer humiliation can be felt only by an Indian heart. Hence it is strongly recommended for every Indian.",

            "content": "Seldom comes a cinema so deeply engrossing, the latest directional venture by Shoojit Sircar is the finest tribute to the life of Sardar Udham Singh. This multilayered and heart wrenching film is easily one of the best movie of this decade. The movie works in multiple parallel story lines, and it has been skilfully intertwined with the final act. It starts at a slow pace, putting the characters at its locations and giving the audience a chance to feel the same emotion and frustration young Udham was feeling. Shoojit Sircar lets the audience connect to this journey, without spoon feeding the gravitas of the circumstances. The circumstances are itself powerful and patiently directed. Thanks to the mesmerising cinematography. The color palettes and set design transports the audience into the WW1 era. It speaks volumes about the hard-work and dedication the technical team has gone through to recreate that bygone era. The background score by Shantanu Moitra was cherry on the cake. The music was used so subtly that it never overpowered the essence of the act, but in a way dissolved in the anger and pain of Sardar Udham. The theme music named \" Time to meet my friend\" which was played in a couple of scenes was extremely heartbreaking. And finally the acting. Vicky Kaushal is magnetic in this movie. His eyes did most of the acting. What a great actor he is! Outstanding! He truly engulfed the soul of Udham Singh, with his extremely resilient yet powerful performance. His desperation, his laughs, his anger was naturally moulded in this movie. It is without any doubt his best performance, even surpassing his acting in Masaan. The British actors are meticulously selected and each one of their performance needs a mention. Shaun Scott as Michael O'Dwyer is brilliant. His dialogue delivery was top notch, making this version of Dwyer believable. Stephen Hogan did a commendable job. The acting was on flow and natural as if real investigation was being carried out. Kirsty Averton's role is minimal. I wished to see her more in other movies.As the film moves to the last 40 min, the movie sets on a roller coaster. The scenes were deeply emotional and tragic. Perhaps such kind of portrayal of Jallianwala Bagh massacre was never filmed in Indian cinema. Shoojit Sircar didn't cuts the scenes. He lets us to fully take on to the upheaval. As the movie close to end, I was devastated. I was numb to the core realising the actual pain and trauma those people had witnessed on that fateful day. Watch Sardar Udham, not just for its history, but for its near perfect execution on screen and to witness the greatness of Ram Mohammad Singh Azad.This movie will surely take away multiple awards in its bag. This is the film of this year and will find itself in the list of best International movies of 2021. Go, experience this art yourself.",
