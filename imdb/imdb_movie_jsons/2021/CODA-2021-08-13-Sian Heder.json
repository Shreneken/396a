            "content": "For most of CODA's running time, I was enjoying it very much while at the same time thinking that it had a very safe, made for television movie vibe that was keeping it from greatness. But then there was that audition scene. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. And from that moment forward, I was a mess. I'm obsessed with Emilia Jones's version of \"Both Sides Now\" on Spotify, and I'm already dreading the day I have to send my son off to college (he's 12, by the way).This movie is warm and earnest in the best possible way. Jones gives a marvelous performance -- it's too bad she couldn't have received more recognition for this. And Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur give equally wonderful performances as Jones's parents. A scene where Matlin tells Jones that she was disappointed when she wasn't born deaf, and another where Kotsur has his daughter sing to him while he feels her throat are two of the most devastating you'll see in movies this year.Grade: A+",

The film has a tremendous amount of heart. This was a tear jerker by the end. All of the characters are so lovable and reliable. Watching Frank Rossi describe how to put a condom on in sign language to Miles was just ...agghhh amazing.Director Sian Heder knocked it out of the park with extremely laser precision on-point direction. Specially how he had the actors who played Ruby's parents react to the singing at the high school. Everything was so on point and believable. Emilia Jones was outstanding. Such a beautiful and talented redhead. Can you imagine how hard is to find an excellent actress that is also an amazing singer? Seriously, I am super impressed with the whole cast. If this is television, then Heder raised the bar very high. Not only was the direction fantastic, but so was the screenplay. It was witty, funny and intelligent. This should have been a theatrical film. Honestly, I'll keep it short because if I could, I could name about a dozen scenes in this film that I loved. It was one after another, freaking fantastic scenes.The only con I can think of was the title. Why an acronym for such a beautiful film?SOLID 10/10 and screw the haters.

She finds herself torn between pursuing her love of music and her family's reliance on her to be their connection to the outside world. I would like to say how much of a crowd pleaser this is. All of the reviews have come back positive saying this is the best opener since Whiplash. The performances are good all around. What got to me most is the family dynamic. It's something really heart-warming to watch that put a smile on my face the whole time. The comedy landed well throughout. The same goes for the drama. Sian Heder is a good director and we see the heart put into the movie. The story is where some of my issues came from. It follows a typical storyline that we've seen before in movies geared toward teens. It became predictable along the way and some of the scenes felt too good to be true. But I understand this isn't meant to be something to breakdown and analyze. All in all, this is meant to make us feel good and that's exactly what it did. I look forward to rewatching this again in the future.",

            "review_title": "dream a little dream",
            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Ruby Rossi is a high school student. She is also a CODA - Child of Deaf Adults. Her older brother is deaf too, meaning Ruby's life has been spent as an interpreter for her family, while also working on the family fishing boat in Gloucester, Massachusetts, where they are treated as outcasts and viewed as oddities by others. Ruby also loves to sing and listen to music, activities she can't share with her family. This is no coming-of-age tale, as Ruby has long been wise beyond her years. It is, however, a story of a young person finding their true self and breaking from the ties that bind to the only life she's known.Emilia Jones (HIGH-RISE, 2015) stars as Ruby, and we first see her slinging fish on the boat with her father Frank (Troy Kutsor) and brother Leo (newcomer Daniel Durant). Ruby belts out songs while the two men handle their duties, unaware of the lovely melodies filling the air. At home, the dinner table conversation is handled through ASL (American Sign Language) with mom/wife Jackie (Oscar winner Marlee Matlin, CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD, 1986) leading the way.At school, Ruby is an outcast due to her clothes, the lingering aroma of fish, and her \"weird\" family. With a silent crush on Miles (Ferdio Walsh-Peelo from the excellent SING STREET, 2016), Ruby signs up for choir, but freezes during the audition. The choir director, Bernardo (roll the r's) Villalobos, is played energetically and colorfully by Eugenio Derbez (OVERBOARD, 2018), and he offers encouragement to Ruby - mostly because she has a beautiful singing voice. Bernardo explains how her singing voice offers a path to college, something she's never before considered due to family responsibilities.There is a lot going on in this film from writer-director Sian Heder (TALLULAH, 2016). It's obviously adapted from the 2014 French film LA FAMILLE BELIER, and plays as a mainstream crowd-pleaser, when it just as easily could have been a deep cut indie film. Ms. Heder's approach means a larger viewing audience, though there are elements we wish had been further explored. The teen romance never really clicks, and there are hints that Bernardo's story holds more levels than we get. However, the Rossi family dynamics are quite something to behold. Father Frank wears his emotions on his sleeve. Sometimes those emotions are angry and bitter, while other times quite comical or even horny (for his wife). Brother Leo wants desperately to lead the family business towards prosperity. He has ideas for growth, but is frustrated being dependent on Ruby as a conduit to the community.Mother Jackie and Ruby have a typical mother-teenage daughter relationship. The mother wants status quo where the daughter remains an integral part of the family, while the daughter wants her mom to acknowledge the dreams for a different life - one that capitalizes on her talents. When Jackie questions her daughter on her singing, she does so in the most hurtful way possible (brilliant writing). And yet, when mom recounts Ruby's birth, the love is as clear as the disconnect ... and likely to draw a tear or two. Filmmaker Hader serves up numerous strong scenes, but two really stood out for this viewer. First, when Ruby is singing on stage, we \"hear\" what the parents hear, and their pride is obvious. The second occurs when dad asks Ruby to sing for him as they are perched on the backend of the car. It's phenomenal acting by Kutsor, and further clarifies a lifelong father-daughter bond ... and the first time he fully comprehends her talent. All four leads give strong performances, and it's a star-making performance from Ms. Jones (think a young Saoirse Ronan).Apple paid a record-breaking $25 million for the film's rights at Sundance, and the mainstream appeal of this family drama sprinkled with comedy and life messages is indisputable. So while my preference would have been more focus on the 'outsider' aspect of the Rossi family in the community, it's easy to see why this choice was made. It's an entertaining film that will likely land on many year-end \"Best\" lists. Maybe even mine.Streaming on AppleTV+ on August 13, 2021.",

            "content": "Every single fairly positive human emotion that could be called up in life, showed up in this film. It presented hope, frustration, ignorance, healthy responses to envy, love, support, family bonding and so much more. It truly was a delight to watch and feel a part of the growth of the main character. Her journey is truly one of courage as she finds her way through life.The fact that all three of the primary deaf roles are played by actual deaf actors is wonderful and a tribute to both the filmmaker and the deaf acting community. Each of them was brilliant, and though I knew Marlee Matlin from Children of a Lesser God and more since that time, I was not familiar with Kotsure and Durant, who were also wonderful. Coupled with the incredible performance of Emilia Jones who was a joy to watch, they delivered a realistic view of the daily lives of deaf people as they go about the business of living in a world designed for hearing people. I am grateful to them for their abilities to allow us to see clearly.Though the story is simple, the delivery keeps you engaged and able to take in new information. It was a wonderful film.",

So no real surprises in Coda, you will exactly know the outcome way long before the ending. That said it's still an enjoyable movie to watch. A little bit emotional sometimes, which is almost normal as you feel compassion for the deaf people and certainly for the daughter that has a lot on her plate. Maybe a bit too much singing in my opinion but that's just because I'm not a big fan of singing in movies unless it's the music that I like but that's not likely to happen given my taste of music. Coda is predictable but it doesn't really matter as the acting is really good and that from the whole cast. Certainly worth a watch.",

            "review_title": "Sundance 2021: CODA might very well end up as my favorite film of the festival and one of the best movies of the year!",
            "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I know Sundance is one of those festivals that carry dozens of impressive, impactful films from writer-directors that really throw themselves into the art of filmmaking and storytelling. I anticipated being blown away by many movies that I knew nothing about or didn't recognize the crew and cast involved. I expected some films to emotionally impact me so much that I'd save them close to my heart until the very end of the year. With this said, I was unbelievably far from imagining that the very first viewing would be a heavy contender for my absolute favorite movie of the entire festival.CODA (Child Of Deaf Adults) is the first film I watch by Si\u00e2n Heder, and after this session, I can't wait to see what she did so far and what she's going to do in the future. The clearly interesting premise is developed through a much more emotional narrative than I expected. From rich visual storytelling to exceptional use of sign language, Heder is able to capture something unique and deeply important to transmit to the audience and to today's society. The world was fortunate enough to get Sound of Metal last year, and CODA reinforces the essential message that being deaf must not be seen as a massive disability or a brutal handicap.As the movie cleverly communicates through its impeccable screenplay, having some sort of \"limitation\" doesn't automatically characterize someone as weird, different, or that the respective family members don't love each other as much or more than the so-called \"normal\" families. Except for a somewhat insignificant love relationship featuring the main character (that could have brought up an entirely different, unnecessary, and even distracting topic to the film's central, vital themes), I was incredibly invested in every single storyline.In fact, I find every interaction within the deaf family much more compelling and captivating than any other dialogue in the movie, and this is mostly due to the amazing performances from the cast. Leaving the protagonist to the end, Daniel Durant (Leo Rossi, brother) and Marlee Matlin (Jackie Rossi, mother) are great as supporting characters, but Troy Kotsur (Frank Rossi, father) and Eugenio Derbez (Bernardo Villalobos, music teacher) literally left me in tears with their heartfelt displays. I could feel the outstanding commitment to their roles, and I'm delighted that Bernardo Villalobos isn't just another stereotypical, cliche, hysterical choir adult.However, the biggest praise in my bag must go to powerful glue that holds everything together, elevating the whole film to a whole other level: Emilia Jones as the only hearing member of the family, Ruby Rossi. First of all, I love music, and Pentatonix is actually my favorite group (acapella or not), so hearing so many wonderful voices singing together would always be a massive plus for CODA in my review. Nevertheless, not only Jones' voice is sumptuously heartwarming, but her performance has everything an actor needs to receive acting nominations. I can't remember the last time I was fully invested in a single character in such an emotionally powerful manner, and Jones is definitely a major reason.A final praise to Paula Huidobro's visually grabbing camera work and Marius de Vries, who composed the movie's subtle yet efficient score and who I'm guessing had a hand in the song choices. Either way, terrific job.CODA may very well end up as my favorite film of the 2021's edition of the Sundance Film Festival, and it will undoubtedly become a must-watch movie when it's available worldwide. Si\u00e2n Heder offers her impeccable direction and beautifully written screenplay, which is packed with emotionally powerful moments that left me tearing up for the last forty-five minutes. Boasting an educative, meaningful message regarding the deaf community and what our society perceives as a tremendous handicap/disability, the characteristic visual storytelling and the captivating interactions within the deaf family prove to be incredibly investing, deeply elevating the overall piece. With the help of heartfelt, genuine performances from the supporting cast (mainly Troy Kotsur and Eugenio Derbez), Emilia Jones takes off and lands one of my favorite female performances in a long, long time. A tear-inducing, thoughtful film that I hope will conquer audiences all around the world.Rating: A",

            "review_title": "A worthy Oscar nominee. Powerful.",
            "content": "Because CODA is an acronym for children of deaf adults, you'd expect the Oscar-nominated film of the same name to be about deafness. I'm here to tell you it is not, for it is above all about family challenges, teenage trials, and the power of education. While the central family of this romance is deaf, played mostly by deaf actors, with one exception, using ASL communication, the film's title is a metaphor for a story whose many layers reveal truths about life that transcend deafness.Rubi (Emilia Jones) is the only hearing member of her loving four-member family in Gloucester, Mass., and figuratively she hears the conflicting sources of discord as she navigates between her emerging singing talent and her necessity to be the translator for her family's fishing business. For any teen who moves slowly to distance herself from family so she can go it on her won, CODA will resonate, hearing or not.This coming-of-age drama plays out against a community yet unschooled in dealing with otherness, viz., fellow humans with special needs and talents, but outside of the community's normal experience. Not everyone can be as understanding or resilient as dad Frank (Troy Kotsur, with an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor), who initially goes nose to nose with ignorance, but who gradually adjusts to the town and his lovingly rebellious daughterEducation is often a game changer, and in CODA it is no different. Rubi's choir director, Mr. V (Eugenio Derbez), sees her voice gift and gives his time to coach her for a Berklee School of Music audition. His dedication to her, with his tough-love methods (J K Simmons in Whiplash but sweeter), is a convincing statement about the right way to teach and the power of education done right.CODA is much more than about deafness: It reveals the many hurdles teens and parents face getting to their higher levels. While it lacks the luster of Little Miss Sunshine and has a midlin' sap index, it succeeds in figuratively adjusting those of us who have a deaf ear to the demands of achieving happiness through, you guessed it, LOVE.CODA deserves its Oscar nominations (it garnered the most awards in Sundance history, after all!). If you take a free week's subscription from Apple TV to see it, you'll thank me and certainly sing Both Side Now (Rubi's audition song) for days if not forever.",

Ruby (Emilia Jones) is a young girl with a lot of hopes and responsibilities. She's a passion for music, issues with cliquey classmates, a job working for the struggling family fishing firm, oh and she's the only one in her family who can hear. CODA (Child of Deaf Adults) right from the get go is a rich tapestry of plot threads. It sounds like it could be heavy right and sure it does have some serious weight, but it's also really funny. Frank (Troy Kotsur) and Jackie (Marlee Matlin), Ruby's parents are a riot for a start. Ruby is frustrated by them, they mark her out as different with her peers. They are though, of course, her source or strength. Ruby has a power within her that she doesn't realise and a voice and feeling for music that's just itching to break out. Between the music and Ruby's ability to speak up for her family, it's brilliantly positive, life affirming and occasionally fist in the air sort of stuff. The supporting cast too are wonderful, particularly Eugenio Derbez as the flamboyant choir master, who thrusts Ruby reluctantly together with her crush and pushes her to chase her dreams. Great as they all are though, it's Jones who carry this. She's marvellous, her performance will have your crying tears of joy, as she deftly portrays teenage awkwardness with a depth and strength that's infectious to everyone lucky enough to share the screen with her. This isn't just Ruby's story though, her development is everyone's, but as things get better, they can always get worse, with Ruby torn between the things she loves and her families dependence on her. When Ruby's mum tells her she's brave though... well that just nails it. She knows her daughter. Knows that everything that comes her way, good, bad, wonderful or difficult, Ruby has it. She's a fantastic character to watch and that's what her parents are left with as Ruby begins to realise her dreams. They can't hear her sing, they can only watch. I try not to spoil film when writing about them, but just as Sound of Metal leans on it's audio choices to hammer home the perspectives of those on screen, so too does CODA, with no less devastating effect. Not devastating bad, just the sort of cinematic wallop that floors you, leaving you with a heart bursting sense of beauty in humanity. I can't recall the last time I cried as much watching a film.

Additionally, Troy Kotsur and Marlee Matlin's performance of the sanguine but sentimental couple is exquisite and evocative. Besides that, I see no creativity anyhow in the main storyline. Typical high school girl who strives for a better life; male character who does nothing but dalliance; classic stern mentor with a soft heart. Protagonist explores her talent, she practices, she gets hindered, she overcomes, she experiences happy, she experiences sadness, she grows, end of story. I thought La La Land set standard for future movies about music and development, encouraging unique messages instead of cliche. Compared to all other nominated films, Coda feels just right, but from whence does the academy see it better than its fellow contenders?",

            "content": "While the film leans a little too heavily into the (inaccurate) trope of Deaf people not understanding music how its story is executed with grace and humor results in a moving wonderful film. This is a universal story of a young woman learning to develop her own passions and chart her own course. It is also the story of family meeting the challenges of the world head on and how that can impact interpersonal relationships. It is *not* a film about how Deaf people are just so helpless or disadvantaged by society. This is a flesh and blood family-they fight, they deal with sexuality, they deal with friendships.The cast is the best feature; I would be hard pressed who gave the best performance. Every character is brought to life in naturalistic unstated performances. But I think Kotsur is given the two hardest scenes-dramatizing how a dad comes to indirectly see his daughter's talents-and he rises to the challenge. Kotsur does give my favorite performance of the year.The other great feature of the film is simple elegant shooting style it has. This film isn't flashy at all but it is so well calibrated that the humor blends seamlessly with the pathos. This could have been coy or excessively sentiment; instead Heder hits each beat and moment just right to bring the Rossi family to life.",

            "review_title": "\"Been there. Done that\" has never felt so good",
            "content": "\"CODA\" stands for \"child of deaf adults\". Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), at 17 when we first meet her (and still so at the end of the movie) is born into such a family, with parents and an older brother all deaf. As the only \"hearing\" member of the family, she has been their bridge of communication with the rest of the world. But, is that role really Ruby's destiny? Families made up entirely of deaf members still survive. That is the question asked throughout the movie. Helping to run the family's fishing boat, Ruby has a talent for singing and is well poised to pursue an education and a career in music.CODA does not really have anything that you have not seen before. It opens in a light tone, and continues that way. Some examples. When poor Ruby, exhausted, naps in the middle of a class on constitutional history, the teacher approaches her desk and mutters \"unfortunately, there is no amendment protecting the right to nap\". Explaining why he has the car radio turned in full blast, her deaf brother Leo (Daniel Durant) quips \"my whole ass is vibrating\". Finally, treating the parent for some minor ailment, the doctor explains that they should abstain from sex for 2 weeks. In her sign language interpretation (for which the audience has subtitle), when the anxious parents ask how long, Ruby sings \"forever\". After a moment of satisfaction in seeing the horror on their faces, Ruby corrects \"two weeks\".The story is, as mentioned, all but predictable. The slightly eccentric but entirely endearing music teacher Mr V (Eugenio Derbez), seeing Ruby's talents, secures an audition for her to win a place to a prestigious music school in Boston. Her value to her family is now the main obstacle. A sub-plot, quite predictably, is on how the hearing-impaired deal with their handicaps in a world where not everybody is sympathetic. There is also a sweet teenage romance.\"Been there; done that\" is what my headline intimates. However, the beauty of CODA is the way the story is told, and acted. More examples.In the scene where Mr. V tries to convince Ruby to seriously pursue singing, he asks \"how do you feel when you sing\". She replies in sign language! And he (and you) understands. A nice touch. Rehearsing a duet for the school concert, Ruby, facing her tender, charming classmate Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo), finds that she cannot focus. They find a perfect solution: back-to-back, feeling each other vibration but avoiding distracting eye contact, they harmonize beautifully. At the concert, the entire family applaud and cheer for her, taking the cue from the rest of the audience. Watching this, you cannot help but feel a little sad. Then, the poignancy finally hit home when right in the middle of the beautiful singing, the sound is muted. Abruptly, you are thrown into the world of absolute silence of Frank (Troy Kotsur), Jackie (Marlee Matlin) and Daniel Rossi.The most touching scene comes after the concert, with father and daughter together, alone, under the starlight. After \"hearing\" his daughter's performance, Frank's mind is made up, that pursuing Ruby's destiny in music should be the priority, for the entire family. But he wants to hear her sing, just to him. As she starts to sing for him the love duet, which can also be interpreted as a song of simple devotion, he puts his fingers to her throat, feeling the vibration. Watching Kotsur and Jones in this scene melts the most cynical of hearts. This scene, which is pure tenderness, is surpassed by only one more. The audition scene is both deeply touching and joyfully elating. I am not going to spoil it. While the father-and-daughter scene was only close to bringing tears to my eyes, the audition scene finally did it.Against all odds, director Sian Heder succeeded in casting Ruby's family with hearing-handicapped (total deaf to sever hearing impaired) actors. Their performance says everything.",

It is a simple, heartfelt & crowd-pleasing delight that's further bolstered by its welcome inclusivity & emotional purity.Written & directed by Sian Heder, the premise is nothing new and the route it takes is also a familiar one but the emotional beats do strike the right chord with the heart and makes it an endearing, arresting & heartwarming roller-coaster. Its portrait of deaf community in typical, day-to-day settings is carried out with care & understanding and the family dynamic is both relatable & thoroughly captivating.The small-town setting, radiant camerawork, intelligent wit, breezy pace & silent interplays add more exuberance to the experience but it's the performances from its entire cast & the spot-on chemistry they share with one another that strengthens the picture from inside out. Emilia Jones is impressive as our protagonist struggling to juggle her family's interests with her own and she is brilliantly supported by the rest.Overall, CODA (Child of Deaf Adults) takes an existing coming-of-age template, doesn't try to subvert any of the genre tropes, and even features an ending that's predictable from afar. Yet it is brought to cinematic life with so much heart, warmth & affection that the film's honesty & humanity not only stands out but shines through. Add to that, it serves as a powerful reminder of why representation matters and the difference it can make when done correctly.",

Her dad and brother, who are deaf, work as fishermen and Ruby serves as their interpreter. She also longs to study music at the prestigious Breklee College of Music. Her school teacher, Mr. Bernardo (Eugenio Derbez), pushes young Ruby the excel herself at being a singer.The movie is not bad by any means. It is entertaining if rather \"flat\" throughout its entire length. There are no overtly dramatic parts, no serious conflict between any of the characters, no tragedy, no overtly goofy parts and no twist ending. Aside from a few kinky scenes, this is really Disney-like fare that could be enjoyed by the entire family.With this said, I just fail to see this movie as Oscar material. Best Movie??? Best supporting actor? If you cast a deaf person playing a deaf person, would you consider that \"acting\" or that person playing basically himself? There's no outstanding musical score, no jaw dropping cinematography, no definitive performances by any of the actors, no nothing. It's just a plain \"good\" movie, period, but nothing that would warrant any Oscars. Sure, the academy does this from time to time, but this looks like an ABC Monday night movie, with all due respect. As for Eugenio Derbez, who I think is a great guy and one of Mexico's top comedians, there's not a single American movie where he doesn't justify his heavy Mexican accent by saying he's from (drum roll): MEXICO! You don't see Salma Hayek saying she's from Mexico in her movies, why should Mr. Derbez do so?Anyway. \"CODA\" is an ok family fun film that doesn't break ANY new ground and is an unlikely memorable one. 5 out of 10.",

From this, Sound of Metal, and the Quiet Place franchise (and hell, even the use of ASL in Godzilla v. Kong), actual deaf actors and the deaf community are getting the representation in cinema they deserve.Further, the predominantly deaf audience I had the privilege of seeing this film with was elated to find that captions would be provided ON SCREEN, and not with captiview equipment. Hopefully, this film helps usher this accessibility in as a standard, and not an exception.Now, focusing on CODA specifically, it's a brilliantly written and acted story was clearly a labor of love for all involved. You can tell how much the director cared about doing the story justice and accurately capturing the struggles and hardships the deaf community face, as well as the community and love they all share.During this film, you really feel as though you are a part of this family, and their struggles become your struggles.

Ruby is a HS senior and on a whim, she decides to sign up for the choir class simply because she loves singing. At the very first choir orientation session, the choir master asks everyone in the class to come forward and sing \"Happy Birthday To You\" so that he can classify the voice (alt/soprano, etc.) When it's Ruby's turn, she panics and runs out of the class room... At this point we are 10 min. Into the film,. But to tell you more of the plot should spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the US remake of a 2014 film from France called \"La Famille Belier\", which was a hit both critically and at the box office. I've not seen it, and so I judge \"CODA\" as a standalone. Strictly going by what I saw on the movie screen, I have nothing but great things to say about it. \"CODA\" is directed by Sian Heder, best known for having written seasons 1-3 of \"Orange Is the New Black\". Here she brings some sharp observations on what it's like being deaf in today's world, and obviously it ain't easy. The film also explores the economic struggles for a community like Gloucester, and in particular its (mostly mom-and-pop) fishing industry. Last but not least the film smartly balances on the one hand the strong family ties in the Rossi family, and on the other hand Ruby's desire to branch out into the world. Of course none of this would matter if the acting lacks, but instead the acting is tops, period. Marlee Latin and 2 other deaf actors play Ruby's parents and brother. And then there is the role of Rubi, played by up-and-coming British actress Emilia Jones. She is nothing short of brilliant, and surely we haven't seen the last of her, on the contrary.\"CODA\" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival to immediate acclaim, and Apple+ immediately snapped it up for a Sundance record #25 million. The movie was released on Apple+ and also in select theaters a few weeks ago, and I finally had a chance to see it at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati. The Tuesday early evening where I saw this at was not attended well (exactly 5 people, including myself). Regardless, if you are in the mood for a wonderful and moving family comedy-drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",

It's the kind of movie that's almost impossible to dislike, purely because it's so wholesome and universally accessible. Its representation of its deaf characters is also really strong; their deafness doesn't define them. The acting is great across the board, and the piece is well-paced throughout. The problem is that it's incredibly formulaic. It looks like it was shot for television, it hits every beat you expect it to and it takes absolutely no risks. It's a safe movie, through and through. That doesn't mean it's bad, just that it's very forgettable. It's feel-good fluff; sometimes, that's exactly what you need. It isn't deep, but it knows what it's doing and it does it effectively. It's difficult to criticise, in a way. At the same time, though, it's a bit frustrating. There are hints of a more compelling piece sprinkled throughout, most of which relate to the brilliant family dynamic at the core of the story. If the feature had focused more on the interpersonal relationships between its core characters, as well as their relationship with the wider community, it probably would have been more distinct and, even, affecting. Still, it's a good effort on the whole. It's enjoyable and it manages to be sweet without being sappy.

It's PG 13 and listed as simply a \"comedy / drama\". No one ever said it was a family film. I can see teens 13 and up being able to watch it with no problem. (One brief scene of the parents in the bedroom, I'm sure teens know parents do that.)The actors playing the family seem very much like a real family, they convey real emotions and the rest of the players here , act and react as humans in the real world do.There's no over dramatization, there's no preaching / lecturing (I know how some people just hate that) although I personally don't care ... but what is here, is just a very good story told on an even level , without hitting you over the head with anything.Sure most know that it would work out in the end but so what? People call this cliche' , 'been there-done that' or even unoriginal. There's been very few films between, \"Children of A Lesser God\" in 1986 and this , that have dealt with the subject of living with deafness or having family members that are.I've seen movies like this too but I put that fact aside,\nin wanting to see what this would be and to be fair in my review.These kind of stories do need to be told every few years, because people tend to think \"Well those issues aren't a big deal anymore.\" No, they are ALWAYS a big deal, especially those who live it everyday.As for originality, well ladies and gentlemen Hollywood and movie making in general is over 120 years old. How many original ideas are there left to take from life? All that can be done, is be as original as possible and as fresh a take on it as they can.It is not remake, just a U. S. version of the French original and if anything, the makers of the original version, were likely approached about it first. Everyone acts like Hollywood robbed France and other countries at gunpoint and stole their movies.Anyhow, the movie truly remined me of the kind of human experience films Hollywood was doing circa late 1970s to 1983. If I hadn't seen cell phones and a laptop & modern cars, wardrobe ...it could easily have been set back then.That reminder is a good thing. It reminds us that there are good stories out there to tell about people and in life, many of the same stories will come around again....as there are always new generations to tell them too. Whether they learn something from it, or are touched emotionally is up to them.As indicated ... ten stars for quality in every facet that went into the making of this movie. I didn't cry but did come away pleased that simple but important human life stories , still matter in cinema. (END)",

Her teacher realises her great singing gift and supports her, but she cannot abandon her totally deaf family for whom she acts as full time translator, particular as their fishing business appears to be going under.One of those truly charming, beautifully acted films that leaves you wanting more. It's largely free of sentimentality, produces some great laughs and is gloriously acted by Jones, her family, all played by deaf actors and Eugenio Derbez as her grumpy heart of gold teacher. It offers great insights into the problems of being deaf in a modern world and the impossible position Ruby is in in having to chose between 2 great loves. The music here is lovely - Jones can really sing - apart from it all seemingly being tied up rather too neatly at the end, it is one of the funnest, most moving films of the year that could easily have been spoiled with too much treacle.",

Director/writer Sian Heder has crafted a story with familiar characters and situations and cast deaf actors in three of the four leads, the one exception being Emilia Jones, who is exquisite as Ruby, a hearing daughter who must decide between pursuing her passion for music and staying to help her deaf family's struggling fishing business. Marlee Marlin, Daniel Durant, and especially Troy Kotsur turn in achingly effective work as her family, and the last forty minutes really pierce the heart, especially when the family is unable to recognize Ruby's talent during a concert that is moving everyone else in attendance. It's hard not to be in tears through scenes like that.",

Ruby is the only one in her household who is not deaf, and as a result literally is the ears of her family and their fishing business.I absolutely LOVE this film! It is presented in such a lighthearted manner, it is refreshingly delightful. Even the sign language is (intentionally) funny, without being insulting to the deaf. Troy Kotsur stole the show as the sex-hungry Dad, Frank! He ensured many hilarious moments throughout the film. Caught in the middle, is Ruby, who just wants to sing. She has a crush on Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) and signs up for Choir just to be close to him. Eugenio Derbez is wonderful as music teacher Bernardo.An interesting fact about the cast, is that most of them are really deaf. Remember Marlee Matlin from 'Children of a Lesser God'? She's also amazing here. The entire cast was just perfect in their respective roles. The film also so well illustrates the challenges of being deaf, but also portrays deaf people as ordinary people who are not as helpless as many tend to believe. It certainly teaches us not to take our senses for granted.Wow, the film's final act really got to me! (The song choice during the finale was perfect!) This is a fantastic feel-good movie that will resonate with me for a long time. This is easily one of the best films I've seen lately. None of the other 2022 Academy Award nominees for Best Film had this affect on me. This was stunning!",

            "content": "My review of \"CODA,\" Si\u00e2n Heder's sublime coming-of-age story of a child of eaf adults. I've viewed the movie several times in these last 11 months. For me, \"CODA\" contains a great many elements familiar in many movies I have enjoyed in decades of going to the movies.Some themes and stories bare repeating in the world of movies, as some become a product of their era and, to some, seem dated and irrelevant. Also, new young adults need a fresh perspectiv, even if adults have seen such movies before.So, as most already know, it's about a restless teenager trying to break free from her parents' expectations, helped along by an inspirational teacher, putting her on the path to a tense, make-or-break musical audition that's followed by an emotional catharsis by film's end.But because Heder's adept at establishing the emotional bonds between the film's close-knit family, the presence of all these conventions doesn't matter too much.\"CODA\" focuses on Ruby (Emilia Jones), a high school senior in Gloucester, Mass., who wakes up before the sun rises so she can help her father (Troy Kotsur) and older brother Leo (Daniel Durant) on the family fishing boat before heading to school to fall asleep at her desk and endure taunts that she smells like haddock.Ruby is the only hearing person in her family, which puts the weight of responsibility on her shoulders for almost everything in her parents life. Marlee Matlin plays the mom, and she and Kotsur are a terrific acting pair on screen.She loves singing and she's good enough, that her choir teacher, Bernardo, offers to train her so she can audition for the for the prestigious Berklee College of Music.Ruby pairs up with the boy she's been crushing on, for a duet of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's \"You're All I Need to Get By.\" It pretty much guarantees that they'll fall in love because, singing that song, naturally they later realize there's a mutual attraction and real feelings.Another certainty Ruby's desire to leave home and pursue her dreams will conflict with her family's need for her to stick around and help.One thing that separates \"CODA\" from every other coming-of-age movie ... is the way that Heder seamlessly moves between speaking and American Sign Language in the family scenes. The signing is subtitled, rather than translated, highlighting it as a form of communication.The mother, father, sister and brother communicating with this energy and intimacy, our understanding of the family, its dynamics, the love they share and what's at stake if Ruby leaves - is elevatedThat means we care about these people - a lot. Ruby, played by British actress Jones captures the character's sensitivity & youthful impulsiveness, when sets out on the final part of her early life, so that she can begin the next part of it.You 'might' cry at this moment or if you've been there before or you'll recognize it's familiarity, from when you yourself left home and it too, may not have been an easy transition.As Joni Mitchell's song puts it : \"Something's lost, but something's gained.\" Which is pretty much what life itself is...that's everyone's life.TEN STARS!",

            "content": "This movie was a good story that showed hilarious moments, awkward moments, and cultural moments that involved a Deaf family. All of the actors were great. Especially, Troy Kotsur. He is a master! He deserves an Oscar, in my opinion. The movie was written and directed by Sian Heder. She is pretty good! I really enjoyed this movie but this movie should have been released in 1970s-1990s instead of today. This movie didn't show the use of technology that we use along with American Sign Language, (ASL). Technology such as Video Relay Services, and a Video Phone. The device was in the movie but they didn't use it, because they preferred to use their daughter to interpret instead. My dad and aunt did this during the 1970s-1990s, because at that time, there were no devices such as Video Phones for Deaf people to use. Technology was not yet developed then. Today it is better. So, when I watched this movie and I felt like the movie had the same old theme. The theme is consistent in depicting the old adage; \"poor Deaf people can't do anything for themselves, because they can't hear and they need to depend on their CODA children to interpret and do everything for them\". CODA means Child of Deaf Adults. Did we, the Deaf Community ALL like this movie? No. It's very different today. I use a Video Phone, I use the technology available to me today. I can request an ASL interpreter for my doctor's appointment by myself, along with communicating with my employer, and communicating with other hearing folks through current technology/interpreting services. I don't need to use my dad to interpret, or my sister. This movie didn't show that because like I said this move shows an old theme, and this movie should have been released 20-30 years ago. I don't understand why they made this movie, until I learned that this movie is based on the original film, \"La Famille Belier.\" They decided to make the movie, \"CODA\", as \"La Famille Belier\" is a foreign, (French) film, and they wanted to do a reinvention/remake of this film. I haven't seen the original film yet, but the issue here is the story/plot is old and out of date. While I enjoyed the movie, I would give it an 8 out of 10. I truly hope that this is the last movie that depicts Deaf folks in a negative and pitiful light, and that we can move on from this and develop/produce movies that depict Deaf people equal to hearing folks.",

Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones) is a high school student who has deaf parents and a deaf older brother.Before she starts school, she is out in a trawler with her father Frank (Troy Kostur) and brother Leo as the sole hearing person. The price they get for each catch gets lower and lower, while costs gets higher.At school Rose is shy. She stinks of fish, because of her parents deafness, she only learned how to talk properly when she started school.Rose shows talent as a singer. Her music teacher Mr Villalobos wants her to audition for a prestigious music school after she graduates.That puts Rose at odds with her parents who want her to stay with them, especially her mother Jackie (Marlee Matlin.) She also has to balance music lessons with the demands of her family's new fishing venture.There is no epic scope here even much of an emotional rollercoaster. It does avoid the schmaltz of the movie of the week approach.Where CODA soars is in the close knit family dynamics. The Rossi's are regarded as outsiders. No one else communicates with them much. Even regarded as freaks by others in the fishing community.The family appear to be unconventional but they feel real. Mum and dad have the hots for each other, they do not realise how much noise they make during lovemaking. Causing embarrassment for Rose.There are some nice touches. Jackie telling Rose that she was afraid if she could ever bond with a daughter who had full hearing. When the family go to the school music recital. They just hear silence and are too far away for the brother to lip read for them.It is a small scale feel good movie with many familiar ingredients in the screenplay. British actress Emilia Jones shows a lot of talent as Rose.It would not had been my pick for the Best Picture Oscar but it does have a lot of heart.",

Just a pure insightfully told story, so beautiful in its delivery and interpretations.The acting is exceptional kudos to Emilia Jones as the hearing girl, with Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur as her Deaf parents and Daniel Durant as her Deaf brother. Eugenio Derbez is a sheer delight.Kostur is so skilled at conveying emotion with his incredibly expressive gestures. And funny. To me, he is a very strong contender for the Oscar. It would be a travesty if he did not win. Marlee Matlin was breathtakingly brilliant, as always.And Jones' voice is so pure. And free of all the Christina Aguilera runs and forced vocal gymnastics, what a refreshing change.In the last 10 years, I can honestly say I have been rarely moved to tears in anything I watch.

That is absolutely gross. In the end she won and they hired all real life deaf actors to play all the deaf characters. I think things like this are important because it adds nuance to a subject matter like this.

            "content": "CODA is a very inspiring film with an overall good script and moral message. I also love the comedy in this movie.CODA is about an 18-year-old named Ruby who is the only one in her family of four without a hearing impairment. Her father is a fisherman, and she needs to help her dad with fishing since he can't hear. For example, if he violates a fishing code, the Coast Guard calls him, but he cannot respond because he can't hear the call. That's when Ruby comes in handy. Ruby's passion is singing. Her dream is to go to the Berklee College of Music. She finds out about a chorus group and joins it, which leads to some conflicts-primarily that her family relies on her, but she also wants to live her life and go to college.CODA, which stands for \"child of deaf adults\", is an outstanding film (with many awards and nominations) that is a remake of the 2014 French film, La Famille B\u00e9lier. Sian Heder wrote and directed this beautiful adapted screenplay. Not only is this film heartwarming and comical at the same time, but it also lets the audience experience what it is to be deaf to the point of feeling vulnerable by not experiencing the joy of a live concert. My favorite part is when Ruby performs a song on stage with her family watching in the crowd. This is the most interesting and heartwarming scene because when they cut out the audio you get to see the dad's point of view. You really feel what he experiences as a deaf person.There are many morals to this film, but the main one is that no matter what you suffer from or who you are-or even how you look-we are all humans. We should all be treated equally, and we are each unique in our own way. CODA does have some sexual scenes and foul language.I give CODA 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults. CODA is available now on Apple TV. By Ethan P., KIDS FIRST!",

            "content": "CODA is a beautiful film. I loved it and cannot recommend checking it out enough! I could easily see this winning best picture and I can't help but want to just rave about this film. I loved getting to peek inside the lives and challenges of a marginalized and often forgotten group. It's shows that the difficulties brought in by deafness are not only experienced by the deaf people themselves but also their family members, especially their children who can hear. It's a brilliant and heartfelt exploration of this as we follow Ruby, a young girl whose deaf family relies on her to help with their fishing business while she looks to pursue her love of music, something they can't truly get a sense of. I thought it was just excellent and I LOVED it. Sure, it's somewhat formulaic for the coming of age genre, but it's a truly radiant film, it's a deeply satisfying heart-warmer that embraces the pleasure and pureness of the formula, reminding one of the comforting and cathartic feelings of a feel good story that's well told. And that's exactly what this is. Emilia Jones is stunningly good in this movie and delivers what I think was one of the best performances this year. Not to mention her singing voice is gorgeous and she learned to both sing and sign for this role! The movie is just fantastic and it works so well as a comedy-drama, it's just exactly why it needs to be. Director Si\u00e2n Heder did a perfect job, every aspect of this film excelled. It's simplistic, beautiful and delightful. I truly loved it. It's a must see masterpiece.I could very much see this taking Best Picture at the Oscars.",

She's a very likable and relatible character and made the movie fun and pleasant to watch.For an adaptation they dumbed down quite a few plot details to make sure even the slowest of us would get their hammered home points, working against the insight and spryness of the greater movie.This wasn't the best film of 2021, it certainly had some good attributes, but the hokum script telling predictable stories detracted from the many good parts of it.",

It's just that the situations are so heartfelt and moving, and poignant in a way that strikes at what it means to be part of a family. While the story of Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones) is wrapped in a fairly formulaic plot line, it's her relationship and confrontations with father Frank (Troy Kotsur), Mom Jackie (Marlee Matlin), and brother Leo (Daniel Durant) that resonate with each conversation and outburst. Particularly moving is when after the school concert, Frank asks Ruby to sing the song for him. Damn, that scene really got to me. And what can you say about Ruby's rendition of 'Both Sides Now' at the finale? It encapsulated what the film was all about in a nutshell with an instructive message for anyone watching. But I have to end this review on a somewhat humorous note with a mention of Best Supporting Oscar Winner Troy Kutsur, who's appearance closely resembled a long time acquaintance and friend of mine who lives in my hometown. It might not have made such an impression, except for the fact that in the picture, Kotsur portrayed a fisherman, and the guy I'm talking about is named John Fish!",

The reason probably lies in the reality of the characters, but also in the direction in which the film developed. The reality is that the deaf people in the film are played by actors who are deaf in real life, so it was easier for us to convey and show us the situations in which deaf people find themselves every day.The main character is a teenager Ruby who faces a very difficult choice: to follow her own path and dreams or stay with a family that depends a lot on her as she is the only member of that family who is not deaf. The moral dilemma seems real and I feel sorry for Ruby who is torn between those two paths. There's not a single boring scene in the film, and the drama is shattered by a couple of scenes that contain a bit of humor.The film invites us and shows us how to be aware of the problems of the deaf because the things we take for granted cause them a big problem in life and this is very nicely shown in the film without any pathos or regret. It all looks very real, real people with the right relationships and feelings. That, in my opinion, is perhaps the strongest aspect of the film.",

I don't believe that there is any better film to introduce a person to it. The movie follows a teenage girl, Ruby (Emilia Jones), the daughter of two deaf adults (Marlee Matlin and Troy Katsur), and her older sibling Leo (Daniel Durant), as the girl struggles to juggle her family business with her passion, singing. She loves to sing, much to her parent's dismay.It's truly a wonderful and heartwarming experience to see her overcome all these roadblocks. I have one problem with the film though, and that involves the story. It's a bit too sappy, and almost a little too predictable. It's a movie that you walk into expecting something and getting just that. A 'tearjerker' as they used to say in the 1950's. If a film like this has just one flaw, it's a very admirable piece of work - I loved it, and would easily recommend it.Note: Troy Katsur won best supporting actor for his work here, and he couldn't have deserved it more. He was fantastic. This film also won best picture, which I completely agree with. (CODA was my number two pick; I chose Licorice Pizza as my favorite nominee; but that had no chance of being able to win). It may have been a disastrous Oscar night, but the awards given here were absolutely deserved; I would only say however that I would have also liked to see Marlee Matlin win a second Oscar for her work here.",

            "content": "Every once in a while, a film comes along and unexpectedly pulls at the heartstrings in a feel-good way. 'Coda' is the latest example of this.The Gloucseter, MA-set \"little film that could\" has quietly gained ground in this year's Oscars race as it continues to reach a wider audience through Apple TV+. What the film lacks in starpower (save a perfectly cast Marlee Matlin), it makes up for it in everything else. From the touching coming-of-age story of a young woman at a crossroads of choosing between supporting her deaf family and pursuing her passion for singing to its perfect mix of offbeat humor and serious subject matter, 'Coda' illuminates the challenges faced by the deaf community in a respectful and engaging way.There are a few scenes in 'Coda' where it's almost impossible not to reach for a tissue - this is the mark of a movie that strikes a chord with its audience. Not only does Emilia Jones have a bright future in acting, but her angelic voice will take her equally far. And the Rossi family patriarch (played by Troy Kotsur) is a portrait of a complex, tough yet compassionate man who perfectly represents the Massachusetts fishing community.'Coda' is the rare breed of a triple threat film that has the potential to educate people while making an emotional connection and still managing to be entertaining.",

            "content": "This film should have been one of the big talking points of the Academy Awards the year it won Best Picture, unfortunately the world was instead talking about Will Smith hitting Chris Rock, however it was recognised throughout Awards Season, and I was looking forward to watching it. Basically, in Gloucester, Massachusetts, Ruby Rossi (BAFTA nominated Emilia Jones) is the child of deaf adults (CODA), the only hearing member of her family. Her parents, Frank (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Troy Kotsur) and Jackie (Marlee Matlin), and older brother Leo (Daniel Durant), are all deaf, and all communicate through American Sign Language. Ruby assists with the family fishing business and after graduating from high school plans to go into it full-time. In her spare time, she enjoys listening to music and singing. Because of her family, Ruby is an outcast at school. Ruby has a crush on fellow student Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo). She notices him signing up for choir, and impulsively does the same. Her best friend Gertie (Amy Forsyth) worries that this could lead to bullying. One day, Ruby accompanies her parents to a medical appointment where a Doctor (Jason Pugatch) confirms they have \"jock itch\", a fungal infection most common when spending time in damp clothes (from fishing). The doctor says it is transferrable through intercourse and recommends Frank and Jackie abstain from sex for two weeks. On the first day of choir, teacher Bernardo \"Mr. V\" Villalobos (Eugenio Derbez), instructs the students to sing \"Happy Birthday to You\" to determine their vocal ability and assign their parts. Faced with having to sing in front of the class, Ruby panics and runs away. She later returns to Mr. V and explains that she was bullied as a child for talking differently. Mr. V tells Ruby there is room for all kinds of voices in the choir and is surprised and impressed by her beautiful singing voice. Mr. V pairs Ruby with Miles for a duet at the upcoming choir recital. Their first rehearsal goes poorly as they have prepared separately; Mr. V insists that they must practice together. Ruby invites Miles to her house to practice, but they are interrupted by Frank and Jackie loudly having sex in the next room, ignoring the doctor's advice. Ruby later hears classmates in the cafeteria mocking the incident. Miles insists her he only told one person, who spread the story; angered she tells him he wants nothing to do with him. She eventually forgives him, and they resume their practice while forming a relationship. Meanwhile, Frank and Leo struggle to make ends meet with the fishing business as new fees and sanctions are imposed by the local board. At a board meeting, everyone is angry that more boats are disappearing from the harbour even though the counsel is trying to help. During the yelling Frank stands, interpreted through Ruby, he announces that he is going to start his own company and intends to sell his own fish, inviting other local anglers to join him. The family struggles to get the new business off the ground, relying on Ruby to spread the word. Mr. V encourages Ruby to audition for Berklee College of Music. He offers to help her prepare with private lessons, as he is already privately tutoring Miles. Ruby agrees, but her increasing commitments to the family business, with her parents dependent upon her interpreting for them, cause her to be late for their lessons. Mr. V grows impatient with Ruby's constant lateness and berates her for wasting his time and not caring enough about music. One day, while Frank and Leo are fishing, they have a federal fishing observer on board, who was unaware in advance that Frank and Leo are deaf. Meanwhile, Ruby is out swimming with Miles at a lake. Frank and Leo's boat is intercepted by the Coast Guard, after they failed to respond to ship horns and radio calls. They are fined and have their fishing licenses suspended for negligence. They chastise Ruby for not being there when they needed her, she insists she can't always interpret for them, and this was not her fault. Frank and Leo appeal and successfully get their license back, on the condition that they always have a hearing person on board. Ruby announces to her family that she is giving up college and will join the business full-time. Frank and Jackie are supportive, but Leo is angry, insisting that they can manage without Ruby as she has talent. Leo and Ruby argue, with him telling her she would be wasting her opportunity and will regret not going to college. Ruby's family attends her choir recital, and while they cannot hear her sing, they notice the positive reception from the audience watching. Later that night, Frank asks Ruby to sing for him while he feels her vocal cords, and he gets emotional. The entire family then drives to Boston with Ruby for her Berklee audition. Before her audition, she sees Miles, who tells her that he failed at his audition and wishes her luck. Ruby is nervous and unprepared at first, but Mr. V comes to accompany her on piano. The auditions do not allow outside attendees, but Ruby's family sneak up to the balcony to watch her. Ruby starts deliberately, so Mr. V makes a deliberate mistake on the piano, allowing her to start again. As she sings, she gains confidence when she sees her family. Ruby signs along while singing \"Both Sides, Now\" by Joni Mitchell, so they can understand what she is singing. The adjudicators notice the family and realise the family situation. Sometime later, Ruby is accepted to Berklee. Her family and Mr. V are delighted with the news. She invites Miles to visit her in Boston. Meanwhile, the hearing workers in the family's fishing business can communicate with and interpret for the family after learning sign language. Ruby's friend Gertie drives her to Boston for college. They stop temporarily for Ruby to get out and give her family a hug, and she signs, \"I love you so much\" to them as they drive away. Also starring John Fiore as Tony Salgado, Lonnie Farmer as Arthur, Kevin Chapman as Brady, and Courtland Jones as Ms. Simon. Jones is splendid as the hearing teenage girl in a deaf family with a beautiful singing voice, Kotsur (who became the second and first male deaf Oscar winner) is fantastic as the girl's passionate father, Matlin (the first deaf Oscar winner) and Durant are great support as the mother and brother, and Derbez is likeable as the eccentric teacher. It is an emotional story about a teenage girl caught between helping her family's fledgling business and her ambitions to become a singer, and it makes you laugh with the banter between the family and some amusingly awkward moments, a great movie with heart and depth, a must-see compelling coming-of-age comedy-drama. It won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year (the first movie produced by a streaming service (Apple TV+) to win), and Best Adapted Screenplay for Sian Heder (also directing), it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!",

There were many funny and clever jokes mostly from the main character's deaf parents that showed the tight relationship in the family. I was consistently entertained with what our main character had to go through because she was the only hearing person in her family.This led to the main conflict for our main character. The struggle between family responsibilities and one's hope and dream was a familiar theme that is explored many times before. However, the story created a new and unique situation that had me sympathized with not our main character, but also her family members. The family dynamics worked so well that the situation even more conflicting.Still, the movie had many sweet moments. The audition scene near the end was beautiful and got me emotional there. Also, Emilia Jones, who played the main girl Ruby, had a beautiful voice, and I loved every scene where she sang.As for problems, the progression was definitely a bit formulaic, but it didn't bother me much at all.Overall, a sweet, beautiful, and unique slice of life/coming of age story. 9/10.",

When the families fishing business is threatened, Ruby finds herself torn between pursuing her love for music and her fear of abandoning her parents. Wow what a truly moving and incredible film, I have so many amazing things to talk about here.My first few positives would be the amazing cinematography. The charming tone and humour. Excellent chemistry and performances from the cast. As well as the deep themes and excellent representation. This film was visually amazing. Not for its creative shots but for its beautiful simplicity, with long shots really highlighting the beautiful set locations of the film. The film had such a charming tone as well especially with its humour. None of it felt forced and it came across authentically, the family's interactions were so heartfelt and charming, and the awkward situations with Ruby's parents and Ruby and her brother offered a lot of great comedic moments. The whole family had such fantastic chemistry with each other, and it made the film seem so genuine and much more fun to watch. The whole cast also delivered excellent performances here. Everyone executed passionate, charismatic, and powerful performances showing a lot of versatility, specifically with Emilia Jones who was insanely impressive here. The themes that this film touched upon was also very moving. It tackled anxiety, fear of abandonment, responsibility, and the difficulties of having a disability so well and in so much depth it was amazing to watch. It was written so well and was often really moving to see. The representation for the deaf community this film gave was also amazing. It truly was done in a genuine and authentic way, highlighting the struggles the deaf community face, but also highlighting how they adapt and can live a normal life.My next few positives would be the soundtrack and music elements, the great character conflict and depth. As well as balance to the conflict. As well as the likeable main character and strong supporting cast with unique storytelling. The film did a really good job with its music elements. The Soundtrack was fun and Ruby or shall I say Emilia Jones had a beautiful voice and it was amazing to see her grow in confidence with her voice as the film developed. Ruby as a character was also just extremely likeable. I really connected to her character with her anxiety and social awkwardness, she got so used to people making fun of her due to her family it really knocked back her confidence. But as the film developed her confidence grew and so did my love for her character. She helped her family so much and sacrificed a lot for them. The character depth was some of the best I have seen. Each character had their own journey or things to grow on throughout the film. The son felt left out of the family and was finding his path into being accepted as a man. And the mother and father really grew in terms of their openness to see their daughter happy. Ruby as a character had a tremendous amount of depth, which is linked to the conflict. Her family have always been so reliant on her to interpret what other people say or to help with the business, in the process stopping Ruby from achieving her goals in life, and this film showed a great balance to both sides of the conflict and all the characters really grew from this conflict in terms of understanding each other. I also thought the supporting cast was very strong. Ferdia Peelo and Eugenio Derbez in particular. Eugenio Derbez delivered a charismatic performance; his character was so likeable. Despite a perhaps slightly harsh way of teaching occasionally he genuinely cares about his students and his chemistry with Ruby was a fantastic element to the film. Ferdia Peelo was also fantastic. The romance wasn't a big part of the film which I loved as it didn't need to be the main focus. But he delivered a charming performance and his romantic chemistry with Emilia was great to see. Finally, I loved the unique storytelling. This film really incorporated sign language into how the story was told which I loved. Often due to being with a deaf family Ruby expressed her emotions through sign even though she could speak, due to her confidence issues she found this the best way to communicate. It was such a clever and interesting way to incorporate sign language that felt fresh and unique to the film.My final few positives would be the uplifting moments, emotional weight and moving ending. This film was so uplifting and offered such a hopeful message about living with a disability and showing that you can learn and adapt to live a normal life. This film had so much emotional weight and really got to me. It was just heart-breaking to see the families struggles, they couldn't enjoy Ruby's singing because they couldn't hear it and the personal scenes between Ruby and her parents really touched me. This movie handled its deep themes and really showed what it's like to be deaf, and it has really stuck with me. The ending was so moving, the family were such a strong unit by the end, fully supporting Ruby. And Ruby getting accepted into music school was so powerfully done, with her audition being sung and done in sign language at the same time. It was truly moving cinema.Overall, CODA is my favourite film of the year and completely deserved its win at Sundance. In a powerful, moving, and uplifting story. That was incredibly written. Filled with incredible performances and it really moved me emotionally. Offering so many beautiful messages about love, acceptance, and family. Giving important representation to the deaf community showing that with hard work, determination, and cooperation with the people around you, people with disabilities are just as capable at living a normal life.Overall rating 100/100.",

The same could be said for Best Picture; a tie in my book between Belfast and CODA. Child of Deaf Adults would have been a lesser title; CODA was the right choice. Emilia Jones was almost as good as Nicole Kidder in Being the Ricardos, and deserved a nomination for Best Actress.The only minor weakness of the film is the predictable ending; something not present in Belfast. We already know how things will turn out, especially since the girlfriend of her brother can hear and speak. Despite that minor flaw, the film is brilliant, and the performances of the entire cast are outstanding. There is one segment in the film that is unforgettable; when the viewing audience actually experiences what it is like to be deaf, while everyone else is having a good time. Good to see Marlee Matlin again; the first big role since Children of a Lesser God made 35 years ago. A movie not to be missed.",

Its is definitely going to win some Oscars come tomorrow Night ( in US of course) and rightly so. This movie has been buzzing around since Last year's Sundance Film festival \ud83c\udf8e where it won and swept all the fans and critics alike.Using real deaf actors in this movie really Bode well for the movie in general and only adds to the genuiness of the film in portraying this sweet and publicly awkward family. It really shows what are the challenges faced by deaf people in general and being CODA is the toughest of it all. You can see and feel the helplessness of the family members without CODA in general public and the consequences they have to suffer in absence of them. But how this family evolves into something more and their dynamics with one another and how it changes throughout the movie makes it one amazing watch and an unforgettable one.The songs used in the movie are so soothing and mesmerizing that it helps you as a viewer to delve deeper into the movie and back the emotional rollercoaster they are on.This movie is part drama, part comedy (not forced I must say) and a part coming of the age story. Saying anything else would be to undermine the story telling and emotions it generates.You will have to see it to believe it!!!VERDICT: 4.5/5PLATFORM: APPLE TV/PRIME VIDEO.",

Music is another key player too, with a great soundtrack and an unforgettable performance of a Joni Mitchell song during which I had something in my eye. Some truly hilarious moments also along the way, not least an uproarious twist on the embarrassment of being caught at it by your parents!

It certainly has the cliche elements of a story that involves someone finding their identity, but the way the film truly focuses on heartfelt themes like family, love and friendship is the key to the success this film has garnered since it's August release last year.I am writing this at the time of its recent awards success (BAFTA and SAG awards) and the supporting actor winner for Troy Kotsur really was deserved for the uniqueness of his performance. He evokes humour, love and passion throughout the film and all that is made even more incredible due to him being deaf. Emilia Jones as the central character Ruby was equally as good, she will be a fine actress no doubt and her music tutor Mr Villalobos played brilliantly by Eugenio Derbez was a hilarious gem consistently throughout.Likewise, the score by Marius De Vries compliments the film perfectly. The various tracks produce a variety of feelings that elevate your emotions towards the characters. It's exactly what a soundtrack should do and it played a major part in me loving this film as much as a I did.As most films though, it's not perfect. Perhaps it is predictable come the end, but it's narrative is simple and for me it works well. It was slamming any message down your throats, it's a film you can just observe and learn from, as films should make you feel.A really enjoyable film with many memorable moments, I'm so glad to see it doing well in awards season and while it might be a long shot for Best Picture, you just never know.",

            "content": "Child of Deaf Adults is Sian Heder's latest masterpiece release, starring Marlee Matlin and Emilia Jones.The film is the progressive insight into living in a family that is three-quarters deaf. Emilia Jones plays hearing Ruby who finds the strength to pursue her passion of music, a talent completely contrasting her family's disability. Heder perfects the balance of displaying the household's struggle in benefiting from their fishing business and Ruby's thriving progression under vibrant music teacher Bernardo, whilst also placing emphasis on her integral role to the family.Emilia Jones spent nine months perfecting American-sign language as well as building up the courage to sing in front of an audience, which she had never previously done. She spoke with Total Film Magazine highlighting how her parents were never pushy, and that she hadn't attending singing lessons/school. Oh and she's British, which having watched CODA, you would not have thought. My point is that this young 19-year-old is special, and demonstrates her qualities and intentions with a real gloss in Apple TV's production.The film on the whole is a work of art, one of the rarest forms of cinematography that is designed to make you both laugh and cry. The comedy within is undefeated and is effective in making the picture seem as relatable as possible, an awkward doctor's appointment followed by an even more awkward bedroom scene is the unprecedented eye-covering sequence that we didn't know we needed!Total Film's interview with Emilia Jones delves into the crux of the idea, and the core of its plan was to display reality, not to generalise, or exaggerate, but to have deaf actors play deaf characters and see how a family that may seem disjointed, can still function comfortably, and how the non-hearing, can still enjoy sound in an alternative form.CODA addresses serious philosophical subjects in such a fantastical manner, which helps the name the film as one of the highest ranking releases this year.",

            "content": "As so often happens, CODA winning Best Picture at the Academy Awards (2022 edition) inspired me to give it a watch when I may not have otherwise. What I found was a film that is incredibly emotional and forthright in exploring deaf communities and families, if a bit caricature-ish at times in that pursuit.For a very basic overview, the movie tells the story of Ruby (Emilia Jones), who is a CODA (or Child of Deaf Adults). While struggling to manage interpreting for a fisherman father (Troy Kotsur), mother (Marlee Matlin), and brother (Daniel Durant) who often resents her place in the family, Ruby discovers a talent and passion for singing. Cultivated by a high school choir teacher (Eugenio Derbez), Ruby must decide whether to pursue music in college or stay in her Massachusetts hometown to continue supporting her family's needs.What ultimately makes CODA a successful endeavor is its honest and open exploration of the deaf community. Kotsur's role particularly stands out here, what with his inability to get a fish-selling business off the ground using signing instead of words. There is also some very interesting resentment-issue material in the brother/sister relationship, as one sibling is deaf and the other hearing. Most of all, the conflict in Ruby-having to choose between pursuing her own dreams and leaving her family to fend for themselves-is palpable throughout.CODA is also a very emotional film, almost certain to have you holding back tears (if not outright shedding them). Certain familiar conversations are imbued with significant emotional depth, and the film's climax-Ruby's audition for a spot at Berklee College of Music-is beautiful.The only thing holding CODA back from a higher ranking for me? I felt some characters were often more caricatures in certain aspects. Ruby's high school music instructor is without a doubt a driving force in the film, but often borders on clich\u00e9. The same could be said for Ruby's boyfriend (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) at times. For such a deep, emotional film, there were just a few too many scenes where I felt like I was watching a teen high school movie (though perhaps this was intentional).Overall, though, I found CODA to be a solid film that made me think about issues related to hearing-impaired individuals and society at large. For the most part, those issues and their emotional portrayals win the day here.",

            "content": "The film chronicles the trauma of a teenaged American schoolgirl who is caught in a deep dilemma torn between her love and support for her deaf family and her personal aspirations of becoming a choir singer. Her deaf parents and a grown up deaf brother are managing a fishing business and she is their constantly available interpreter to communicate to the outside world. The setting is a small American town.Emelia Jones is simply superb as the 17 year old Ruby who is trying to balance her life while meeting the demands from three aspects of her ongoing life. One, her parents need her constantly as an interpreter; two, her music teacher in school who wants her undivided attention for regular choir singing practice and finally her friend Miles ( her duet partner in singing) in school who adores her and wants to be her friend. Director Sian Heder has very sensitively presented the scenes which will no doubt be loved by the audience. The dialogue builds up emotions very naturally as we watch the the different scenes of Ruby with her mom, dad, brother, music teacher, and friend Miles. All these scenes are very heartwarming and touching. There are a few well shot silent scenes as the father unable to hear Ruby's singing watches the audience members appreciateing the performance. The movie shows that parents do care, do make sacrifices and are not selfish as perceived by the children most of the time. Award level performances come from Troy Kotsur and Marlee Matlin as the parents. They deserve all the awards they get.All told this a very sensitively told and enacted story of family relationships. A trivia of interest is that the actors playing parents and brother are deaf in real life. This makes to make this film on a \"must watch\" category for this reason too.",

Ruby, played by Emilia Jones, does a fantastic job at showing us the hardships of choosing between the life you were given and the life you want to make for yourself.First lets discuss the amazing supporting cast. The brother played by Daniel Durant, the mother played by Marlee Martin, and the Farher played by Troy Kotsur. These three blew me away with the emotion they provided throughout the film while only being able to communicate through sign language. The struggles they endure as deaf family really puts things into perspective. No matter how hard they try to live an ordinary life, society can be rough for the hearing impaired. However, they handle these challenges with grace, and thankfully for the audience, with some comedic relief as well.The best part of the film in my opinion is the relationship between Ruby and her teacher, Bernardo, played by Eugenio Derbez. He doesnt take it easy on her and it really teaches her that neither will the world. The way he challenges her sends a great message that you will need to make tough choices for yourself and your overall well being, and then you need to own those decisions whole heartedly.Overall Coda was an incredible film with a whole cast that I wanted to spend more time with once the final credits rolled. I hope it wins the Oscar for Best Picture!",

            "content": "The new AppleTV+ movie directed by Sian Heder will surely hit you like a ton of bricks. It's emotional without being manipulative but rather by making us invested in the characters and their lives.Basically the movie follows Ruby Rossi, a teenage child of deaf adults who has to take a huge responsibility in managing her family from a very young age and her coming of age and trying to have an identity of her own.But that doesn't mean the supporting characters aren't fleshed out. They have their own agencies and they feel real which is probably why the movie works so well. The mother (Jackie) is shown to be conflicted about her daughter growing up as she doesn't want her daughter going away from them. The brother (Leo) is insecure as he feels the family favors and assigns more tasks to Ruby even though he is the older brother. He wants people to know that he can shoulder responsibility and take care of the family. Then it brings us to the father (Frank), featuring a magnificent performance from Troy Kotsur. He steals every scene he is in and his relationship with his daughter Ruby is the heart of the film.There have been complaints that the film is standard and predictable and yes this is true. You can predict the plot points from a mile away because these kinds of movies are made a lot. But still the movie works because of hw dedicated and committed the cast and crew are. They believe in the story and characters and this makes the events happening real. We connect to the characters and are prepared to go on the journey with them. The plot points even though they've been covered a million times feels real because there is a feel of authenticity in this movie.And Emilia Jones(who plays ruby). My god!! What a performance. The movie wouldn't work without her giving it all. She has to be authentic in multiple categories. She has to believable in catching fish, in sign language, singing and an American accent. And I haven't even talked about her acting skills because she has to be unbelievably likeable. We have to be prepared to go with her and she has to manage to be interesting for 2 hours and she does it with so much ease.But the things I loved the most about this movie are the emotional beats. Ruby singing to her dad in the back of the truck and then the song at the audition had me bawling my eyes out. Also, it was genuinely funny with Troy Kotsur being absolutely hilarious. And I also think it's one of the very few movies which treats deaf people with kindness and takes them seriously. They are allowed to be full human beings with problems just like everybody else compared to other films where deaf person's only character trait is that he/she is deaf.Overall, a terrific movie with some plot points which don't feel that sincere compared to the rest of the movie. It's one of those movies which I feel like everyone should watch because it makes you feel so much of empathy.",

I thought something like C'mon C'mon struck a similar tone and was a little better made and more distinctive overall, but oh well- CODA is better than some of the nominees it was up against for sure, but personally I was rooting for Drive My Car.It's nice though- I don't know what more there is to say. It's a very good movie, but not much more. It does almost everything pretty well, and only has a couple of clunky moments here and there, when it comes to characters seeming to forget conflicts very easily, or the odd line of dialogue that's a bit on the nose.Still, it's a hard movie to hate.

It can be schmaltzy at times, it can feel overly emotional. Secondly... It just works though. Everyone here is just incredible, they all feel like real people, rich characters with complex lives and personalities, prides and faults. I love that they got actual deaf people to play these parts and that they had them played so well. Its a brilliant film for representation, for demystifying the deaf community and showing that they're just people, people with their own rituals, quirks and habits like anyone else, but people. I laughed when the parents asked what a boy's intentions were with their daughter, I bawled my eyes out when the daughter sang for her father and overall just found myself really affected by this film.I don't know that I would say CODA was the best film of the year, but it was certainly one of them.

            "content": "I really was expecting a slow haul when I started this film, something I would feel my eyes getting heavy in as I just counted the minutes down to the inevitable faster paced third act. I was seriously wrong. What made me even think about watching it was the premise.Coda follows Ruby, who is the only hearing person in her family and follows her in her pursuit for her dreams in music but with the fear of abandoning her parents. This is a hugely insightful film.TLDR at the bottom.Starting with everything I loved, and there's a lot of it, the writing. By far, the writing stood out the most to me but not that far behind was the performances by all the actors, notably Troy Kotsur as the father, Frank. The writing here is so natural and it flows from scene to scene. The moments will have you feeling a range of emotions from laughter to having you tear up. Each character has their own distinct personality, and you can really empathise and invest yourself in their lives and see their point of view. From the writing, you get a sense of unity between each character, and it has some wonderful moments between each of the family members; and that's just it, there are always moments with the family, whether it be father and daughter, mother and daughter or brother and sister, it was wholesome and really lets each actor shine in their own right.Speaking of the acting, brilliant stuff here. You can really see their pride and struggles from the acting. Considering that majority of the main cast talk using ASL just emphasises how powerful their body language and facial expressions are. Troy Kotsur brings his all to the table and it was his performance that can really make you shed a tear and also make you laugh out loud. Eugenio Derbez also brings the light-heartedness with his character of being a choir teacher to life. Great acting.All of this was fit in to a runtime 1 hour 51 minutes and it did feel a bit slower in the beginning and did feel longer than the actual runtime, but the film manages to ensure that every scene shown is relevant.In terms of the technical aspects, there wasn't anything outstanding, but I wasn't looking for it. There were moments where I thought the cinematography was great: the wide shots of the lake and the framing of said shots, but otherwise I was so invested in the characters and the narrative that all the technical aspects flew past me but I'm sure the cinematography, soundtrack and all other aspects were a contributing factor in the success of this solid film. It is very apparent, that this was a well thought out film with a lot of passion behind it.It was in the third act; however, I felt the film missed a beat in terms of a little character development, but this was a minor gripe and doesn't take away from the film as a whole, but it did linger with me after the credits rolled.Overall, the film was beautifully crafted and has fantastic performances and great writing whilst also being very insightful. It may be a little predictable, but it creates for a light-hearted atmosphere in the times of its unexpected comedy and it will definitely fog up your eyes.P. S. The parallels between Ruby's musical life and her home life were great and the singing was fantastic.P. P. S. This film definitely deserves the awards and nominations it is getting.TLDR: A fantastic film. Watch it.",

            "content": "I've been meaning to see 'CODA' for a while now, but the Best Picture Oscar nomination was what finally got me around to doing so. I suspected I was going to like this movie. This has been the strongest type of movie for quite a few years now. Teenager/s (usually female but not always) dealing with school, family, love etc. Of course 'CODA' has a twist with the deaf family aspect, and this helped it become one of the best films in recent times in a genre that was already extremely strong.The acting in this movie is superb. Troy Kotsur received a Best Supporting Actor nomination - and deservedly so - but I feel like Marlee Matlin could easily have earned one as well. Both are absolutely terrific. Also Emilia Jones plays a crucial role in this film being as good as it is. She has to be extremely likeable, believable in terms of her sign language and also musically talented. Don't underestimate just how good she was.I've always said the one thing no film can do without is likeable characters and this movie has them in spades. The character of 'Bernardo' played by Eugenio Derbez is a perfect example of this. This is not an easy character to perfect. The hard-ass teacher (with a heart of gold) doesn't just write itself. It has to be carefully crafted to find the perfect balance. They nailed it here.There are some genuinely funny moments in this film. I'm talking laugh out loud funny. And it really does just come from the characters being themselves. It doesn't feel forced.My only gripe with the film would be that sometimes the conflict/drama comes from Ruby's parents doing some pretty unkind things to her. It's not just embarrassment at their situation of being deaf which they can't help, it's embarrassment at them doing brutal things to her that any parents could do to their child if they felt like it. It's a small gripe but it did bother me a little.Otherwise though I had a very good time with 'CODA'. I'm glad this is getting the recognition it deserves and hopefully it helps to continue this genre of film churning out quality products in the future. 9/10.",

You really empathise with all the characters in this movie and the ending culminates into some of the best cinema I have seen in a long time, not for the wow factor of it but just the subtle nod to THIS is what the film has been building up to and it was executed perfectly.Each actor aces their performances and I would happily watch this film again & again.

This just shows you that no one should pay attention to the Academy Awards as they have no clue about movies, but then again, there were a lot of terrible movies in 2021.This movie was sweet, but predictable as can be. The French version is sweeter and better if you are looking for something to watch. I just can't get over that they gave the best picture award to a film that was almost a frame-by-frame copy of another movie in another language.Eugenio Derbez was awesome as the music teacher, but he was riffing off the original version, too, as that film had a great character to follow. Derbez is a great comedic actor and proves it in this movie.I'm not sure, but I'm almost positive that you can't start singing during your last year of high school and then win a scholarship to Berklee College of Music, and certainly not by doing just an OK rendition of Both Side Now, but in Hollywood, anything is possible. Pretty weak singing numbers, and as I said, Glee did it better.",

Doesn't mean that first hour is bad, it is quite good and held well by the leads through their outstanding performances , just that it is not on par with the third act. Kudos to Sian Heder , she handled the subject with \u00e9lan and brought the best emotions from the real deaf guys , hats off.Emilia Jones as Ruby is brilliant, beautiful and incredible throughout. She carried the movie and of course, got amazing support from reel family who did an outstanding job in elevating the movie with their sign act. You eventually become a part of their family, such is the atmosphere and vibe they give through their performances. All the three actors in the movie are real deaf persons and trust me, they make you feel their struggle, plight , emotions just with the signs BRAVO.Troy Kotsur as Ruby's dad is natural and phenomenal. There is one scene in the third act, where he asks his daughter to sing for him and place his hand on her neck to feel it is one of the finest and strikingly beautiful scenes ever. Same goes with the scene where Ruby asks her mother \" did you ever wish I was born deaf ? \" and the following scene with sign language and no background music made me feel something which is unexplainable. I give credit to actors for making me go through this, love you guys.Had it carried the same third act feel in the first hour, overall rating would have been higher. Yet, it deserves 8 for the actors especially real deaf persons act and for Sian's heartwarming stroke. Couple of issues but forgivable , as it managed to overcome in the final showdown. Do yourself a favor and watch it!!",

            "content": "Of all the awards contenders of 2021, CODA is the feel-good movie of the pack, alongside King Richard. You know exactly where it's going and it goes there, but that doesn't stop it from being a very good and enjoyable movie. There isn't really that much to say about it. It's a movie where the credits roll and you feel uplifted. The premise is that Ruby, a CODA (child of deaf adults) is torn between staying with her deaf family and going off to music school.The movie's best aspect is its acting, especially from Emilia Jones and Troy Kotsur. Of course, it's easy to admire the deaf actor's excellent performances, but those who had to learn American Sign Language for the movie also deserve respect. Even for those of us that don't understand ASL, it still conveys itself as well as the spoken dialogue does. Emilia Jones speaks well, sings well, and does ASL well. It's an all-around excellent performance from her. The screenplay is very good as well. CODA may be feel-good, but it's no sappy Hallmark movie. The weight of Ruby's decision is there, and the effects of either option are worth considering. There is a real emotional weight in the movie, and the relationship between Ruby and her family is very well handled. It also has a very lovely setting in an idyllic fishing village in Massachusetts, featuring some beautiful maritime scenery.While it is a solid film, there are a few things it does wrong. The relationship between Ruby and Miles, her school classmate/crush, goes back and forth without much to build it up or make it meaningful. There is also too much sexual humor in the movie. While I do understand that they wanted to show that deaf people can be sexually active, there's too much of it in other places. The part with the choir singing a decidedly dirty song in school felt kind of icky. These are mostly minor issues, though. CODA is a solid film boosted by excellent performances and a great screenplay. But above all, it's a uplifting movie. Sometimes that's just what you need. Serious dramas have their place, but sometimes you just need a film like this to lift your spirits.",

As the only \"normal\" person, she has to be a baller in taking up responsibilities to protect her family in all ways she can, even though she is the youngest. However, as adolescence approaches, a period when one begins to have his/her own dreams, fantasies and love pursuits, Ruby has to make difficult choices of either being true to herself or loyal to her family. This sounds like a very hard decision to make. Yet, with an understanding and supportive family, where communication goes way beyond words, there is always a way out which does nothing but only strengthens the familial bond.CODA is a beautiful and touching story. Many of the scenes are the Rossi family communicating in sign language. But you don't feel a gap or any problems of understanding what they are conveying. No doubt this is all about the impeccable writing and acting.In the movie, you can feel how hard the Rossi family find it to fit in the community. How hard it is to make ends meet when the fishing business is going downhill. And the fear that they would fail, as a parent and as a child. But with sincere and genuine conversations, the Rossis talk ( in sign language), they listen and they choose love. Quite a lot of touching conversations in the movie that you have to watch for yourself. I can't help but broke into tears as we all know this is not easy to come by in real life. And it is chilling to feel this genuine kind of love in the big screen once in a while.In the midst of pandemic, I would strongly suggest you watch this movie to remind you that there is still something worth fighting for.",

It has a small cast that absolutely smash it, especially the three actors that are deaf.Coda innovates. It's a different coming-of-age story, one that offers a fresh perspective. Coda means \"Child of Deaf Adult\". Ruby is a member of a deaf family, in which only she is not deaf. She loves to sing but her family can't here her. And challenges rise from there.One of the best things about Coda is that it never stops giving, every moment in the film is delivered perfectly. The emotions hit you in the right spot, the drama is intense and the comedy sticks the landing. Like the clever use of sign language to converse with someone who is not learned in ASL but gets what that person is trying to convey given the circumstances. Or showing the shortcomings of being deaf while simultaneously not making them seem less able than others. It perfectly shows you what it feels like to be a deaf person.It is perfectly easy to understand sign language via subtitles but the way those actors deliver those signs makes it even more emotional than normal speaking lines.Emilia Jones plays a fantastic role as Ruby. Ruby's story, although unique, is very relatable. I like how the film doesn't over-focus on school stuff and teen romance like some other films. This gave time for and space for Emilia to show her great talents as an actress.Overall, Coda is definitely one of the best films of 2021 and I 100% recommend watching this.",

You can clearly see the level of careful research Si\u00e2n Heder took.I've never seen Emilia Jones in anything else (apart from \"One Day\" lol) but she was fantastic. I love films this way since she was a blank page that she started to paint. She took responsibility of this role and delivered to great effect.I thought some story beats, acting and locations were very formulaic, even clich\u00e9. It became fairly predictable which made me lose the story a bit. You've seen this story a good amount of times but it still felt fresh.The cinematography was nice but I wish there was something else to it. It was very clean with sharp lenses making it feel very digital. Unless they wanted that look, I feel it could've perhaps lended itself to some imperfections in the image like using filmstock or vintage lenses. I feel it would fit the story really well but perhaps that's just my own taste.This film has great beautiful moments that I'll remember.

I really have no idea.I guess CODA is filmed in a very unassuming and unpretentious manner with little or no ego or selfishness, which is reflected in the low-key unity of the family to just get on with it, no matter what.Or maybe I'm just a sucker for Joni Mitchell music and happy ever after soppy(ish) movies, but for whatever reason, I really enjoyed this presentation and was moved by the simplicity of it all, and perhaps the gaps in dialogue and non-intelligible sign language had a subconscious effect on my brain.I liked CODA a lot.",

You have to show it.\" CODA (Child of Deaf Adults) is a fitting tribute to this adage & epitomizes hope and kindness with utter pure heart and soul.As you start watching, being a silent film for majority of its part, it makes you anxious about the fact that there are going to be no subtitles or dialogues to help you navigate here. But pretty soon as you go deeper into the sea of emotions, you are struck by the presence of the most powerful language in the world. Love.Sprinkle it with a sumptuous mix of soothing music and all you are left with is an experience worth remembering. A heart warming glimpse into two different worlds separated by sound but connected with love.CODA is easily one of the best films of the year so far. A great blend of ambition and sacrifice, it makes you believe that there is always light at the end of the tunnel. All you need to do is to stop cribbing and channelize your energy in the right direction.",

Also, above all, i want to praise brilliant chemistry between these 2 actors, because i was totally doubting, while i was watching the movie, that they might actually be real life father-daughter.I'm a little bit confused why is there no comedy genre tag, neither here nor on IMDB, because this movie has plenty of comedy moments, and all of the jokes land.Now, i was thinking to myself: ''Yeah, i enjoyed this movie so much, but should i really give it 5/5 stars, because at the end of the day it's nothing groundbreaking or innovational?'' And the answer is, as you saw already, ABSOLUTELY YES!CODA is touching and heartfelt drama about life struggles of a family.

Yes, even today's modern stories can be metaphorical. Here's the proof. Not a regular coming of age story but a film with right emotions and sensitive conflicts. The reason to call 'The New Star Is Born' is nothing logical. It just 'came out'. It took me back to those days when musicals had heart at the right place unlike today's mediocre works that are being loved undeservingly. As a CODA (Child of Deaf Adults) Ruby is the only hearing person in her deaf family. When the family's fishing business is threatened, Ruby finds herself torn between pursuing her love of music by wanting to go to Berklee College of Music and her fear of abandoning her parents. So many metaphors in such a short time, I wonder how they managed it. This film is full of metaphors, you just have to keep your eyes and brain open for that, and yes more than ears. The girl is screwed up, not even that, I felt like she's tossed up in the air and is unable to decide which side to fall on. The mother confesses that she wished that her daughter should be deaf like her so that they won't have differences. The father, he's such a freak, such a blast of a person but does understand the right thing. The brother, though damn regular, is quite a sensible man who wishes his sister to go away- only for her best. The entire family is so freaking hilarious, vulgarly funny, sometimes messy but as a whole- a lovable affair. That last scene when the girl tells her mom, let's not make this a thing and then she herself comes back to make a scene. You know what, that's how a family should be. I found so many metaphors throughout the film but i think it missed that in the climax. Though it was sensible and realistic, I think it could have been better. Overall, a nice break from regular musicals and family dramas and please find your different metaphors on your own.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",

It is fascinating what effect facial expressions and gestures alone can have. Through sign language, you don't understand what exactly is being discussed, but you do understand in which direction a dialogue is developing, which feelings are being triggered and what the context is.The frame story is basically run-of-the-mill, but that's not the point here. It's more about the interpersonal relationships and the tensions within the family. In addition, it is impressively shown what it means to be deaf and with what difficulties one is confronted.The acting performance of Emilia Jones also deserves special mention. She was really good and I found it impressive how authentic her use of sign language was. I totally bought her role.It's really refreshing that there are movies like 'CODA'.

And though I have issues with the formulaic nature of its plot and the lack of surprise (except for how emotional I got at the end) I am putting down my critic's club and focusing on all that's great about this sweetest film of the year.I'm a cynic with a heart of mush. All it takes to successfully manipulate me into a vulnerable state are good intentions mixed with truth; unexpected kindness; valiancy and the possibility of redemption. Great acting also helps. And a beautiful girl with a beautiful voice singing a Joni Mitchell classic. (If for no other reason than that it sends a bunch of young folks on a journey to discover our greatest living songwriter, CODA deserves its position on Oscar's Best Picture list).Plus, I love a movie that shows people over fifty being sexually active. Even when (as here) it's primarily played for laughs. Marlee Marlin and Troy Kotsur make for a sexy, goofy couple. And I didn't mind their mutual carnality, even when engaging in some afternoon delight that can be heard through the walls of their bedroom, much to the horror of their 'at the end of her rope' daughter Ruby, (a sweet-natured Emilia Jones).The story of conflict between artistic pursuit and familial responsibility is well trod. But the fact that Ruby is the only hearing member of her family - and that she is a singer (therefore her art will never be enjoyed fully by the people she most wants to share it with) - lifts CODA from the mundane and sends it into a kind of metaphoric Valhalla. And though I may have seen the ending coming from a mile away, I sure didn't see how strongly I would be effected by it.Sometimes Bennett falls asleep on my arm and drools all over my hand- Sometimes when I'm smooching his tummy I get overwhelmed and cry all over his fur. It's good to feel things. This movie is an unapologetic weeper. I have no shame for shutting down my critical eye and being utterly ensnared.",

When I read this title, I thought I would be watching a sad movie similar to Sound of Metal; instead, it turned out to be a feel good film closer to Little Miss Sunshine. On the surface, it might seem like CODA is a coming of age story with the tropes that many of us have seen before. What makes it different though, is the entire deaf aspect and the nuanced way in which the narrative is crafted around it while offering opportunity for both sadness and good natured laughter. Yes laughter! The first half of the film is pure comedy and you wont believe how funny it is unless you see it.CODA is about a young girl Ruby and her deaf family. Being the only hearing person, she has spent her entire life as an interpreter for her mother, father and brother who make their livelihood through fishing. One day, Ruby signs up for choir and her teacher notices that she is highly talented and might have an opportunity to go to a prestigious college. It might seem like good news but in reality, they make Ruby feel torn between chasing a dream and fulfilling the immense responsibility for her family who rely on her for every little thing.If you are someone who is familiar with putting family first, you will find this story even more enjoyable. I did notice occasional cliches but I wasn't bothered by them because of how humane and pleasant the entire experience felt. Emilia Jones manages to brilliantly portray Ruby's struggle who can't imagine existing without her family and yet, can't stop dreaming of bigger things. There are plenty of moments to bring a smile to your face and quite a few that might bring a tear to your eye. I feel this touching story is perfect to watch on a summer day and I can't overemphasize how much I enjoyed it.P. S.

But you could feel the creaky gears of conventionality starting up in the plot somehow; you know where it's headed, and the final scenes are closer to a made-for-video Disney flick than the genuine inspiration we got from the movie's first act.There is also a subplot about the protagonist's family's fishing business that didn't seem to be resolved.

I've seen plenty of films that have deaf characters but I've never seen something that dives into that life the way this film did. We get to see all of the complications that come with being deaf and it really opens your eyes and makes you think about what it would be like.Emilia Jones plays the lead character Ruby Rossi and does an amazing job. You become extremely invested in this character fairly early on so throughout the entire film you are rooting for her and you feel the emotions she feels when dealing with her parents that can't really understand her passion for music.On the other side of this film we see her family who are trying as hard as they can to live a comfortable life. Troy Kostar is phenomenal in his role. His ability to act and display emotion without speaking is something I've never seen before. Daniel Durant and Marlee Martin are both amazing butt Troy is the stand out for me.This was also extremely funny in my opinion. There are moments that are fairly cheesy but overall they did a great job of making this film not only compelling and emotionally gripping but also entertaining.Overall CODA is an amazing film.

            "content": "Every once in a while, a movie comes along that's surprisingly unique. Like, you would have thought such a plot would have existed a dozen times already, but Hollywood has only remade it once from a version that was initially in French. CODA (2021) is such a film. Sure, it has elements that are common to other dramatic films-like fishers, singers, and family dynamics. The combination of these things makes CODA stand out as unique to me. Not only does its double-meaning title elevate it above other movies, but its heartfelt content is something we need more of in this depressing world.CODA's take on the \"my family doesn't understand my talent and is holding me back\" cliche hits differently in this scenario. It's not that Ruby (Emilia Jones) has a family that ignores her obvious talent for singing, it's that they literally cannot understand how much better she is at singing than the average person. Since she is the only one in their family fishing boat who can communicate with others at the docks, they have placed an over-reliance on her ability, which traps her in the tough position of supporting her family versus pursuing her talent.With so many movies focusing on broken families and people, CODA is a refreshing change of pace. Even with everyone else being deaf, Ruby loves her family, and they all love each other. Their struggle is not within their disability, but against the systems that attempt to hold them back. There's deep emotion in having to choose between your family and your obvious talent, and CODA does this incredibly well by pushing Ruby to make this choice at every twist and turn of the plot. Funny, charming, emotional, and wholesome, CODA is an instant classic.A fantastic and unique take on the \"talented family member\" trope, I give CODA 5.0 stars out of 5.",

This movie was based on the movie La Famille B\u00e9lier directed by \u00c9ric Lartigau and written by Stanislas Carr\u00e9 de Malberg and \u00c9ric Lartigau. This movie is about a girl called Ruby Rossi who has a talent for singing and she is the only hearing person in her deaf family. In her family are dad, mother and brother. All her family except her are fishermen and this is only their source of money. During the movie she needs to decide if she will go to the school in Boston called Berkley or if she will stay fishing with her family in her hometown.This movie cannot be described as anything other than a fantastic romantic drama movie which is in some situations funny, emotional and it arouses emotions in you too. Actors who have learned sign language were amazing and it looks like they have experience with that. Actors were wisely chosen and the roles were written for them. If I pass a few scenes where I think could have been better camera placement I think that the director of photography Paula Huidobro did as alway a very good job. I'm surprised that this movie does not have a romance genre because the romantic part was made very well. Even if you think that the movie is predictable, it pleasantly misleads you. The music is so perfect that I think better music for this movie could not be.This movie was very remarkable and unique in its style as well as the story. Conclusively I recommend this movie and I think that we will not see such a very good musical, romance and drama movie in one for a long time.8/10 stars\n80%",

            "review_title": "A funny, often touching story of a young lady, her future ambitions, and her tight-knit family",
            "content": "\"CODA\" is a comedy-drama based on the 2014 French film \"La famille B\u00e9lier\". Directed by Sian Heder and starring Emilia Jones, Troy Kotsur, and Marlee Matlin, it is a funny, often touching story of a young lady, her future ambitions, and her tight-knit family.In Massachusetts, high school student Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones) helps out with her family's fishing business, planning to work for them full-time after graduation. Since Ruby is a \"CODA\" (Child Of Deaf Adults), she is required to assist her father Frank (Troy Kotsur), mother Jackie (Marlee Matlin), and older brother Leo (Daniel Durant), all three of whom are deaf, with anything important, communicating and translating for them in American Sign Language. As she approaches the end of her school life, Ruby decides to follow her passion for singing and so signs up for a choir class. Ruby's teacher Mr. Villalobos (Eugenio Derbez) sees potential in her but she soon discovers the difficulty in finding time to practice for an upcoming recital while her family is struggling to make ends meet without her.As I stated in my review for \"Sound Of Metal\", it is easy to take for granted something like our sense of hearing, considering how simple it is to listen in on our surroundings without a second thought. That movie helped open my eyes to how appreciative we should be to have that sense at our leisure when there are many out there who aren't so lucky. A similar thing happens here with the film \"CODA\", in that it makes you fully aware of how hard it must be to live with others who have this handicap, especially when the people in question are your own close family members.What could have been another generic coming-of-age story is instead a rather heartfelt tale of a young girl finding ways to create balance in her life. Ruby is shown to be someone who is constantly fighting an uphill battle being the only person in her family who can hear, necessitating her involvement in their fishing business, all while contemplating whether or not this is the future she really wants. On top of that, she is also an outcast at school where the other students tease her for being that weird girl who smells like fish and has a family who cannot communicate verbally like everyone else. Despite these issues, Ruby still loves her family unconditionally but it presents a serious dilemma for her, as she must decide between achieving her dream of becoming a singer or staying behind to help with the business. It is this ultimatum that provides an excellent driving force for the film's plot since it is made clear from the beginning that things could go either way.In addition to \"Sound of Metal\", another film this one reminded me of was 1993's \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\". Both feature a young protagonist living in a small town who is busy tending to the needs of their unusual family while longing for a better life out in the real world. But most importantly, the two films each did a great job of humanising its characters with irregularities without reducing them to that of a circus freak show. In spite of their deafness, Ruby's parents are depicted as a loving couple that have had an enduring marriage throughout all of their hardships. Sure, they may not be able to hear anything and argue using only sign language, but their impassioned love for each other and their two children makes them seem like a more realistic husband and wife team than most others I've seen on screen.Although the film is primarily dramatic in tone, it isn't afraid to shy away from being comedic when necessary. I was surprised at how often I was laughing at some of the strange situations that occurred throughout the story. Many of these moments involved Ruby's family, mostly from her father Frank's misunderstanding of others trying to interpret his sign language. Ruby acts as the primary translator for her family and this means she often bares the brunt of others shooting the messenger even though she is only trying to help. Thankfully, whenever something funny occurred involving one of the deaf characters, it never felt like we were laughing at them but instead at the circumstances that led to this awkwardness in the first place.Also worth mentioning is that the film makes good use of its setting. Like \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\", the small town where the film takes place uses a limited amount of locations like the family home, school classrooms, or a teacher's house. The only time the film feels more open is when we see the Rossi family sailing on their fishing boat with the wide ocean symbolising the outside world Ruby longs to see for herself. This use of smaller settings made the film seem like a low budget indie picture. I could easily imagine this being released in the early-to-mid 2000s, since that was the peak era of popularity for these types of films.Unfortunately, what tarnishes the film's small town charm is the overabundance of Apple product placement. As this film is an Apple TV+ exclusive, some parts feature inconveniently placed shots of characters using iPhones and MacBooks with particular emphasis on the Apple logo shoehorned into certain scenes. Though they aren't too frequent, these scenes did bother me as it makes the film seem more corporate than it should be. Normally, a character using commercial products in a film doesn't bother me, but this time it felt as though the filmmakers were going out of their way to make a point that every electronic product being used by someone was made by Apple.Each member of the cast played their roles perfectly, with Emilia Jones providing the heart and soul of the film as Ruby. Jones seamlessly fits in with her onscreen family, whose actors are actually deaf in real life, so much so that you really get the feeling that they are related. Reportedly, Jones also learned American Sign Language over the course of nine months in order to effectively communicate with them, using both her hand gestures and her speaking voice. It goes to show that the art of acting goes beyond simply memorising lines from a script and that body language also plays a key part in giving a convincing performance.Many of the film's warmest moments were thanks to the duel performances of both Troy Kotsur and Marlee Matlin as Frank and Jackie. There are some genuinely poignant moments involving their interactions with Ruby. One scene with Frank involved him cracking a \"dad joke\" to her at the dinner table in typical eye-rolling fashion, but what made it so nice to watch was how he does it all through sign language. This is to remind us that even though he can't speak to her through conventional means, he is still her father and wants her to know he loves her anyway. Another scene involved Jackie talking with Ruby about her birth and the importance of that day. Without going into too much detail, this was one of the most affecting scenes in the movie that further establishes them all as a close family. Although their scenes were brief, I also liked the sibling rivalry between Ruby and Leo. Even though Leo is the older of the two, he comes across as less mature due to his hearing difficulties affecting his self-confidence. From time to time, Ruby finds herself clashing with him over the smallest of things, and this provided some interesting bonus conflict that made the story more investing than it already is.Much like \"Sound of Metal\" before it, \"CODA\" has successfully demonstrated to its audience the difficulties that arise from living without one of your primary senses. This time, however, from a familial third person perspective rather than through the actual protagonist itself. Not only that, but it has done so in a respectable manner that never mocks its subjects or uses them for cheap entertainment. There's so much to enjoy in watching this family that don't let their physical impairments tear them apart and actually try to work through any problems constructively. It's rare to see this in films nowadays so such integrity cannot be overstated.I rate it a solid 9/10.",

I especially do not like subtitles. Still, I felt drawn to this story when reading its description. Its fresh. Different.It didn't disappoint! Right from the start, Ruby's (Emilia) soulful voice grabs you and doesn't let you leave the room for a popcorn run. To think she took singing lessons (in addition to the sign-language and fishing lessons), and was able to perform like that made me believe that... maybe I could sing if I took lessons? Nahh... they probably don't have supernatural abilities.There was a scene with Ruby and her brother Leo (Daniel Durant) that I thought was amazing. The emotion. The pain, frustration and ... conflict of loving the person who is the antagonist to your position in the family was palpable. Well done Daniel!I am familiar with some of Marlee Matlin's (the Mom) work. Not much but I know she's done well with her career, but I didn't like her character in this film. They do some work to try to endear her character to the audience but it wasn't enough for me. At one point her character tried to convey a sense of the empty nester parent that I felt came across as self-centered and uncaring. I just couldn't with her after that. Maybe that's what they were going for.Troy (the Dad) was great also and offered up a welcome comedic relief and not in the form of some one-line chucklers but actually roared laugh that I am sure my neighbors heard.They could have developed the love interest a bit more. It felt thrown in at the last minute. I understand the movie was about the family and the dynamic of being a CODA. But then what value did the romance with Miles add to it. It felt like one of those unwritten rules where every movie has to end with the boy getting the girl (in this case vice versa).Still, this was all around a great movie!! The best I've seen in a long time. I'd pay to see this twice in a theater!!",

So deaf people could enjoy them too\"Sian Heder's \"CODA\" is a modest, heartwarming coming of age tale that not only embodies a youngster's fascination for Music but also sheds some light on the community of deaf people in the most truthful way possible. By signing three real-world deaf performers, they made their intentions quite clear, they weren't here to mess around, they were aiming for perfection, and as much authenticity as feasible. And guess what? The entire ensemble poured their hearts out in here.Despite all the familiar tropes laying around and the narrative being pretty much on the predictable side; I did like their approach. They kept it relatively simple (Yet effective) with just the right proportion of light humour. Needless to say, the narration is very much to the point and strives to serve a particular purpose here, which is to speak on behalf of the deaf community and its people.While I do agree the film is entitled to all the love and appreciation coming on its way but to present them with the \"Best Picture\" award at the Oscars, is a decision that I'm still finding tough to comprehend. I mean, come on! Weren't there much better options to give this award to?Pardon me for the unwarranted cynicism here, but I had to get that off my chest. Ever since I have been made aware of the winners, it has been pretty difficult for me to accept the result.Don't get me wrong, I'm delighted for the deaf community, my heart goes to the deaf people who have always wanted to be an integral part of society, and their part of the stories need to come out in the open as well. And now it seems their prayers are finally being listened to and that too on a universal scale.",

Marlee Matlin was there too rooting him on and I remember watching her win the Oscar for Best Actress back in the 1980s for Children Of A Lesser God. Back then and now, it elated me seeing those with hearing impairment given a chance to shine and prove their talents in the film industry. That's when I knew I had to check CODA out.After viewing it this afternoon, it did indeed live up to its expectations. It's an extremely touching story of a teenage girl with no hearing problems who acts as the anchor to her deaf parents and brother. She's always been the translator to them to communicate with the hearing world, but when she lands a crush on a boy at school and ultimately learns her singing talent, she comes to realize she needs to follow her own interests and dreams.That's where the problems begin. She gets torn between the dependency her deaf family has on her to what she really wants to eventually do in life. It's subject matter that's handled remarkably well and heightened by superb performances by the whole cast. It can be deeply hilarious and also deeply touching at the same time. It also brought a better understanding to what those with hearing impairment go through and their troubles in communicating with the hearing world.I only recall meeting a few deaf people in my life, but the one I never forgot was a dishwasher at a local diner in my home town. When I got hired there to be a dishwasher too, he was excellent in his silent communication on teaching me what to do. I didn't know sign language, but he broke that barrier by constantly pointing, nodding and shaking his head and showing me examples on how to do things on the job. I had no trouble understanding him at all and was deeply impressed by how well he could communicate without words.He didn't need any hearing family or friends available to be translators to what he had to say. He handled himself extremely well and I never forgot that. That experience and this movie did indeed provoke my interest in learning Sign Language. From what I've seen in this film, it is indeed an expressive way to communicate, especially when we are taught the \"dirty words\" and hilarious exchanges it can bring.So, hats off to Troy Kotsur, Marlee Matlin and especially Emilia Jones for their excellent performances in this coming of age film. Emilia especially shines with her excellent singing voice and the ability to confidently be the translator for her family while also juggling her schooling and fishing duties at the same time.I love this movie. I consider it one of the best recent films I ever saw and highly recommend it. It's not only great entertainment, but a learning experience as well. Nothing can ever match what this film has to offer. It's a true gem.",

When she discovers a passion for singing, Ruby must choose between family fishing business obligations and her dreams to pursue music. After the film won the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award winner at the Sundance Film Festival, Apple bought the distribution rights to it for $25 million, the largest sum at the time.CODA stands for \"Child of Deaf Adults\". The film is written and directed by Sian Heder. It has nothing to do with the 2020 movie also called Coda. This is an English-language remake of the 2014 French-language film called The Belier Family / La Famille B\u00e9lier - English Subtitles. It was filmed in Gloucester, Massachusetts.THINGS I LIKED:\nEmilia Jones is a revelation. She acts, signs, and sings beautifully.Eugenio Derbez plays the passionate choir director. He's hilarious in everything he does, but he also shows a dramatic flair in his role since the film is more serious than a true comedy.I remember when Marlee Matlin first took Hollywood by storm when she won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in Children of a Lesser God, the only deaf actress to win the award. She has been deaf since she was a little girl.Actors Troy Kotsur and Daniel Durant are both deaf in real life.It's really powerful when you can't hear any sound and you get to experience what it might be like to be deaf. One of my nieces married a deaf man. Many members of my extended family, including myself, have been trying to learn sign language.There are some truly touching moments that made my eyes fill with tears several times. Very sweet.I like the title because it instantly intrigues you and you want to know what it's all about.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nThe story is sweet and touching and yet there is a lot of crude content that makes it inappropriate for family viewing, which is such a shame because there are some really great messages in the movie.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nProfanity - both spoken verbally and in sign language\nTeenage girls talk about hooking up with guys.Adults talk about jock itch\nYou see a married couple doing it in bed (with clothes on)\nThe dad smokes marijuana.Men drink alcohol in a bar and get in a brawl.An underage teenager works as a bartender and explains that she can because none of the men there know how to count to 21.A lot of crude conversations and gestures.There's a lot of sign language spoken, obviously, so you have to read a lot of subtitles.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",

The biggest criticism of this sincere, coming-of-age family drama is that the film's trajectory is easy to figure out early on, but that aside the journey is still a believable one, the emotional aspects are in check, and there's a terrific collection of actors in the cast led by Emilia Jones who's totally convincing, and a surprising amount of colorful humor courtesy of real-life deaf actor Troy Kotsur. ***",

Depicting complex deaf characters with legitimately deaf actors, CODA deserves recognition. Plus, the story has real obstacles, effective arcs, and touching conversations. Its convenient conclusion slightly undermines its conflicts, but the catharsis still feels earned. Ultimately, CODA displays atypical life in a world built for typical abilities, a poignant message. Furthermore, the acting elevates the material. Jones is wholly relatable, Derbez is eccentrically heartfelt, and Matlin, Kotsur, and Durant communicate various waves of nonverbal emotion. Thus, the script's shortcomings are outweighed by its dramatic impact.Meanwhile, CODA's filmmaking is above average. The cinematography uses attractive framing to convey significance, the editing utilizes intercutting during the climax, and the production design sets a humble tone. The soundtrack is an integral part of the narrative, heightening emotions and creating a nostalgic mood. Also, the sound design uses symbolic silence to show how deaf people can feel disconnected from the hearing community. Therefore, CODA might not be a technical masterclass, but it remains powerful for its meaningful use of relevant mediums. It isn't a perfect film, but CODA is clearly a valuable experience.Writing: 8/10\nDirection: 8/10\nCinematography: 7/10\nActing: 9/10\nEditing: 7/10\nSound: 9/10\nScore/Soundtrack: 9/10\nProduction Design: 7/10\nCasting: 9/10\nEffects: 6/10Overall Score: 7.9/10.",

            "content": "Ruby (Emilia Jones) is a high school senior living is the seaport town of Glouscester, just north of Boston. In addition to all the usual awkward teenager issues of her studies, boys and mean girls, Ruby has to get up at 3 am every day to help with her family fishing business. Oh, and her parents (Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur) and brother (Daniel Durant) are deaf (the entire movie is subtitled and close captioned).Writer-Director Sian Heder (adapting a French film, La Famille Belier) centers her movie on Ruby as a way for the audience to understand the family's dynamics. Her script also uses the Massachusetts setting to give it it's own specific feel and atmosphere and not feel like a rote remake. Heder is also smart in never trying to artificially present the clan as a \"normal family\", while always maintaining a sympathetic eye and ear towards them.Ruby has never been \"good at school\", but she shows some talent as a singer when she joins the school choir on whim. Eugenio Derbez plays her colorful music teacher (we first see him in an ascot) who encourages her talent. Derbez performance shows warmth and wit, and is able to escape caricature. Less successful is the humor which is often forced and too overly broadly played. Sure, it's, I suppose, comforting to know that deaf families can be just as wacky as any other brood, but, tonally, it doesn't quite blend with the pathos.Jones gives a sweetly determined performance that carries the movie over it's bumps and occasionally too conventional plotting. It's a strong performance that lifts not only the movie, but the other performances as well. Jones stands out, but, it's never showy. A young actress to keep an eye on.CODA, the winner of Sundance's top award (which lead to Apple paying $25M for its rights), occasionally falls into the trap of seeming to check off the usual Festival Award Winner attributes (why do all young persons seem to be involved in Music and the Arts?), but, fortunately, Jones and and the movie's uplift make it a worthwhile journey.",

            "content": "\"CODA,\" a new film coming to theaters and streaming on AppleTV+ on August 13 was a delightful and inspirational movie about what it is like to be a CODA, Child of Deaf Adults.Ruby Rossi is just a normal teenage girl who loves to sing, and her family is anything but normal. As the youngest child of deaf adults, Ruby takes on many roles that many other children don't need to worry about. Her father and older brother are fishermen in Gloucester, Massachusetts. She joins them every morning before the sun rises and before school starts out on the water as a deck hand, and the only one who can listen for distress calls from the Coast Guard or warnings from the National Weather Service. When they bring in the catch, she helps negotiate a price for the fish they catch, making sure they aren't getting ripped off compared to other fishermen.From the docks she goes to school with other kids who don't know what it's like being the daughter of deaf parents. She lives in a world that she feels she doesn't belong, but in her senior year, Ruby decides to do something for herself for once. She auditions for the high school choir.Besides bringing awareness of what it might be like for deaf people around us, the film explores the interesting dynamics between the world of hearers and the deaf community. The film also delves into how the deaf parents might feel if a child wanted to do something that they couldn't enjoy or appreciate due to their deafness.The film is as much about pursuing a dream and gaining independence, as it is about inter-dependence in a family and supporting one another. There are so many powerful moments throughout the film as Ruby explores what it means to be independent as well as what it means to be a CODA. It is a human story about connection and love and being there for one another no matter what. It is also a story about letting go and releasing someone you love to live life to the fullest.I really loved this film and the story that it told. I feel like I gained new empathy and understanding for deaf people in my community. The film is funny and sweet, but also inspirational.\"CODA\" was written and directed by Si\u00e2n Heder. The film stars Emilia Jones as Ruby Rossi, Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur as Jackie and Frank Rossi, Daniel Durant as Leo Rossi, and Eugenio Derbez as Ruby's music teacher, Mr. Villalobos among others.",

I watched in Japanese dub & English dub.CODA is such a great story that i have many thoughts after watching. Ruby, the 17 yrs little girl was actually not confident with her voice don't believe she can sing, being born in the deaf family. When the little girl was lack of confident on her accent, it's the Latin Spanish accent singing techer Mr. V helped her on her self-confidence. It's not in the story but i could imagine from the line, the techer had a tough life and that was similar with what Ruby has gone throught.It's not a genios girl AGT kind of heart moving emotion, it's towards a little non confident YOU find your little confidence that you believe in yourself that you want to move on, in a little desperated world and push back from your surrounding.Although i know nothing about the deaf community, the little girl challenge is just a mirror of many of our day to day challenge.If you watched the movie, the highlight is at 1h26m. That open you eyes to the other side of the story. And i fully understand why i felt awkward few minutes earlier. And that also drove me to tear towards end of the movie.This movie is a good entertainment, encouraging story, a little touching and eyes opening. I now can look at lifes from both side now.",

It is many of those things; it is also often genuinely funny and insightful. A film that breaks this many barriers and thus holds the level of significance it does should probably be a bit more than that, however. That most of the narrative beats of the film are entirely predictable is a shame, but it's also true that several good performances do elevate it to a degree. A brilliant use of sound dropping away in a music performance scene gives to hearing audience members the most profound moment of empathy in the film; there are other moments, and sequences that hit home in their own way. Emilia Jones' singing voice is something special too, it's not hard to see her career taking a distinctly musical direction from here on out. Ultimately it has more to recommend it than other similar films, and its heart is undoubtedly in a good place. But it also could, and perhaps should, have been more too.",

This is a coming of age film unlike any other one I have seen, it's very original and brings an awareness to a disability that is often underrepresented in movies. I have not seen the original, but the fact that they used actual deaf actors is a huge bonus for me. They really knocked it out in their performances.

A film does not have to be original or cutting edge to be great. This is a homespun take on devotion to family and reaching for the stars. It's an old-fashioned story but there's nothing dated about its heart or integrity.Ruby, the only family member of the Rossi family who is not deaf, is a teenager, portrayed by an impressive Emilia Jones. This young woman finds her passion in singing and music, which seems odd coming from a family living in silence. We accompany this young woman balancing between supporting her family and their business on the one side and following her dreams on the other.Seeing a loving and caring family struggling in a world of the hearing is extremely touching, and this movie is really authentic as all deaf family members are portrayed by deaf actors, Marlee Matlin as the mother Jackie, Troy Kotsur as the father Frank and Daniel Durant as the older brother Leo of the Rossi family. The amazing and brilliant Eugenio Derbez as music teacher Bernardo Villalobos is fun to watch and has an incredible impact on Ruby to follow her passion. Jones' powerful singing voice and subtly fierce screen presence makes her an up-and-comer to watch.This movie is a must see for everyone - it's full of life, love, passion and giving an insight into a world which usually is out of our focus.",

And like Billy Elliot, it has enough humor and authenticity about the community it portrays to make its classic story arc feel satisfying and fresh.It's an emotional button-pusher, but the characters felt original and the specifics of the family dynamics were drawn beautifully, including the older brother character who got frustrated by his younger sister's role as \"martyr\" to the family.

It turns out she has a real voice; choir master Eugenio Derbez tells her she can win a scholarship to Berklee in mythical Boston. Can she convince her family to believe in her dream when they can't even hear her, or will her duty to them overwhelm her ambitions?In other words, it's RATATOUILLE for tweens, with another message that \"Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist can come from anywhere\", albeit with more songs. It's decently written, pleasantly shot, well acted, and has enough raunchy jokes for adults not to be ashamed to have seen it. It is, in short, the sort of well made small movie that wins outsized applause because it shows that, like JOHNNY BELINDA, the deaf are just like you and me, except they have more sex. It's a nice little middle-brow movie of the sort that used to win the Oscar every three or four years, with a very affecting version of \"Both Sides Now.\" A very nice way to spend a couple of hours.",

It is possible -and would have been a far more interesting movie - to make a comedy and yet show what being deaf means and its challenges.Departing from an interesting premise - a deaf family and their communication difficulties with the hearing ones -the film fails into a parody instead.Being this one of main flaws of the film it is either unbelievable -and somehow insulting- that any of the family members lack the ability to communicate with hearing people. A nice improvement from the French version was changing the brother role from being unsubstantial one to a more mature one (the brother-sister discussion about him being able to do her interpreter work is a point that should have been deeply developed).Several other things seem to be out of place (deaf father driving? -maybe in the USA)\nThe ending scene with daughter singing in front of their parents using hand sign language while she sings so her family can understand what she is singing about sure is a nice one -by the way, the original lyrics in the French version were changed since they were not about leaving home for good but a farewell note from a kid who is going to commit suicide) but I rather much prefer the scene where she is singing at the school festival and her family has gone to watch to her.All of a sudden sound is off and we can have a terrifying glimpse of what being deaf really mean. To hear no sound. Any sound. Only watch her moving her lips. In the end other people applause. No sound at all. That IS what really means being deaf. That was for me the best and most emotional scene of the movie. Really goose feather.",

However, CODA uses this formula perfectly - the film is emotionally moving in the right way and at the right moments, the humour is great, the characters are all likable, the cast does a great job, led by the excellent Emilia Jones, whose performance of 'Both Sides Now pleasantly surprised me.So allthough I'm not blown away overall by CODA, it definitely deserves higher rating.",

At times, I take a break and come back to it (figuring I might not have been in the right mood for the film) but in other times, I fight through whatever emotion I am feeling (most of the time boredom) to keep focused on what the filmmakers are attempting to do in their film - and, at times, I am rewarded for this perseverance.Such is the case with the Oscar Nominated film CODA. Written and Directed by Sian Heder (who was Oscar Nominated for her Screenplay), CODA tells the tale of Ruby who is a CODA (Child of Deaf Adults), who runs afoul of her family (especially her parents) and their expectations of her.For the first half of this film it is pretty standard fare - one that has been shown on many, many movie screens throughout the years. Even though this one had the added \"plot twist\" of Ruby being able to hear while her Parents and Brothers are all deaf, the first half of this film never rose above the ordinary.But, something happened in the 2nd half of the film, I fell in love with this family and their foibles and was rooting for them all to resolve their issues and for Ruby to get what she wanted.Credit for this must go to Writer/Director Heder, who is not deaf, who came up with the idea/concept for the film and then felt a strong obligation to \"get it right\" for the deaf community. And get it right she does.Her first good move was to cast Oscar Winner Marlee Matlin, a well known deaf performer and advocate for the Deaf Community. She brought instant credibility and star power to this film and she also insisted that the other 2 deaf characters in this film be performed by deaf performers.Troy Kotsur is Oscar Nominated as Best Supporting Actor for his turn as Ruby's father and he, for the first 1/2 of this film, acts in black and white - either funny (the comic relief) or angry (the drama) and I was unimpressed by him, but - just like the film - his performance gains some nuance in the 2nd half and he does have the \"Oscar Moment\" in this part of the movie that makes him a deserving nominee.Emilia Jones is \"just fine\" in the lead role of Ruby and Daniel Durant (the other deaf actor in this film who plays her brother) and Lonnie Farmer (who plays her teacher) are also \"fine\". Thank goodness we had the star wattage of Matlin to elevate the first half of the film before things got interesting - and nuanced - in the 2nd half.Kudos to CODA for shining a light on a group that does not normally get the light shone upon it and kudos to the Academy for nominating this Sundance darling in the Best Picture category.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

            "review_title": "Coda (2021, Sian Heder) Heartfelt film that evokes all the feels and while not dramatically weighty does not feel lessened by it",
            "content": "'Coda' is an English language remake of the 2014 Belgian film 'La Familie Belier'. It stars Emilia Jones and, as the title indicates, she is the child of deaf adults although taking it one step further, in her family of four, she is the only hearing person as her older brother is also deaf. This is a coming-of-age drama/comedy directed by Sian Heder who's only other directorial achievement of note is 2015's 'Tallulah'. After 'Coda' debuted at Sundance the rights were purchased by Apple for $25 million. At the 94th Academy Awards 'Coda' was nominated for three awards and it won all three for Best Picture, Adapted Screenplay and Troy Kotsur won for Best Supporting Actor.In Gloucester, MA we are introduced to family of fishermen including teenage daughter Ruby Rossi. The distinction of this family that drives the entire plot is that the parents played by Troy Kotsur and Marlee Matlin as well as older brother Leo, played by Daniel Durant, are all deaf leaving Ruby as the sole hearing member of the family. Not only is she trying to navigate her tumultuous teenage years at her local high school she is also integral to the family's business as she does all the interpreting for the family when they have to interact with hearing folks which is essentially all the time. At the outset there is a feeling that the family is somewhat of an outcast clan due to their inability or unwillingness to communicate with the rest of their community. This ostracizing extends to Ruby who is chided at school not only because of her deaf family, but also because she is from a fishing family. Chasing a boy she signs up for choir, and we find out, despite some nerves, she is an amazing singer and at the behest of a fabulous teacher, played wonderfully by Eugenio Derbez, she begins to work toward a path of higher education in music. This causes a rift in the family as they do not understand her love of music thinking it might be just adolescent rebellion, but also without her they would lose their prime conduit to interact with the world at large. Things become amplified as issues occur with the business of fishing and regulations for the family which greatly effects Ruby's decision making process. There is also a young love story which is sweet, but not very dynamic as far as the story goes. 'Coda' goes the route of feel good movie and in the end many of the storylines are progressed to a satisfactory point looking forward toward a hopeful future for Ruby and the family in general.'Coda' was a bit of an upset win for Best Picture. By far the best reviewed film and the frontrunner was 'The Power of the Dog' which is a far more hefty, dramatic film with darker themes. 'Coda' is in the same realm as 'Green Book' in the pantheon of Best Picture winners. It does have some heavier themes, but it puts a positive, hopeful spin on all of its messaging. With a society still crawling up out of a pandemic quagmire perhaps the general feeling is that rewarding a film that is of a very high quality, but leaves you with good vibes and good feelings is more attractive than awarding a better film that is heavier and darker in its themes. To be clear I liked 'Coda' quite a lot and in fact out of the collection of Best Picture nominees it is second only to 'The Power of the Dog', but it certainly is not without its narrative flaws. There are story issues regarding the family's functioning and the fishing business operation at the end that aren't really resolved. It is more like everyone hugs at the end and lives happily ever after. It is not quite that idyllic but it is not far off, and while those positive sentiments are laudable they are not that realistic. You can have the happy endings, but in this instance I wish they would have done more to explain the nuts and bolts of their happy ending rather than just sort of saying it is a happy ending. To film's credit this is the movie that made me feel the most while watching it this year. It gives you such a rush of emotion that is commendable and hard to ignore, and it is that evocation that really sets this film above more standard fare telling similarly feel good stories.Eric's Grade: B+",

Right from the beginning the movie sells out a charm that you can't ignore for even one minute. With enough charm the movie also sells out elements that flow in such a way that you instantly get connected with it. Director and screenplay writer Sian Heder has done a wonderful and sweet job with the presentation. The film itself is quite predictable at many points and the pattern of story feels like it has many predecessors but in the end nothing matters cause the presentation makes up for everything. Every single actor in the movie has given everything that they could to their performance and thanks to that, we can connect to every aspect of the story and that makes it feels relatable. Overall it's a film you would definitely wanna watch on your day off and you would also like to re-watch it many times because of it's glorious presentation.",

That being said, after all I read about it, I was pretty worried it would not live up to the hype. However, I must say that this movie hits all the right boxes - it had humor, it had heart, it had wonderful, well-drawn out characters who were flawed but redeemable, and it presented real-life dilemmas that I think could be true of any family, not just families with deaf or hard-of-hearing people with in it. I truly connected with the depiction of life viewed through the eyes of the deaf family members, and my mother (who is hearing) truly connected to the experience of having a family member who is DHH as well as just being a mom who is trying to figure out what is best for her kid, no matter what. The acting was superb, the writing was crisp and clean, the sound mixing was awesome, and honestly ... this is what movies should be. All heart, all human. Very powerful, very well done.",

            "review_title": "A Small film that hits all the right notes",
            "content": "My Review - CODA\nMy Rating 9/10\nThe movie title CODA is an acronym for Child Of Deaf Adults which is the premise for this wonderful \"Indie film \"Independent films are produced by smaller production companies. They do not follow the same formula. As studio films.Instead, they vary in style and genre and usually have a production budget which is a fraction of the studio films in my opinion they often have more to say than many big budget Studio movies .Just imagine living in a family of four and being the only member of that family that can hear. Even in the most loving and supportive family like the Rossi family in \"CODA \" imagine the challenges faced as the daughter who can hear having to put your life aspirations and dreams on hold to take on the role of interpreter for your Mother, Father and Brother because they have no hearing at all.When the family's fishing business is threatened, Ruby finds herself torn between pursuing her love of music and her fear of abandoning her parents.The movie is beautifully set in the seaside locations of Gloucester, Rockport and Boston in Massachusetts\nCODA, premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2021, winning more awards than any film in Sundance history. It captivated audiences and prompted a bidding war between Netflix, Amazon, Searchlight and Apple which concluded in Apple paying a record breaking $25 million for world wide rights to the movie.CODA, written and directed by Sian Heder, is an English-language remake of the French-language film La Famille B\u00e9lier, which was released in 2014 and was successful at the French box office.Philippe Rousselet was one of the original film's producers, and he had the rights to do a remake. He and producer Patrick Wachsberger approached Sian Heder to direct a remake for a United States audience. Sian Heder said, \"They were interested in adapting the film, but they wanted someone to make it unique and take the premise from the original and, also, reinvent it.\"\nWell I haven't seen the La Famille B\u00e9lier yet but Sian Heder (take note Academy) has more than succeeded. Sian is another brilliant female Writer, Producer, Director who previous to CODA wrote and produced a critically acclaimed short film in 2006 \"Mother\" and help write and produce 20 episodes of the hit series \"Orange is the New Black.\"\nThere have been 2 brilliant movies this year concerning the life experiences of characters who are profoundly hearing impaired or totally deaf .One was the superb film \"Sound of Metal\" about a heavy-metal drummer's life that is thrown into freefall when he begins to lose his hearing.CODA is a very different story I gave \"Sound of Metal\" and CODA both a 9/10 Rating because both films have characters that are real, vulnerable and totally convincing . Their life experiences interested me and opened up a world of complex difficulties that I can only imagine because I can hear and take it for granted so authentic movies about people with a disability like deafness or blindness I find fascinating and educational.Both Directors of these films use a clever and dramatic technique for a few minutes that allows the movie audience to do just that.In \"Sound of Metal\" when the drummer Rubin Stone is walking a street for the first time with his Cochlear implants we hear what he hears just distorted loud sounds that are more disturbing than no sound at all.In CODA when Ruby's family attend their daughter Ruby's Concert in which she is performing a duet they can only watch the reactions of the audience to something they cant experience themselves .The soundtrack is silent in part of the song to show their reactions to the movie its one of the many moving scenes in this film . Another for me was when Ruby's Dad Frank asks her to sing for him only and gently touches his daughters threat to feel the vibrations of her beautiful voice.Emilia Jones the talented 19 year old daughter of famous Welsh singer Aled Jones does have a beautiful voice and it's a joy to hear her version of the Joni Mitchell classic song \" Both Sides Now \"\nEmilia Jones impressed me greatly in her role as Ruby Rossi when she filmed CODA she was only 17 or 18 years old .I predict she will become a major Cinema Star in the future she has already been nominated for a BAFTA British Academy Award for her role in the series \"Locke & Key.\" which was filmed for Netflix after CODA it also looks very impressive .For her role in CODA, Emilia had to spend nine months learning American Sign Language, have singing lessons and learn how to operate a professional fishing trawler.All the characters in this movie interested me 1987 Oscar Winner Marlee Matlin is perfect as Jackie Rossi the strong willed but loving matriarch of the family .Marlee Matlin was born deaf as was Troy Kotsur who plays Ruby's craggy weather beaten seafaring but very sensitive and loving Father Frank Rossi.Daniel Durant cast as Ruby's brother was born to deaf parents and went to the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf in Faribault, Minnesota, where he got involved with theater. He's great as the eldest son who feels he's living in the shadow of his talented sister because of his family's dependence on her hearing.Another delightful performance from John Fiore as Tony Salgado the High School music teacher who sees great promise in Ruby and encourages her to think of a life outside her family .There are so many highlights in CODA it's an uplifting film as one reviewer noted \"CODA\" is a small movie that hits all the right notes it's a beautiful film.",

            "review_title": "More than just a \"coming of age\" movie",
            "content": "Although an obvious coming of age story, the real plot line is the conflicting relationships that a young girl has between the speaking world, which offers her opportunity and personal fulfillment, and the deaf world, to which she is emotionally anchored. Born into a deaf family, she receives only humiliation and embarrassment in her interactions with the speaking world, so much so that in order to find her singing voice she must retreat to her secret \"safe place\", a quarry/swimming hole where she can be alone with her voice. This is such a safe venue that, when hurt by the boy she loves, she can only accept him back when he agrees to follow her to the quarry and prove himself.But her true emotional connection is the warmth and love of her deaf family, so much so that when her music teacher asks how music makes her feel, she cannot express it in words, only in ASL. Even without subtitles, every viewer will fully understand her emotional connection to singing.Similarly, in the overpowering tryout for music college, her singing voice is drab and mundane until she starts signing to her family using ASL, and no one will be left dry eyed at how her singing and signing expressively complement one another.A CODA (child of deaf adults) learns early in life to take on adult responsibilities for the sake, and safety, of their family, and to put their own aspirations on the back burner. As in CODA, only with incredible love and trust can a CODA break free to be her own person.",

I thought it would continue in a fairly serious atmosphere, but there were quite a few elements of sex that came out and made me laugh. It was really good. The love part is well connected to the musical, and the viewer is thrilled when he thinks that he can sing with the person he likes, and I think the reason why he is moved just by singing the song is probably because the direction is a film that draws people who are watching very well.If you force a bad place, there are quite a lot of bad stories and you may notice it if you watch it with your lover, so be careful about it, but as I have said many times, this movie is really moving, especially the scene where the father tries hard to listen to his daughter's song is really moving, and it is worth watching even people who do not like musicals etc.I recommend watching this movie alone.",

The father, mother and her brother roles were so greatly performed by three amazing actors.The only weak one is the music teacher, a role played extremely over the top exaggerated. The way to teach how to sing was also quite wrong by demanding her to scream with her head off. That definitely would hurt her vocal cord.Other than this small flaw, the songs sang by her were absolutely angelic and touching.This is the movie that we really need among and out of those stupid CGI crapped superhero or disgusting horror movies.Highly recommended!!",

I laughed and cried and everything in between for two hours straight. This movie does a phenomenal job at capturing the essence of what it feels like when you're perceived different.CODA is essentially a story about the only hearing person of a deaf family who is at crossroads whether to stay help her family or to choose her own path forward. She was born to be part of both worlds yet doesn't take full ownership of either. Emilia Jones (as Ruby Rossi) does a fantastic job in her role navigating through family responsibility, pressure, expectations, belonging, identity and finding her own voice, literally. The entire cast is just pure joy to watch - with Troy Kotsur absolutely killing it. This guy makes sign language feel like the strongest, most intuitive and most swag way of expressing human emotion.If you're hesitating whether to watch this movie - don't. CODA is genuinely special. It's beautiful, different, poignant, hilariously funny at times and excruciatingly painful at others. I loved every single minute of it and rooted for every single character so badly I wanted to befriend them immediately. This film fully deserves its Best Motion Picture Oscar and yes. It is VERY worthwhile your attention.",

It's akin to an everyday testament to the old adage \"a picture speaks a thousands words.\"Being able to pour your heart out using all these gestures that just look like a palette of a thousand scintillating colors thrown onto a wall to create a masterpiece of emotions, thoughts and utterly unadulterated and sincere human connection - it's incredible.That is, quite frankly, possibly the greatest Ode to Joy ever sung.",

Secondly \"worthy\" Oscar movies that virtue signal are usually best avoided. To call a movie \"signing\" or Coda puts disability front and centre when these elements are necessarily secondary to any plot.In reality this was a strong family story, quite light and humorous with a first love/coming of age story about a young woman discovering her musical talent and going off to college.Very much a TV movie made for the small screen with a largely exaggerated acting style. Emelia Jones played Ruby Rossi turned out a great performance and her voice was beautiful. Troy Kotsur played her father and gave some brilliant comic moments it really was tremendous.Did I learn anything about being the hearing child in a deaf family, not really, as the need to communicate is not dissimilar to any non native speaker in a foreign land. Why the Rossi family didn't speak or learn to lip read is a mystery never explained in this movie, they seemed to live in a deaf \"bunker\".I thought this was a really great movie with it's strength of story and humanity conveyed with a musical dream, it neither sugar coated the issues or exaggerated the daily problems deaf families encounter.Dune was clearly the best movie in 2022, everyone knows that, however best supporting actor for Troy Kotsur was well deserved.I'm giving this a firm 8 outta 10 and I'm glad I finally watched it.",

Can't have everything. Apparently you can have actual deaf actors playing these deaf characters though (shocking, I know), and even though I'm not deaf myself, it's very nice to see that, and I think you can just tell authenticity when you see it.Unfortunately, the writer and director is not deaf. I know I just said I'm not deaf, but I mentioned in my Raiders Of The Lost Ark review that I am bisexual, so I do know what it's like being a part of a minority group. And I've always thought that if a film were ever to be made specifically about the bisexual experience, I couldn't care less if a straight actor played the part as long as the writer was bi and got to say \"yes, I am okay with this straight actor playing this part\", because ultimately, it's their story to tell the way they want to tell it, they don't have to be some exemplar of representation for their own minority group if they don't want to, and the actor's job is to tell someone else's story, not overshadow it.I think that should be seen as more worthy representation for any minority group than actors from that group playing the part, even though that is important too. And I know that deaf people do largely really appreciate this film aside from a few inaccuracies, so I'm not gonna talk over them and say that this film is any worse for being written and directed by a hearing person, but as a general rule, I think that films about a minority group's experience should, at the very least, be co-written by someone by someone who belongs to that group.Anyway, rant over, acting's fantastic, but you know what else is? The story. Aside from that stuff I mentioned earlier, everything here feels so natural and realistic to me, and although it is a comedy and there are some jokes that come out of the main character's family being deaf, it never feels like it's laughing at them. It just feels incredibly real, and the narrative as a whole is very heartwarming without being cheesy (most of the time anyway).And largely that's because of some fantastic dialogue, so hats off to that. In terms of how much I think this deserves Best Picture, well...a whole lot more than Don't Look Up, I'll say that much.",

But I have to take that judgement back, because this is such a great movie for a few reasons.First, the comedy is quiet different from the usual comedy / dramas. They make harsh jokes, they will be in really awkward situations at times and the comedic moments might not work for everyone, but they did for me.Second, where many movies try to become over dramatic because of subject matter, CODA maintains a level of realism by not going too far.Third, the music scenes are great. The practice sessions are enjoyable, and later on, when they have to perform, you immerse yourself completely in the situation.As for flaws, the ending is a bit drawn out with several alternative endings they could make. As for the script, there are a few times that they use too much talk to explain what the family is feeling while we as audience already can feel it without needing the context explained.Overall, a great much where everyone can find something to love even if you think it is not for you, go and give it a try, you won't regret it.",

Its so far the best ensemble performance I have seen this year.It started with Emilia Jones who is in a career defining performance. She is just wonderful and so natural. Its not an easy role. Finding the right tone around the character and in addition with some physical challenges really makes it a treasure of a performance. The supporting cast is not lesser good. The most outstanding role, and hopefully he will be the Paul Raci of next Oscar season, is Troy Kotsur who does magic with the role of the father. Such a well balanced and beautiful performance. Such a great character, and not only on paper. He adds so much to it. Marlee Matlin is also good in the role of the mother and its always beautiful to see her on screen. Last but not least Eugenio Derbez turns into a very noteworthy performance.The film has a beautiful cinematography, a very nice score and soundtrack and it sticks in your head for a long time after seeing it.

            "content": "Ever since premiering at Sundance film festival to rave reviews, I've been looking forward to CODA but have always kept my expectations in check. CODA is a coming-of-age story sees Ruby (played by Emilia Jones in one of the best performances this year), a girl with a penchant for singing, grappling with chasing her dreams while helping her deaf family which she happens to be the only hearing member in. The story is nothing special, and the film itself is anything but groundbreaking. Rather, it's one that thrives off of its simplicity from which it yields enriching subtlety.For starters, the family dynamic is priceless. Whether they're squabbling or having a laugh, their interactions with each other are like quickfire repartees that have you transfixed while at play, and are sunk in as soon as they end. The humour in this movie originally generates either from how crude and blunt Ruby's family is (more on that later) or from the complexity of non-verbal communication. Yet, the movie never looks down at deaf people or even regards them patronizingly, and each time we spend some moments with the family makes this more and more evident. Does the same go for the family itself and each member of it? And are they perfectly imperfect as they seem? Not really.As the family has its own identity, each character has its own individual personality and unique mannerisms, too. And it's here where we get to see through the cracks in each one of them. Ruby is the one who communicates with them and the sign-language interpreter and mediator between them and the townspeople. Ironically, none of her family members is able to properly communicate their feelings to Ruby herself, the thing that made her dilemma more and more perplexing and befuddling.Ruby's brother, Leo (Daniel Durant), grows tired of people regarding him and his parents as 'disabled'. He feels that he's seen as helpless and \"freak\" - as one once called him before getting into a bar brawl. That feeling is further amplified when he realises how much they rely on his sister to be their connection to the outside world. As a consequence, he puts the blame on Ruby because he feels that he lives under her sister's shadow, let alone she's his younger sibling. In his heart, however, he loves his sister dearly. And after knowing of her talent, he becomes worried her potential might go to waste as a result of staying with them forever instead of pursuing her passion.As for the mother, Jackie (Marlee Matlin), things are much more complicated. She bans Ruby from listening to music while they're at the table because that's 'rude' since it's not something \"(they) all can do together,\" and she's frustrated at learning she joined the school choir. Later on, she's desperate to do anything to stop her from heading off to the music school because that way they'd lose their only 'interpreter' they can't afford to keep their fishing business afloat. Thus, her actions and intentions seem to be solely based on the family's business' interests with a total disregard to Ruby's. She comes across as exploitative, and also as someone who clearly sees deafness as a deficiency that the whole family must suffer from. That said, it's revealed that all that has something to do with her past, which I'm not going to spoil but it shows how much Jackie's actually concerned about her relationship with her daughter.However, it's not only about her family, as Ruby herself has her own internal conflict and restrictions that she's built for herself - unwillingly, of course. On the face of it, she's ashamed of her family because of how shamelessly frank they are, especially her father (Troy Kotsur), who legitimately got Ruby in some awkwardly embarrassing situations. On closer inspection, though, we see she's learned to adopt a new persona at school over the years because 'sounding like a deaf person' made her classmates make fun of her. Unfortunately, she learned to be normal by being different, only to become diffident. The whole thing about her inspiring, eccentric music teacher (Eugenio Derbez) telling her that her problem is that she's \"holding her voice,\" as though she's suppressing it, is a metaphor for her true self and identity she's been nearly stripped of unconsciously, whether because she's confined to her familial obligation or to avoid feelings of inadequacy and mortification.\"The stars here, they don't look as good as they do on the water.\"\nThe second half of CODA is undeniably the weakest. As I mentioned earlier, the story itself is pretty formulaic, with its ups and downs, romantic storyline that slipped into clich\u00e9 territory before even we're halfway through, and 'too-good-to-be-true' moments by the end. Nevertheless, CODA overflows with emotional beats that are bound to melt even the stony hearts, which the second half, in particular, is replete with. I mean, I almost teared up in three scenes! If that doesn't eclipse its shortcomings I don't know what does. It's not a film about hearing or deafness per se, but rather about the expression of inner feelings suppressed by circumstances, and by doing so it sets itself apart from your conventional inspirational films about finding your voice and following your dreams, despite conforming to their exact same formula. Sweet, tender and earnest, CODA is a crowd-pleaser and one of the biggest surprises of the year.",

Have Hollywood been so over soaked with remakes and super hero movies that we are just getting a watered down version of what we consider great films. Coda was a lovely movie and the source material was great, but I just don't know if I can come to call this a best picture worthy film. I hope most cinephiles like me are not satisfied with CODA being the best movie that filmmakers have to offer us over an entire year. We need to get back to making original films from the great directors that we have. I know marvel an DC movies will not stop being made because of the money they generate but they are destroying the movie industry and the reason so many potentially great films are not being made and we are settling for basically a Disney style film as being the potential winner of the highest achievement in film in 2021. I don't mean to be harsh and I enjoyed the acting and art direction and everything about CODA, but I cannot give it a 10 or except this as the best film Hollywood has to offer us. Sorry :)",

The film introduces an intriguing premise, lending itself to a unique and interesting utilization of sound and non-verbal emotion. Although this is present in a couple of scenes, mainly towards the end, the film mistakenly focuses too much of its time on the uninteresting aspects of the plot such as the many scenes involving teenage drama. This can also be done in an interesting way, but the execution of the cinematography, as well as the story, make for a generic, redundant, and bland feel to the film. The few scenes that truly earn an emotional moment, stem fully from the aspects of the film where the actors produce uncommunicative moments of emotion as well as when the sound plays an integral role in understanding the character's mindsets. Interesting plot elements are introduced throughout but are either forgotten or backtracked by inexplicable character motivations. Although the characters are enjoyable to watch and the actors playing them do a fine job, the script they are given doesn't allow them to have the emotional punch this film desperately needed. This film had the capacity to be something that would truly stick to its viewers, and while at times it shines through its characters and performances, in others fails through a bland look and generic story it tries to convey.",

It gives much needed representation to under-represented deaf community/families and shines light on and gives us view into some of their problems we will never know about like being alienated from the outside world. This in other hand could fall into the victim of being overly-sentimental and unnecessarily dramatic but Sian Heder carefully directed this movie and it shows. Every moment of the movie is simply magical, heart-warming and furthermore, the performances from the whole cast is deeply moving (particular from the father. The scene where he tried to feel his daughter sings got me in tears) and only adds authenticity into the air. Not to mention it's beautiful photography too.

And there's also several wonderful musical sequences set to classic popular songs. I really wasn't exaggerating when I said these movies are identical.Only CODA sets itself apart with the added layer of what it's like to be the able child of disabled parents, and to have your life entirely defined by their disability, to feel honor bound to assisting them with their aspirations while yours fall to the wayside, similar to the bilingual children of immigrant parents.Ruby finds herself in a difficult situation, born as the only hearing members into a deaf family, the default surrogate designated to translating for her parents as they endeavor in a startup co-op business venture with collaborators who cannot understand them, which interferes with her ambition to make music and perform, an ambition utterly alien to her deaf parents. As her older brother watches his sister throw her dreams away to be the mouthpiece for her parents in a world of people unwilling to accommodate them, he sums up the general attitude best,\"Let them figure out how to deal with deaf people.\"And that's exactly as it should be.

Emilia Jones was given a role in which she exceled as the lead, making the movie so much better for it. She wants to sing, while also thinking about the sacrifice she would make for the people she loves by not leaving them. But that sentiment goes both ways, and \"freeing a bird from it's cage\" is also love. It's a family drama with excellent song choices as well as execution and presentation.And I may be used to seeing the silly side of Eugenio Derbez, but as a supporting pillar of a student that wants to just sing, he does an excellent job! The rest of the Cast also does a great job. All the interactions are excellent! And the story may be simple, straightforward and predictable like most movies like these often are.. It's the message and the way that it is said that differentiates them from the rest.It is definitely worth watching if you like to choke up a bit, and would recommend it any time.",

The main detail that the film has is that it takes a long time for the plot to appear and I personally feel that the ending is somewhat predictable and very hopeful, but given the times we are living in, it is very encouraging to see this ending.It is a film full of emotions and feelings that can be reflected in the public and that, due to excellent performances, make us feel and see the characters in a very human way, it is a decently developed emotional film that reflects our human side of coping some problems.",

When it comes to putting the viewer in the shoes of the deaf and hard of hearing community, I have never in my life seen a movie do it better than CODA. Some strong choices by the director, cinematographer, and the sound crew take what could be a very good film, and turn it into a great film. It makes you laugh, cry, and empathize all in 2 hours.As someone who knows ASL on a novice level after growing up with a mute brother, I truly believe that CODA is not only an incredible accomplishment for filmmaking, but a massive breakthrough for intertwining the deaf community with the world of entertainment. It shows that you, as a hearing person, can still stay engaged throughout an entire film, even if it contains significantly less audible dialogue than average. This can open up a whole new world of possibilities and shut down any misconceptions about deaf entertainment being received in the mainstream.The script is funny, the acting is very good, and the conflicts (and thus resolutions) take you on a very moving journey (prep some tissues). Despite having to read most of the captions to understand what was being communicated, I was just as, if not more, invested in the characters and the challenges they faced throughout the story. That's only one of the many ways I can convey just how good this film really was, and why I'm excited to see where this takes us.This film is a historic moment for cinema. I have not given a 9 rating in a long time, but CODA deserves every bit of it!Verdict: Watch.",

It's an emotionally investing piece that I cared for despite its lack of originality.The reality is that even if you've never seen CODA, you have definitely seen CODA. Tell me if this sounds familiar: We have the girl who never quite fit in and gets picked on protagonist, the quirky best friend, the popular attractive boy who ends up falling for her despite her status, the teacher that inspires her to do more with her life, the loud and brash parents that she initially finds embarrassing until she realizes that she loves them, like this clich\u00e9 stuff has been done a million and a half times.But the characters are so well-written and likable that it didn't really bother me. The way the family interacts does a great job at establishing their relationship from the very beginning, the arguments they have feel organic and are presented in a visually interesting way, the lead and her boyfriend have a really cute dynamic, and the challenges of being a CODA are done in a much more unique fashion than I was expecting. All of this creates a sort of perfect-storm for emotional investment that I definitely fell victim to.I really liked the Dad and the teacher in particular, they're both just really fun people to watch. The dynamic between the lead and her brother was set up well and established early on, and it felt particularly realistic to someone like myself with siblings. The casting in general is done extremely well. I'm assuming that these are actual deaf actors because they're all doing a pretty great job at nailing the dynamic between deaf people and hearing people.Yeah it's basically just one big trope, and it's shot like a TV movie, but I quite liked it. Normally these super cheesy movies aren't really my thing, but this one worked for me.",

The acting just wasn't that great (beyond the parents), the whole shy singer turn star felt clich\u00e9, the student/teacher relationship was predictable, she happens to hit it off with her cute duet partner, etc.Power of the Dog wasn't my favorite either but it had that polish, suspense, tension, strong characters and acting that we have seen win Best Picture year after year. West Side Story had all those elements as well. This one had none of that. Maybe there was just a split of votes that happen to fall in Coda's favor?

            "content": "CODA which stands for Child Of Deaf Adult directed by Sian Heder is a movie about a girl named Ruby Rossi played by Emilia Jones who is a hearing girl in a deaf family who wants to pursue her passion of singing but when her family needs her to help in their fishing business, now Ruby has to struggle between choosing her passion of singing or help her family with their business. Most movies that have to do with high school life and a struggle are usually really bad movies and end up cheesy but this movie is just phenomenal and I can't stop thinking about this movie, some of my thoughts on the performances throughout the movie is Emilia Jones can play a tough, strong, and shy girl who is struggling to fit in because of her situation she is in being the only hearing person in her family who is deaf and she plays a person that can't fit in. The Scenes in CODA was nicely shot for example when Ruby was alone singing at the lake, the cinematography is pretty good. The chemistry between all the Characters have together is really amazing, The acting in the movie is just like if they were in real life as a family, or in a school. I was impressed during these scenes where Ruby and Miles played by Ferdia Walsh Peelo were singing in a duet for the first time ever Ruby keeps looking at Miles showing how much she is into him but Miles at this point isn't really into her and keeps looking at Bernardo played by Eugenio Derbez which I think this is a really good scene. Another scene I liked is when Ruby is trying to explain how she feels to sing to Bernardo but can't put it into words so she signs how she feels to sing to Bernardo, he can't understand what she is signing but he can understand that it makes her feel safe and comfortable. Also another scene I liked is When Ruby and Miles are singing at the concert Frank Rossi played by Trot Kotsur and Jackie Rossi played by Marlee Matlin are looking around to see the audiences reaction to their daughter singing at they see that people are enjoying their singing and some tearing up to their singing and at that moment they realize that their daughter has real talent, also Ruby explains to her Frank that the song that she was singing at the concert was about what it is to need another person which perfectly shows what the parents are in need of, they need Ruby. This Movie has little to no flaws and I really enjoyed CODA and I will give this movie a 10/10, the next time Sian Heder makes a movie if its anything like this I will surely watch it.",

A lot of the dialogue and events are implied, but not built into or shown. This let a lot of events get edited into a shorter amount of time. This movie is missing a lot of the building tension of the scene that we get in other movies.So really, the opposite of a 1960's movie; short scenes, jumping from one event to the next, less time wasted on each scene.As I settle in to enjoy the scene, it cuts to the next event.",

            "review_title": "One glaring flaw",
            "content": "Takes the edge off a film that had plenty to like. Others here have said plenty about that, so let me focus now on that flaw.Remember, Ruby works on her father's boat and her presence is potentially vital, since she is the only one aboard who can hear. One day, she unilaterally decides - without telling anybody - to take the whole day off to go to a lake with the boy she fancies.It's a lovely day out and advances their relationship. But in her absence, her father and brother are unable to communicate with the observer placed on board their boat, do not hear radio broadcasts or hailer calls and end up being boarded by the suspicious coastguard. This set of circumstances incurs large fines the family cannot afford and, worse still, could put them permanently out of business!And yet, when she finally turns up, Ruby gets upset that the family is \"trying to pin this on me\". In other words, even when confronted with the dire consequences, she refuses to assume any guilt for the damage her terrible lack of responsiblity has caused.That is not so surprising among teenagers, but the film copmpounds the problem by letting her get away with it and instead pins the blame squarely on the parents for expecting too much of their daughter. It was a burden to carry, but she was an apparently mature young lady who had been doing a reasonable job since she was very young and the family had organized itself around that. So they depended on her and she let them down, very badly!Yes, kids should be encouraged to pursue their (realistic) dreams, but the universe does not stop for that to happen and life in a society entails all kinds of basic responsibilities that have to be fulfilled in order for that society to function. That is a far more important lesson to teach the younger generations!Another is the importance of communication. Ruby not only comes close to ruining the family business, but also nearly destroys her budding singing future by letting down her tutor, giving him the impression she's undisciplined and wasting his time, because she does not explain (just offers vague excuses) the difficulties she is having in reconciling all the commitments she has assumed.",

Does every movie with an angsty teen have to have dreams of being a singer or musician? Is that rule now? I would have been more interested if she wanted to be a radiologist, or zookeeper, or an astronaut. Literally anything else! And I know that music is more convenient for a story about a deaf family, but come on, is this supposed to be Mr. Holland's Opus 2: Electric Boogaloo? By the way, the singing is laughable. I was embarrassed watching it. Plus the acting was pretty poor. I'm not really sure how Troy Kotsur is getting all this award attention. He overacts. Trying waaaaay too hard at comedy. Fart jokes and sex jokes really aren't my thing. The only redeeming thing in this movie is Eugenio Derbez as the choir teacher. His performance is actually interesting unlike every other actor in this \"film\". My final note, the actress playing Ruby's best friend Gertie is 27, but playing a high school student.

            "content": "The Sundance Film Festival has always been known for giving a great platform to unassuming films by little-known filmmakers. Many of the festival's winners have gone on to win prestigious awards. CODA could be the next candidate in which this scenario occurs. Not only is it one of the biggest crowd-pleasers of the year, but the coming-of-age story gives the sneezy cast of deaf-mute performers a chance to shine.It is important to mention that CODA is based on the French comedy Do You Understand the B\u00e9liers. Whereas in the original work, however, only hearing actors embody the almost exclusively deaf-mute family members, here it is people with the actual affliction. At the latest since Sound of Metal showed this fascinating group in such a grandiose way, deaf-muteness in films has been on everyone's lips. Director Sian Heder wraps this concept in a film reminiscent of coming-of-age stories like Lady Bird and Juno. The youngest member of the family, Ruby, is the only hearing one in her family and helps her loved ones make ends meet as a translator in a less tolerant society. The family owns a fishing business, into which several obstacles get in the way as the plot unfolds. But that is not the main story. Rather, the film is told through Ruby's eyes and accompanies her as she is torn between staying true to her family or pursuing her dream as a singer. 19-year-old Emilia Jones plays this character as authentically and adolescently as possible, and you buy into her almost impossible situation, but one that seems so remote from our point of view. The best moments in CODA occur when she shares emotional dialogue with her parents and brother. Although they only gesture with sign language, you follow the conversation as if it were the spoken word we are used to. This is thanks to the great performances of Oscar winner Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur and Laniel Durant. They seem very bizarre and different at first, but it becomes increasingly clear that they too have normal concerns and needs apart from their deafness. Eugenio Derbez, as Ruby's mentor and singing teacher, is also a constant in the protagonist's life that we wish we had.Out the back, CODA lives up to all the hype as a crowd pleaser. Some scenes press hard on the tear gland and are carried by great sung musical accompaniment. Before that, however, the film takes almost half the time to finally get going. This is detrimental to the film because the plot lost me a little after the long delay. One should not expect surprises anyway. The film follows a classic pattern, but the predictability does it little harm. Rather, the fact that the family conflict built up in the first half never fully unfolds. Only between brother and sister is there a reckoning, but this is not really pursued. In retrospect, however, this is forgotten, as Heder knows how to rely on elements towards the end that simply appeal to filmgoers. I fell for that too and that is the reason why I enjoyed CODA so much in the end. Viewed as a whole, however, the film has obvious weaknesses, which is why I cannot rank it among the top tier coming-of-age stories.",

Never has a film so galvanized me in the injustices wreaked on the disabled. One particular scene was truly illuminating: the parents can't hear their daughter sing anymore than we can, as the sound is muted.The acting is terrific - especially by Troy Kotsur and Emilia Jones.

Emilia Jones Is one of the most amazing actresses I have seen in a long time. I could feel her struggle, and it was real. Her moments with her family were tender and touching, and frustrating all at the same time. You wanted Emilia's character to succeed, but she had so many challenges, it seemed impossible. And the struggle with her deaf mom and dad and brother, trying to fit in with society and be treated as normal was so well portrayed. I cried at least 3 times in this movie, not because it's a tragedy, but because the movie is so realistic and moving. The music teacher Bernardo was terrific, and Ruby's dad was so interesting to watch. This movie definitely deserves the Oscar for Best Picture, and Emilia Jones is one of the best actresses to come out of Hollywood.",

I see a number of reviews using terms like \"formulaic\" or \"by the numbers\", which may have some basis, however, do not for a moment believe that is a full assessment of this beautifully told story.(I'm not hating on Hollywood, they are, after all, in it for the money not the art, and to that end they do a fine job. However, CODA is yet another stunning example of how the film industry outside of Hollywood produces wonderfully wonderful work! This movie is a wee gem!)CODA explores how people's interpretations of situations can be vastly different, and often not recognised by those sharing those situations, even loved ones.It lets us know that sometimes we need to stop being selfless and to do things for ourselves, for the benefit of our sanity, desires, dreams, and dare I say it... our souls! Simultaneously, the story tells us why we must stop being selfish, dependent, negative, turning can't do / won't do attitudes, beliefs, and actions around, giving new strength to the characters. It is a coming of age story, but not simply a teen coming of age, not by a long way.There is one scene that I just know will last with me forever. These powerful scenes come along very rarely in cinema, Tom Hanks' interpretation of the opera in Philadelphia is one. Liam Neeson in Schindler's List when he is counting the number of Jewish lives his Nazi pin could have bought is also one. Likewise, Jean Valjean's death scene / the finale of Les Mis\u00e9rables, is another example of a truly rare and exceptionally crafted moment (IMHO). CODA too, has one of these moments, and while I'd wager most would say it's the scene where Ruby sings to her father on the back of their pickup truck. For me, it's the duet scene, the scene we know is going to be pivotal, but then... That moment! Right there! Where everything changes, everyone becomes aware of more than themselves for a mere moment, and it's transformative in the most beautiful way, without a word being uttered, nor a sound being made!I will happily re-watch this movie, and joyfully re-experience those emotions again and again, I'm certain of this.To me this felt authentic, the acting was very much on point, (everyone is on point). It's clear Emelia Jones worked very hard to prepare for this role, highlighted by the fact that, at no moment ever does she look uncomfortable working on a fishing trawler, nor does she look like anything less than someone who has signed to communicate her entire life! She does, for the most part, look uncomfortable singing, but she's supposed to, and yet, It's apparent she has the singing chops to pull of the big singing moments.Look, do yourself a favour, if you haven't seen CODA yet then watch this movie! If you have seen it, then watch it again!Thank you for making CODA.",

The story is a pretty good one; a feel good, in-depth tale of family and becoming, without the cheesiness or exaggeration that often comes with movies of this nature.Great acting, directing script, production. Emelia Jones does a fantastic job with the lead, but in truth, the whole main cast does excellent job... I can't really fault it without being pedantically picky. Now you'll probably shed a tear here and there, so have the tissues ready.Aside from being just a thoroughly enjoyable movie, its also a great \"get you out the doghouse movie\" so if you have to make amends with your wife/girlfriend for some transgression, you could do no better than to take them to see it, just trust me on this.Anyway it was a great change from the films I normally seek out to see.

At the end of the day it taught good morals about family and living your authentic life. I respect that but this is truly one of the most mediocre films I have ever seen.",

            "content": "The Rossi family runs a fishing boat off the coast of Massachusetts and Ruby (Emilia Jones) is the only member of the clan who is not deaf. She joins the high school choir during her senior year and finds herself caught between, on the one hand, the demands of her (very close-knit) family, and on the other hand her aspirations to pursue voice in college.While this is a remake of a 2014 French movie, this reboot carves out its own identity by placing the material in the working class, fishing sub-culture of Gloucester, Massachusetts. That atmosphere added grit to the film, and the audience never doubts the genuineness of the setting. The parents (Marlee Matlin, Troy Katsur) have a wonderful chemistry and Ruby's brother (Daniel Durant) is also fantastic; and Emilia Jones absolutely shines as Ruby. We quickly learn that, despite the challenges presented by being deaf and the chaos caused by that, their family life is animated by love. I was touched by the honesty of their interactions and the beauty of their shared lives in spite of their common disability. This made Ruby's dilemma all the more poignant; how can she leave them given their dependence on her, but how can she not follow her own dreams?In our cynical day, this movie was uplifting--not by foisting a pre-conceived message on the audience--but by simply allowing the beauty of the Rossi's family life to radiate. The writing is intelligent and witty, and the dialogue, both spoken and signed, is heartfelt and often hilarious. The movie doesn't glorify the characters merely because they have a disability, nor are they prevented from acting out their full humanity--the highs and the lows--with integrity.This is a beautiful movie and worthy of the Best Picture award at the Oscars. Frankly, it caught me off guard that such a positive film--one not inundated with politically correct virtue signaling, took the top prize. This was heartening.",

The obstacles that the protagonist has to face to achieve her dream are overcome very easily, and there is really no tension: from the very beginning, you just know there will be the happy ending with the girl going to music school, so the whole plot feels sort of fake.You can't even say that the concept is original, since it's basically a copy of a previous french movie.On a positive note, I think the dialogue between the protagonist and her dad is really moving, I admit I might have shed a tear in that moment.As an adult, I think I am too old for this kind of movie, but I would recommend showing it to kids or young adolescents.",

Her mother and her relationship is almost clich\u00e9 like every mother daughter relationship who puts her family first.

You don't just follow the life of the main character but you get to FEEL what they're going through. And yes......I'm saying they because while you get emotionally invested in one character, you are also connected with others but in a different sense.The teen girl lead can choose between her family or her dream. Literally her family's ability to support themselves, keep a roof over their heads and food on their table. This is a crushing weight to be on the shoulders of a teenager that is different than the rest of her family.You will need to read subtitles or know ASL to watch this movie but it is 1,000% worth every word.

However, the family does not support the protagonist because they need him/her to help their family business/does not believe the arts are a practical pursuit for financial independence/is anti-art. Ultimately the protagonist has to choose between his/her family or his/her passion, but whatever choice the protagonist makes, everything is reconciled at the end. Or not.Everyone and their mother has told this story. 90% of Japan's animated productions tell some variation of this story.Some try to add something new or subvert or satirize the genre in some way to stand out. Not CODA! CODA relies on its gimmick of using deaf actors to play deaf characters to emotionally manipulate the audience. Not dissimilar to how Boyhood was shot over decades.Don't get me wrong, it's great that deaf actors are getting representation, I just wish it wasn't just for a stupid gimmick.The film is passably made for what it is, but it does NOT deserve its accolades.TL;DR Skip this, and just rewatch Dead Poets Society instead.Or the Weird Al movie, which is a brilliant satire of the coming-of-age genre.",
