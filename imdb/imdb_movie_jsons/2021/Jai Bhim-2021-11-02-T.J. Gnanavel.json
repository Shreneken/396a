            "content": "In a scene in Jai Bhim, a group of tribals man meet a police office who is heading an inquiry commission about the disappearance of three missing tribals who were being interrogated by the police about a theft case. One man tells him that he was once arrested by cops just for greeting them. Another tells him about how he was arrested just because he tried to slink away fearing them. A woman narrates how her husband was forced to 'confess' to a crime which he had not committed after the cops started molesting her. A young boy mentions that the police picked him up just because they could not get his father, and how that one incident made him a perennial suspect at school. These people are clearly damned if they did, and damned if they didn't.This scene is an echo of the scene that opens the film. We see many prisoners being let out of prison. A few cops from the surrounding police stations are waiting. As each prisoner comes out, he is asked for his caste. If they mention a dominant caste's name, they are asked to leave. But those who belong to a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe, they are told to stand in a corner, only for the waiting cops to pick them up as suspects in the many cases that remain unsolved in their station. When some of them complain that there are too few for them to foist cases on, they are told that they could accuses a few of committing more than one crime.With scenes like these, Jai Bhim powerfully captures the abuse and humiliation that is heaped upon the underprivileged by those in power and the kind of defiance it will take to get them justice. Like Visaaranai and the recent Kavalthurai Ungal Nanban, the film is also a fierce criticism of police brutality. The plot revolves around Rajakannu (Manikandan) and Sengani (Lijomol Jose), a couple who live at Konamalai near Viluppuram. They belong to the Irular tribe, and despite their poverty - they still cannot afford a brick house - they are contented and happy. Especially with their daughter Alli going to school and a second child on its way.But their happiness is dashed when cops come in search of Rajakannu over a robbery. The poor man has become the main suspect just because he happened to be the one who had visited the house where the robbery happened that day to catch a snake. Unable to find him, the police pick up the pregnant Sengani and a few other men from the tribe, including Rajakannu's brother Irutappan. Sengani is later let go - not before being beaten and kicked multiple times - but for Rajakannu and a couple of others, there is no respite from the harrowing violence unleashed upon by the men in khakhi. When Sengani hears that the three men have escaped and their whereabouts unknown, she reached out to Chandru (Suriya), a righteous lawyer who fights for the downtrodden. But can they uncover the truth with an entire system standing against them?Jai Bhim is an unexpected sophomore effort from TJ Gnanavel, who had previously directed the uneven drama Kootathil Oruvan. This is a film that is raw, real and brutal, with gritty filmmaking enhancing the solid writing. It effectively portrays the wrongs that are done to the underprivileged without seeming exploitative or overly melodramatic. Despite being one of the oldest communities in the country, these tribes do not even have any proof to show that they are its citizens and cannot even own a piece of the land. When Mythra (Rajisha Vijayan), a teacher who is part of an adult literacy programme, tries to get them a voter id, the local big shot, who belongs to a dominant caste, retorts, \"Isn't it enough we have to request the lower castes to vote for us? Should we also go to the homes of these fellows?\"Gnanavel gives us some terrific moments of defiance. Lijomol Jose is quietly powerful as Sengani, who gets a couple of rousing scenes when she turns down efforts at a compromise from cops. Manikandan, too, is effective and stands out in the scene when he urges his men to not give in as that will result in their community being branded as criminals. The director also portrays the intimacy between Sengani and Rajakannu in a charming manner.The film is based on a real-life incident involving Justice K Chandru, from his days as a lawyer. Suriya plays this role with the right amount of intensity and earnestness, which helps the character seem grounded even while the film and Sean Roldan's score try to build him up as a can-do-no-wrong superhero. In fact, his introduction scene wouldn't be out of place in a masala movie. But after Soorarai Pottru, this is another notable film for the star as a performer.And his scenes with Prakash Raj, who plays the inquiry commission head, Perumalsamy, give us calm and composed dialogue that act as a counterpoint to the flinching violence and the moving melodrama. The latter lends the role with a great deal of dignity to a character who believes one has to take up a little bit of authoritarianism to protect democracy. So, we have a lawyer who considers the police as the worst and a cop who finds lawyers the worst working together to ensure justice is done. Through these scenes, Gnanavel - as one of the judges in the film mentions - shows how justice can be upheld when law and order work hand in hand.There are only a couple of missteps. After a point, the violence begins to feel like torture porn, even though the film presents these episodes as flashbacks of events that happened over a day or two. And in a narrative sense, Chandru's efforts to unravel the mystery and his battle in court feels somewhat easier because there are no strong antagonists. Both Rao Ramesh as the advocate general and Guru Somasundaram as the public prosecutor never come across as formidable foes for Chandru in court. That said, as Chandru unravels one cover-up after another, the film makes us realise the extent to which unchecked power can go to maintain status quo.But these doesn't lessen the emotional impact of the film, which, along with films like Visaaranai, Kirumi and Kavalthurai Ungal Nanban, is a much-needed antidote to restore the balance in portrayals of the police in an industry overrun by the Singams and the Saamys.",

            "content": "There's some serious upvoting for this film here on IMDb; if not for a weighted averaging of the film's rating by viewers, this would be the number one movie of all time having just come out this year, and that by a wide margin. I thought the movie was good for it's portrayal of corrupt authorities taken down by a dedicated attorney, it hit on many of the points that social justice advocates clamor for here in this country. Based on a true story, one can only marvel at the dedication of a man like Chandru (Suriya), who utilized every bit of means and cunning to humiliate the brutal police authorities and their corrupt political allies. Many times it's a difficult story to watch, as the beatings and punishment doled out by district police against members of lower castes approach grotesquely inhumane treatment. Chandru's efforts eventually pay off, and it was inspiring to see him honored by the citizens he represented at the finale, reminiscent of that final scene of Gregory Peck in \"To Kill A Mockingbird\".One note of caution when coming to the IMDb title page - the names of characters listed in the credits don't match the corresponding identification of characters in the film. As an example, actress Lijo Mol Jose portrayed the agonized wife Sengoni in the credits, but in the film, captioning described her as 'Sannamma'. I'm not versed well enough in Indian nomenclature to know if that's a result of translation or some other factor. I would also question the narrative offered at the end of the story that stated the attorney portrayed in the picture was responsible for ninety six thousand cases in six years. To do that, he would have to have been involved with over forty cases per day, every single day for six years, with no days off!",

            "content": "Jai Bhim turned out to be a hard-hitting, raw and powerful court-room drama. The purpose of cinema is not just to entertain but also educate and empower the audience. The courtroom drama based movies are always engaging as the prosecutor and defendant both fight to solve the case with solid evidences and innumerable witnesses.Bollywood Films like \"Damini\", \"Jolly LLB\",\"Talvar\" \"Rustom\", \"Pink\" or even \"Section 375\" have been immensely successful in keeping the audience engaged with impeccable dialogues and fantastic screenplay but what makes Jai Bhim different is the beautiful message on morality and equality of a tribal woman who fights for the justice of her husband.Jai Bhim is based on 1995 Habeas Corpus petition in which human right activist cum lawyer K. Chandru ( played by Suriya ), who takes up the case of Irular tribe couple (Rajakannu and Sengeni) where the husband is wrongly convicted by local police for stealing ornaments from village head's house.As Jai Bhim opens, we see that cops segregating the prisoners based on their caste. Among all the caste, the tribal people becomes the easy target for the cops to clear the pending cases under the influence of their political head. We also see how Rajakannu, the main accused in the jewelry case, is forcibly taken away from his family. The film goes back in the flashback mode where life of the tribal couple is beautiful in the serene village where they hone the skills of catching rat for their bosses. As their life progresses, in one of the event Rajakannu and his brothers are caught for the crime which they did not commit. They go through extreme level of police harassment and torture which will be very hard to digest and is completely raw. Enter Chandra a.k.a Suriya who takes up the case when Sengeni narrates the entire incident and request to help find her husband who as per police, has been absconding from the jail.Jai Bhim is one such hair-raising film which is definitely difficult to digest as it gives you goosebumps and eye-popping experience. Screenplay is the hero with nail-biting moments. Art direction is fine while Cinematography is excellent. Suriya is a knight in shining armor. Watch out for him in the second half when he questions the witnesses in the courtroom. It is unforgettable performance which should be lauded for its sheer brilliance. Among the actors - Manikandan and Lijomol Jose are mind-blowing with their natural performances. Prakash Raj does well as IG.Jai Bhim is an experience that needs to be lauded for its impeccable direction, electrifying performances and beautiful message. Excellent 4/5.",

J. Gnanavel deserves praise for letting the story take the driver's seat, never reducing to unnecessary 'massy' sequences or masala elements to drive the narrative forward.Lijimol Jose as the wife of Rajakannu (played by Manikandan) is an absolute force of nature in her role, delivering some of the best sequences in the film, turning in a performance a veteran would be proud of.Prakash Raj as usual excels in a supporting role while and Rajisha Vijayan had precious little screen time to make any sizeable impact.The music from Seal Roldan played very significant role, helping the audience to feel the pain of the beleaguered protagonists in the beginning and that of vindication and righteousness towards the climax.Jai Bhim does not rise up to the emotional highs of previous classic dramas based on custodial violence like Visaranai (2015) or Naandhi (2021) but is an immensely engrossing watch.

            "content": "Turns out, the movie is based on a real-life incident from 1993.In times when being a policeman is mostly glorified in Indian cinema, I wasn't expecting a movie about police brutality, something that's usually swept under the rugs, which makes this an important film in Tamil film industry and thanks to streaming services, in Indian Cinema.The storytelling does a great job of making you care enough for Rajakannu and Sengani (both brilliantly played, with Lijomol being the show stealer in this movie) that you empathize with them throughout the movie. Parts of the movie were brutal and hard to watch, don't be surprised if you find yourself shouting \"Okay that's enough! STOP!\" at the events that unfold. Suriya and Prakash Raj play their respective roles with just enough intensity, nothing over the top with this one. Acting by all of the support cast was very well done.As much as this film is about police brutality, this is also about casteism, which is still prevalent in our great country. Movies, both good and bad ones, in the past on this topic have been made, but you can tell if the script is trying too hard to highlight the caste system. This one, I thought, did it just right and didn't overdo it.If you HAVE to, you can find things wrong with the movie - some cinematic liberty, the \"comedic\" elements, some \"mass moments\", were all necessary IMO. That said, this isn't the kind of movie you find flaws in, but the kind that you watch, and learn and grown from as a person. So, I'd request that you simply appreciate the filmmaking, empathize with the characters and learn a thing or two takeaways for real life.",

Suriya brings another firebrand performance after SP, and delivers with his impeccable dialogue delivery and mannerism. I'm glad they didn't add any unnecessary mass/commercial scenes just because it is a Suriya film, and even the songs went along with the story instead destroying the pace. Another important mention is Lijomol Jose's performance as the Irular women who nailed it in every scene.If I had to nitpick some minor negatives in the movie. It would be the antagonists. While they did a satisfactory job, perhaps having a more intelligent lawyer to counter Suriya would have added to more intensity, however this barely impacts the film. The runtime could have also been shortened by 10-15 minutes.Jai Bhim is a fantastic movie and frankly I was more emotionally moved by it than Soorarai Pottru. The movie is an eye-opener to police brutality, but isn't over the top in its police bashing either. Instead it provides nuanced perspectives from well-meaning police officers (pay attention to Prakash Raj's role) in an attempt to support a more just legal system.Rating: 9.5/10.",

It breaks your heart throughout the event. Jai Bhim is thoughtful in the sense that it will keep you thinking about who is really the culprit in today's society. Finally it will gives you a silver lining throughout the dark episode. An intellectual war between constitution and unconstitutional surpassing caste creed and divisons.Now coming to the movie, Suriya plays the role of a dedicated lawyer. He works for upliftment of the downtrodden and provides justice. He plays the part well, no nonsense behavior normally done by the protagony of south movies. The antagony is well represented. Means he is perfect outwardly but a devil inside. A genuine depiction of villains in real world. The movie progresses as a war between justice and injustice that finally gives an optimistic ending. Like a ray appearing in the dark. The message of awareness that we should cultivate rearding oppression done by law keepers is a mandatory nowadays. I shall remember movies like Jai bhim and Ardh Satya regarding the social issues. Both are good though opposed to one another in story.Prakash Raj is good to watch esp in Positive role. The performances are praiseworthy. All possible edges are covered makes you seated. The BGM is of heightened feel. It is a positive themed movie. One of the best from south. Recommended for social issues in Indian context. It's a strong point also that the movie is based upon a true story, but there is a minor political issue attached with it. It is modified so is slightly unreal with unreal vibes throughout. So a 90/100.",

I feel so much guilty that we are still carrying the burden of this 2500 years old rotten caste system where our fellow human beings are still treated worse than animals. As if the actors have not acted, it feels like I am watching CCTV footage! There is minimal heroism, maximum expression. There is not much court room drama, still the pace of the story is intense. The police and system which were supposed to protect us, provide everybody equal rights for survival, in reality literally killing people based on their surnames!!! :-( This movie based on a real life story on tribal rights made me sad, this movie made me hopeful too!

            "content": "It's always nice to see a star like Suriya move away from a typical masala flick for Diwali and come up with a hard-hitting courtroom drama based on actual events. In the film, he is more of a tool that helps enact justice for the oppressed victims. There's no showy entry, songs that praise him to the skies, or stock heroines who exist only to admire him. Instead, the film focuses more on the tribal characters played by Manikandan and Lijomol (both excellent) and the series of unfortunate events that they go through.Police brutality has been a sensitive topic, touched upon by very few films and filmmakers, even when we keep hearing several such cases in the news. Films like Visaranai and Karnan paved the way for TJ Gnanavel's Jai Bhim to tell a harrowing social issue without the need to be preachy. Jai Bhim's first hour is a somewhat disturbing watch, with the cries of the oppressed both tugging at your heartstrings and coming across as slightly amplified. There's no subtlety at play. The punches are wholly felt, the screams are heard loud and clear. If you still don't, Sean Roldan's woeful score will drive the point home.But the film gets infinitely better in its final hour. While the finale isn't exactly unpredictable, the journey of getting there is riveting. Both Suriya and Prakash Raj deliver the goods gracefully - not for once, getting in our faces with loud monologues. At a length of 2h 45m, Jai Bhim works due to its performances and topical relevance. Glad that a mainstream audience gets to see it on OTT.",

His wife with the help of a lawyer try very hard to bring justice and find out what exactly happened.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie but soon enough I understood that it will be an amazing movie. The plot is very interesting and it contained plenty of unexpected plot twists that made it even more interesting. The interpretations of Suriya who played as Chandru and Lijo Mol Jose who played as Senggeni were very good and they made the difference. In addition to this, the direction which was made by T. J. Gnanavel who is also the writer, it was equally good and he presented very well both the plot and his main characters, something that made possible for the audience to relate to them. Lastly, I have to say that \"Jai Bhim\" is an interesting drama movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",

            "content": "We Indians live in binaries since our votes are mostly emotionally driven. When we love a film star in the film or the cause it discusses, we are hypercharged and want to give it a 10. Just the way Vishwaroopoam was. Vishwaroopam had 9.8/10 with more than 30k votes back in 2013 when Indian films barely touched 10k votes (pre-jio era).The same is happening with Jai Bhim, which is currently at 9.6/10 in above 70k votes. Diving a little deeper into the vote analysis, it shows 62k votes is 10/10. That would mean, the film has been voted as one of the rarest of rare flawless pieces of art to ever come out in the world of films. I think I have rated about 4 films 10/10. Not to say this does not deserve a 10/10. But the film receiving a perfect score from more than 88% of the total votes is an extreme coincidence, especially when the top 1000 voters on IMDb have a weighted average of 4/10 - not 6, not 8, only 4/10 for the film. The funny thing is, 3.5% of them have voted it 1/10 as well. Let's compare this with another fan-driven top 10 IMDb film \"The Dark Knight\". The Dark Knight has a combined percentage of 10/10 and 1/10 of 46.3% against Jai Bhim's cumulative 91.5% in 10/10 and 1/10.Not saying this could not be possible, but this clearly seems like a large section of the audience is voting on the basis of the biased emotional rush. We saw similar instances with Wanted (2008) when this had just come out. However, this has reduced by a huge margin for Salman Khan films in the last 5-6 years with growing awareness on the mediocrity of bhai's films where even the fans now feel illiterate on praising his work. But considering the Hero worship in the Tamil and the Telugu films industry combined with a cause many people strongly resonate with, I am sure many things have been overlooked while judging this particular film. We saw this happen with Baahubali as well, no doubt it is an entertaining film but not without flaws. I am sure, so is this and many other such films.",

I don't know what amazon paid but , this is rated at 9.7 in IMDB with over 30k ratings, what ever it is , they hit a jack pot.But why not in theatres , why not? , I don't mind OTT, bussiness but when I am unable to watch India's top rated movie in a theatre , it's injustice.@actorsuriya , it's criminal not releasing it on the Big screen.Finally .All men/Women are born and created equal no matter to whome and where they are born.Everyone is the same in the eyes of law, be it a king or the sweeper .#jaibhim\n#movie #tamil #tribal #court #drama #equalityP.

A bitter reality... in last 5 years In the last five years, a total of 300 caste-related murders have been reported in Tamil Nadu and most victims were Dalits. At least two Dalits are assaulted every hour in 21st-century India, and every day, three Dalit women are raped, two Dalits are murdered and two Dalit homes are torched on average. Over 200 million Dalits, who comprise nearly 17% of India's population, face the threat of such violence daily (Ref: Wire)\nThe apotheosis of the protagonist and few unnecessary jail sequences however takes away the focus from the underlying tribal issue .. but it does not fail to deliver a strong message and demands one to introspect.. thought provoking, based on true story ..

Yaa, whether it drills down to the level of torture shown in this movie maybe a point to debate, and I am not the correct person to judge all that.Coming to incidents shown, power pack performance by leads or the spine chilling atmosphere is all on top and needs no explanation. I mean, I had seen Suriya's many films and this one is not behind any.But, this being said, I still see few hiccups and those, as per me, should have been taken care of. Somehow, I tend to compare this courtcase with Jolly LLB. Even if both are totally opposite yet they ooze out same problem: injustice to lower class or below poverty line people. And that's when I see Boman Irani giving tight fight to Arshad Warsi. However, in here, the story seemed focused on solving the case and some how, inclined towards Suriya, as a lawyer. PP wasn't doing much, and Attorney General's entry looked gloomy, naive and just for the sake. I mean, if this story is based on real life incidents, then was that person unprepared to anything. And also, if that is the case, and he was a probable MP candidate, then who made him to whatever level he was. At this stage, people do their level best to win rather just mock around and at the end face the blow.Anyways, if to keep aside that aspect, the movie is good and no doubt worth a watch.",

            "content": "One of the exceptional, outstanding movies of Hot Chocolate, Hot Shot, Actor Suriya (Younger Killer Looks). Court drama that is so thoroughly astonishing & engaging right from the start of the movie. Distinctively unique, even from the very first 5-10 minutes. Definitely from the lines of \"Visaranai\", I am getting used to the recent cinematic legal works such as Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, these kind of thought-provoking scripts is fast catching up as a trending inspiration for all film makers.In his Brave & Bold attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks about custodial violence, police cover-up, systemic corruption at a huge level, that is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole truth and finally there would be no end to the entire picture. The blame game is never ending.I can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is actually truly-brutally honest, clear-cut reality filled with heart-wrenching scenes, that is sure to leave you feeling that there is more bad in this world than good.One can praise Actor Suriya for his super star performance that is so shockingly awesome, only to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has done a wonderful job of acting so well & so concealed, that I just forgot him in the process, being so much involved in the amazing narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the writer TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.Huge round of applause for the extreme level beautiful Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this movie it s core life & the element of suspense. Music by Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own way, made me feel pain and all kinds of emotions throughout the film. Other actors namely Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his sensible acting portions for a supporting role, while Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and especially K. Manikandan who earned the merit of a special mention. One wonders how he actually did all those gruesome scenes.The director unquestionably has to be awarded for the stupendous success of this movie which solely entertains family audiences without depending upon masala factor or \"mass\"components.I would definitely watch it again as it was based on detailed portrayal of true events & people!Hats off to the entire Cast & Crew, Team of Jai Bhim! Cheers!Original Content By Ar Deepika Dhilip.",

The plot is about a tribal who is wrongfully arrested for stealing jewellery and police use third degree to force him to confess. The narrative is gripping as it first shows the police version and alternates with scenes of actually what happened.Director TJ Gnanvel deserves credit for making a riveting movie based on a taut screenplay focusing on the oppression faced by the marginalised tribals. There is raw realism as we see them catching rats for food and struggling to make an existence with dignity. Their way of life both in the sad and happy moments are shown well. I felt that that the director has been inspired by the work of Shyam Benegal and Prakash Jha.Limo Mol Jose who has played the role of the suffering wife has done a superb job. No less impressive is actor K Manikandan as the harassed victim. Suriya plays a brave lawyer- crusader who takes on the entire police department in order to deliver justice to the pregnant wife of the tribal. Veteran Prakash Raj is impressive as IG, police. The acting of all is high class.The courtroom scenes have been shot skillfully and are absorbing. It is clear that the self respect , dignity and human rights of the tribal community are on trial here against the all powerful police and bureaucratic state machinery. The movie has excellent cinematography and editing.Despite the scenes of excessive police brutality (custodial third degree), the movie should be on the \"must see list\" due to its overall excellence.",

            "content": "Looks like those who have watched Jai Bheem are already divided in two groups. The ones belonging to the segment which has superliked this innocuously immature movie and are championing it to be a messiah of their lost ideology and those who are considering this as a threat to their existence. It has a rating of 9.6 on IMDB and yet to come in the top 250 list of the database provided by the site even after securing nearly 56k votes when this review is being written, a proof of the fact that something is wrong with the metrics and the effervescent rating will overcome the emotional doldrums and will stabilize soon after the initial emotions doze off. This shows how people belonging to any particular political ideology have strongly voted in favor of this movie. On the other hand, the way this movie is being slammed by some so called 'Film Pundits' or the 'Protectors of the nation' on several social media platforms show their unnecessary fear of losing their propaganda politics for a mere movie. The real metrics of IMDB will come into action when the initial zeal will die off from both the parties. Wait till that day to be too biased by any judgmental review.'Jai Bhim' is an honest endeavour to champion the spirit of protecting the rights of our indigenous people. The movie has its heart in the right place. The depiction of the brutality meted out to our innocent tribals invokes pity. But that in no way makes a movie scale the heights of greatness. In no way, Jai Bhim succeeds in being obstinate to the popular demands and reach new heights of glory in terms of movie making. It is melodramatic from the beginning to the end and even though it has its effervescent moments of greatness it fails to live with it.The movie is a strange admixture of movie making of the present-day style of real-life storytelling and the bland, over emotional way of direction, reminiscent of the 90s style of creating a movie. The entry of the protagonist in many scenes are made to invite whistle from the audience, uncalled for a movie belonging to this genre at this age when people expect a movie with this much sincerity in its intention to be grounded, uncompromising and undeterred by the lure of commercial gains.But the pursuits of 'Jai Bhim' are unfathomably ambitious, to an extent that it fails to be realistic in its portrayal of the plight of the tribal people. Right from the inception of the story, where a sarpanch is pressurizing the SP to catch an innocent tribal till the trial in the court in presence of a buffoonery AG of the state, the movie is bubbled to shed its earthliness and thus fails to arouse any real emotion. The torture scenes are brutal, naked yet they do not conform to the storyline and appear to be exaggerated.Surya as the protagonist is good but at times appears to be lost in agendas and a weak screenplay does not allow him to come out of the shell. Prakash Raj is hyperideologist and does not have any connection with the ground realities. The ones donning the roles of Raja and Singani are brilliant though.The reason why communist flags are being shown again and again and those went missing while the narration was leading to a conclusive end is nebulous. Communists or their ideologies or flags have been shown as mere agenda or objects appearing only when the screenplay needed them not when the situation demanded them. The intentions of the petty police officials are unclear and why the AG is hellbent on supporting them even when he is refuting the SP is also equally hazy. The theory of monetary benefits could not be well established.Overall, this movie should be hailed for its honest intention in portraying the plight of the oppressed sections of the society. Only the execution could have been better.The cherubic style of the little kid is the best takeaway from this movie.My Rating- 7 out of 10.",

It's a good thought. But in the real incident (based which this movie was made) the sub inspector was a Christian but in the movie his character was modified into an upper caste man. Why Anthony Das becomes Guru here? All other main character names are retained. The original characters have been intentionally replaced to target specific communities who are against the Surya's favorite Ruling party. Only because their minority appeasement will come to stake or there will be a question mark on their so called secularism ideology. The moment I saw Periyar (person who was believed to fight against discrimination, but filled with hatred towards hindu traditions) I was disgusted.

Jai Bhim presents a story about injustice and presents it in a way that showcases the power of the people, the empowerment of the oppressed and how the legal system can achieve justice if good people are willing to fight for the good cause and the film tells this story in a gripping way,Everyone must watch to know the state of the society we are in and the souls that suffer silently everyday.",

That was pretty gory and intense. In this film, the grunts, moans, wails, and the actors curls make up most of the film not to mention a plethora of unnecessary shots including of the actor who is playing his own character rather than the character role of Chandru, the lawyer.An illustration of this in recent times wud be Sully played by Tom Hanks where Tom doesnt play Tom, the actor, but Sully the pilot. Again in Concussion, Will Smith doesnt play Will, the movie star, but Dr. Omalu a pathologist. Maybe its not the actors but an inadequacy on the directors for failing to make a charcter driven film which this essentially was supposed to be.",

            "content": "Review By Kamal KJai Bhim is said to be a story inspired by the real experiences of Justice Chandru. The movie holds the mirror to the ugly side of caste discrimination in the country even today. The fact that many people languish in jails without an opportunity to prove their innocence and the way the system treats them is highly disturbing.The first half of the film starts with the description of the lifestyle of the tribals. Director Gnanavel has shown their innocence, how they are deprived of a decent living and recognition, and how they are discriminated against in society. Once the crime scene starts, the police brutality is very disturbing and is certainly not for the faint-hearted.Suriya enters the proceedings almost half an hour into the film but you do not miss him. Sinna Thalli narrates the story to him and that episode ends with a heart-warming scene. Chandru is disturbed by the fact how Sinna Thalli can not even sign the petition but it is immediately followed by a shot in which Sinna Thalli's daughter writes her name on a slate. The scene indicates the fate of tribals and also carries a message that only education can change their fate.The courtroom drama follows after that. If there is one drawback for the film, these are the portions. We expect courtroom drama to be intense from both sides. But then, the other side is so meek. It is although all the evidence walks up to Chandru and submits themselves. And, there are the culprit police who admit to everything with minimal grilling.But then, we do not feel that or finish the movie with that feeling. The director constantly makes us feel the pain of the affected family and pulls the heartstrings with emotions. Lijo Mol Jose who played Sinna Thalli plays a crucial role here. She has put up a spectacular show so that audience will connect to her plight. Even though the climax is not spectacular, we connect to the cause and cherish the justice done to Rajanna's family.Despite being based on a true incident, showing some things in the film by changing it is also one of the negative points of the film.Performances -I didn't felt that Surya acted in this movie, I felt that he is the original Chandru in each and every bit and scene of the movie.The next two standout characters are not the seniors like Rao Ramesh and Prakash Raj. It is Manikandan and Lijo Mol Jose who played Rajanna and Sinna Thalli who were exceptional. Rao Ramesh and Prakash Raj were good in the roles they are given. We somehow feel Rao Ramesh's characterization needs some more fireworks. Rajisha Vijayan is okay in a small role. The rest of the characters are fine to the extent they are expected to perform.All in all, Jai Bhim is a Good watch on Amazon Prime Video.",

            "content": "Jai Bhim (2021) :\nMovie Review -Tamil Cinema has brought some really good films this year. Not just good but meaningful ones. Films like 'Pebbles', 'Mandela' and 'Karnan' have brought major social issues into spotlight. Director T. J. Gnanavel's latest offering 'Jai Bhim' is another superb addition in the list. However, it's like a stone turned into Silver when it could have been Gold, if wanted. Jai Bhim attempts a very sensitive issue in a hard hitting narrative but while doing so, it misses a few things that could have made it a Sensational Film. Anyways, it's a great one time watch and surely does some much needed hammering on \"The System\".Based on a true incident in 1993, the film follows Sengani (Lijomol Jose) and Rajakannu (K. Manikandan), a couple from the Irular tribe. The latter is convicted by the police due, and later goes missing from the police station. Senggeni seeks the help of an advocate Chandru (Suriya) to seek justice for her husband. It's not a fight between low caste and high caste or corrupt police officers, but it's a fight against the entire system. When the first born of the lands are treated like slaves, your blood surely boils but what can these low grade people do against highly influential people? Law is same for all and that's the biggest weapon they have. Jai Bhim is too disturbing and devastating at moments. Some scenes in the film are unbearable (for weak hearted) but because its storyline demands the same uncompromised vision, you don't get a chance to point a finger at it.The performance of Suriya is the biggest reason why this film can be recommended to everyone. Supporting him, Prakash Raj, K. Manikandan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh, Rajisha Vijayan and M. S. Bhaskar put out their best in their individual roles. The entire acting unit in Jai Bhim is commendable. Talking about the flaws, the film fails to remain steady throughout the narrative. This entire thing takes 164 minutes to wrap up the same old Ambedkar-oriented stuff, why? That grip over the content is not tight enough to hold such a socially important topic.When it comes to the positives, one has to mention the writer first. Gnanavel's on-paper draft is astonishing and eye-opening stuff. Sadly, his direction is not upto the mark as required but it's fairly decent. In some scenes, you just can't stop loving his directorial skills. For instance, whenever there's Suriya on the screen thinking of something, you hear that intense background music which creates that atmosphere around you. Those speeches on morals, fundamental rights and equality will end up with your claps. Unfortunately, some scenes have been dragged for no reason and over-dramatized for the sake emotional quotient. Also, the predictable nature of the script is too typical. It works sometimes because you cannot bear seeing those brutal and painful scenes of obscene tyranny. Excluding couple of mistakes done by the director, nothing seems to bother too much. Jai Bhim has an extraordinary story to tell, which deserves your viewing but it gets an ordinary vision to showcase it on screen. Had it been taken care of, Jai Bhim would have been a nationwide sensation.RATING - 6.5/10*",

You should go before that..somewhere something got stolen, they randomly pick any such memeber of a such a tribe and put into jail, case over....\nNow coming to the moviee..

Although Surya hardly smiles in this movie, people will him for his excellent acting and emotions, very good movie from him once again after 'Soorarai Pottru'.Keeping the communal aspects apart, it has really good message for everyone, how important education is for everyone to grow and speak up.

            "review_title": "A gut wrenching and heartbreaking film that is a must watch for everyone.",
            "content": "This is not an entertainment film. Jai Bhim is more of an educational film that needs to be seen by everyone. Jai Bhim shows us a reality that we conveniently ignore and overlook, because it's too ugly and depressing, and we just want beauty and positivity in our life. We are fed with movies like Sooryavanshi, where policemen have superhuman abilities and are always acting in the best interests of the people, but the true picture is very different from the one shown to us by the likes of Rohit Shetty. We as human beings do not believe in the concept of \"always punch up\", we derive pleasure out of exploiting the poor, weak and the downtrodden. We have turned ourselves into the monsters that we used to read about in the fairytales as kids. 'Jai Bhim' shows us the mirror that we just don't have the courage to look into.WHAT'S GOOD IN THE FILM :1. Suriya leads from the front with his confident portrayal of Chandru. Every dialogue that he delivers is said with full conviction, and creates a deep impact on the viewer making us believe that a person like him would surely embed fear into the minds of his opponents. Suriya is just outstanding in the film.2. While some movies find pleasure in showing policemen as superheroes who can do no wrong, Jai Bhim doesn't shy away from showing the reality. Extreme level of police torture, kicking and beating women, implicating innocent people in false cases and arresting them, taking orders from politicians and rich people, it's all there in the film. The movie throws light on the mindset of corrupt police officers who don't have any kind of respect for any kind of law.3. The movie throws light on the life of people who belong to an extremely lower caste, people who aren't even considered worthy of having a voter I card or a proper house made of bricks. These lower caste people are left to do the dirty work for us, but in return they aren't even considered as equals. They don't get any kind of empathy, compassion or love from the upper caste people, all they get is hatred and disdain. After watching a movie like this, some introspection is necessary, we need to think about what we have made ourselves, what are we teaching our children. What kind of human beings are we, if we can't even treat others with the same love and respect that we want for ourselves ?4. The climax of the film is bound to give you goosebumps and make you cry. Your heart needs a special kind of medical attention if you don't get emotional at the sight of a mother and her daughter folding hands thanking Chandru, while getting drenched in the rain. The final scene is bound to make you cry a little, but at the same time will bring a smile to your face.WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD IN THE FILM :1. The lawyers are too weak. In every court battle, Chandru (Suriya) wins quite easily. I agree, he is well versed with all the rules of the court, has all the facts, but his opponents are shown to be extremely incompetent, with nothing in their mind to counter Chandru's statements. I don't think it's that easy to win a court battle. In fact, the prosecution often ends up taking advantage of the loopholes in the Legal system of India.2. The movie is too long. The pacing is also an issue here. Every scene that has Suriya in it is extremely powerful, but once he moves out of the scene, the movie slows down. This movie would not have been the same without Suriya's stellar act. Jai Bhim's inconsistent screenplay and direction do not allow for it to be called a great film.Overall, Jai Bhim is a movie that deserves to be seen by each one of us. It may not be a perfect film, but one needs to ignore the shortcomings in a movie like this. Despite all the things that weigh it down, 'Jai Bhim' remains an extremely strong and relevant film with powerful performances from Suriya, Lijo Jose and Prakash Raj. Jai Bhim is the story of defiance, standing up for what's right and fighting against the evil society that doesn't even consider you worthy of being called a human being. 'Jai Bhim' is a must watch.",

The film talks about the injustice that happened to the Irular community. It is not a caste film, it's all about equality. Very bold direct portrayal of casteist discrimination & demonic police brutality. Another landmark film from Jyotika-Suriya's 2D Entertainment.No forced romance, no song-dance, no stunts, no needless heroism! Nadippin Nayagan is 100% the Kadhaiyin Nayagan here. Immense maturity shown by the star actor to let the story take prominence and play within it's boundaries! Yes, Suriya steals the show but special mention to Lijo Mol Jose and Manikandan, they have given their heart & soul to the film, stellar performances from both of them and the whole cast. Full credit to Tha. Se Gnanavel for discovering & bringing out such a case - it's brutal, twisted and the intensity in the film is supreme. A must-watch powerful courtroom drama.",

When covering the issue of caste discrimination, it does not shy away from all the horrific ways the authorities inflict injustice on the tribal group. Throughout the film, they exist to the police only as useful scapegoats to inflate their arrest records as they don't have the wealth or social status to defend themselves. This is all portrayed in a tense and brutal way as the actors always show they are in constant anguish and it never shies away from direct violence (which got too much at times). It strikes a fine balance between cynicism and hope, as embodied by the main lawyer character who is a reluctant hero and is pessimistic about the missing men but is defiant enough to try to find them anyway. My main concern with the film was the odd editing as time skips around a lot in very confusing ways, especially when there are so many characters.",

            "content": "Jai Bhim, a film based on a true story, inspired by real events. This is a movie that will move even the coldest of hearts.Jai Bhim focuses on police brutality against tribals/lower caste people. The way the cops will falsely arrest them and charge them with whatever crimes they feel like, along with how they have no way to fight back against this oppression. The storyline is absolutely fantastic, it has twists and turns that will have you questioning what really happened. It gets the viewer emotionally invested in the plights of it's main characters Rajakannu and his wife Sengeni, two tribals living a simple, yet happy life until Rajakannu is falsely imprisoned for committing a crime, he didn't commit, and is beaten to death by the local cops while in jail.These tribals or low caste people, don't even own the land they live on or have documents to show they exist as people. The movie follows the lawyer Chandru, who is one of the few people who seems to care about justice for everyone, not just the rich or higher caste people. He doesn't charge a single cent for human rights cases and when Sengeni comes to him asking for help, they fight an uphill battle to prove what really happened to Rajakannu. It may seem like just a single case, but in reality it's a turning point, it's a chance at a better life for all tribals.What makes this movie so great is the absolutely fantastic acting performances delivered by Lijomol Jose (Sengeni), K. Manikandan (Rajakannu), Suriya (Chandru), Rajisha Vijayan (Mythra), Prakash Raj (IG Perumalsamy) and the rest of the supporting cast. Every single one of them puts their absolute heart and soul into the characters they're playing. They bring them to life on screen and now that we are viewing them as real, live, living people, we can't help but become emotionally invested in the movie and the story and plight of the Irula people. When Sengeni cries, your heart wrenches at the sound, when her daughter Alli Rajakannu (Baby Joshika Maya) screams for her daddy or mummy it will being tears to your eyes.A brilliant, raw and powerful storyline, combined with a talented cast to bring it to life and you've got an amazing movie. The fact it's based on real events that have happened, just reaches out to the minds, hearts and souls of every single person who sees it. The director knew what he was doing, what he wanted from his cast and production team, and in the end everyone delivered.There is no big dance numbers in the movie, though there is a song or two. They are well placed to not disrupt the movies story, but that still help to build on it. The songs themselves are really lovely and I'll definitely be listening to them a few more times.A beautiful movie from Tamil cinema, which deals with real life issues that conveys a powerful message to its audience. This is truly what cinema is about, not the trash that is thrown out, a dime a dozen nowadays in Hollywood. A extremely well deserved 10/10 from me.Jai Bhim, Jai Chandru, Jai Hind! Justice for all!",

His nuanced performance, umpteen moments where he conveys everything with the mere movement of eyes, a raised eyebrow and so forth is fascinating to watch.Of course, the hard work that went into both the making and the performance by Suriya is evident and applause worthy.What stands above all are the real people whose story this is.

The story progresses in snail's pace and it's oh so predictable and cliche. Yes, I get it, it's based on a true story, but what matters in cinema is not what the story is, but how it is presented.Jai Bhim isn't by any account a bad movie. I think it's a decent one. But like literally every legal drama movie ever made in Tamil cinema, it falls victim to overestimating its appeal. Do we really need the exaggerated slow-mo's, the over dramatic profiles and the intrusively annoying musical numbers to have effectively told this story?The worst part about this movie is its characters. They lack an enormous amount of depth. I still wonder why the character of M S Baskhar even existed in the movie, if not to annoy us with literally every word he says, effectively bogging the movie down with him. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy and think he's an amazing actor, but he was so poorly written overall in this movie. And that is true for Suriya as well. The character has nothing to set him apart from what you might expect from an exaggerated \"goody\" lawyer.The movie is 160-something minutes long. That is a painstakingly long time to have to sit through a movie with so little substance. If they had cut down on everything they thought would make it a commercial movie, and had stuck with only the meat of it, they could have made it into an amazing 90-100 minute experience of high spirits and emotions. But no, you just had to drag it for as long as you did.I don't hate the movie, if not for feeling like it wasted one extra hour of my attention it deserved to have. It's at least a decent one, but nothing close to the amount of praise it gets. But hey, I'm in the minority here, so who knows...",

Majority of people have it 10 and this review will be explaining my ratingI went into the film with a pre-existing judgement that it will be a very preachy unoriginal story relying on identity politics and though I can't say I was completely proved wrong,I have to admit that I did enjoy the film well.'Jai Bhim' has a very boring unoriginal first act and a short second act and has a very black-or-white approach with only three class of humans:The Oppressors,The Opressed and The Savior. The real world never works that way and there needs to be a lot more nuance in depicting an issue of such magnitude. When I said three classes,I meant that those belonging to any label has no other personality trait other than being Extremely Evil,Extremely helpless or Extremely Virtuous. This type of apporach would work well for a film like 'Karnan' which has a very dreamy,mythical and fairy-tale approach,a reason why the film is so great. But for a film like 'Jai Bhim' which is supposed to be grounded in reality and only having slight dramatization,this falls flat and feels very \"rubbing it on the face\".But after the first 1/3 rd,the film becomes a very entertaining court-room thriller despite its dramatisations and takes a more nuanced approach to the issue and its depiction even though 'The Saviour' character of Surya still remains an unrealistically holy and virtuous persona.The final act where justice is served was satisfying and brought this entertainer to a decent end. However the film could have made some effort to show that the actual trial which the film is based on actually took years to reach its final verdict instead in the film it feels like everything became well and fine within a couple of months which in the harsh and cruel reality of the Indian Judiciary,never happensSurya,who now has matured as an actor gives a very decent performance with just enough drama to make it entertaining while not over-doing it to the point of meladroma. Lijomol Jose gives her career-best performance though I found the use of black-face to be slightly offensive.The digital cinematography is just ok and does not have much signifance as this is heavily plot driven. I did see some fan theories of hidden symbolism. Editing was good. An odd thing about this script and screenplay is that it feels like it was written by two different people. It is clumsy,unrealistic and rushed in the first third while the rest two thirds is solid and straight. The score and songs of this film was really magnificent.It is the turn which the film takes after the second act which made me give 8 stars instead of 7 while it is the overall clumsiness which prevents me from giving this 9.In essence,a decent cinematic work with high ambitions and low execution but which offers good entertainment.",

GNANVEL produced by 2D Entertainment...Verdict : Blockbuster......Lets go through the observation and mine review to this plot.....The story shows of.....1) The people belonging to low caste tribal people who are being squeezed and exploited badly by the society....2) How injustice can be done towards this group if the law is in the wrong people......3) \"Hail Bhim\" , \" Victory for Bhim\", slogan given by great Dr Ambedkar, but are these followed.... Still a question mark...The plot is based on a true story during 1995-96 in Tamil Nadu where a a group of low caste tribal are the prey for the merciless society non justifiable activities and how Advocate Chandru played by Suriya fights forms the rest part of the story....Performance wise, Lijomon Jose who portrayed the tribal women had given a spectacular performance.. Scenes where we cannot able to see, she has delivered the best... Now she will definitely bag good roles in Malayalam films.....Suriya, whether its Soorari Pottoru, Ghajini, Kaka Kaka, he has his own unique style of acting and that makes him different from other mass hero's....K. Manikadan portraying the tribal men also delivered the best performance... Cannot able to withstand on certain scene, as the director has able to take the shots very perfect, where a viewer will be in tears after some time or just a take a pause to come back to normalcy.....Film had shot an arrow towards the biased political system and the biased law where justice is a dream for many people who by their \" low caste\" stamped in their life being deprived their fundamental rights.... Its very ashameful moment to realise the weak spineless law system.....But it also shows if people like Advocate Chandru, NCB officer Sameer Wankhede exists the law will not be sold off to the wrong society....Overall a movie to know, to realize the attrocity when the law is at the wrong plate.",

            "content": "You would imagine that security forces and law are the two sides of the same coin and must always work hand in hand. Not true! Jai Bhim is the narrative of a real life incident and some real people where a fearless lawyer fights for the basic human rights of the underprivileged against the police force, dealing fire with fire in a backdrop of adversity.When heavily Sengenni's (Lijo Mol Jose) husband Rajakanna and two other relatives, all from an underprivileged and socially deprived tribe in Tamil Nadu go missing from the police custody without a trace, she runs from the pillar to the post to urge the authorities to help search for them. With no financial or economic resources, the helpless Sengenni finally finds kindness in Chandru (Suriya), a fearless lawyer who firmly believes that the police machinery has been given too much latitude and have turned into a maleficent force against the poor. After studying the details of the incidents that had originally led to the arrest of the three men and the subsequent events as described by Sengenni, Chandru is certain that the policemen are concealing the facts and are behind their disappearance. He agrees to take up the case and files a habeas corpus petition at the Chennai High Court against the police department, seeking assistance from the government to trace down the missing prisoners whose crime hasn't been proven.Jai Bhim is an intense investigation and courtroom drama that unfolds macabre events with diabolical consequences. Faced against the Attorney General fighting for protecting the policemen, Chandru faces an uphill task to unearth the facts that will eventually unmask the ugly truth. The film directed by T. J. Gnanavel showcases the naked chasm between the educated and civilised society and the marginalised scheduled castes and tribes, and is a glaring instance of the inequality that exists without our realisation. One of the hardest hitting films of our times, Jai Bhim is undoubtedly one in the calibre of the arthouse films of the 80's directed by Shyam Benegal, Govind Nihalani, M S Sathyu and Adoor Gopalakrishnan, and should be promoted to be India's entry for Oscars. Suriya is mighty impressive as the upright human rights lawyer fighting the case outwardly dispassionately, but seething from inside. Lijo Mol Joseph is a resounding reminder of Smita Patil's intense performances, showcasing angst and pathos in the most heart-rending manner. Rajisha Vijayan, Prakash Raj and Rao Ramesh offer great support. Yet I must laud the performance of Tamizh as the evil S. I. Gurumoorthy, the perpetrator of the excessive torture on the hapless trio, to rouse awareness of what goes on pice lock ups and how far reaching the power machinery can go to protect the real criminals.Don't miss Jai Bhim - it offers a wide range of emotional turmoil and makes for a gripping watch, standing out as one of the best films of recent times.",

            "content": "This film is based on true events that took place in Cuddalore district in 1993. In the original story, Rajakannu, a member of the Andai Kurumbar tribe whose main occupation was making bamboo baskets and agricultural labour, was accused of stealing jewels from a house that employed him. Based on the complaint, Rajkannu was taken into police custody.After suffering torture at the hands of the police, Rajakannu died in custody. To cover up their crimes, the local police moved his body late into the night, disposed of it in the neighbouring Tiruchirappalli (Trichy) district and later claimed that he had escaped from custody. Rajakannu's wife Parvathi, however, did not buy this story and sought help to locate her husband. Finally, she found a lawyer of the Madras High Court, K Chandru, who joined her quest for justice.K Chandru, who would later on become a well-respected and popular judge in the Madras High Court, filed a habeas corpus petition in the same court. After a 13-year legal battle, the court adjudicated that this was a case of custodial death and the accused police officials were sentenced to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment for the murder of Rajakannu. In an interview with The News Minute, he recalls how the police attempted to bribe Parvathi and him during the case. Chandru responded by throwing out the suitcase of money and the police from his office.Getting Parvathi justice for the custodial muder of her husband, however, is only one among the many incredible contributions of Justice K Chandru for the marginalised and downtrodden.In his six and a half years as a judge of the Madras High Court, he disposed of 96,000 cases, a remarkable feat which was only possible because of his immaculate planning and organisation.",

The film was more about glorifying Suriya the celebrity than the actual advocate role he was portraying. The score volume was too high, making it appear more like a heroic genre rather than accentuating the despicable state of events\n-Jai Bhim was told in a very common way: show the torture of the marginalized communities, expose police brutality, and have a centralized heroic figure that the audience can admire. The screenplay was not relatable and could have had stronger dialogues and scenario\n-Ooook....so Lijomol Jose (playing Sengeni) was 'darkened' in Jai Bhim to come across as a tribal woman....this is like the times when Hollywood used to darken white actors to play black roles. This is a little concerning that the production couldn't find an actual dark woman to play Sengeni.

Movie provide an insight into the plight of tribal folks and could help in a change of view. Pace and construct of the movie keeps you gripped despite the story being predictable.Negatives:\nMovie is too long and should have been wrapped under 2 hours. Movie tries to cash on regional jingoism like the scene where a man is slapped for speaking Hindi. Police brutality is very commonly presented subject and not a new theme.Overall a well made movie but if you are hoping to see a ground breaking masterpiece going by the ratings, then sorry this is not.",

It's surprising to see such a huge cast handled perfectly. Usually movie focuses on the lead characters. Here even the star Surya doesn't rise above the other cast. He proves his uniqueness among other Kollywood stars. It's sad n\nSongs are well suited to the tone of the movie.

G Perumal as a honest police officer.Remember the Mulk ( secularism controversy ) at a same time. This is the 2nd court hearing I love the most. (Atrocities on Tribal & below cast ) some scene are intolerable ( beaten scene of pregnant women & police kick on her husband's chest) like #Paatallok rape scene was. Pre production work for collection & study of evidences was superb. Finally that lady got Justice with truth but without her husband's life.The beauty was\n1.

            "content": "One of the exceptional, outstanding movies of Hot Chocolate, Hot Shot, Actor Suriya (Younger Killer Looks). Court drama that is so thoroughly astonishing & engaging right from the start of the movie. Distinctively unique, even from the very first 5-10 minutes. Definitely from the lines of \"Visaranai\", I am getting used to the recent cinematic legal works such as Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, these kind of thought-provoking scripts is fast catching up as a trending inspiration for all film makers.In his Brave & Bold attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks about custodial violence, police cover-up, systemic corruption at a huge level, that is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole truth and finally there would be no end to the entire picture. The blame game is never ending.I can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is actually truly-brutally honest, clear-cut reality filled with heart-wrenching scenes, that is sure to leave you feeling that there is more bad in this world than good.One can praise Actor Suriya for his super star performance that is so shockingly awesome, only to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has done a wonderful job of acting so well & so concealed, that I just forgot him in the process, being so much involved in the amazing narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the writer TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.Huge round of applause for the extreme level beautiful Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this movie it s core life & the element of suspense. Music by Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own way, made me feel pain and all kinds of emotions throughout the film. Other actors namely Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his sensible acting portions for a supporting role, while Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and especially K. Manikandan who earned the merit of a special mention. One wonders how he actually did all those gruesome scenes.The director unquestionably has to be awarded for the stupendous success of this movie which solely entertains family audiences without depending upon masala factor or \"mass\"components.I would definitely watch it again as it was based on detailed portrayal of true events & people!Hats off to the entire Cast & Crew, Team of Jai Bhim!

Many police characters were haunting. Even if I come across these actors in real life, It will create a sense of fear inside me.The success of the movie majorly lies in the fact there was no compromise just for the purpose of roping suriya into the movie.

An issue that I believe, should be construed as a topic of discussion more often!That being said, I'm still not fully convinced. Make no mistake, I wholeheartedly admire the cause as well as the initiative taken by the whole team but my biggest gripe is about its core treatment, which for better or worse has mostly been mass-centric. Probably due to the inclusion of superstar 'Suriya' in this narrative.Now, I do understand, why the creators might have taken such a lenient route! Their primary incentive was to reach a much broader base of the audience rather than limiting themselves to a niche category and in that regard, they went for the most reasonable choice vacant. But then again, a delicate subject like this, in my humble opinion, rather asks for an artsy & articulative way of storytelling.I'm in no way implying this was a bad attempt, not at all. On the contrary, I do appreciate the honesty and the audacity of the makers for even thinking about making such a movie that would dauntlessly question the injustices and would put a mirror on our administration and the jurisdiction for self-reflect. It's just that I beg to differ in the journeys taken not the destination it aspired to go to.",

They r tortured to confess the crime and during 3rd degree one dies. Trust me - it's not from crime patrol or savdhan india . It's from the highest rated movie on IMDB.3. The police is torturing them coz they are in poverty and living a life too low to protest. But this fact does not suite agenda so let's introduce caste.4. Here comes a cool-dude-version of Ambedkar who believes Ambedkar must be kept at par with Gandhi and Nehru. Not sure how many nanoseconds Mr Ambedkar passed in jail. With all due respect he has a reserved place for him in history. What does this question mean in movie is beyond human know abilities.5. Judges are shown in such a poor light that almost all witnesses from defence lie million times but they just excuse them with a funny face. Reality is that lying in court is contempt of court + damaging the credibility of entire case from the perspective of the accused7. Courtroom drama is presented in a very non-dramatic environment. Director fails miserably to make it look real. Who on the earth will believe the logic presented in the court?8. The entire story gets a positive end because of few key people - the doctor, the booth guy and the officer(Prakash raj). They all have been shown to belong to community of the accused. Still the hatred narrative is set against the community of accused.9. Lastly, the title - Jai Bhim ? Seriously ? It's a political slogan of a political party. You guys seriously wanted us to believe that the movie wanted to be justifiable and appreciable despite being politically motivated so much so that it's titled on a political slogan. Are we really jokers?10. Scan your own friend list and see how many people from these categories are there . Ask yourself - did you personally misbehaved with them for their cast?? No!

It's a good thought. But in the real incident (based which this movie was made) the sub inspector was a Christian but in the movie his character was modified into an upper caste man. Why Anthony Das becomes Guru here? All other main character names are retained. The original characters have been intentionally replaced to target specific communities who are against the Surya's favorite Ruling party. Only because their minority appeasement will come to stake or there will be a question mark on their so called secularism ideology. The moment I saw Periyar (person who was believed to fight against discrimination, but filled with hatred towards hindu traditions) I was disgusted. This movie is made to create hate towards certain communities which was unnecessary.",

            "content": "Jai Bhim. The voice of the voiceless and their faith in the justice system.Police terror and caste discrimination are not new in Tamil cinema, why Jai Bhim is set apart from others is because of the intensity in the presentation.Judgments are made in each court but to what extent can people gain faith in the court and the judiciary through those orders? Director TJ Gnanavel who wrote the screenplay and directed, reveals that belief moreover argues that not only those in power, but the oppressed also should have right to have a piece of land and justice for them on this earth.Jai Bhim's screenplay is based on a real-life incident that took place in Tamil Nadu in 1993, a legal battle fought by Sengani; the wife of a young man named Rajakannu with the support of Advocate Chandru played by Surya. In the real life when Chandru was a judge, he would ask lawyers in court not to call him 'My Lord' since he was neither at all interested in such expressions of power nor did he have a personal security, moreover he did not hesitate to declare his private property publicly. From the day he became a judge until the day he retired, he left his official vehicle and drove home on a local train. Justice Chandru has settled 96,000 cases in his notable judicial career, that too during his six and a half years as a judge.'Jai Bhim' directed by TJ Gnanavel, a biopic of Chandru (later Justice Chandru retired from the Madras High Court) is being discussed everywhere. The film is about the legal battle and victory of Rajakannu's widow Sengani against the police during 1996-97 with the help of Advocate Chandru. The Rajan case in Kerala is widely cited in the Habeas corpus case filed by Sengani to find Rajakannu.The film begins with those who are released from jail being segregated by caste, showing how much caste is deeply rooted awkwardly in our society even after so many years of Independence. Throughout the film we see the life of Irular (dark class) caste who are seen and ignored by society as slaves, the screenplay accurately canvassed their work, culture, food, and customs very precisely, the director never failed in detailing it throughout the film. The film says that the voice of the voiceless should be the judiciary system. There are many lessons to be learned from the Raja Kannu for the crime he did not commit and the tears of Pregnant Sengani who waited in hope for his release but in vain at the last. In spite of many years passed after independence, the Irular tribe does not own land or voter ID and ration cards, their social status is conducive to being prosecuted in unproven cases.When it comes to actors, the first thing to mark is Actress Lijo Mol who came as dark skinned Sengani, has succeeded in conveying all her agony to the audience with minute actions precisely, a national award will be on the way to her.Actor Manikandan who essayed the crucial and pivotal role Rajakannu has been basking in the glory of the incredible success who had the strenuous job of interpreting the character that has various stratums of complex emotional phases. He did a fabulous job and the whole story revolves around his innocence and the torture he had undergone by the corrupted power. He tailored his character so astonishingly, the audience felt they are getting the Police brutality and pain.Surya reaching as Chandru is extra ordinary in his performance keeping aside his usual introduction BGM, Slow motion, dances and acrobatic stunts and has to be appreciated first, for making such a film to bring out the life of the suppressed to public and secondly for playing such a convincing role 100 percent loyal to real Lawyer Chandru and giving more screen space for the character Rajakannu. When Sengani describes her plight, the slightest movement in the muscles of Chandru's face is enough to understand how much Surya, the actor, is drawn into the role.The director made a detailed study to communicate his feelings through the screenplay to the audience and in one scene, we can see the reference related to the Rajan murder case during the state of emergency in Kerala, Chandru argued in the Madras High Court at that time that this case (Rajakannu) should be seen in the same way as the Rajan case and filed a habeas corpus. Jai Bhim travels with Sengani, Rajakannu follwed by Chandru, their tears are burning in the audience's chest.Prakash Raj as IG Perumal Swamy, who slaps a Hindi-speaking witness in the face with a dialogue 'Tamil Pesuda', (Speak in Tamil) evokes the anti-Hindi Dravidian spirit inherent in Tamils. All the supporting actors are real people from Irular Caste, never familiar with any modern visual medias, hats off to director bringing them in the frame as it is.After watching Jai Bhim the movie goer definitely will be in a state of trauma as Rajakannu's and Sengani's quandary sink deep down in their heart, and at the outset that's the success of the film.",

And i saw few comments saying that this movie has violence and communist ideologies. I think those didn't aware this movie inspired by the true incident that happened way back in 1993. A man named Rajakannu from the Irular tribe was falsely framed in a theft case. The horrific death of Rajakannu due to the custodial torture was a challenging and landmark legal battle for Justice K. Chandru is a former Madras High Court Judge appointed by President Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam to the Madras High Court. When the victim's wife Sengani (real name Parvathi) came to the lawyer for help and the case trail was happened 15 years and he is not charging a single rupee for this case.And some people say that this movie portrait hight violence, in the recent interview by Chandru told that the violence portrait in the movie is not even a 50% shown in the movie and he told that police removed dress oof rajakannu and his mother and beaten them to have intercourse in front of them. The people who watched this move in the 52 inch LED with high end sound system will not understand the pain of the oppressed people. The worst part is still this kind of incident is still happening around us. As said by the nation award winner director Vetrimaran this year, people who don't link the social justice will not support this kind of movies and this is not wondering any more.Jai Bhim is the power full word to protect oppressed people, this move dose that very well and this kind of move is very important to the society.

            "content": "Where I lived in Patna, a community called Mushahar lived around us. Shriek cries of pigs being hunted and skinned, their catch of field rats and squirrels that they displayed, their habitat and drunken squabbles bothered our middle-class sensibilities a lot. Even in those urban surroundings, we were all told to take care of our belongings from these nomadic urchins. 'Jai Bhim' took me back to those personal memories and showed me a mirror of ignorance and insensitivity towards these marginal communities.The film's pitch is set to the populist tunes and though there is no fight sequence with the hero, the background music, gestures of the 'star', the camera angles - they all build up the hero worship Tamilnadu is so much known for. Personally, I feel an actor like Vijay Sethupati would have brought more layers to the protagonist's character. Suriya, even in this author backed role, seemed much of a star and less of a seasoned lawyer. Prakash Raj too was routine.The real 'hero' of the film is Lijomol Jose's Sengeni. Her physical acting and lack of expressions while helpless will haunt a sensitive viewer for long. Just that they had to blacken an otherwise fair actress for a role hurts me a bit. Same as Suriya, I think a naturally deglamorized actress would have been fitter for the film.Manikandan's Rajakannu, Rajendran's Mosakutty, Tamizh as SI Gurumurthy - and the rest of the cast bring to life the daily day toils, joys and sorrows of the incidents and characters.It is a difficult film to watch. The torture scenes should have come with a warning for the mentally not so strong people. If it gets so disturbing at times to watch, I can't begin to imagine how difficult the lives of such marginal communities actually are.The movie could have done with some editing. Even without the melodrama creating background music, the film would have remained as effective. I think the film could have opened with Sengeni waiting to meet Advocate Chandru and the rest could have unfolded gradually. Narration through flashback, as a trope, has not been well exploited in this film.This is a necessary film. The sage Ramakrishna Paramhansa had said, \"Theatre educates the masses\", and the same can be said about this film.Just to document the plight of the marginal tribes who struggle every day to prove their existence despite their skills and demanding work could have given the film much credence. That the director has attempted to do so within the parameters of popular cinema makes it even more creditable. Gnanavel seems deft in handling the scenes depicting the masses. Where he had to blend the same with the matinee icon's charisma, there are a few hiccups.I have given an extra star in the review just due to the boldness of the makes and Prime Videos to let this film happen. Though set at a pitch a tad higher than necessary, the film delivers the message home.To conclude, the medium of cinema, an OTT channel and a viewer like me who is privileged to use internet and a holiday to watch make me write the caption of this review. This cinema remains as a peep into the masses through an elitist binocular.",

On one hand the presence of a big star like Surya would inevitably lead to certain \"mass\" scenes which might bother the emotional flow and on the other hand his presence would also bring in tons of audience to this film that is addressing an important issue. Jai Bhim is about a horrific real incident that happened in the 90's but the problem it's addressing is as relevant today as it was back then. The initial portions of the film where we see the life of Irulars are amazing. We get to know them, their lifestyle and, most importantly, how they're treated. Then the film segues into the real issue. I wish the film had been treated like Visaranai. This movie is just a bit too commercial for such a sensitive topic but i get it, a film like Visaranai would never reach as many people as this has. Anyways this is a very important film about casteism, social injustice and police brutality.",

Court drama that is so thoroughly astonishing & engaging right from the start of the movie. Distinctively unique, even from the very first 5-10 minutes. Definitely from the lines of \"Visaranai\", I am getting used to the recent cinematic legal works such as Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, these kind of thought-provoking scripts is fast catching up as a trending inspiration for all film makers.In his Brave & Bold attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks about custodial violence, police cover-up, systemic corruption at a huge level, that is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole truth and finally there would be no end to the entire picture. The blame game is never ending.I can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is actually truly-brutally honest, clear-cut reality filled with heart-wrenching scenes, that is sure to leave you feeling that there is more bad in this world than good.One can praise Actor Suriya for his super star performance that is so shockingly awesome, only to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has done a wonderful job of acting so well & so concealed, that I just forgot him in the process, being so much involved in the amazing narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the writer TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.Huge round of applause for the extreme level beautiful Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this movie it s core life & the element of suspense. Music by Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own way, made me feel pain and all kinds of emotions throughout the film. Other actors namely Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his sensible acting portions for a supporting role, while Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and especially K. Manikandan who earned the merit of a special mention. One wonders how he actually did all those gruesome scenes.The director unquestionably has to be awarded for the stupendous success of this movie which solely entertains family audiences without depending upon masala factor or \"mass\"components.I would definitely watch it again as it was based on detailed portrayal of true events & people!Hats off to the entire Cast & Crew, Team of Jai Bhim!

I found it unbearably irritating the way the women in the movie , especially the wife of the victim cries in every scene unnecessarily. Tears are effective on screen when they are shown only when necessary , making it occur every second scene , combined with lots of wailing and bawling , just diminishes its effectiveness in garnering sympathy . If fact every time she started wailing I hoped the cop would shut her up . Maybe, it's only in the Hindi dubbed version that all these unnecessary loud noises are shown and not in its original format. But all the same a good movie was ruined by some very unwanted overacting by its female casts and a few male cast as well , like the short guy in the lock up as well as in the end at the court .what any guy in court would have given his statement in a normal and controlled manner , this fellow was overflowing with mile long tears and wailing with more unwanted noises .When he was doing his teary acts , I so wanted the cop or anyone in the movie to just kill him too , just to shut his bawling .It was that unbearable. Why couldn't the director make it more realistic and less melodramatic like rest of the movie ? Would have been well deserving the fantastic IMBD ratings had it not been for these stupid melodramas and sound pollutions . Having said that , the movie was an out an out entertaining movie and thoroughly captivating .",

            "content": "Movie Review / Jai Bhim / Tamil / Prime Video / 4.5/5 / No spoilersJai Bhim is a cinematic marvel based on the real life inspiring story of Justice K Chandru. An Iyer Brahmin lawyer, who stood up for the human rights of marginalised tribal community against the corruption and atrocities of police.Right from the first scene, this film grips you and shows you lifestyle of a community you can never imagine. In fiction, you have the liberty to cook up any story but this is a fact which happened not too far in history but in 1996. I am glad writer and director Gnanavel brought out this story to the audience. There are some of these scenes, which just stayed with me... tribals hunting for their food, owl looks at them like a CCTV camera, chemistry between Rajakannu and Sengenni. Gnanavel hasn't delivered anything great before but he would be in a different league after this film. First half of the film moves smoothly with well established characters and tension between the oppressed and the oppressor. 2nd half becomes less magical as courtroom drama doesn't offer us anything new in terms of cinematic marvel.Casting of the film is superb too. On one side there are well known actors like Suriya, Prakash Raj, Guru Somsundaram, there are unknown faces who gel well with the characters they are playing. My favourite being Manikandan playing Rajakannu and Lijo Jose playing Sengenni. Acting is top notch of all the actors. Wonderful Screenplay, Cinematography and Editing.While watching the film, one feels so much helpless that how can we help these powerless victims who get trampled by corruption every day. How many Chandrus do we have who will dedicate their lives to the society? Even today we see cops stopping 2W to check documents and extract money. They don't want to touch 4W as they supposedly would have better contacts. Isn't this the same mentality of picking on less powerful guys?Verdict: A wonderful film that will bring tears to your eyes. Torture given to these tribals is worse than what britishers did to our freedom fighters. A film which was truly worthy of representing India in Oscars but alas couldn't get shortlisted.",

            "content": "It's always nice to see a star like Suriya move away from a typical masala flick for Diwali and come up with a hard-hitting courtroom drama based on actual events. In the film, he is more of a tool that helps enact justice for the oppressed victims. There's no showy entry, songs that praise him to the skies, or stock heroines who exist only to admire him. Instead, the film focuses more on the tribal characters played by Manikandan and Lijomol (both excellent) and the series of unfortunate events that they go through.Police brutality has been a sensitive topic, touched upon by very few films and filmmakers, even when we keep hearing several such cases in the news. Films like Visaranai and Karnan paved the way for TJ Gnanavel's Jai Bhim to tell a harrowing social issue without the need to be preachy. Jai Bhim's first hour is a somewhat disturbing watch, with the cries of the oppressed both tugging at your heartstrings and coming across as slightly amplified. There's no subtlety at play. The punches are wholly felt, the screams are heard loud and clear. If you still don't, Sean Roldan's woeful score will drive the point home.",

            "content": ".The story revolves around the crusade of a conscientious activist lawyer Chandru played to the T by Surya Sivakumar) who fights for the downtrodden masses. Surya has taken the mantle of the firebrand real life advocate and subsequently well known real life hero - Justice Chandru and breathed life in the character. When he is not mouthing dialogues, he conveys a vicissitude of emotion through his handsome visage and those fluid and sharp eyes at every turn but never going over board. In this movie he takes up the fight of a defenseless Irula tribal woman (Senganni)and her quest for justice - her missing husband is(Rajakannu) whose whereabouts are not known after he is dragged into the police lockup for investigating a theft wherein he is the suspect. Surya takes up what looks like a Kargil mountain climbing kind of a case which appears to be an open-shut case in favor of the Tamil Nadu police department. In the process he delves, prods and probes deep into the deep rot into the justice department and the myriad laws and bylaws which subjugates many a valorous but now downtrodden tribe of Irulaa. In this case, it is the ancient Irula tribe who were warriors and plant medicine experts from a bygone era. Now successive governments and local politicians and police machinery use them as broiler chicken criminals to feed their greedy masters to plug loopholes and to gain footholds into higher echelons of power and greed for wealth. Chandru's first court appearance in the movie is about a man from a minority community who has been wrongly incarcerated by the cops, who are under pressure to close pending cases. With a single petition in the Madras High Court, Chandru manages to get bail not just for his client but about 7,000 people, who were possibly arrested on false charges across Tamil Nadu. That moment, you understand the power of courts and how it could be harnessed to hold unscrupulous men in power accountable. Chandru has a worthy adversary in the form of the chief government Advocate General played to perfection by Rao Ramesh (Ram Mohan), an effective and conscientious police officer IG Perumalswamy (Prakash Raj), a persistent social worker fighting for the Irula tribe - Mythra (Rajisha Vijayan, malayalam actress) and Sengenni( Lijomol Jose). One thing striking in the movie is all the protagonists are nonviolent and rebellious who don't bow their head to any form of tyranny. The men who are taken to violence are the villains in this movie. The barbaric methods of the cops were no match to the non-violent resistance and resilience of Rajakannu, Senganni and, of course, Chandru. This is a gripping court room drama filled with a deep social message, powerful dialogues and all round performance by all cast and crew. Now available on Amazon Prime. Rating 3.5/5 Deepavali special with a social message. Must watch.",

Its a must watch and an epitome of how movies should be made these days, rather than superhero stunts and romantic fantasies, guiding younger generation to ignorance. It would really be true that the actors have lived the characters in the movie and Sengani cast has been played outstandingly by Lijo Mol Jose, Rajkannu by Manikandan. Surya and director has done an absolutely amazing job in making this movie and bring awareness to the so-called freedom and equality. Upcoming movies should come up with society's burning issues like this and bring awareness to the younger generation. I am not sure why anyone would rate below 10, if they happen to do it, I am pretty sure something is wrong with the way they have been brought up. Either they are in the upper supporting caste or some mentally retarded that enjoys sufferings of fellow human beings.",

I mean there was no real intense debate or speech scene b/w lawyers in the movie which makes you think.You can skip first 1 hour easily. So much over dramatic scenes. So many tollywood like emotional scenes of poor people which you can see in their almost every other movie.And they also distracted from main topic in the middle (caste discrimination).The only thing to watch to watch this movie is that it is based on a true story and the role of the wife otherwise they wasted a good story about a legend.It's the time people should stop giving high ratings to a movie just because it is a south indian movie.Like KGF or Master or na jane kaun kaun si.",

The film is more of crime suspense thriller than just courtroom drama. The visuals are stunning. The songs and background music are too good that they elevate a situation to a great extent though they act as speed breakers occasionally. There is nothing bad to say about the performances and in fact they deserve prestigious awards too. I did not find anything wrong in technical aspects of the film to my knowledge.The brutality involved in the film is too high but that is a reality which cannot be denied. I recommend elderly people having heart related issues not to watch this film as some scenes can affect them mentally. It can bring tears during raw intense scenes of beating innocent tribal people including women, severely. In short, it is a must-watch for all children and adults because the content can impact the behaviour of people by making them understand equality of all castes in this society and also digest the fact that there are still people in our country who are oppressed , weak and vulnerable with no identity.",

I think like PARASITE, Oscar awarded film Jai Bhim also spreading in to everyone heart. Everything about this Movie has to be praised be it camera, back ground score, plot, Casting, charecters etc. Certainly you will get al Kind of emotions, Joy, anger and tears! Good message to Society for people from any country because it is happening every where in any place. Atleast some film it without restriction. All charecters are well performed natural especialy rasakkannu Manikandan and his wife senkeni Lijo jose Marvellous. Soorya of course, great actor and Producer and he himself acted become strong added value for this film to bring more credits : Why Not OSCAR award for jai Bhim every where around globe people talking commenting reviewing giving Credits fir this beautiful movie.. Jai Bheem flawlessly speaks about custodial voilence, Police cover up, Systemic curruption at a huge leva. Moreover this film portraying the role of left in the life of dwon troddens ! In Many of the Scenes. And also in back ground red flague appearing and in the struggles leaders of the communist Party are present.

A tight slap by the policeman to the criminal that blabbers arrogantly in Hindi when asked questions in Tamil (although he's well versed in Tamil), despite being the cunning creature engaging in everything illegal was absolutely befitting and not too fantastic to be real! To mainain such momentum despite such a serious and subject is indeed commendable! In my opinion, a movie that really connects with me manages to tear me up a couple of times and this movie gave me at least ten instances with such impactful dialogues and I must say that this is the best Tamil movie I've ever watched!I love the attention to details this movie brings in the backdrop of every other scene, painting a picture of what's in everyone's minds, from time to time, without ever overdoing it, for the sake of appearing artsy! Too many good things to say about this movie honestly!Many critics out here are busy finding the tiniest technical errors to justify that this movie isn't a masterpiece, but this movie is much more and it's purpose is to awaken dead humanity and learn what social justice means, if you didn't know! It serves a greater purpose than being just a work of art that suits the sensibilities of a few (I love art myself, but humanity is bigger than that)!All in all, an absolute must watch, no matter your background!",

            "review_title": "Vera level movie",
            "content": "In a scene in Jai Bhim, a group of tribals man meet a police office who is heading an inquiry commission about the disappearance of three missing tribals who were being interrogated by the police about a theft case. One man tells him that he was once arrested by cops just for greeting them. Another tells him about how he was arrested just because he tried to slink away fearing them. A woman narrates how her husband was forced to 'confess' to a crime which he had not committed after the cops started molesting her. A young boy mentions that the police picked him up just because they could not get his father, and how that one incident made him a perennial suspect at school. These people are clearly damned if they did, and damned if they didn't.This scene is an echo of the scene that opens the film. We see many prisoners being let out of prison. A few cops from the surrounding police stations are waiting. As each prisoner comes out, he is asked for his caste. If they mention a dominant caste's name, they are asked to leave. But those who belong to a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe, they are told to stand in a corner, only for the waiting cops to pick them up as suspects in the many cases that remain unsolved in their station. When some of them complain that there are too few for them to foist cases on, they are told that they could accuses a few of committing more than one crime.With scenes like these, Jai Bhim powerfully captures the abuse and humiliation that is heaped upon the underprivileged by those in power and the kind of defiance it will take to get them justice. Like Visaaranai and the recent Kavalthurai Ungal Nanban, the film is also a fierce criticism of police brutality. The plot revolves around Rajakannu (Manikandan) and Sengani (Lijomol Jose), a couple who live at Konamalai near Viluppuram. They belong to the Irular tribe, and despite their poverty - they still cannot afford a brick house - they are contented and happy. Especially with their daughter Alli going to school and a second child on its way.But their happiness is dashed when cops come in search of Rajakannu over a robbery. The poor man has become the main suspect just because he happened to be the one who had visited the house where the robbery happened that day to catch a snake. Unable to find him, the police pick up the pregnant Sengani and a few other men from the tribe, including Rajakannu's brother Irutappan. Sengani is later let go - not before being beaten and kicked multiple times - but for Rajakannu and a couple of others, there is no respite from the harrowing violence unleashed upon by the men in khakhi. When Sengani hears that the three men have escaped and their whereabouts unknown, she reached out to Chandru (Suriya), a righteous lawyer who fights for the downtrodden. But can they uncover the truth with an entire system standing against them?Jai Bhim is an unexpected sophomore effort from TJ Gnanavel, who had previously directed the uneven drama Kootathil Oruvan. This is a film that is raw, real and brutal, with gritty filmmaking enhancing the solid writing. It effectively portrays the wrongs that are done to the underprivileged without seeming exploitative or overly melodramatic. Despite being one of the oldest communities in the country, these tribes do not even have any proof to show that they are its citizens and cannot even own a piece of the land. When Mythra (Rajisha Vijayan), a teacher who is part of an adult literacy programme, tries to get them a voter id, the local big shot, who belongs to a dominant caste, retorts, \"Isn't it enough we have to request the lower castes to vote for us? Should we also go to the homes of these fellows?\"Gnanavel gives us some terrific moments of defiance. Lijomol Jose is quietly powerful as Sengani, who gets a couple of rousing scenes when she turns down efforts at a compromise from cops. Manikandan, too, is effective and stands out in the scene when he urges his men to not give in as that will result in their community being branded as criminals. The director also portrays the intimacy between Sengani and Rajakannu in a charming manner.The film is based on a real-life incident involving Justice K Chandru, from his days as a lawyer. Suriya plays this role with the right amount of intensity and earnestness, which helps the character seem grounded even while the film and Sean Roldan's score try to build him up as a can-do-no-wrong superhero. In fact, his introduction scene wouldn't be out of place in a masala movie. But after Soorarai Pottru, this is another notable film for the star as a performer.And his scenes with Prakash Raj, who plays the inquiry commission head, Perumalsamy, give us calm and composed dialogue that act as a counterpoint to the flinching violence and the moving melodrama. The latter lends the role with a great deal of dignity to a character who believes one has to take up a little bit of authoritarianism to protect democracy. So, we have a lawyer who considers the police as the worst and a cop who finds lawyers the worst working together to ensure justice is done. Through these scenes, Gnanavel - as one of the judges in the film mentions - shows how justice can be upheld when law and order work hand in hand.There are only a couple of missteps. After a point, the violence begins to feel like torture porn, even though the film presents these episodes as flashbacks of events that happened over a day or two. And in a narrative sense, Chandru's efforts to unravel the mystery and his battle in court feels somewhat easier because there are no strong antagonists. Both Rao Ramesh as the advocate general and Guru Somasundaram as the public prosecutor never come across as formidable foes for Chandru in court. That said, as Chandru unravels one cover-up after another, the film makes us realise the extent to which unchecked power can go to maintain status quo.But these doesn't lessen the emotional impact of the film, which, along with films like Visaaranai, Kirumi and Kavalthurai Ungal Nanban, is a much-needed antidote to restore the balance in portrayals of the police in an industry overrun by the Singams and the Saamys.",

The upper caste still enjoys privileges of being part of that caste and lower caste / tribals bears the harassment from upper caste plus the society. The movie is an eye opener on the casteism that still exists in our fake modern society. This country still need honest lawyers who believes in standing up for those who are denied justice and standing against who misuses the power and law. About the slapping scene where police officer slapped the person to speak in tamil I couldn't find anything offensive. Everyone is proud of their mother language and one should remember hindi is not a national language so dont impose it on everyone. Don't ruin the rational behind the movie over just one scene. The movie shows us the horrible state of this society upper caste lower caste and of course the police brutality no doubt why I still hate police so much.",

Chandru as a lawyer does anything and everything legally to bring justice to Sengeni. His expressions speak. Climax scene emotions and expressions by Chandru character is awesome and makes you feel the same way he feels. Characters represented as higher grade people treat Rasakannu and Sengeni and their people very bad as if they are untouchables and low grade people. Even when they know these people are good, they won't help them or save them from Police. Lawyers who support villains have done the given job and executed it well. We get angry on why such lawyers even exist helping wrong people and encouraging them to do more. Treat every man and woman from any caste equally. Have heart and treat everybody with humanity. If people we start respecting everybody and treating others with humanity and helping needy people by means of education and employment, each and every family will definitely raise their status from Poverty to at least middle class eventually someday.

We are still differed from people as if we are not human being. This is really very bad. We have to make a huge change in our beliefs and our thoughts and our behavior towards everyone that can help to our next coming generation. Thank you\nJai Bhim!",

JAI BHIM is a quintessential example of pure acting, a marvelous story, and a superb direction. This 151 min drama portrays the plight of tribal people caused by the caste divide in society.In my opinion, the movie was centered around the oxymoron \"good and bad\". On one hand, this movie shows the impeccable character of Advocate Chandru, IG officer Perumalsamy, and the devotion of a wife (Senggeni) to his husband (Rajakannu). At the same time, there are characters like Prosecution lawyers (PP C. And S. Ram Mohan), and the 3 culprit policemen.It was highlighted that good and bad comes in pair. Just because the majority of a class is bad, it can't be used as a precedence to generalize that the entire class is bad.On the surface, this movie portrays injustice towards tribal people, police brutality, misuse of government policies by officials, corruption, suppressing and oppressing minorities. But at a deeper level, this movie emphasizes the power of unity, the Integrity of courts, the importance of education, the value of human life and emotions, and how an individual can bring change with self-confidence.This biopic shows the longest case in the history of the Chennai high court. It ends on a positive note that justice in this largest democracy may get delayed, but it will not be lost. Justice will be served and everyone is equal in the eyes of law.",

            "content": "Firstly this is based off a true story. The victimized community, the lawyer who fought for them, the political leader who advocated for their justice are all there so do not believe the negative reviews that falsely proclaim it was a lie. This incident shown in the film has been proven in a court of law so to deny it would be unlawful in the first place.Now the movie...The marginalized community was depicted very accurately in the film. It is a sad fact that all over India these real, indigenous people, are still not allowed inside the main areas of the village/township, reduced to do menial jobs, mistreated, and even taken as perpetrators of crime without evidence. This is EXACTLY how they have been shown in the film.The filming crew has given extreme attention to detail when it comes to outlining their characters onscreen (this includes their accent, dressing, jobs, and lifestyle in general).Unlike many Indian films, there are no 'masala' scenes or songs showing heroism. The lawyer character fights for the truth and that's what is shown as well.One other thing to look for a movie is how well the central incident is taken by different characters in the film. The director has captured it perfectly and showcases how prejudice is interwoven in the society and while it is harmless to the unaffected, causes immense pain to the other.The long duration of the film does not cause even an iota of disinterest and puts you on the edge of your seat with its gripping reality.Movies like this should be welcome as eye-openers and proof that Indian flicks do not have to be all about dancing in the rain and catapulting villains.You can certainly find reviews that label this movie as fabricated, divisive etc. But remember, according the honorable (retired) judge of Madras High Court who actually handled the case when he was a lawyer, it was watered down a lot to reduce the gore and pain of the real incident.Kudos to Surya and team, and Amazon for taking up such a bold subject much needed for the society today.",

            "review_title": "Why Law has become a weapon to people like Chandru?",
            "content": "By watching the film trailer, I was under the impression that this is another courtroom drama like Nerkonda Paarvai. But after watching the film, this has a noteworthy crime thriller carefully placed in between the courtroom arguments and it is something beyond a murder case investigation.To me, this is a bold film in terms of storytelling not because they dealt with oppression but they'd told the entire story in the opening scene itself. The oppression begins right from the point when the false case begins on the basis of caste along with the pressure and greed behind closing the pending cases. We already know where it all began and we're just given the feeling of sitting on the time bomb.I feel this film is a domino effect of Visaranai. In the lines of Pariyerum Perumal, this film comes with a different dimension on voicing out the victims. Though the initial 28 mins of the film could've been made a little shorter, the impact it builds as the film progresses justifies the first act.The film has a lot of subtexts and one of my favorites is Chandru's introduction. The slow-motion where Suriya jumps over the barricades is the subtle way of telling the audience that, he will cross all the barriers and hurdles in life no matter what. And the reason is to get justice for people and not for any public stunts. No one can stand between him and people who are robbed off of justice. That's what this slow-motion conveys. This simple shot shows that he's not just another lawyer here, because, among hundreds of lawyers who are actively participating in the strike, only Chandru jumps for Sengani. This is a fantastic foreshadowing (on who's going to save Sengani?), at least to me.The film unfolds in a particular period and one can shy away from taking lots of effort. But Gnanavel made sure that, even the 90s Sun TV logo is authentic. The Pallavan transport passing, the \"Bombay\" film Cut out (we don't say hoarding those days), the Chetak scooters, Yamaha RX 100, passing in the backdrop, Surya's watch, his Rajdoot bike, and most importantly Ilavarusu watching \"Pepsi Ungal Choice\" in Sun TV when Sengani character pleads for help. Simply a devil's eyes in the details. The art department silently pillared the director's visions. Gnanavel could've easily diverted us into the story but he raised the bar by not giving up on these details.Also, I never expected this level of quality from Sean Roldan - the composer who elevated many scenes without disturbing the story and narration.The whole film is pinned on Sengeni's point of view. The screenplay is written in such a way that the audience would know a little more than Sengani. I think that's the success of the film. The place where the police jeep crushing the toys would've been a clich\u00e9, had the narration dropped anywhere in Raja Kannu's portions. That scene was right on point where the character is crushed to its bones and victimized by sheer power abuse.This is one among the very few films, where you simply can't appreciate just one actor who performed the lead or supporting. Apart from lockup and chili powder scenes, Manikandan's innocent smile or Lijo Mol's dull-looking face would make us feel heavy. Prakash Raj's performance when he couldn't take more and walks away by hearing the saddest of stories from the victims would make us a part of the scene effortlessly. The final credits showing real Chandru leave us thinking, a selfless act from one lawyer saved many and he's no less than god!Above all, it is Suriya. Why? He has a wonderful market in Tamil and Telugu. He could've cast a popular actor for Chandru's role, supported this film as a producer, and easily turned his back from facing heated politics, but he didn't. That's where he stands tall. The urge to take this film on a bigger stage and make sure that it spreads a good message is an act of nobility. The positive effects from the government post-release are so warming to see. That's the power of good films.Surya supported this film exactly the way he supports the kid reading the newspaper in the last scene! On any given day, highly recommended.Jai Bhim - Humanity is free but caste and power abuse make it costly!",

            "content": "While I cannot deny the fact that the movie has been treated in a little unrealistic manner the way mainstream movies does to heighten the impact of the story. Some may cringe, some may whistle. I did wish that it was treated in a matter of fact way, but, I am extremely satisfied thinking that it reaches a larger audience with the kind of treatment it has been given and with the start power of Suriya. Now, when I say star power, I would highly appreciate if many of our stars used their power to bring in stories like this that would actually contribute to the awareness and therefore, progress of the society instead of indulging in no-brainer movies all the time. Of course, one can enjoy it, but when you have such a huge influence on people, why not use it for good? Coming to the movie, despite the minor issue, by and large, I extremely loved it. One can't deny that it makes you think and introspect. The title of movie sounded gimmicky to me initially but by the time the end credits started rolling, I found myself guilty for thinking so. The subtle tribute it gives to the father of the Indian constitution is very well deserved. Of course, such success stories are far and wide from one to the other, but it gives us hope that judiciary wasn't given that extra independence for nothing. For the marginalized section of the society, where even the Government treats them like outsiders in many cases, they have got no one but the judiciary to look up to for protection. It's sad that such cases are very rare. India, by large, hasn't been able to achieve the kind of progress despite all the infrastructural, technological and what not progress that we have achieved over the years, simply because the very foundation of our society is still based on malice, discrimination, prejudice. Where one would openly protest against reservation but would hesitate to speak up for the rights of minorities, it is a clear indication of the fact that we still haven't come out from the clutches of the evils that plagued our society centuries ago. I personally believe that, before the government or judiciary or for that matter, even the constitution, it is extremely important for each and every individual to bring progress within their mindset and conscience. That, in itself would be the start to a progressive environment. This is something I seriously want people to discuss and consider it important. There are many movies based on similar subject, but I recommend you all to watch this wonderful movie. It will definitely make you think.",

I really enjoyed some of his punch lines \"We can see Gandhi and Nehru but we can't find Bhim\". Sengeni, who was wife of Rajakunnu has also played her role brilliantly. At the end of the movie, Sengeni tries to give her Mangal Sutra to Adv Chandra as the fees of her case but he refuses to take it by asking her what if someone would have come to you with agony of snake's bite. Would you not save their life if they were not able to pay you the money. I am really sorry at this point as I have missed a point, this tribe was expert at saving people's life from the snake's bite. This scene is heart melting and you can feel it.

Lighting was great to match the situations as well as camera angling. For example, low key lighting to match the intense or violent sequences. Dialogue was perfect as there weren't really any cliches of any sort and they hit hard as well. The sound direction was phenomenal. Performances were outstanding. This movie had a good theme as well and how they portray that on screen with their technical aspects was great for making the audience to sympathize with the characters. Whether people agree with the message or not, the movie did an amazing job of calling attention to the marginalized communities and promoting change. It also emphasized the importance of finding truth and restoring faith in the justice system when it fails the people. Those are some of the most important things that we have to open our minds for to this day. Now while the movie isn't 100% accurate accordingly to the true events, we have to remember that is a story constructed based off true events. Its message is basically to let us know that these kinds of atrocities are happening and that we should try to prevent it from happening again. We should focus on the message that they portray through onscreen elements and judge the movie accordingly to that. Overall, great work by the crew!",

And the government, along with the entire police department, has stepped in to cover up the killings. Because, if this petition goes against the government then their dignity will be questioned.This movie can give you some ideas of how our Executive and Judiciary are governed and how the abominable acts are done by the police. Where the lawmakers are lawbreakers, then what would be the consequence? The law is divided on the basis of caste. The law has become a slave to power and money.Jai Bhim is an important film in the history of Tamil cinema. It shows how caste discrimination and injustice kill people. Jai Bhim is a film that also talks about the lack of humanity. Jai Bhim is a must-watch for its hard-hitting content and its ideologies. It's what society needs right now.Rajakannu's wife make a writ petition through a lawyer named \"Chandru\". Where they get justice. In his 30 years of career as a lawyer, he has reclaimed the rights of thousands of workers. And he did not receive a penny for all the human rights cases he fought. Later he became a judge of the Chennai court and solved ninety-six thousand cases in six years and seven months. He gave many landmark judgments as well.Good and bad people are everywhere.

Before getting angry, please let me explain.The man clearly knew Tamil or Telugu, and was trying to mislead the police team by speaking in Hindi, as the IG didn't know Hindi. So I think it was okay for him to ask him to speak in Tamil or Telugu.The thing is, the Hindi dubbing team should've done the scene like the guy was speaking some other language like Tamil or Telugu, and the IG asking him to speak Hindi.And the director should've made sure that it was done like that.The only thing I find disturbing in this scene is the physical abuse.

Courtroom drama this is so thoroughly remarkable & enticing right from the start of the film. Distinctively particular, even from the first actual 5-10 minutes. Virtually from the traces of \"Visaranai\", i am getting used to the current cinematic criminal works which includes Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, those kind of thought-provoking scripts is speedy catching up as a trending inspiration for all movie makers.In his brave & ambitious attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks approximately custodial violence, police cowl-up, systemic corruption at a big level, this is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole fact and sooner or later there could be no end to the complete picture. The blame recreation is in no way ending.I can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is truely actually-brutally honest, 665ffa919c35bfa66744e335c03b7855 truth full of heart-wrenching scenes, that is certain to depart you feeling that there may be greater terrible on this international than good.Possible praise Actor Suriya for his notable megastar overall performance this is so shockingly superb, handiest to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has finished a excellent task of appearing so well & so concealed, that I simply forgot him in the procedure, being so much involved within the brilliant narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the author TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.Massive spherical of applause for simple degree lovely Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this film it s center existence & the detail of suspense. Song by using Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own manner, made me sense pain and all styles of emotions in the course of the film. Other actors specifically Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his realistic acting quantities for a helping function, whilst Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and mainly okay. Manikandan who earned the merit of a unique mention. One wonders how he simply did all those ugly scenes.The director honestly has to be offered for the stupendous fulfillment of this movie which solely entertains circle of relatives audiences without relying upon masala component or \"mass\"components.I'd truly watch it once more because it become primarily based on specified portrayal of proper activities & humans!Hats off to the whole solid & group, group of Jai Bhim!

We in India are getting polarized to an extreme for every topic and community, where fake news goes unchecked, Whatsapp has become a University in itself to spread lies, deceit and hatred.Coming quickly back to the movie, i do not want to have spoilers, this movie is a marvel, although it is very hard to watch, but i request everyone, as many of us to watch this movie and share this to atleast 2 more friends and colleagues to spread the way we in our country have treated lives of people with the least of dignity and decency. Very sad that things still are in this state in our country, there is no police reform that have been so vociferously demanded. The new govt. Has done no change to the existing system and has only shamelessly continued the use of power.I watched the movie with pain in my heart that when it happens in reality what will be the emotion of the people going through it. And i was in tears when i knew that a lawyer/advocate really existed in real life who actually took this complicated case of atrocities of police against the tribal community. I have heard other things about this advocate who became a judge later on his life. As a lawyer he had taken up 96,000 cases (jaw dropping number) fighting for the under privileged. I salute to this man Mr. Chandru ( i don't know the appropriate title but only respect for this man).I would urge everyone who has able to read this much, to watch this movie and spread the word further. Sad but a powerhouse of a movie. It still manages to end with a positive note and spread the message of courage and conscience. There is no doubt that you will like this movie.",

Court drama that is so thoroughly astonishing & engaging right from the start of the movie. Distinctively unique, even from the very first 5-10 minutes. Definitely from the lines of \"Visaranai\", I am getting used to the recent cinematic legal works such as Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, these kind of thought-provoking scripts is fast catching up as a trending inspiration for all film makers.In his Brave & Bold attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks about custodial violence, police cover-up, systemic corruption at a huge level, that is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole truth and finally there would be no end to the entire picture. The blame game is never ending.I can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is actually truly-brutally honest, clear-cut reality filled with heart-wrenching scenes, that is sure to leave you feeling that there is more bad in this world than good.One can praise Actor Suriya for his super star performance that is so shockingly awesome, only to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has done a wonderful job of acting so well & so concealed, that I just forgot him in the process, being so much involved in the amazing narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the writer TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.Huge round of applause for the extreme level beautiful Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this movie it s core life & the element of suspense. Music by Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own way, made me feel pain and all kinds of emotions throughout the film. Other actors namely Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his sensible acting portions for a supporting role, while Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and especially K. Manikandan who earned the merit of a special mention. One wonders how he actually did all those gruesome scenes.The director unquestionably has to be awarded for the stupendous success of this movie which solely entertains family audiences without depending upon masala factor or \"mass\"components.I would definitely watch it again as it was based on detailed portrayal of true events & people!Hats off to the entire Cast & Crew, Team of Jai Bhim! Cheers! ~ Aditya Narayan.",

It is one of those movies which unabashedly shows the plight of the tribals and that you need someone of Chandru's spirit to get justice.I would have loved a bit more about the man Chandru - as from where he got his conviction. A tight editing could have helped here.Having worked bit with tribals, I can say that they too na\u00efve (if that is the word) to comprehend the social structure, power equations and majority wish to lead their lives with dignity and non-interference. Sadly the contrary sets in when power mongers twist and twirl to secure petty benefits. That by favoring and taking sides with power mongers one can secure a raise, a promotion.... dispels the notion that merit prevails and that it would not become a casualty in the future too...With fine actors, the movie is brutally honest and OTT serves this content well. Fancy Censor Board clearing a movie without any cuts.Overall, a gripping ~ 2.42 minutes wherein one is transported to become either a tribal or a Chandru or a honest IG to uphold and celebrate what they have done. On the other hand it also transports one to visualize one as a power mongers and how to modify ones conduct for the betterment of the society.Thank you Producers, Directors, Actors, and an array of stakeholders for sharing the story.",

They showed us accurate detailing and kept the audience engaged throughout. It's an perfect attempt on important things that needs to be discussed on a mainstream cinema. Many film's intention will be good but it'll fail in terms of execution. Miraculous and staggering performance by Manikandan. In that police station scenes, he was marvellous. Extraordinary. Hard hitting one. Duration was lengthy one, but it's a needed one too. Most of the scenes will be so eye-trouble.

            "content": "When an issue for a rich family crop up, the police, politicians, and judicial systems stands up for them and the greatest lawyers in the country are hired to speak against them and ensure that even though guilty are released with ease. But, in the same scenario when a poor or a backward caste family are stuck around courts seeking justice everything just falls apart. Jai Bhim showcases a story about an honest lawyer who stands for such issues and about a tribal family who seeks justice for their innocence for a case that has been upheld against them.There have been many movies in the past showcasing the issues that the backward caste / tribal people go through by the injustice done by the society as if they don't exist in the normal population. They are treated as a different set of people and termed as UNTOUCHABLES.Since 2020 when OTT is on a rise, there have been multiple movies that have opted for OTT as their route and with no second thoughts Jai Bhim stands out in all the ways. Be it a thought-provoking subject, courtroom drama, people's attitude towards backward, troubles that tribal people face, and to prove that they exist in society. This reminds me of Ambedkar's fight to abolish untouchability in India which still exists in greater parts of India. This plot showcases the story based on true events revolving around a 1995 habeas corpus petition that human rights. (Fundamental right in the Constitution that protects against unlawful and indefinite imprisonment)Suriya once again proves that be it any subject, if done with conviction and honesty will reach people's hearts. His simplicity throughout shows his sincerity towards the character. The other characters in the story are apt as per the proceedings. The initial premise of 25 mins is slow as it sets the stage for the main plot and when the protagonist appears on the screen, that's when the real proceedings follow. There are no punch dialogues or any massy numbers which a regular movie-goer would expect. This is a serious subject which every section should watch and applaud for! The emotions of the tribal people are heart-wrenching (Police station episodes are raw and rustic). The logic in the proceedings never go for a toss, each and every dot connection shows the perfection while execution.To sum up, Jai Bhim proves it point of the empathy that the poor or the tribal people are looking for and this one when ends would stay in your heart for a long time! Very Well Written and executed! (Language is no barrier, Amazon Prime has released the movie in all major languages \ud83d\ude09)",

            "content": "Excellent movie a master piece direction depicting reality \"as is\" away from the stereotype nonsensical movies that drifts the nation from meaning generation commitment towards nation building in it true democratic principles. Jai Bhim provides answers to the questions that have not raised for centuries in this nation full of inequality disguise under religious caste dogma. This 164 minutes movie lay bares the sanctimonious democracy that we proudly flaunt as world largest. This century old discrimination is worst of its kind while in other countries even in a lesser form had resulted in social revolutions. In the movie we hear the voice of Dr. Ambedkar, the alone crusader of social justice condemning the human discrimination had still hoped that his countrymen will one day realize if not in his life time but maybe later when the history will be reviewed unbiased and his role to established social reform would be studied as pinnacle of social revolution failed by his own countrymen. The movie title \"Jai Bhim\" which is proudly used to greet each other by lakhs of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar followers and Buddhists alike justifies the vision of the father of modern India Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar to educate, organize and agitate against any form of discrimination.",

Each and every actor is too good with their performances which makes Jai Bhim a must-watch if you are fond of realistic tales. Jai Bhim sounds like an investigative thriller. Suriya's role has no elevations that a lead actor has in a South Indian film. He behaves like the other role in the film. He plays the role of an activist and an advocate who takes up issues that are ignored in the society. The drama looks narrated in detail and the custodial torture is quite brutal.

Even though Chandru anchors the film, Jai Bhim truly belongs to the tribal couple Sengeni (Lijomol) and Rajakannu (Manikandan). Lijomol takes the cake with a phenomenal performance. She plays Sengeni with such a beautiful combination of dignity, innocence, and spirit that she becomes the soul of Jai Bhim. Lijomol is fantastically supported by Manikandan, who plays Rajakannu. The film also thankfully avoids forcing a romantic relationship between Chandru and Maithra (Rajisha Vijayan ). In the Tamil mainstream, the top reason to have a female character is still to play the love interest to the hero. Her importance to the story becomes less important. It is refreshing to see a star film sidestep this.",

One man tells him that he was once arrested by cops just for greeting them. Another tells him about how he was arrested just because he tried to slink away fearing them. A woman narrates how her husband was forced to 'confess' to a crime which he had not committed after the cops started molesting her. A young boy mentions that the police picked him up just because they could not get his father, and how that one incident made him a perennial suspect at school. These people are clearly damned if they did, and damned if they didn't.This scene is an echo of the scene that opens the film. We see many prisoners being let out of prison. A few cops from the surrounding police stations are waiting. As each prisoner comes out, he is asked for his caste. If they mention a dominant caste's name, they are asked to leave. But those who belong to a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe, they are told to stand in a corner, only for the waiting cops to pick them up as suspects in the many cases that remain unsolved in their station. When some of them complain that there are too few for them to foist cases on, they are told that they could accuses a few of committing more than one crime.",

Court drama that is so thoroughly astonishing & engaging right from the start of the movie. Distinctively unique, even from the very first 5-10 minutes. Definitely from the lines of \"Visaranai\", I am getting used to the recent cinematic legal works such as Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, these kind of thought-provoking scripts is fast catching up as a trending inspiration for all film makers.In his Brave & Bold attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks about custodial violence, police cover-up, systemic corruption at a huge level, that is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole truth and finally there would be no end to the entire picture. The blame game is never ending.I can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is actually truly-brutally honest, clear-cut reality filled with heart-wrenching scenes, that is sure to leave you feeling that there is more bad in this world than good.One can praise Actor Suriya for his super star performance that is so shockingly awesome, only to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has done a wonderful job of acting so well & so concealed, that I just forgot him in the process, being so much involved in the amazing narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the writer TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.Huge round of applause for the extreme level beautiful Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this movie it s core life & the element of suspense. Music by Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own way, made me feel pain and all kinds of emotions throughout the film. Other actors namely Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his sensible acting portions for a supporting role, while Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and especially K. Manikandan who earned the merit of a special mention. One wonders how he actually did all those gruesome scenes.The director unquestionably has to be awarded for the stupendous success of this movie which solely entertains family audiences without depending upon masala factor or \"mass\"components.I would definitely watch it again as it was based on detailed portrayal of true events & people!Hats off to the entire Cast & Crew, Team of Jai Bhim!

Courtroom drama this is so thoroughly remarkable & enticing right from the start of the film. Distinctively particular, even from the first actual 5-10 minutes. Virtually from the traces of \"Visaranai\", i am getting used to the current cinematic criminal works which includes Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, those kind of thought-provoking scripts is speedy catching up as a trending inspiration for all movie makers.In his brave & ambitious attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks approximately custodial violence, police cowl-up, systemic corruption at a big level, this is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole fact and sooner or later there could be no end to the complete picture.

The punches are wholly felt, the screams are heard loud and clear. If you still don't, Sean Roldan's woeful score will drive the point home.",

Yet, it has happened in modern times...simply disgusting.I am also grateful that the world got to identify a unsung hero Mr Chandru (Lawyer) and a martyr like Rajakannu. It is in fact a classic of the year 2021.The actor Surya (as Lawyer Chandru) has done justice to the role and he is just that good. The actor M. Manikandan (as Rajakannu) has a trove of talent that the Director TJ Gnanavel had used these tools amicably with his class in picturization.I am very grateful to TJ Gnanavel to have decided to do this movie for the world to see. It is available in Prime Video and thru other means that you may get your hands on.I heard that there were some 'useless forces' trying to make this movie a failed attempt due to the same reason that this event came about. I really hope they get a life or just crawl under some rock and die...A time well spent watching this classic and please never every watch this if you are already in despair yourself....Beautiful Job, Surya, Gnanavel, K. Manikandan and crew.",

It does not deserve to be in top 250 list.Cast performance, camera techniques, reactions to scenes, it was like an amateur movie. Music is cliche. They are trying to affect you, but it is impossible because everything is very artificial and disattractive. You cannot even focus to the story. I felt like I am watching something from 100 years ago.I watched lots of perfect Indian movies. However, this one was not in the same category. I hope next one will be a good one.",

Suriya has done complete justice to the role and Carries it throughout the film\nSecondly it's not only Suriya but the other actors have done equally well including the actor Prakash Raj, actress Lijomol Jose and every single people who played various roles this sums up the acting in the filmComing to cinematography it was realistic and the shots, angles were convincing. Lighting is excellent what lighting is needed to showcase the story they have been used no personal touches or styles were followedMusic is good, songs and bgm are too good.Finally the real hero Story Screenplay and Direction is class apart because filming is done as what is needed for audience to view the real fight of the people who were distanced by the society and are very far from leading a life that is equal to all. My sincere appreciation to the director as I just could see sengani and the injustice that has happened to her family not just a film there are no other words.In a whole technically as well as story wise the film is one of a kind which will definitely create a impact to your inner soul.Humanity explained, Service to Humanity is service to god.",

            "content": "It's always nice to see a star like Suriya move away from a typical masala flick for Diwali and come up with a hard-hitting courtroom drama based on actual events. In the film, he is more of a tool that helps enact justice for the oppressed victims. There's no showy entry, songs that praise him to the skies, or stock heroines who exist only to admire him. Instead, the film focuses more on the tribal characters played by Manikandan and Lijomol (both excellent) and the series of unfortunate events that they go through.Police brutality has been a sensitive topic, touched upon by very few films and filmmakers, even when we keep hearing several such cases in the news. Films like Visaranai and Karnan paved the way for TJ Gnanavel's Jai Bhim to tell a harrowing social issue without the need to be preachy. Jai Bhim's first hour is a somewhat disturbing watch, with the cries of the oppressed both tugging at your heartstrings and coming across as slightly amplified. There's no subtlety at play. The punches are wholly felt, the screams are heard loud and clear. If you still don't, Sean Roldan's woeful score will drive the point home.But the film gets infinitely better in its final hour. While the finale isn't exactly unpredictable, the journey of getting there is riveting. Both Suriya and Prakash Raj deliver the goods gracefully - not for once, getting in our faces with loud monologues. At a length of 2h 45m, Jai Bhim works due to its performances and topical relevance. Glad that a mainstream audience gets to see it on OTT.77 out of 146 found this helpful.",

It doesn't dare turn its back on hitting where it hurts the most, and its politics is not weighed down by the presence of a star like SuriyaAt one point in this nearly three-hour-long film, there is a goosebumps-raising moment that has a tribal woman - also the protagonist - turning her back on power, refusing to bow down to the system of dominance that has exploited the fruits of their labour, quite literally. Looking at it purely from the point of view of Tamil cinema's masala conventions, it is essentially a \"mass\" scene written for a Dalit character to give her a chance to look at her oppressors in the eye and perhaps tell them: \"You cannot break me.\"",

He stuns all with his body language, mannerisms, and dialogues. He came with subtle and powerful expressions and his new look attracts all. The actor should be appreciated for picking up such scripts.Lijomal Jose who plays the tribal lady is astonishing in her role. The way she portrays a helpless pregnant lady fighting for her husband is terrific. In the same way, Manikandan, who plays Rajanna is also intense. Be it his look or the way he showcases the pain in all the investigation scenes looks realistic.Rajisha Vijayan also came with a good performance.Rao Ramesh as an advocate showed different mannerisms and body language compared to his earlier films.Prakash Raj performed well as a police officer.Rest of the all other actors are justifying their roles.Technical values :\nDirector Gynanavel, he has done an amazing job with the film. He takes the real-life story of lawyer Chandru and showcases one of his best cases on screen. The way he adapts the screenplay with gripping narration is the highlight. The film shows how the lower castes are suppressed and keep you guessing. The pain that the tribal couple goes through is showcased in a moving manner.Music and BGM by Sean Roldan are just amazing.Kathir with his cinematography portrayed the court scenes in a beautiful and gripping manner. He captured the scenic locations of Munnar in a captivating way.Editing is fine. Production values are good.Highlights :\nSuriya fantastic performance\nLijomal jose and manikandan terrific performances\nStory & screenplay\nRealistic narration\nEmotional scenesDrawbacks :\nLengthy runtimeOverall : A Honest and realistic attempt.",

Wonderful message, shakes up your sould, no doubt...is haunting me days after I have watched it. To some up, it's the voice of the voiceless that has to be heard, but I question few things about the director's intentions\n1. CJ Bhaskar's character really doesn't contribute anything to this story, why does he chant Shiva and has a brahmin accent ?2. The much talked about Vanniyar Calendar, d prop and set design, could have done without the calendar too, but seems to be a calculated Easter egg placed\n3. When the pawn shop guy speaks in Hindi, d cop slaps and asks him to speak in English. Anti Hindi sentiment is deep rooted in our culture for a reason , we opposed people who forced us to learn and accept a language, again this scene is d reversal of anti hindi sentiments, guess the director thought of this as a clap block scene. All this said, these r oly mild remarks had and I am not startled or offended by these and certainly doesn't call for Violence against the actor producer. Kudos to the team for this stellar movie.",

He acted like a real tribe. The detailing was good at many points. But the movie didn't look real to me as the Sengani, and Chandru were getting success at many points. If there were still few losses to make it look real, I would have given it 9. The bgm gave goosebumps but the dialogues failed at some points. The guy who played the AG character has also did a good performance even though he is coming from the telugu industry. The police officer should have been given bold dialogues at the court too. The police officer was shown so weak at the court unlike from the police station. This movie is decent but This isn't a perfect movie .",

I thought the movie was good for it's portrayal of corrupt authorities taken down by a dedicated attorney, it hit on many of the points that social justice advocates clamor for here in this country. Based on a true story, one can only marvel at the dedication of a man like Chandru (Suriya), who utilized every bit of means and cunning to humiliate the brutal police authorities and their corrupt political allies. Many times it's a difficult story to watch, as the beatings and punishment doled out by district police against members of lower castes approach grotesquely inhumane treatment. Chandru's efforts eventually pay off, and it was inspiring to see him honored by the citizens he represented at the finale, reminiscent of that final scene of Gregory Peck in \"To Kill A Mockingbird\".One note of caution when coming to the IMDb title page - the names of characters listed in the credits don't match the corresponding identification of characters in the film. As an example, actress Lijo Mol Jose portrayed the agonized wife Sengoni in the credits, but in the film, captioning described her as 'Sannamma'. I'm not versed well enough in Indian nomenclature to know if that's a result of translation or some other factor. I would also question the narrative offered at the end of the story that stated the attorney portrayed in the picture was responsible for ninety six thousand cases in six years. To do that, he would have to have been involved with over forty cases per day, every single day for six years, with no days off!",

Rajakannu is called to a rich man's dwelling to catch a snake that sneaked inside a room. The next day, a case of burglary is reported when the wife of the man reports missing jewellery pieces from her closet and raises doubt on Rajakannu. The police invade Rajakannu's home to find evidence. Rajakannu had left the town earlier for work. During the invasion, the police brutally beat and unlawfully detain the pregnant Sengeni. The police arrest other relatives: Rajakannu's brother Iruttupan, his sister Pachaiammal and his brother-in-law Mosakutty, and torture them to confess Rajakannu's whereabouts. The police find Rajakannu and imprison him. They torture him to confess the crime but release Sengeni. Later, she is informed that all three men in detention are absconding and police threaten her furthermore to tell them about their whereabouts.",

            "content": "In the original case, the wife of the victim, who fought for justice, was Parvati. Her name has been changed. The name of one of the co-accused (victim) was Govindaraju. That too has been changed in the movie.The overtly Hindu names on the side of the victim have been changed. The overtly Hindu names on the side of the perpetrators have been retained. And the Christian name of the main accused has been changed to a Hindu-sounding name. (Details of the original case can be seen here).The role of the judge character is minimal, though in the case the movie is based on, the judge played an important role. The habeas corpus writ petition in the real case was dealt with by Justice P S Mishra. The man was a Gandhian and incidentally a Brahmin, and was a man of integrity and humanism. A prominent mentor of Justice Mishra was Jayaprakash Narayan. But then, highlighting these aspects of the judge in any way would be contrary to the narrative the movie was trying to build.Also, in the original case, the community which the victims belonged to was the Kurava. Even this has been changed to the Irula community.Pretty soon we know why.As the end credits start rolling, we see a bunch of Claretian missionaries of the Catholic Church being thanked. These are a branch of missionaries who are into evangelizing the Irula communities. They use the schemes of the central government, like the 'Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana' and make Irulas the beneficiaries; but all of this is executed through the hands of missionaries.The Irula community are people with strong ties to Hindu Dharma. In 2008, this writer reviewed a book on Irulars. Irulars, while being a tribal community, had close relations with non-tribals too. They worship Sapta-Matrika, Rangaswamy and Siva. The rice pounded by them used to be offered to Siva in the famous temple of Alangadu.But with the arrival of the mills and the weakening of traditional relations with the advent of British, they were declared a 'criminal tribe'.In post-independent India those who fought for Irular rights included Kamaraj, Rajaji and Pasumpon Thevar.Yet, a history of 'caste-Hindu' indifference as well as abuse of the tribal communities had to be constructed. And the discrimination practiced by the state machinery was somehow blamed on the 'caste-Hindu' structure.What can be a better medium to further this narrative than a popular movie?Already, a lot of Hindu social activists and organisations are working silently with the tribal communities. But their work is never based on victimhood narratives or on creating enmity between communities. On the other hand, Christian proselytising predicates itself on such narrative-building which puts the 'oppressive caste-Hindus' against the 'liberating missionaries-and-or-Marxists'.Now think why the Kuravas were changed to Irulas. The memory of them being declared as an 'ST' by Modi government in 2016 may still be fresh. The recommendation to classify Narikuravas as a 'Scheduled Tribe' was initiated by Dr MGR in the '80s. But as late as 2013, the UPA, which was forced to bring a bill because of the agitations of the community, could not pass it.It was the Modi government which ultimately fulfilled the long-standing demand of three important but highly marginalised tribal communities.Clearly, every aspect that could create even a sense of social harmony has been avoided in the movie.For a product of the Chennai film industry, the movie is extraordinarily well crafted - though compared to the similar 'lawyer getting justice for the marginalised' genre in Hollywood, its Chennai counterpart is still in infancy.Ultimately though, Jai Bhim leads the viewer away from reality, from the real causes and from the real heroes. Unfortunately, when good people do not propagate the truth, such distortions are bound to spread and believed to be the truth instead.",

This movie shows the ground reality of how underprivileged are tortured and falsely set up in cases just for the sake of closing up cases by police and so called privileged classes.I have lived in a village and have witnessed all this, this is an eye opening glimpse for us to atleast briefly understand what happens with underprivileged classes and how they live aside in a different corner of a village.Kudos to the director who has picked up such a complex topic and portrayed it so well, acting is top notch, screenplay is good, dialogues are superb.

I'm sure this movie will win multiple awards. This is no doubt an Oscar qualifier. Screenplay & direction is just amazing.One of the exceptional, outstanding movies of Hot Chocolate, Hot Shot, Actor Suriya (Younger Killer Looks). Court drama that is so thoroughly astonishing & engaging right from the start of the movie. Distinctively unique, even from the very first 5-10 minutes. Definitely from the lines of \"Visaranai\", I am getting used to the recent cinematic legal works such as Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, these kind of thought-provoking scripts is fast catching up as a trending inspiration for all film makers.In his Brave & Bold attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks about custodial violence, police cover-up, systemic corruption at a huge level, that is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole truth and finally there would be no end to the entire picture. The blame game is never ending.I can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is actually truly-brutally honest, clear-cut reality filled with heart-wrenching scenes, that is sure to leave you feeling that there is more bad in this world than good.One can praise Actor Suriya for his super star performance that is so shockingly awesome, only to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has done a wonderful job of acting so well & so concealed, that I just forgot him in the process, being so much involved in the amazing narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the writer TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.Huge round of applause for the extreme level beautiful Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this movie it s core life & the element of suspense. Music by Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own way, made me feel pain and all kinds of emotions throughout the film. Other actors namely Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his sensible acting portions for a supporting role, while Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and especially K. Manikandan who earned the merit of a special mention. One wonders how he actually did all those gruesome scenes.",

It is a very powerful movie where the reality slaps you right in the face. How having a voter id or vote bank can protect some citizens from system abuse. Only concern was the viewers should have been informed that the police knew the real culprits and they have a share with the theft. That would have made us understand the severe torture meted out to the victims by the police. Revealing at the end might be good from a cinema point of view but it takes away the vital information from the viewers which they need to know to understand the entire brutality. This movie will bring in some required social changes in the society. The importance of adequate representation for every oppressed community was clearly evident. Tamil film industry will lead the infian movie industry in making movies based out of the social fabric of the society. Which while in remake will be missed out as was the case with asuran. Watch these type of movies in their native language to understand the actual pain and plight. My heartly congratulations in making a wonderful movieti enlighten the masses about oppression.

Writer directors specially taken care about the hearth about the movie which is social msg and real story, this movie has not a single dialogue with the word \"Jai Bhim\" but whole movie given a msg more than this word. In India lower caste people greetings with the word \"Jai Bhim\" just like western countries say \"Hello\" as a greeting word. \"Jai Bhim\" coming from Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar who is father of Indian constitution coming from lower cast community.This movie based on real story which is happened in 90s. Every scenes in the movie shows that the details study of whole team on each character.Director also not looks intrested in any hate communal dailouge, she sticked with the real story very well.Pregnant lady she is main character because story revolving around her her acting look more real.Sometimes movie gives feel like you are watching actual cctv footage of the real story.Thanks to Suriya because no Bollywood actor or director will dare to toch this topic as they are more interested in money making and undigestable comedy or same singam style movie.Bollywood need to take classes first from Tamil industry then we can expect from them atleast some better content.People Alredy proves that they want pure content without any masala, movie named \"Sairat\" (Marathi Movie) made a history in Marathi industry because people knows that marathi industry is full of Brahmin people. But Maharashtra liked the subject of \"Sairat\".Bollywood should know that people don't want glamour anymore they are hungry for an Art, they don't want all time white actress or Gym actors.People more intrest in pure art.Once again I would say \"Jai Bhim\" is a Masterpiece movie in Indian history.",

Best part of the movie is music literally makes us too cry in Emotional scenes.Postive of the movie is relationship between chandru and I.g .perumalsamy. Although nearly three hours long, it manages to keep us gripped. There is not a moment that drags. Surya calm and angry acting Worked well Tribal peoples actors acting are too natural.Unique thing is one man Against the total government for justice that makes Movie too strong.Somebody can felt little bit lag but this movie needs that much length personally I don't feel any lag after the chandru Entry I felt only curious.Overall movie is Worthy and Must watch movie.

The other cast also did a great job.Music:\nThe songs in the movies may not be catchy or commercial but it helped the audience to feel the emotion which the movie wanted to convey. The BGM were so good and very apt for the film.Direction:\nT. J Gnanavel has given quality movies in the past but this one is his masterpiece till date. It will be one of the best movies he has directed. The movie was simple, to the point and kept the audience nailed to the seat.This movie is based on true events and shows what injustice and hardship tribal community has gone through. It is a long film with 2hr and 40 min screen time but not even in one scene it felt slow. It has a nice pace and awesome dialogue and screenplay which will make almost 3 hrs feel so short. If the movie went on for another hour I wouldn't have complained.The film was finished and released even in this pandemic so hats off to the entire team. This is by far the best movie Ive seen this year. I wouldn't be surprised if bags multiple national awards.",
