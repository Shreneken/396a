Now moving to the film, it takes us back to the point where Radhe ended the dukedom of Gani Bhai.. However this time the film runs on a tedious note with only engaging in parts. Salman as Radhe goes on a manhunt to look for the wealthiest man of Mumbai secretly running a crime syndicate. The story from onwards is predictable.. It is that old formula of Salman hunting baddies but this doesn't work time and again.Pertinent to mention that the scenes between Radhe and Randeep Hooda just before the intermission are good. However that is not enough to make one glued for more than 2 hours. The signature shirt scene of Salman is there well at the end. However this looks monotonous with every passing Salman film. It can give you cheers in first some shows but won't connect with the audience.Acting wise Salman has done that acting which he is known for. Disha has a small role in parts. Jacky is ignored. However Randeep Hooda is brilliant.On the whole it is a big big let down.. A Colossal Disappointment..",

I mean WHAT were you thinking? Your body language, dialouge delivery and expressions were so bad. It is as if like you did'nt know how to act or was acting just for the sake of it.For me the biggest letdown was not the movie or the script but it was you. You were the most negative part in the movie. Had it been any other actor, or even a newcommer, this movie could have been a bit watchable.And for Prabhudeva, please stop making fun of yourself. You were my childhood hero, had immense respect for you but you are making some crap movie which you should stop.And for Randeep Hooda, the only positive thing about the movie was Randeep Hooda. So these two stars are only for him.And for script, direction, music - Sorry there wasn't any script in the movie and I fast forward all the songs as they were just crap.",

            "content": "Review By Kamal KGood lord, viewers deserve better than this! The directors that make fortunes off commercial cinema, the actors who we've elevated to superstardom, the producers that hold the power to greenlight projects-they all need to do better. This will simply not do.No one's even pretending to act in this sham of a movie. Salman Khan, ageing ungracefully, with a heroine half his age, recycles dialogues from his own movies, takes a lift to 'Galaxy apartments', and looks directly at the screen to wish 'Eid Mubarak'.The story is convoluted and disjointed. When the crime rate goes up in Mumbai and young ones are being lured by the drug mafia, the cops decide to call on Radhe (Salman Khan) who has '97 encounters and 23 transfers' behind him. The tired dialogue explains that he doesn't follow rules but can get the job done. Hearing their plea (\"police department ko tumhaari zaroorat hai\"), Radhe takes up the job swaggering, scowling and never in a uniform.Jackie Shroff appears as his comical, insecure senior and Disha Patani, a fantastic dancer with sketchy acting skills, can also be seen in a thankless role that insults everyone's intelligence. Women are usually not given their due in director Prabhu Deva's movies, and here too, we see an objectified, air-headed character with no depth or ambitions/interests of her own.After their meet-cute, when Dia (Disha Patani) asks him what he does for a living, the 50-plus Khan replies that he's a struggling model. Of course, she believes him. She helps him with a photoshoot where he is referred to as the 'new boy' and 'cute boy' leading up to the mandatory shirtless scene.'Radhe...' is based on Korean film 'The Outlaws'. Judging from the trailer, the Hindi film has twisted the original's premise beyond recognition. Instead of borrowing from their films, it would be wonderful if our filmmakers could take inspiration from the bold strides taken by South Korean cinema.Not as disastrous as Dabangg 3, this one comes close. Why after that debacle, would the same producer-director team-up for another vanity project is a mystery.Meanwhile the villains have dialogues like 'Minister ko paisa khila diya hai.' Randeep Hooda as the antagonist is a carboard character but his talent shines through anyway.Jackie Shroff's recent film choices are befuddling. After the Hello Charlie where he was in a gorilla costume for most of the movie, this is another odd choice.With decades of superstardom, Salman Khan carries with him the capacity to make a shift in the industry. And yet he chooses to make this. It's disappointing, really.We're living in unprecedented, heartbreaking times. If we are to watch cinema, it has to be the kind that feeds the soul. This movie is depleting and leaves you tired.To the viewers who are ok going through an unbearable movie for a few songs and a couple of Khan's shirtless scenes, I just have this to say- you deserve better.",

Seems like they had someone else in mind and then offer it to Jackie Shroff. It doesn't suit Jackie Dada at all. What people does on the name of Comedy these days.And did Salman watch his shirtless scene? I doubt, if he had, he himself would have said to remove it. It clearly seems fake and doesn't server any purpose.The only good point is Randeep Huda along with few side actors. They have made this film barely watchable. A bit of pat on back for action master. Action is bearable and much better than that fake action stunts using ropes and strings.Overall its only for Salman's fans. And I doubt even they can watch it till end.",

The story has multiple continuity issues, it is predictable from the start, none of the twist is surprising and you don't feel any emotion from the start to the end. The story has been poorly written by AC Mugil and Vijay Maurya (also the dialogue writer) and even the so called choreographer turned director Prabhudeva has done a horrible job.The acting is so poor this time. Salman Khan looked good but there were many factors that have let this act down. Disha Patani is terrible to the worse extent (she can only be cast in Calvin Klein Advertisements). Also, Randeep hooda looked very unconvincing with his role this time. All the three villains are not up to the mark. Jackie Shroff was good in comic portions. Loved his scenes with Salman Khan. But, his mini dress scene was horrible. Poor casting by SKF especially Disha Patani. Except, Title Track, the music is total cringe. Poor, Very Very PoorThere is nothing positive in this movie to watch. The climax and the end is very much predictable. Also, the Salman's entry to the fight scene is below par. I sincerely request everyone to just avoid this movie. Salman Khan is a brand name in Bollywood Cinema. He does not deserve this type of Prabhudeva's mediocre movie.",

            "content": "Your \"Most Wanted Bhai\" is here, in your drawing room, waiting to be seen and lauded. Radhe is actually much ado about nothing really. A bad man Rana (Randeep Hooda) is in Mumbai, feeding drugs to the youth, driving them nuts while the deadly chemicals consume them, and Mumbai Police must stop him. Rana has a few henchmen with him all the time, and together, they create mayhem wherever they go. So, Radhe (Salman Khan), suspended from his duties (we don't know why, but gauge it must be for his violent encounter specialisation having gone a notch worse than usual) must be recalled to confront Rana and \"clean up\" Mumbai again.A cat and mouse chase commences, mostly culminating in mire and more violent clashes, involving scores of baddies and gazillions of props and weapons, but Rana remains elusive to Radhe. After a few face offs and near misses, the two men have the final showdown in a helicopter that obviously had to crash land and blow up so that the hand combat leading to the climax can have the audience drooling for more action.Radhe is at best a mediocre potboiler of a story that has been told a million times since early 1970s by Bollywood about honest cops and dirty rotten drug smugglers, that springs no surprises. It remains immensely predictable and is over the top with poor jokes, puns and gory action. Absolutely no one gets a chance to act - actually, there's neither the need, nor the scope available in the script. Arjun Kanungo (yes, the singer & composer), one of Rana's henchmen did have an opportunity to show some histrionics and he makes an effort, but his role is so minuscule and screen time so limited, that you blink and miss him. Salman Khan and Randeep Hooda do show off a fantastic chemistry yet again, but it remains confined to bloody, unbelievable and repetitive, fiercely fought battles. Disha Patani is at best, wasted. It's sad to see Jackie Shroff in a strange, potentially important role where he has to do things he has never done earlier, like wearing a micro dress and dancing with Salman Khan - the sequence was pitiful. The songs are forgettable, ill placed and spaced, and the music is dreadful. The action admittedly is great and so is the running time of 109 minutes - even that tests your patience as you tend to let your mind wander off. Remember, you were asked to leave your brains behind? No? I am asking you to do so now - please comply!",

            "content": "Radhe (2021) :\nMovie Review -Salman Khan is struggling with Eid releases since 2017 as his last huge hit came in 2016 which was also his last good film on Eid. With Tubelight (2017), Race 3 (2018) and Bharat (2019) he made a hat-trick of craps on Eid and that's the main reason why these 3 films couldn't emerge Clean Hits in India. 2020 went without a Eid release but in 2021 he came back again on his favourite festival but unfortunately the streak of bad films continues. Korean crime-action drama The Outlaws was a big hit there and it's a good entertainer even though it doesn't have anything extraordinary. It is a simple film where a cop is set to demolish the drugs racket. It has typical Korean style action and also focuses on regional gangwars. Radhe makes a massy version of it by destroying the simplicity of The Outlaws and then additional factors like unmatched romance, outdated vision and cheap humour takes away all the chances of making a decent flick.Radhe (Salman Khan), is an outrageous cop who doesn't follow any rules is appointed by seniors to stop a harmful drug racket in the City. He claims to clean the city but he's unaware of a new drug dealer Rana (Randeep Hooda) who is an little extra evil kind of guy. Disha Patani plays Diya, a love interest of Radhe and also a sister of Radhe's senior officer Mr. Avinash (Jackie Shroff). The storyline is 90% same as the The Outlaws with exact situations being recreated while the Romance and other entertainment elements are part of additional changes. Actually, these additional factors have destroyed the screenplay because then it had to compromise with the essence of the story. At the same time it tries so many forceful and unconventional theories just to make the film look massy but then it turns into pathetic childish affair.Radhe has a basic story which makes a good sense for youth audience, however, the screenplay forgets to make a speech on it while taking too much care of machoism and hardcore scenics. For instance, the entry scene of Salman. He jumps into the room by breaking the whole big glass, spits a piece of glass on a man but guess what, the in incident happens in silent atmosphere. Can you believe it? Breaking a glass without making any noise?? It doesn't end here, there are at least 10 to 12 scenes in the film which goes on like this without making one percent sense. See, i don't expect an intellectual Cinema like Satyajit Ray, Bimay Roy, Bergman or even massy film like Rajamouli and Rohit Shetty from Salman, I know his and Prabhudeva's limits so i expect a decent film and not a single penny more. I mean he had made good films like Wanted, Dabangg, Sultan and decent/average films like Bodyguard, Ek The Tiger and some more but this is just too degrading. I mean the entire idea of making a commerical entertainer is completely lost.Acting wise, Radhe is a big disaster show. The only guy who has done some Acting is Randeep Hooda, rest all are hideous. Radhe is somehow lifted by Action scenes coming at right time and Salman Khan- The Superstar but downgraded by Salman Khan-An Actor. He is so absurd at so many occasions. Disha Patani and Jackie Shroff looks totally clueless throughout the film. Prabhu Deva's B Grade direction and outdated vision are the two big reasons why Radhe fails to make a decent version of a good flick. The time has come to quit direction, I don't think he will ever be able to make fantastic mass films like Wanted and Rowdy Rathore (both are simply copy-pasted) in future and anyhow continue using the same methods he used for these two films won't save him for sure. Overall, Radhe has little fun here and there but more boredom. It's nothing but a Race 3 version set in Cops World.RATING - 4/10*",

            "content": "An official remake of Korean Thriller 'The Outlaws'; \"Radhe\" which is allegedly a massy 'entertainer' fails to bring forth the entertainment itself! Topsy-turvy narration, cringe-worthy dialogues, and plain atrocities in the name of visual effects ensure this affair to be no less than a torment!There was a time, back in the 2010s; Salman was revitalizing his career with consecutive blockbusters such as Wanted, Dabangg, Kick, etc. And pleading guilty, I took pleasure attending them as a kid. Fast forward to 2021, I have grown up and he's still in a similar spot endeavoring with the same old formulaic approach i.e. PLAY IT SAFE, and remain hopeful that his ardent admirers will follow suit!Salman Sir, I'm afraid to break it to you but things have drastically changed!The revolution this film industry has gone through in recent years concerning Content; calling it a phenomenon would be an understatement! And most of all, viewers too have changed their perceptions during this period of transition.Make no mistake, I'm not the guy who's ill-disposed to 'Masala' movies; In contrast, I do extol what the South Indian film industry comes up with in that context! They produce some of the finest massy projects even to this day but they do so in an appropriate manner!That's plenty of my personal opinions, now let us address the elephant in the room, 'Radhe'. If I were to boil it down in a single sentence, I would describe it as \"An awfully executed repetitive piece of garbage that didn't have any clue apropos of its motives and purposes\".Merely on a technical basis it's got some style, I'll you give you that. But it's all show and no go! Screenplay lacking in continuity and above all, key developements in the storyline come to pass without any prior build-up ahead of their revelations! And the Music being largely futile as they entirely appears to be forceful inclusions rather than obligatory constituents!Albeit there is a naive incentive about educating the audience about Drugs and the harm and distress it brings upon the people who suffer. But that too felt shoddily lumped together! As there aren't any sincere attempts being made to set up its base! Being used solely as a backdrop for our Main lead to beat up some bad guys! That's it!Defining the performances, Disha Patani is despicably squandered. Simply put, she was extremely irritating. However, Randeep Hooda on the other side did what he could with such prosaic script in hand. He was probably if not the only saving grace in here! Speaking of Salman: well! You know, he's just being himself for the umpteenth time!As we finally arrived at the point of conclusion, I just wanna finish with giving a piece of advice to the creators. There's still time, alter your manifestos and your way of thinking as this type of works do no good for the Fans or the medium of Cinema in general.",

The police employs trigger happy yet suspended police officer Radhe. The interaction between Radhe and the police is mind numbingly vague. They tell him there is a drug issue and they need his help.A. The first time the police meets Radhe, they never mention any investigation to Radhe that they have done in this huge issue. What was the police doing before employing Radhe ?B. First day Radhe joins back into the force, he notices a young male drop a letter near the police station bin explaining about the drug issue and how his friends have been losing their lives. He comes to complain to the police every day for a month but the police chooses to stay ignorant.If this is true, why did they never mention to Radhe that not only they have done absolutely nothing in this investigation, they have also been absolute buffoons when witnesses are walking up to police spoon feeding them information. This is serious unprofessionalism from the perspective of the police.C. When Radhe finally decided that they should get to the bottom of this drug issue, they employ school children to be their informers.Now, I know what you are thinking- this would be an extremely naive plan considering this was decided by adults.Right ? Nope, the plan works splendidly! All the drug deals happen in broad daylight almost right next to the 25 odd children employed as informers in the entire city, who conveniently video tape the deals and forward them to the police.However it begs the question dearly, that if all the drug deals were happening without any respect for privacy, then how come the entire police department informers and officers were not able to notice any such deals which the school children could easily notice happening in front of them almost all the time ever since they got employed to be informers. This cannot be the taskforce employed to protect citizens, certainly ?!I don't want to bash on the direction, story, cinematography, screenplay or whatnot. But I wonder how did the police let itself be shown so foolishly and stupidly through out the film and be okay with it. The reason will remain as surprising as the decision to make this movie.",

Nothing.Everything is borrowed from Sallu's earlier movies where the story and Prabhudeva's direction are the real culprits.The trailer looked terrible but in comparison to the movie, the trailer is a blockbuster. This is not a new phenomenon. Almost every Salman movie follows a similar pattern. No story but full-on Swag mantra. However, you end up enjoying his swag but here, there is no relief.He looked tired. Not a single dialogue or expression or his moves are good enough to charm you. Further, Disha is the absolute right choice for a role that has no meat. She is perfect. There is no other name to replace her for this 'good for nothing' role.Jackie is wasted as well. It is embarrassing to see him in such a bad role. The action scenes are boring. The villain played by Randeep Hooda is a disaster. There is nothing to save the movie.Please, stay away from this one.

We all have the reach of the Hollywood movies and other international content in our hands so this type of scripts don't work anymore.Already Dabang series has been ruiend with dabang 3 lousy script and poor acting and now Wanted is ruined. 2008 wanted was such a delight woth good songs, comedy, action and Radhe is vomit.Salman looks very tired now ,take rest,take a break and then come with a bang but don't give us these garbage.Please Salman choose good scripts and good directors.We want bajrangi bhaijaan, sultan, tiger scripts with energetic performance.",

            "content": "Radhe review :In this Corona induced lockdown, I caught up on some of the old '80s Hindi films which I had missed then. Most of these actioners would invariably have Dharmendra or Mithun Chakraborty fighting out the villains for reason no one cared for. The plot didn't matter here; the hero did. Radhe is exactly that film. Only it has the present day superstar Salman Khan in place of Dharam or Mithunda, and just like them, bhai pulls off the non-existent script entirely on his shoulders.Making a superhero like entry smashing right through glass shards, Salman plays to the gallery completely bashing up a dozen bozos and mouthing lines to please his fan base. Breaking the fourth wall, he even wishes them Eid Mubarak!! He is Radhe (obviously!!!), an encounter specialist cop - a character carried forward from his own hit Wanted (2009) - who is out to clean Mumbai city from the drug menace penetrated by an unknown outsider (Randeep Hooda).In between the crash boom bang action, Radhe finds time to flirt with his boss' sister (Disha Patani) and even fool her to believe that he is a wannabe model. \"Tumhare liye Bigg Boss theek rahega\" says someone as a self reference to Bhai who then looks bemused at the camera. The Disha love angle is the most unconvincing and needless part of this one hour fifty minute movie and shockingly, even Salman didn't seem to be enjoying himself in the romantic shots.On the positive, the songs are zany, choreographed efficiently and merged seamlessly in the narrative. Particularly, the 'Dil De Diya' number is fun to watch with Bhai's trademark grooves and Randeep's moon walk.On the tech front, Mumbai city is captured well looking much quieter and sparse probably shot immediately after last years lockdown. Some of the action sequences are impressive like the washroom fight and the one involving a fire extinguisher. The climactic chopper moments are however a big let down with some really tacky VFX which gives it a '90s videogame wala feel...Pathetic!! The editing is also quite patchy in places with disjointed scenes. Prabhu Deva's direction is strictly average. He doesn't appear to be in control here and even the overall film seems to be hurriedly made and dished out...Of the cast, Jackie Shroff is hopelessly miscast as heroine ka bhai where Disha actually looks like his daughter rather than sister. Randeep is impressive as the main villain. Note his eyes while lusting after a henchman's moll (Ihana Dhillon). Its a super fine performance no doubt!! Marathi actors Siddharth Jadhav and Pravin Tarde get pivotal roles and nail it. On the other hand, Disha Patani has precious little to do as far as acting does. She is a glam doll here but isn't able to strike any notable chemistry with her superstar co-star making their pairing fall flat on its mooh!!Expectedly, Radhe belongs to Salman Khan with the star clearly rising above the routine script and making the otherwise mundane film an imminently watchable fare. This one is better than his last few outings like Tubelight (2017) and Race 3 (2018) but not to the level of Dabangg (2010) and Wanted (2009).Final score : Salman gets a full five but Radhe is sadly Aadhe!!Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

            "content": "Radhe offers you a clich\u00e9 plot, poor performances, predictable story, and cringe-worthy dialogues. The movie fails to entertain the viewers. If you're looking for an action masala entertainer, this will let you down. Director Prabhu Deva failed to recreate the magic of Wanted (2009).The trashy writing doesn't do justice to Salman's stardom. He still holds the charisma and always looks terrific while doing action & punching the baddies. But his charm cannot rescue this misadventure.In the acting department, Randeep Hooda is the better of the lot. Although, his character has no depth still he manages to essays the brutal character efficiently. Disha Patani in skimpy clothes and hot pants adds plenty of glamour to the scenes but it doesn't always work. Jackie Shroff is wasted because of the poorly-written role and his attempt at humour falls flat due to the humourless dialogues. Other supporting casts fail to leave any impact.The background score by Sanchit and Ankit Balhara is loud but adds to the impact. Editor Ritesh Soni has done a fine job by keeping the film's runtime to 114 minutes. The cinematography is decent and action sequences are well executed in the second half. But the washroom fight sequence seen in John Abraham and Emraan Hashmi starrer Mumbai Saga was far better. The climax is not as exciting as we have seen in many of Salman's films in the past.Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai Movie Rating:\nDirection 1/5\nActing 1.5/5\nEditing 2.5/5\nStory 1.5/5\nScreenplay 1.5/5\nOverall Hit ya Flop Rating: 1.5 out of 5 Stars (Not Watchable)RADHE is strictly for Salman Khan fans.

Narration is fast paced and doesn't make you bored. Salman who sleepwalked throughout race 3 and dabangg 3 improves in radhe. Randeep hooda was as expected brilliant. Action scenes were entertaining. Among songs, i liked dil de diya and seetimaar(audio only).Prabhu deva goes back to his wanted days in direction but disappoints in choreography. He doesn't even make a cameo appearnace on screen. It was worst to cast jackie shroff as disha's brother. And the whole film is predictable.On the whole, i enjoyed radhe personally and its far better than race 3 and dabangg 3.",

To start with, movie's script is very lousy n lame, in most of the scene, your reaction would be \"to hit your bad\", rather than wasting time- watching this movie. The only thing good was Randeep Hooda's acting, whenever he come on the screen, script get its speed. The action scenes of the movie were not realistic - specially the scenes in which Salman appeared. Disha Patni -was just an eye candy in the movie. Her acting goes down as compared to her previous movies. She was calling ,Salman \"a sweet boy\"- how he can be look like a boy, in first meeting- she said, \"tumhe body banani chahiye\"- I was like,\"eyes hai ya button\", she played a model, and she can't even see his body. I don't know why Jacky Shroff did this movie, there's nothing for him to do. Mahesh Manjarejar would be a better choice but as he has been killed in Wanted- hence maker's can't have him again. Music, was not as catchy as in \"Wanted\". Salman needs to understand this thing, he can't repeat the same formula - with today's audience. Wanted,Dabang- worked but that doesn't mean- you'll do a different action scenes with the same kind of script- and audience will like it. This thing already has been backfired twice -Dabang-3,Race2.Ignore this movie- if you want to save your time.",

Nothing much Woww performance from him..His routine style, cliche dialogues which made only for him, overrated stunts which the audience comes to know its made for only for him...If stunts are over we could understand, as film is a make belief but the makers should realize that audience are not FOOLS....kuch bhi dikhao aur taali marenge ???... There has to be sense while choreographing action sequences....Reason behind casting Disha Patani is very clear, it was just for gymnastic dance steps and for glamour basssss that's it, Katrina Kaif could have been better if a heroine really required..Jackie Shroff another question mark.... Yyyyyy him, pathetic, not at all convincing.......FYIP this movie is the remake of 2017 South Korean \" THE OUTLAWS\".... So another copy paste picture but taken in a senseless way...Salman, after SRK is time for u to take a break and think seriouslyNow let's see how will be his future projects i.e Tiger 3, Kick 2, Kabhi Eid Kabhi Diwali, Antim and remake of Tamil Movie Master....",

Both of them proved no matter how brilliant a plot they get, they can only make substandard rubbish film.Salman had been in a good track with Tiger, Sultan, Bhajrangi etc. Prabhudeva with his lack of creativity couldnt even manage to make this remake right. Dabangg 3 was sluggishly boring and this outdid that film.Sad to see when the industry has come miles ahead in technical aspects, the film making itself has returned to stone age.Disha Patani was present only as an eye candy with no meaty role than to occasionally praise salman's body and looks.Jackie Shroff and Randeep Hooda were the only plus points in this film. Megha and Bharath were pleasant additions yet nothing for them to bite onto.As usual, this salman film too is another one man show. Gorgeous lady falls for him, Goons gets beaten up, Grown ups act as fans when he's around with zero expressions on Salmans face while all this happens.Unfortunately Big arms and CGI six packs will keep Salman busy for atleast another decade.",

No music.The entry of Randeep is awesome in the guise of the brutal bad guy in the black outfit which is like that of Hollywood gangsters. He is cruel, brutal, and never leaving his enemies. Dialogue delivery is fluent but bad writing spoils the show.Disha is used as a showpiece and love interest of Radhe without which Bollywood can't survive and go ahead. Just for showoff glamour and dances. We have seen it umpteenth times.Jackie was just wasted. He should stop playing such cheap roles which are forced on him, In the name of comedy they are serving vulgar scenes. He is creepy and pathetic.Entry of Radhe is forced to be larger than life person. It is illogical that no sound of glass shattering was heard by the person and he gets injured. Also carrying of one man with one hand.Actions scenes were so boring as these seem taken from Baaghi 3 where the hero jumps to a helicopter and dhobi ghat scene from simmba. Flying motorcycles in the climax or helicopter being crashed on land.The screenplay is boring and predictable. It ends the franchise of Wanted just like Dabangg 3. No storyline no drama just plastic faces moving. Dialogues are awful no sense and forced. They are written in lockdown mind. The direction sucks grow up Prabhudeva or just go to choreography. Why destroy other's careers and Image.The movie is shot in lockdown as it shows empty roads of Mumbai and liberty is provided to the hero to ride even on the cycle.Aerial views suck as they occupy most of the screen time. We know India has one sea link and many movies were shot on this link. Why repeat.Music was zero and one song Dil De Diya is also cut short why only hope for the movie also reduced.No novelty is used in the movie. Waste of time and money. The persona of Salman overshadowed the Radhe. It is so dull that Salman sleeps with his eyes open in one scene.Arjun Kanungo is fine in his first outing but used for a limited time.It is dull and hilarious, moronic, mess provides for nothing new to watch.Overall 1 star for Randeep only.",

It will be loved by fans but the others will dislike it immensely. It has everything for his fans which includes a beautiful heroine, foot stamping music, fights, songs, dances, gravity defying ridiculous stunts. Everything over the top ( pun intended ). Salman does what he has done before in his films. He is Chulbul Pandey once again with a different name.and even uses the same tag line. Disha Patni is ravishing , plays coy and is glamorous in a frothy role. Randeep Huda looks menacing as the villain. Jacky Shroff tries to do some comedy without success.To all critics and others who have panned the film and given it 1-2 out of ten, I have only one question \"Didn't you know what to expect in a Salman film where he is a bhai and he is wanted too ?\".In any case, irrespective of the criticism, Salman and his producer friends will laugh all the way to the bank.",

But we have to see the aspect of story telling, direction too.I have seen the Korean movie and let me tell you why it worked. The core of the story is a crazy gangster went on rampage of killing to take over a cross country region. Now this is the core of it. However in Radhe, the core is drugs, and it sell it there is one guy who came to run the business who is crazy too. Now in here it's drugs, so if you want to stop drug smuggling you have to stop thing guy who is also someone who can kill mindlessly . And there is no fear of how he does it. The other two guys who work for Randeep too is not worth a watch personalities. They more come across like a prop.Now this story's issue if not enough, the writers and directors are bringing love story of Salman khan with a hugely age difference girl. And Deadpool action sequences, pointless remake songs, stupidity of Jackie Shroff and creepy dialogues and plot points. It seems like someone who don't have any knowledge of filmmaking, direction, writing/story telling and acting all ganged up with a group of fans and workers of Salman khan who throw out this film. If you don't take criticism of what's wrong in your approach, you can't change a damn thing or improve and it's more like attempting to pamper each other's ego sort of film.None of the actors seem even worth for films and better suited to work in modeling agency rather than acting of any kind. Randeep does though try to fit in but he is so pointless in whole movie. You can put anyone in that place to fit in.It's fine if you want to make films for Salman khan, but have some sensibilities of why what how it's going to be made.",

His onscreen chemistry with Disha Patani is too cute and romantic which adds more masala in the story.Beside Salman's star power in Radhe, another factor which makes this movie worth watching is the presence of Randeep Hooda as a drug lord and the main target of Radhe. At many points Randeep overtakes Salman with his punchy dialogues and serious facial expressions. At some points, they remind of their confrontation scenese in Kick movie.Director Prabhudeva deserves appreciation for his returning point as a masala entertainer with Radhe.",

But I took a risk and watched Radhe because I really liked Wanted.It was everything but a sequel to Wanted. There are some recurring characters and Salman's name is Radhe (which isn't even his real name in Wanted) and that \"commitment\" dialogue, which reminded me that it's a sequel of Wanted. The movie didn't have Radhe, it had Salman Khan. If you want to do a sequel with same characters but in a completely different world, do it like Lage Raho Munna Bhai. If you want to bring in some continuity, make sure it's not a completely alienated sequel.Radhe is just a name. The character we saw in Wanted is completely absent here. So, Salman Khan (not Radhe) is hired to take down a notorious drug dealer. And he's a complete pervert here. He was cool in Wanted. He was at least a good guy there. Jackie Shroff was cringe. Whatever they made Jacky look like was an insult to him. He deserves a lot better than this. He's a better actor than Salman Khan and has done many memorable films than Salman Khan.After diverting 200% from the plot for almost half the movie, they remember that there's a plot they take the most obvious Dirty Harry route of chasing the criminal, not knowing that chasing the criminals wasn't what made Dirty Harry one of the greatest films of all times. And even when the villain is killed (in the way how Bane broke Batman's back in The Dark Knight Rises), it feels like an absolute lackluster way to kill your villain. The action scenes towards the end reminded me of A Good Day to Die Hard, which is one of the worst action films of all times. By the way, is Salman Khan the real life Barry Allen or something? Anyway, nevermind.I don't know who wrote the script. They just need to find a new job because a 6 year old can write a better script. I haven't seen the Korean film which it acknowledged in the beginning, but I can assure you that it's nothing like that movie because these kind of stupidity can be there only in Bhai's films. The supposedly funny parts were so cringy that it would look awkward in a kindergarten play. There are forcibly shoehorned (un)funny and absolutely terrible sequences that are capable of killing your braincells.Let me close this review with an insult - this movie makes Race 3 look like a masterpiece and A Good Day to Die Hard look like a \"Citizen Kane\" of action films.Score : cringe 0/10.",

SAVW YOURSELF SAVE YOUR FAAMILY AND FRIENDS, DONT LET 'EM WATCH GADHE!EID MUBARAK! \ud83d\ude4f",

Salman Khan is awesome as usual and Randeep Hooda is on\ud83d\udd25,the plus point of this movie are its strong villains. The Randeep Hooda gang is powerful.I watched this movie on pay per view model and initially I was reluctant towards paying for a movie at my home but now after completing the movie I can say it's worth of it. But I bought Zee5 annual subscription worth Rs499 and I hope Zee5 will provide more content coz current hindi content is very less but regional content is awesome and I can go for Satyajit Ray's Bengali movies on Zee5 that's why I bought yearly plan and also it's very cheap though it also has hindi shows but I will advice u to check yourself before buying year pack otherwise you can also watch Radhe for 249Rs.So at last I just want to say if you liked wanted then u gonna love Radhe,though recent few movies of Salman Khan were disappointing but Radhe brings a change in the Air.Just watch it and enjoy full\ud83d\udc4d\nPS- Those giving it completely negative reviews are from boycott bollywood gang so ignore them and try to find out only genuine reviews by reading them.Also get 10% cashback on Zee5 by using promo ode GET10 or ZEE5INDUS.",

He doesn't play by the rule book and has a heightened moral radar.The plot twists appear ludicrous and choppy. Even the villains are unintentionally hilarious. Watching a talented actor like Hooda play a tinny villain in a long leather coat and longer hair is painful to the eyes. Apparently, he hopes to run a drug empire in Mumbai and the city's impressionable youth are his targets. But the way he goes about marking his territory is laughable. Hooda isn't menacing, but comes across as a pesky menace.Seasoned actors such as Jackie Shroff is wasted in poorly-written roles. His attempt at humour lands in a few places, but falls flat for most parts of the film.Don't be zapped if you see a skimpily-clad Jacqueline Fernandez gyrating sensuously in a dazzling song cameo or see its young heroine Disha Patani be a glorified airhead who makes being ditzy an art form.Even if you are in a forgiving mood during a festive holiday, Khan doesn't give us much to hold onto in 'RadheRADHE is strictly for Salman Khan fans.",

He does not belong in movies, he could just resort to TikTok if he plans on selling horribly shot and edited collection of videos in the name of cinema.Prabhu Deva, the incredibly talented dancer has once again proved that he has zero knowledge of filmmaking. More disappointing is the fact that he still portrays our women as mere objects to complement undesirable hooliganism and toxic patriarchy.The glamour bunch of Radhe must have been focused on making the viewers get away from the harsh realities of everyday life for 2.5 hrs. What they missed out is the fact that Radhe actually messes up every remaining ounce of peace with its problematic everything. Such movies are probably made to lower the IQ of the viewers of India so that people can continue to worship flag bearers of nepotism and fake aristocracy that dominate Bollywood today.Even if we can get to the roots of \"why,\" it is impossible to answer how can they make such a worthless production in the name of cinema.

He has a lot of very diverse roles in different genres.In general, he is not bad in this film either. But not as bright as it could be.It's probably the plot. In theory, this is an action movie, a crime drama, a thriller. But something was clearly not enough for the film to leave a bright mark in the memory.The plot is incredibly simple and even worn out by cinema. A tough cop joins the fight against the drug mafia.And everything.Unfortunately, they did not come up with any intrigue and nothing unexpected for the characters and the story itself.Everything is held only in the picture.The very staging of the fights is feigned and rather clowning in the old traditions of Indian cinema of the last century. And S. Khan is not a fighter after all. But he's a good dancer. That's what pleased the film - excellent choreography.And to my joy, they added quite a few funny moments. I.e. There is humor and comedy in the film. A little not often, but it enlivens the general monotony and predictability of the plot.Fortunately, the film is not long by Indian standards - only an hour and forty-five.In general, you can watch it for big fans of Indian cinema and fans of Salman Khan himself. And so the film does not shine with originality.",

Frequent action sequences keep you hooked and the film serves as a great escapism after craving big blockbuster movies from Bollywood. The film looks track in and out of the film and the film is filled with action sequences that over-crowds the film but the shorten run-time is accepted. Radhe is a timeless watch and serves as a great escapism from the Covid-19 pandemic. Though, it is strictly for Salman Khan fans and Action Lovers alike.",

Salman as Radhe goes on a manhunt to look for the wealthiest man of Mumbai secretly running a crime syndicate. The story from onwards is predictable..

            "content": "*Please read carefully*. Whenever a film does not meet our expectations, we tend to say that the film has a disastrous story and has got no plot at all. Same goes for Radhe. However, radhe had the same story as of 'The Outlaws' which was a very successful film. Salman Khan is the most targeted person on the internet. There are people who are always trying to pull this man down. After Race 3, Ramesh taurani said in an interview that there were certain groups that were created just to backlash the man. Although race 3 was not a good film. When SRK or Aamir khan dances, people do not question their dancing skills. But when Salman Khan does the same, there is constant hate. When Salman Khan was standing still in Dhinka Chika and was just moving his pockets, that became a blockbuster. But in Seeti maar he actually put in some effort after wanted in spite of being 55 years old. But the hate has so much risen over the years that whatever he does is constantly criticised and hated. There are few groups on social media who spreads a negativity and the negativity is extremely contagious. Even if a person does not dislike a film, he/she will say negative things just to be among the 'hating club' and will go along with the trend. Radhe is a film where you never feel that it is slow and boring. Yes there was 2 dialogues which were disappointing. And yes the production value should've been better(Car scene and helicopter scene). Otherwise the rest of the action was amazing. The comedy scenes were amazing unlike dabangg 3 or race 3. Like Salim Khan said, it wasn't a great film. But it was not a bad film either. Seriously guys? 173k voting on IMDb for a film? That is like the most number of votes you have ever seen for an Indian film on IMDb. So you're telling me people found it extremely important to come to IMDb and spread awareness of how bad the film was? Like dude. Give me a break. Salman was always targeted. But he has always made a comeback like no one else. And he will soon come back and rise like never before. This is a fun film to watch. A good popcorn flick. However, not the best.",

The ad of being human electric cycle being a shameless plugging done at its best really showed the speed of Salman Khan whether in a car or on foot or his brand new cycle on which he does not even cycle defeating its purpose which is revolutionary. The jokes like Diya and NaDiya are really well thought out and really lets out a good laugh to the extent that the movie has to be paused for the laughing to stop. The six packs of Salman Khan were revealed way too early so that could have been improved. Jackie Shroff should be allowed to talk in his mother tongue in every movie because that is when he shines as evident by the ad video that went viral just because of his acting skills a while back. The crew did a great job reducing the age of Salman Khan to make him seem the same age as Disha Patani and Jackie Shroff as her brother. Overall a work of art and a true successor to Wanted.",

I was not even able to watch this in fast forward. Every time I stopped there was some rubbish going on. Jackie shroff has taken over the Father role for SKF from Vinod Khanna. He is made to do some kind of forced humor which made no sense at all. And Disha is like the exposed figure who would have probably auditioned for the daughter role but somehow bagged the lead.The best part of the movie is Randeep Hooda who at least did not leave his stance and continued his typecast. But I like that guy from the time I saw Highway.Spoilers :\nYou cannot imagine SKF's entry is like the Father of Flash.Jackie is the head of Crime Branch and is probably having a live and license agreement made with Mukesh Ambani to stay in Antilia.Jackie has an intimate scene with prostitutes which I feel was definitely not required. Also a dance sequence in a silk gown.SKF has worked out a lot in this lockdown. I imagine how is he able to keep up with his age.

This one and a half hour film has 4 songs and all these songs do not fit with the character, apart from this, the love story shown in this film is nonsense. You will feel boredom while watching this movie. Whatever character development was shown in the original film. All those things have been removed from this film due to which the importance of this film ends.At the beginning of the film, Salman Khan's entry is shown in the film, then it seems that Salman Khan has made fun of himself. In this, Jackie Shroff is shown in the character of Police Officer who is senior to Salman Khan i.e. Radhe and you will not like his way of talking at all. In this film, Jackie Shroff will be seen dancing in a mini skirt which will really hurt you. Disha Patni's character is not good at all and her overacting is shown in this film. Randeep Hooda plays the role of Villain in this film and his acting is quite good. If you have watched Race 3 and you liked that film then you will definitely like this film but if you are a common citizen then you are not going to like this film at all.",

Salman Khan is awesome as usual and Randeep Hooda is on\ud83d\udd25,the plus point of this movie are its strong villains. The Randeep Hooda gang is powerful.I watched this movie on pay per view model and initially I was reluctant towards paying for a movie at my home but now after completing the movie I can say it's worth of it. But I bought Zee5 annual subscription worth Rs499 and I hope Zee5 will provide more content coz current hindi content is very less but regional content is awesome and I can go for Satyajit Ray's Bengali movies on Zee5 that's why I bought yearly plan and also it's very cheap though it also has hindi shows but I will advice u to check yourself before buying year pack otherwise you can also watch Radhe for 249Rs.So at last I just want to say if you liked wanted then u gonna love Radhe,though recent few movies of Salman Khan were disappointing but Radhe brings a change in the Air.Just watch it and enjoy full\ud83d\udc4d\nPS- Those giving it completely negative reviews are from boycott bollywood gang so ignore them and try to find out only genuine reviews by reading them.Also get 10% cashback on Zee5 by using promo ode GET10 or ZEE5INDUS\nThanks.",

These few 5mins make the movie more of hawabaazi in the middle.VFX and Action scenes could have been improved. The hand combat scenes were just perfect but not the car chasing scenes or the helicopter one.Humour comedy was not upto the Salman Khan standards as we've seen in Ready, Wanted or all his movies.",
