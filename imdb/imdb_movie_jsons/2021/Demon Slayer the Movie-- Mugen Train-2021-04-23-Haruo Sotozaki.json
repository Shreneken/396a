This is the Mugen train arc that was set up at the end of season 1 of Demon Slayer.I expected the same level of animation in the anime, and this movie delivered that aspect the best way it could. It was pleasure for my eyes to see the flame, water, and thunder breathing techniques on display. The action scenes were breathtaking and intense.My problem was that the plot was pretty simple, which made the movie felt too short. I wanted to learn more about the characters, especially Rengoku, and even the demons. The emotion did not hit as high as it could.Overall, the movie was still a blast. 8.5/10.",

Composition of action and conversation in between were also balanced. (This thing is difficult to balance but they did it). Rengoku's character was well written.

It's P E R F E C T. Even though we only have 2 hours to know Rengoku character, but the feeling, the emotion still really hit me. Like I cry a river in the cinema\ud83d\ude2cIt's really recommended!

Umai!\"), another wearing a boar's head, now everyone's asleep and pretty soon the fighting begins . . .That said . . .It is a gorgeous film. The battle scenes are exciting, the animation is superb, and the high quality bears out (Tanjiro's water effects are crazy).Purely on a visual level, I enjoyed this film. I have no doubt that any self-respecting anime fan is scoffing at my ignorance, but it is what it is. Mugen Train is easy on the eyes.",

So I'll just say the things that stopped this masterful work from being a 10/10. There is an large amount of blatant exposition is this film, there are times when it makes sense for a character to be revealing such information but Enmu just stood on top of the train telling his entire plan and more for over 10 minutes for no reason. The music is still top notch but I don't think it was nearly as powerful as the score in the 1st season which stuck to more traditional Japanese instruments. Stop reading this already and go watch it!!!",

            "content": "I want to set the score 100, not 10. The story, characters, visual, actions and moves, professional voice actors, sounds, Lisa's main song are so completely mixed at supreme level.\n(By the way, the meaning of \"Mugen Ressha-Hen\" is \"Infinite Train Arc\". The name of the train in the film is \"Mugen (Infinite)\".)I love movies, seeing it in theaters. Net-streaming is OK as a supplement, but I think it cannot be the mainstream of this industry, and I do hope this movie will be released in USA, Europe, China soon, pull the people back to their nearest theaters, save the industry.I saw this movie on the 1st Saturday, the 1st show (8AM) in a theater near me. 400 seats were 100% full, the audience must wear a mask, drinking was allowed, but no eating (usually in Japan, no shouting, no chanting even without COVID19).Just before the start, I felt \"total concentration breathing\" of the all audience in the theater, complete silence & 100% focus on the screen, that explained how we all were long waiting for this movie's release.The movie itself is really great, so \"breathtaking\". This is the ultimate Anime of a popular Manga/comic series, and I want to give big big big applause to Ufotable who have created this masterpiece.For those who have seen the anime series only (26 episodes), not known the full story of this film, you must go and see Rengoku-san's several \"Flame-breathing\" forms, which give you goose-bumps. His scenes are so super and great that make all people understand Hashira's power & strength.For those who have seen the anime and read the manga series (known full story), you also must go and see how each panel of the manga moves (it really moves!!), and enjoy comparing the scene and the panel after watching the movie (like me). You can also feel the characters' feelings more vividly than the manga series.In the end of the movie, you would be thankful and grateful for the mask, not only for anti-COVID19, but also for hiding your tears and runny noses. (this happened to me, I was so moved and emotional...) In the end, during the last song, the theater was filled with many sobbings.---- Spoilers ----\nI try to minimize my spoilers here.Before the last battle, I felt that the all audience again did into \"total concentration\" one level deeper, and I guessed that most of them must have already read the manga series.The last battle was so so great, I have never seen such a great battle in my life that I cannot describe it with my poor English vocabulary. I can only say that it surpassed the episode 19's battle in Demon slayer anime series, and Ufotable has realized/materialized the manga 100% or more with visual, sounds, voices, backgrounds, etc.I also praise the power of Japanese professional voice actors/actress. They express the characters' feelings completely and you will be easily captured by their voice-performance. I really feel great and am proud that Japan has such great voice actors. I recommend all people in the world to see this movie with Japanese original voices with your own language subtitles, so you can listen/hear/feel their great performance.Ufotable/Aniplex did very good job to make it secret about the last battle. It was not revealed until the opening day. They also even hid the voice actor's name of the key character in the last battle. When I heard the voice in the theater, I felt like and shouted in my mind, \"Wow, it's him! Yes!\" Some of them in the theater must have been same like me. The voice was 100% fit and so convincing that I was like persuaded to become a de....Anyway, please enjoy (with tears)! I am looking forward to seeing/reading your reactions/reviews about this film from all over the world.",

            "content": "Months before the Demon Slayer TV series hit Netflix UK,I became aware of the film version,after seeing on Charting with Dan Murrell reports of it breaking box office records in Japan,at a time when think pieces were claiming that the death of cinema was about to take place. Finding just one showing taking place at my local cinema,I got set to at last board the train.View on the film:Revealing that season 2 of the show will follow the aftermath of the movie, the screenplay by the \"Ufotable\" team adapts Koyoharu Gotouge's Manga with a gripping continuation of the hero's journey which Tanjiro Kamado is on, which is tied into nightmare lucid dreams that blur the lines between the demon slaying Horror fighting with Enmu,and the personal demons which haunt Tanjiro's memories.Not limited in this case to the runtime of under 30 minutes that each episode has, series director Haruo Sotozaki makes a dazzling feature film debut,with spectacular,ultra-stylised hand-drawn animation drawing the Gothic Horror demon slaying across the screen,as slick panning shots run across the colourful, detailed battle sequences.Cleverly,using CGI in a limited manner, Sotozaki blends the contrasting formats to paint a depth of field in the spectacular Akaza becoming one with the train,which goes off the rails towards an explosive, emotionally charged final confrontation between Akaza and Rengoku, as Tanjiro wakes from his nightmare to slay a demon.",

It's was fluid, kinetic and very crisp and detailed. I was a bit hesitant on watching it at first, since I knew this movie would hold some major spoilers for the seiries, and I've only watched the first episode of the anime show since I've only known about it for a week since discovering it on Netflix. This movie does have major spoilers though, but I encourage you to see this in a theatre as soon as you can if tv spoilers bother you or not.I was worried that the whole movie being set on a train would get stale fast, but it is always exciting and doesn't drag a bit. If watching Train To Busan taught me anything, it's that movies set in limited spaces such as trains can still be constantly exciting if it stays engaging. This movie just like Train To Busan isn't entirely set on the train, there are flashbacks and an action sequence seperate from the train.Anyway this was an exceptional movie with very good direction and animation. It was thrilling and also very emotional. Don't miss this one",

None of them knowing that this is all part of a plan orchestrated by one of lower rank Kizuki Enmu. *Disclaimer* it is worth noting that unlike most films that are non-canon to the main story. This film is Canon to the manga and if you haven't watched the first season or read to the rehabilitation arc then this movie is a huge spoiler. The first half of the story is more character driven as we delve into the dreams, the minds of the characters. The most part inosuke and Zenitsu don't really have much to offer until later on. The main focus of the story in kept on Rengoku and Tanjiro. The two of quickly develop a bond between them and Kyojuro offers him wisdom that Tanjiro takes to heart as he still blames himself for his family death. Second-half comes around this is where things start to really get intense. The fighting is so crisp and clean this a feature length that's to be expected. However when you actually look at it you can see just how close the show is to this quality. They're are just so over the top and intense especially near the finale you can get lost in it. The setting is of course on a train which offers a compact secluded environment, but if you're expected to see multiple locations you'll be just a little disappoint the entire film takes place on the train. Overall the movie the first looks like it's gonna be more slow burn her things do escalated rather quickly start it and it offers an interesting story intense action and stunning Visuals. The music is beautiful and the visuals and animation is beautiful, once again offering a perfect mixture between CG and Hand drawn.",

            "content": "Demon Slayer: Mugen Train is a movie that was looked forward to universally with as much hype as possible. And when it eventually did come out, the reviews were great and so was its box office performance. And ever since, this movie has been a pretty big deal amongst the anime community.I finally was able to watch it, and I guess I'm a little underwhelmed by the whole thing. My reaction to this movie was very similar to how I felt about the series, and I think the same can be said of everyone. The series, in my opinion, is a decently enjoyable B-Tier anime with 1 exceptionally phenomenal episode. But that's just my take on it and I'm aware I'm in the minority here, because the amount of love this series has garnered is almost unbelievably massive and universal. So what Mugen Train caters to is exactly that demographic of fans (as so it should), meaning that for someone like me who found very little to go crazy about in the series, would find very little to go crazy about in this movie. But if you're one of those who loved the series for its goofiness and style, then this movie is in every way a treat.I don't think Mugen Train was a bad movie in any way. It was decently enjoyable and had its little moments. The plot is pretty straight forward but makes very little sense if you even stop to think about it. The progress was lazily convenient and the stakes never felt real until at the very end of the movie. The humor was pretty goofy and the characters were as over-the-top as they were in the series... Enjoyable, still The animation was pretty good and consistent throughout; especially the action scenes that were choreographed as well as they were in the series. The colors, the visuals, the music... they're all pretty great and add to the visually pleasing appeal of the movie.In conclusion, this movie doesn't add anything to the medium in any meaningful way, but it stays true to its style and convention as that is what people love most about the Demon Slayer universe. If you loved the series, you'll love this movie... Go for it!",

            "content": "I so desperately wanted this film to blow my mind and become my new favorite of all time. It has been a long time coming for shonen anime to capitalize on American markets in a big way. I have no doubts that Demon Slayer will find great financial success here, given that it is the top box office of all time in Japan and the market for season 1 of the show was huge here. I just wish it blew the doors open in an even bigger way.Mugen train is a direct continuation of season 1 of the wildly popular anime Demon Slayer. The animation in the show was already impressive, but it was promised that the studio behind the movie is in an entirely different league. This turned out to be true and then some, with some of the most pulse-pounding, breath-taking action animation I have ever seen. What can't be understated is the brilliant score that pushed these animations to new heights.The story is gripping, with few dull moments and no plot holes. It even had some big surprises that turn the story on a dime. The problem I had with it is that I expect more from shonen anime. I expect some sense of doom and gloom when the protagonist realizes that the antagonist is far beyond his/her power, or vice versa. I expect an even greater threat to be introduced upon the conclusion of any victory. Demon Slayer does both of these things, but meekly.Ultimately, this is a great movie to watch in theatres for the spectacle, even if you haven't seen the show. Seeing the show may add some more depth to the jokes or empathy for the characters, but it certainly isn't necessary. I recommend this film to anyone who has the maturity to brush off the stereotypes of who should or shouldn't go to a shonen anime in theatres.",

            "content": "Its tricky to write a review for this one because it is not really an usual movie but it's an anime arc and a very serious and the detailed one indeed. As a movie, it was beautiful I would say. Throughout the movie, you would feel various emotions. Some scenes are cute and wholesome, some are sad, filled with regrets, there is a bit of comic relief as well. You may find yourself having a good laugh initially but the ending is sad and emotional.Now, coming back to reviewing it as an arc, this is how it overall went :Story : Beautifully executed. Even though, Enmu was dealt sooner than we expected, the writing is totally justified. We didn't really get to see how Inosuke managed to wake up and break free of that dream but apart from that it was all no-nonsense stuff. There was a thrill but no unnecessary stretching or no unnecessary badasseries. There are few comic relief and cute moments as well. Also, there are quite few classy quotes and I can't get enough of them.Characters : We cannot say that both the villains were purposeless. They are demons and are brilliantly written. By the end of the movie, their respective mindsets were described pretty well. Rengoku too is brilliantly written but I felt we deserved to know more about his father or Rengoku's viewpoint about his father. I am not really sure if we get to know more about him in the upcoming arc. Regardless, Rengoku seemed closer to his mother. Tanjirou as usual a very wholesome character and keeps giving you various feels. But overall, the show belonged to Inosuke. If you guys were waiting for his character development, this is that moment. The movie doesn't offer much to Zenitsu and Nezuko fans but despite that, they do have their respective moments. And rest assured, you will definitely get to hear \"Kaminari no kokyu, ichi no kata. Hekireki Issen!!!\"Art : Outstanding animation. Combined with sound effects, it almost feels like a never-seen-before stuff.Sound : I am yet to browse the titles but one thing is for sure, each of those OSTs are absolute fire. We could not have asked for better. Rengoku fans should not miss the end credits.Overall, I enjoyed every bit of this movie.",

There is quite a bit of cgi aswell but it looks pretty good compared to most anime. The start may be a bit slow and it may not have a real focus but just keep watching it gets reeeaaally great. The main character of the show is in the shade of the side characters as well, it really does an amazing job of create a central focus on this new character while still having other main characters feel a part of the movie. Until the end...the action shuts up and the tears start :( bruh...it so sad. It's so well done I can't put into words how baffling the ending is.

This movie has all the elements that made the series so great except in a movie form factor. The pacing was great! The Comedic relief was awesome especially the Boar. The flashbacks were meaningful and deep and offered great messages. The best part of all were the fights. The animation was bonkers just like season 1 and I like how they really focused in on the Hashira Rengoku. He's such a badass and served as a great mentor to Tanjiro in the movie.The first fight between Tanjiro and the Lower 1 demon was epic and the fight between Rangoku and the higher 3 level demon was amazing. The sad part is that rengoku dies at the end of the movie and passes the torch to Tanjiro to eventually one day take his place as a hashira.The movie doesn't delve much into the main villain Muzan. It basically just features the battle against two of the higher ranked demons and ends. Overall a great movie that is well worth watching. The movie is going to be Dub in the USA so keep that in mind if you do not like dub. Otherwise I can't wait for season 2.",

It made 40 billion Yen followed by \"Spirited Away\" with almost 32 billion (and \"Titanic\" with a measly 26 billion). So it is proof of the strength of the Japanese industry as opposed to most other countries (except India), in that domestic animation totally overrules Disney (as it should everywhere).Its enormous success has a lot to do with a lack of alternatives, with no US features theatrically released in CoVid year. And it's really not as great as \"Spirited Away\", which is a totally unforgettable classic. Still, for a tie-in film it's very good and gives the characters from the series more depth.Lots of the suspicious three-liner reviews here neglect the story, so I'll tell you this much: there are two parts involving two villains, the first of which taking place in the title-giving demon train. This will be pleasing for fans of the series, but those who took issue with the support characters going overboard all the time - brace yourselves. The 2D/3D mix doesn't work so well, and they should have come up with something more original than tentacles, but the action is non-stop and the premise enticing. Still, if it would end after 85 minutes, it would be nothing special.But then the really bad guy shows up. And the really awesome hero must show his marbles. And this is pure joy and the most spectacular 2D animation this side of Heaven. And yes, the resolution is extremely moving, unless your heartstrings snap along the way. It's totally insane and divine. So you have a slow 2/3rds along the lines of what you'd expect and then a glorious third act that elevates it above the \"Fate/Stay Night\" films.I'd still call \"Attack on Titan\" the better franchise but that's not for kids and on a whole other level of awe. This one is OK to take your 12-year-olds to as the violence is sufficiently rooted in fantasy and they're gonna watch it anyway.",

So if you didn't see the series, you need at least watch a recap before watching this. Although I've seen a lot of anime movies and I know Japanese animation has a different approach than western animation, I was very underwhelmed by this one and not moved at all.when characters start crying in this kind of anime, they open the flood gates, visually and auditory. But that doesn't mean you will understand or feel their pain. So you're watching just some crazy emotional stuff and it doesn't move you at all. It almost made me burst in laughter when someone fell down to earth and started crying like crazy.most characters are very superficial, although the storyline pretends they have a lot of emotional bagage to deal with.the storyline doesn't hold much: a train has been taken over by a demon who needs to be killed80% of the movie is just fighting with no build up. So after a while, this gets boring and when you think it's done, there is another 20 min fight. It looks stunning thoughOnly watch this movie when you love the series.",

We live an hour away from the cinema and on our way to see it knowing there was a series about it I asked the boys to fill me in. Just on listening to them explain the twists and plot of the series was enough to get me interested in it.. After watching the movie tho I was hooked, glued and tied to idea that I needed more! I since then have seen the first season and have become an instant fan! The effects and awesome story line is great! Heart felt feelings that I love to feel and see when watching movies!

It means it's not as new, or progressive as others pointed out.

However, I knew nothing at all about the history of this particular franchise, and the film assumes that the average audience member is very familiar with quite a lot of continuity from manga and TV. The film appears to start during a story which has been going on for some time, with characters who you are already supposed to know. This seems to be borne out by the enormous success of this film in Japan.I found it really, really hard work. There are certainly some amazing visuals, but there are also some of the worst Japanese animation tendencies on display - overlapping still frames, close ups of eyes and tears with gently vibrating outlines and so on. Some of the characters - much loved, no doubt - are bizarre and unsympathetic. The storytelling might be effective, but not if you have no foreknowledge.This was a disappointment.",

Mugen Train is just a milking attempt. It's shocking this movie won awards. I guess they had no other movie to give in the covid year. Some of the prominently bad stuff:First antagonist can basically be summed up as this. Supposedly powerful Lower One demon hires sick children who fail completely on all four of their assassination attempts, spams the same useless technique during the later battle, then turns into an giant, immobile entity with a huge, vulnerable weakspot and gets killed predictably. Even the lower 5's underlings gave a better fight than himSecond antagonist is basically a mindless Regen bot. Doesn't dodge, doesn't outsmart, just brute forces and insta heals any cuts he takes. Sure, he meets the bill of being an upper rank demon but if you are going to write a character as unimaginative as this, you need to be flatout replaced with someone who can do your job better.Zero personality from any of the characters. One magic of the anime was that every character, big or small, good or bad, was memorable af. Each had their own personality, unique traits, distinct appearance. In the movie, that formula was gone. They don't carry the same personality their anime counterparts had. This is my biggest criticism for my 3/10 score.

This 10 minutes of dream sequences add NOTHING to the story or the series' plot. It's literally wasting 10 minutes of screen time, for mindless drivel.The other big issue is the fact that Kyojuro Rengoku was portrayed like an idiot in this movie.... like somebody who doesn't take fighting seriously and somebody who when fighting doesn't give 110% from the start. This is purely done by the show's creators to build fake suspense and to create a fictitious ending for the movie. ANY time that a character doesn't give 110% from the very start of the fight when facing a very powerful opponent, it is poor writing by the show's creators and especially when it's as poorly done as it was in the Kyojuro Rengoku fight, then it just spoils the character's legacy and completely spoils the 'twist ending', which I was able to see coming miles away.Overall these two dumb design decisions by the show's creators above, really brings the movie down from what could have been an 8/10, to a 5/10. It's not worth watching in the cinemas either, as it really is just 2 bad episodes from the show that are stitched together. 5/10 as a movie, and considering that you'd normally pay to watch it, i'd even bring that down to 4/10 because it's costing you money.

The most profitable movie of Japan, and probably one of the most sensational film of the entire Asia in 2020. \"Magen train\" continues the story of Tanjiro and his adventure as a demon slayer, the mission of investigating the Magen train with Flame Hashira ended in the death of the Lower One and the sacrifice of Kyujuro in exchange of the safety of 200 passengers. Y tambien, the entrance of the Upper Three marks the following story of demons and the developing trio. The skill and level of animation is absolutely unshakable, and the detailing presentation of the new character Kyujuro, a faithful and flame-like leader, are an undeniable success. However, the exquisite recreation of the comic isn't always a positive aspect, the excess (explanatory) conversation and overly emotional expressions creates a crevasse to the storyline. Plus the immature way of narration... I guess if we watch the whole story on a comic, the strangeness wouldn't be so protruding, but they decided to make a movie. At least the last part of the film is both touching and somewhat philosophical. I hope seeing more works of this great anime.",

It's touching - for anyone - exactly because the story, especially Rengoku's story is so relatable.Everyone goes through hardships in their life. This movie manages to touch these difficult deeply psychological subjects in such a serious and consequential, yet playful way through multiple lenses/characters.It encapsulates a way to look at life; struggles are inevitable, it is about how you overcome them.

(It's already the highest grossing anime film of all-time!) I binge watched all 26 episodes of Season 1 this week and I saw the movie today.Let me tell you, it is absolutely sensational. Season 1 itself was already just so good, so this movie was a fantastic addition to the series. The animation is flawless and done so well. The raw emotions pack a huge punch, similar to Season 1's sentimental aspects. The characters are continued and developed through a clever, exciting, and action-packed ride aboard the Mugen Train! The soundtrack fit perfectly, as it added just the right touch at the exact right time. Even though I just watched Season 1 this last week, I'm already a huge fan!

There were a few fights that had the hair on my arms sticking up and a few second in each that made me make an audible, involuntary sound, while I was barely still in my seat. The art direction? Impeccable. The characters? Immaculate. My main issue with the first season of the show was that Inosuke and Zenitsu were beyond infuriating and were on 100% with their personalities 100% of the time. It was still like this in the first third of the movie, but the characters show some other aspects of their personalities as well, and are slightly more tame during the latter half, which I think the majority of the American audience will greatly appreciate. Another issue I had with the first season was that the audience was never able to properly grieve with Tanjiro over his family's death, as they were given less than five minutes of screen time during the original. I'm not going to spoil anything but that has been addressed now, and I've shed tears for them now, or at least for how much their loss impacted Tanjiro. Oh and back to the art direction. You can tell that every single person on akira matsusima's team gave it their all, and loved every minute of it. Every frame bleeds passion, and some left my jaw hanging. The dedication and attention to detail is evident and I cannot give it high enough praise. I am left very curious as to how the show will go on with Tanjiro as the main character without it feeling underwhelming though, now that we see how much his powers pale in comparison to the high ranking slayers and demons. I'm worried it may have went too crazy too soon but we'll have to find out when season two releases. The sound design was astounding as well. I'm obviously no professional movie reviewer, and I may be a little biased because I love Shonen and am a sucker for art, but I honestly found nothing wrong with this movie and really hope I'm not overhyping it when I say- even if you're not a fan of anime as a genre you're doing yourself a great disservice by not seeing this film. And see it in theaters! IMAX if you can. I know we have COVID out here so be safe and weigh the risk, but it's definitely worth ticket price for IMAX.",

Sound design was also really great!Now, with the good out of the way, the rest.... The story was clich\u00e9, to say the least. What's more, all of the action in the movie was the equivalent of slamming action figures into one another and declaring one of them the victor by screaming exposition at you as to how you should feel about what just happened.Example: Person A slams into Demon-thing B. Flash! Bang! Excitement! A and B separate, breathing heavily. Character C, not involved, says something to the effect of, \"Wow, A really took a beating there, he can't take much more of that.\" Then they go back at it and it repeats.When there are no rules and normal physics don't apply, it's impossible to care about the outcome of any given conflict. It's just at the mercy of the writers deciding which action figure gets to win this conflict.To further emphasize this, during one scene, a character is hit by a giant Demon-Tentacle, and wham, he's slammed into the wall, you'd be done for if it were you. He's fine though. Okay, so this character is strong.Then, literally 1 scene later, this same character is stabbed by something the size of a pencil, and it's practically a death-sentence. He's out of the fight for the rest of the movie.Another character is literally impaled on something's arm, and manages to almost cut its head off anyway, but then the character dies.Why? Give me rules!!!! If character's can be literally impaled and bleeding but summon the strength to scream some nonsense and then burst into flames, what are the limits?!? What am I meant to be impressed by? Has he done something amazing or is he a terrible swordsman? It's impossible for me to tell because there aren't any rules. Soon enough though, character C comes on screen to scream how I should feel, so that I can continue.All-in-all, if you've seen the anime, and you enjoyed that, give it a watch. Otherwise, if you're coming in without any interest in anime prior, leave it be, it'll be a waste of time for you.",

We're at the cinema though, this is the first film I've seen on a big screen in nearly two years. It needs to be seen on a big screen really, it's all about the spectacle. This is a shame seeing as it's only screening for one day in the UK. The plot. It's pretty straightforward. There are demons, that are bad and demon slayers, that are good. Some young slayers including Tanjiro, his sister who's in a box with a muzzle because she's a demon (but a good one) and a dude wearing a boar mask (I thought he was a boar for a large part of the film) are boarding a train to meet and learn from a Hashira who's some kind of demon slayer master who doesn't blink. He's there though to protect the passengers from a demon on board, who seems styled on one of Tim Burton's fantasies, with a detachable hand with its own mouth that's reminiscent of Thing from the Addams Family. It's very trippy, our heroes attacked in their dreams as they're put to sleep, the demon taking over the train in a weird flubber meets The Abyss tendrils, with millions of eyes that pop out of nowhere. It looks very cool. There is an odd mix of animation styles though, from quite simple flat comic book stuff to scenes with beautiful depth. The fight scenes though of which there are many are where it excels. The pace is blistering, the screen awash with colour as as techno rock score blasts away. It's pretty frenetic and to be honest the story is very simple at its core. It's fun though, but I'm not sure I'll be getting into the TV show. I've already missed three seasons. So it's good guys killing bad guys, moral codes, fighting with honour. I feel like I've missed a lot of the back story, but it still works as a stand-alone film.",

The Movie starts off where the 1st season has ended. The movie straight away takes you to the journey and action begins. Though the premise is very simple that our Hero Tanjiro boards the train which has monsters on it. But given the length I was not sure how long the action sequences will be and the story part will be there or not. But the way story telling is done you get loads of actions and emotions and character development. The movie does not let you blink eyes for a second as the story and action happen on a pleasant pace and it keeps your interest going. The ending is not all happy go lucky but it does provides a glimpse of what is yet to come. And I am eagerly waiting for the next season to air. This movie is what keeps surprising me about anime and I recommend it for people who never had seen any anime or any movie based on it. If your mind is bored with this MUC & DC and want to watch stories with great characters and plot twists then this is one of those storytelling masterpiece.",

I liked this part very well, it somehow reminds me of a creepier Harry Potter, with kids solving evil mysteries and all that.The second part is a long fight scene against some tentacle lady (or guy?), which was far too drawn out in my opinion, the oucome was a foregone conclusion and made no impact. The third part was very cool. It's also just a long fight scene, but this one carried a lot more emotional investment, and was overall much more interesting.Overall, animation, acting, music and storytelling are all very good, and it keeps everything together and makes it quite enjoyable. However, the script is very weak. Characters have no development, except maybe some of them being somewhat sadder by the end. The plot also is incomplete and does not warrant a 2 hour movie. Most scenes are drawn-out. There is no introduction and background, and no conclusive ending. If you saw the series I guess it will all make sense so do watch it, but if you, like me, didn't, it doesn't, so don't.",

I suggest you very strongly to watch the anime serial first, since the start of the movie is connected with the ending of the anime serial. the genre of this movie is animation, anime, adventure, action, fantasy, and drama.It may seems boring since the whole movie takes place on a train. But, this arc impacts the whole story. I'm going to try to minimalize as much spoiler as possible. The story is about 4 member of the kisatsutai (demon slayer corps), tanjiro, nezuko, zenitsu, and inosuke, (yes, nezuko is considered as a member of demon slayer corps even though she's a demon), boarding a train to meet the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku, to help him on a mission to hunt an upper moon demon. I can only go so far, (I think) the rest of the story is considered as spoiler. The production team, Aniplex did a great job on both the 2D and 3D the animation. The song \"Homura\" by LiSA really fits to the movie credit, and literally cried when I listened to it. This song is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.I would definitely watch this movie over and over again. You can watch this movie right now. But, I think there is no streaming services that has this movie in high quality. I mean, you can watch it right now if quality doesn't bother you that much.

The dream world moments were quite touching, with the main character recalling his family moments, now long gone. The comedy relief was plenty and balanced the bitterness of the dreams, as well as the hectic action of the story.As for the art, it was nice, just what one should expect from the Demon Slayer series, with bright colors, the right hair and costumes for the fantasy genre, as well as well crafted action scenes for the shounen fans and the rigtht amount of body horror. The OST was brilliant as well. However, the use of technology and special effects was unecessary and set off the whole aesthetic.So, overall, seven out of ten.",

After watching it and the credits started to roll, my first thought was that I could totally understand and respect this being someone's all-time favorite anime. It's gorgeous and may have perfected some of the anime tropes. So, I totally appreciate the love here. For me, it's just ok. Those 'perfected tropes' are still familiar anime devices that I don't particularly enjoy. The art style doesn't work for me in some cases, everyone looks so young and weird. At the end of the day, I'm picky with anime and this one didn't quite make the cut and I can't imagine that I would ever feel inclined to revisit it. Still pleased to have seen it so I can properly relate to the massive sensation it became.",

            "content": "This movie was amazing. I must admit that I had just watched Demon Slayer Season 1 before seeing this with my friend. I really enjoyed demon slayer season 1 but this movie does everything the show set out to de even better. Let's start out with the intro. Immediately after the movie is introduced with the master getting old you knew this had to be a movie as they set this movie up in a way where you know it had to be a movie which was a concern if mine. I was concerned that the movie would feel like 6 episodes smashed together but that's not what it felt like at all. It truely did feel like one story being told in an hour and fifty seven minutes. Anyways, the movie gets straight into the action without spending any time on a recap and we are immediately introduced to Rengoku. I say introduced because although we have seen him in the first season we didn't truely get a feel for his entire personality but this scene perfectly establishes how over the top Rengoku really is. Then, we get right into the action with Rengoku having to fight a demon. Immediately something that you'll notice if you do see this in a theater or if you have surround sound or a sound bar is that the sound design of this movie is amazing. I don't know if it's just because it was my first time going back to a theater but I definitely think that the sound design on this movie is far above average. Anyways, the demon ends up putting all of the main characters to sleep and we get to see their dream sequences. I like Zenitsu's dream sequences a lot and Rengoku'd gives a lot of insight into his childhood. Tanjiro's dream was great as well and definitely focused on just the lengths he would go to to get back with his family. Eventually though he realizes he has to kill himself to get out of the dream so two he does and he wakes up then he gets the others to wake up and he goes in top of the train to fight the demon. I absolutely loved the sequence where the screen was covered in blood and the demon was putting words into the mouths of Tanjiro's family. It was truely a very powerful scene. The train turning into a demon was probably the worst part of the movie but great nonetheless. The CG on the demon is a little jarring though I must admit. But the best part of this sequence is the fact that the train really was a demon as I Inosuke had presumed in the beginning. Let's move on to the section off of the train which is far and away the best part of the movie. At first, when they got off the train I thought it was the end of the movie and I was kind of underwhelmed but boy was I wrong. Upper Moon 3 shows up and Rebgoku has to fight him. This makes for what is, in my opinion, better than the fight in episode 19. In fact I would call this the series' new best fight. The music they used for Upper Moon 3 was just great It was heartwrenching to see Rengoku die as by the end of the movie they really do make you care about Rengokuat and the action was great too. Every shot was animated absolutely beytaigully and I loved what Rengoku'd final blow looked like and when Rengoku asks his mother right before dying if he did a goodjob it's heart-breaking. We end the movie off how it started with the master and I forgot to mention that all of the Hashira finding out is sad as well and done perfectly. So, overall, I have no complaints with this movie. This is the first movie I've ever seen where I wanted to see it again immediately after I saw it the first time. I would definitely reccomended this if you watched the series to anyone and if you haven't watched the series watch it and then watch this movie.",

The animation was top notch, as expected, as was the voice acting, but the story was nothing we haven't seen done better in a million other anime. Also, it relied a little too much on sentimentality for my tastes. The series did it as well, but it was well spaced in 26 episodes, while here it is condensed in 2 hours and it gets a bit much. It's well worth two hours of your time, especially if you are a fan of the series like me, but you shouldn't go expecting a masterpiece. I think that the pandemic helped this movie becoming so popular, in a normal season it definitely wouldn't have surpassed \"Spirited Away\" in ticket sales. Now, that WAS a real masterpiece.",

This really irritated me because Zenitsu is one of my favourite characters and barley got any screentime as a \"main character\" in the movie.My second problem was with the ending of the final fight with Inousuke cutting the demons arms off and letting him escape instead of having Rengoku keeping him restrained until the sun came up so that at least he would have died knowing that the demon would not go on to survive another day. So basically they should not have intervened as Rengoku had said.But overall, a very good animation, these two problems for me brings the rating down to an 8 but still a very enjoyable watch.",

Then I saw how crazily people rate the movie after its release, so I decided to give it a change. Well, I might say I had a good time, it's worth your time if you're relaxing from some tedious, exhausting work, a great and emotional watch for the series' fans.

When you start to watch something after a long break you need to remind why you loved it and this song was it!! Hope they don't screw the second season by using another intro!!!Other than that it was fine, but for a movie, I expected something more, something grand! That's probably why at the end there was another unexpected battle to compensate, which for me it felt out of place! Good battle for sure, but really didn't make sense at that moment.Tv series was far more superior in every way than the movie hands down and I really, really, really hope that they make the 2nd season soon with the same sound track!!!!!!",

CGI and cel animation are not mixed seamlessly, but thrown together-sometimes in a dance, sometimes in a battle. Then a chibi pops up to mix things up some more.The fight scenes are beautiful splashes and slashes of fire, water, and lightning. There's not as much blood as I thought there'd be, but that just made it so when it DID flow, the sympathetic pain was greater.Like the series, though, Mugen Train has a trainload of humor, and the writers, seiyuus, and animators deftly incorporate it into the narrative. Inosuke flying off the handle, Zenitsu drooling over Nezuko, Rengoku's eating habits, smol Nezuko... is funny.The Seiyuus did an excellent job, taking their performances over the top, perfectly matching the visuals.There are a few spots here and there where inconsistent animation messes with the pacing, and only true fans of anime-those who are not only forgiving of extreme melodrama-won't think the ending dragged a bit. But little things can't take away from the awesomeness of Mugen Train.",

It felt like 80% of the movie was the various characters laboriously telling and retelling what they were thinking and how they were feeling. There was pretty much no attempt at \"show instead of tell\" when it comes to character struggles. It was just .... a constant barrage of \"This is what I'm thinking right now.\"Compared to modern animated productions and cinema in general, this aspect of the movie was a huge fail and gratingly annoying.",

And that's what this film did.3) Half way through the fight I was able to notice that flame guy was gonna die just because he wasn't making any progress in the fight. Not because he was getting hurt but because its generic and clich\u00e9. It would have been a LOT more interesting to see him train the group LIKE THEY SAID HE WOULD.4) I've come to notice a lot of animes make films for the sake of money or getting more hype for the show and don't progress the story or really affect it. And why I think they did this in this case is because, not a lot actually happens.-A character that you get introduced dies anyway so its not like you'll be seeing any of him in the future.-The thing that is actually interesting is that you get to see one of the upper ranked demons but you don't get much from it except he killed one of the Hirashi - so his very strong.. too strong for Tanjiro.... okay? And to prove that you had to kill an interesting character?-How it basically ends is that the flame guy says go to my house to talk to my family, read some stuff and this could have happened in one episodes.-I know that technically you did also get an introduction to the demon that killed flame guy but it was so random you could have done that with him randomly appearing and his saying some stuff like \"So lower one didn't make it\" as if he was observing but he didn't - there was no explanation of him being there-Like I said the introduction to the demon and flame guy saying go to my house could have been done in 20 minutes not an hour and 50What im trying to say with my fourth point is that it doesn't move the plot along as much as you'd think....HOWEVER I will recognise the absolute AMAZING MAGNIFICANT animation honestly half the time I excited for just that.But the writing wasn't worth the waitThe movie is still good its just that last 40 minutes that honestly makes it a little bit worse.",

            "review_title": "A simple but great movie with godly animation and music",
            "content": "I've always found the animated version of Demon Slayer to be a great experience. There is great music, godly animation. This movie of course is no exception and goes beyond even what season one of the anime did (which was already amazing in those two departments). If you're a fan of simple stories with endearing characters this will be highly entertaining to watch. Tanjiro and Rengoku especially stand out in the series and in this film. They are characters that most people would find difficult to not like.The story is simple and isn't anything any mindblowing so it does puzzle me a tiny bit that it broke the records it did. Most Shonen Jump (Battle Manga) movies would have a similar story in them such as DBS: Broly or One Piece: Stampede but Demon Slayer has exploded in Japan for various reasons.While the story is simple and errs on the generic side for the most part it isn't bad. Most people would sympathize with Rengoku's story and many would probably tear up during Tanjiro's dream. One other thing that I will commend the story on is that a major supporting character died. Of course it wasn't Tanjiro but a major supporting character in the series. In the scope of this movie, Rengoku was the main character so really the main character of this film died by the end which is something that doesn't happen very often in similar films (like in One Piece or Dragon Ball). If you were to ask someone watching this for the first time if they thought Rengoku would be dead by the end of this film and not have killed Akaza, it would be a unanimous no. It's almost certain that most would not have seen this coming. For the hero to only be unable to defeat the main villain but also perish. Of course, this is also in a literal sense. We, the audience know that Rengoku won in a spiritual sense. Even though he perished he was able to force an Upper Rank Demon to flee and protected everyone else.It's still an enjoyable watch and this adaptation is in my opinion a massive upgrade from the manga version. The manga is ok at best. The art, especially at the beginning wasn't great to put it lightly and the Mugen Train Arc was drawn in those early chapters so it did suffer from this problem.However, in this movie the art, animation and music massively boost the quality of this arc up thanks to Ufotable having a team of amazing animators. In a way you could say that the animators hired to work on this movie are the Hashira of the anime industry. Everything looked beautiful in this movie. The best animated scene had to be when Rengoku slashed Akaza (with his 9th Form: Rengoku) and had to move his sword in a different direction. That looked stunning.The special effects looked amazing (such as Rengoku's fire tiger) and the CGI fit seamlessly. The demon who fused with the train had his new reddish, grotesque body shown through CGI and it looked great.When CGI is shown in anime there is an astoundingly high chance that it will be terrible. The characters and models will look stiff and feel like they came from a video game, especially when they're next to a 2D-drawn character. This can ruin a lot of scenes because it looks out of place when next to hand-drawn characters.In conclusion, if you're a fan of Demon Slayer then you've already seen this epic movie. If you're not a fan and haven't watched the preceding arcs then I would say this is ok to watch as well. This movie won't blow your mind away in terms of story so if you're looking for some complex film you won't find it here. The plot and characters are simple enough that anyone will be to decipher who these characters are and their motivations through this movie without too much backstory. The dreams everyone had on the train especially helps fill in the clues on their motivations and pasts. If you're at all a fan of godly animation and music then is also a must-watch.",

            "content": "The movie Demon Slayer: Mugen Train followed directly where the first season of the tv show ended. It shows the group around the main protagonist Tanjiro going on a train as a next mission for the demon slayer corps. I'll not go further into detail about the story, but I think it is necessary for the movie to watch the tv show, or at least a summary. There is no introduction into the world of demon slayer. The story, the animation and the music are basically the same like the tv show. That means the story is still pretty generic, with characters, which are mostly flat and some still annoying.(Some of my major critic points with the movie (contains spoiler!): At the end something tragical happened, but the audience didn't get to know the person fully to feel much about it. Therefore the pain and the tears from the protagonist, were not really understanable. They just got introduced to the person like 3 hours ago maybe. The other point was why was there a rank 3 demon so suddenly? And why is the protagonist not longer interested in taking blood samples? Why are the only talking about the highest rank in the corps, what about all the other ranks?)The animation is still amazing and beautiful! Just sometimes the cgi was a little bit too much for me, but overall it is really top. Same goes for the music. Really nice and well fitting.The tv show is overhyped, same goes for the movie. Yes, the animation is beautiful and the music and style are okay. But is it a masterpiece ? No, not for me. It has a quite childish humour, the characters have only one personal trait, everything can be categorized in good or bad. The standard pattern as you can see.",

Good and evil, good and bad deeds. In general, the war of good against evil continues. This topic is not the last place in the film, I think many viewers will think about their actions after watching it.

He just treated the person trying to hurt him in his dream with love and kindness. Like, go ahead, do it. In the end, the person changed and didn't hurt Tanjiro by seeing that lively spirit within him.

From the start the movie continues from where it was left in the first season and continues the infinite train journey of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke & Nezuko as they embark on this journey to fight the demon in the train. While u find this portion of the movie itself to be meaty,the movie jumps into an express concoction of action, dialogues, philosophy, master animation effects & BGM in the last 30 minutes to drill you down to the core of your emotions and make you think of it for the whole day. A must watch for all anime lovers...\nHail Kyoguro Rengoku!!!\ud83d\udd25",

Yeah they looked cool fighting but it felt like we and the main three characters had know them barely a few days and spent barely more than a train ride with him, mostly asleep to be crying for 20 minutes when they died.Would've rather they spent way more time setting up and giving motivations for the lower one demon / train.There's some really funny moments and writing in the series but the things in the movie they thought they'd go for were really basic, saying umai repeatedly?

This movie shines in my life after the nightmare final examination week.\nStory:\nThe movie is the sequel of the anime series. The movie starts with the scene on the train where the main characters show up. In the entire film we will stick around with this train as a background which is pretty interesting to me. Using the train as background gives me the feeling about the long journey. The film-makers put the conversation that allows us to learn more about the detail and background story of the character from the series season one. This makes us more connected to the character. Moreover, there are some scenes that have meaningful speech which the audience can understand easily. However, there are some scenes that went too far from my expectations.\nCharacter:\nThere are improvements in the characters that appear in this movie. Characteristics and identities are more visible than the previous series installment.Animation + Sound effects:\nI could say this is one of the best animated films in terms of animation that I've ever watched. Sound effect, scores, voice acting, everything fits in this movie at the top..Verdict: Overall, it is a movie that is worth watching as a Friday night's movie. The storyline is decent, the graphics are well-animated and other things that I haven't mentioned can make you enjoy this movie. If you are free from anything else, I highly recommend this movie for you. :D",
