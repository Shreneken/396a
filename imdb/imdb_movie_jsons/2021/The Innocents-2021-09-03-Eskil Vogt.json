Testing things out - doing stuff that can be considered evil by any moral compass and code.Having said that, this takes this evil to another level. Not to mention that the movie is ... quite fantastical. There are things here - that kids fantasize about ... but never really happen (at least not in our universe). The kids are not all alright ... but they are phenomenal when it comes to the acting. Which is pivotal, considering they are the main actors here. Beautifully shot, edited and a really good sound design, help the movie to reach and hold the viewers attention ... and then some. Certain scenes may be too graphic - but also quite a punch in the gut for some viewers. The movie is relentless ... and does not hold back ...",

            "review_title": "Absolutely Smothering In Its Intensity",
            "content": "Drenched in dark, dreadful & foreboding atmosphere and steered by terrific performances from its young cast, The Innocents (De uskyldige) is slow, patient & measured in its approach but the tension & terror it invokes from its ominous build-up & gradually intensifying drama is unnerving & unsettling in suffocating doses, and ranks amongst the most gripping, absorbing & disturbing examples of its kind.Written & directed by Eskil Vogt, the premise takes its time to set up and character introductions are proper yet there is this feeling of uneasy apprehension that pervades the air & is perceivable from early moments. And it only heightens as the plot progresses once what started as four kids exploring their mysterious powers takes a dangerous turn. And from thereon, the picture has our attention within its grasp.Assisting the story in sustaining its chilling vibe & disquieting tone is the menacing camerawork, brooding score, slow-burn pace & sudden violence while the young actors play their respective parts with deft composure and are highly convincing in their roles. Their credible input is a vital ingredient that makes this drama work and these children navigate & articulate all the required emotions with surprising authenticity.Overall, The Innocents addresses themes of friendship, loneliness, morality, cruelty, curiosity & loss of innocence through the bonding they forge and the hidden powers they discover in each other's presence. Unrelenting in its mood & smothering in its intensity, this Norwegian chiller is as uncomfortable as it is uncanny, never allows the suspense to leave the room and concludes with a haunting finale that lingers long after the credits roll.",

It is by no means scary at any time, but it surely pushes the boundaries of what you expect to see in a movie, where children are the lead characters, this might upset your stomach at times, but this provocative choice is by design.The supernatural/abnormal aspects are never fully explained though, which shouldnt be an issue in a fantasy scifi genre, but at least a small attempt towards some concept justification would have been desired. Still a very gripping film to watch, which could have been 20mins shorter to get a better score!",

            "review_title": "Creative and heartbreaking",
            "content": "The Scandinavians are on a roll lately with horror films. Before I watched, The Innocents (2021), I was very much impressed with The Hatching (2022). Both Scandinavian films bring new creative ideas to horror that I very much appreciate given how derivative horror is today. I feel some of the most creative ideas in horror during the last twenty years have come from foreign countries with new ideas. In the age of streaming movies from all over the world within seconds, it is a delight to watch these films that might never have been seen stateside.The Innocents (2021) is about a group of local Nordic children, two of which have gradually developed psychokinesis and mental suggestive powers. The first is a very special autistic girl by the name of Anna. She is a very gentle docile soul who lost her ability to talk early in her childhood. She has a sister by the name of Ida. Anna and another gentle and lovable little girl named Aisha develop a close friendship. Aisha and Anna can communicate telepathically.Then there is Ben, a boy that seems very friendly. He becomes a playmate with Anna's sister Ida. They hit it off very well. Ben shows Ida the neat tricks he can do with his mind and Ida is enthralled by Ben's tricks. He even tries to teach her to do the same. But as the film progresses, Ida sees disturbing things in Ben. Ben's actions become ominous as he becomes more aggressive.The story is heartbreaking because the director really got me to love these kids. Anna, Aisha, Ida and Ben. We get to know their parents. Then a serious of tragedy evens begin to happen and the story turns more ominous.For me, this is what true horror is. When you grow to love the characters and the unimaginable happens that shoot chills up the spine. The dread that something terrible will happen to the characters you love. This is a good horror film. It isn't a jump scare film. These Scandinavians films really do have a good story behind them like a good horror book will have. Horror isn't someone getting an arrow in the eye if you don't care for them. That's the typical cheap horror tropes that many horror films use because it's a lot harder to write a good story that make you fall in love with the characters. The Innocents and the writer/director know you must care about these children to be shocked by what happens to them. This film is a class act.",

            "content": "The Innocents: Set in an apartment complex which is situated in the midst of a forest, this liminal space provides an ideal setting for young children developing psychic powers. There is much cruelty and bullying carried out by the children which has nothing to do with ESP abilities, even the maltreatment of a profoundly autistic girl and the killing of a cat. What starts with minor displays of telekinesis and telepathy gradually moves on to mind control and murder. Some extremely disturbing scenes, not just of violence, the psychological horror here is especially effective given that three of the main protagonists are around ten years of age. They all would have benefited from attending Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters for a few semesters. Written and Directed by Eskil Vogt (co-wrote screenplay for Thelma). 8.5/10.",

            "content": "This movie does so many things right that it's hard to nitpick the things that it does wrong. The acting is absolutely awe-inspiring (especially that of the little boy), and even the adults play their parts to perfection. It was literally like watching a documentary on TV, watching families and children interact with each other in such a natural way. You don't really see this type of cinema all the time, and the effortlessness of the cast dynamic really made everything about this movie shine.But with all the glowing praise I have, it's the subject matter that was really disturbing for me. I know some kids are born rotten and there is nothing much you can do for them but watch them grow to be rotten adults, but the stuff these kids do is beyond deplorable. I mean, do children really do these things and what kind of parents are raising these little monsters? It was horrifying to see little kids being as awful as I know they can be, and the stellar performances only served to bring this home in a much more direct way. Honestly, the most horrifying thing about this movie were the actual children.I wish the creative team went a little further with the powers aspect of the film, I wish they would have spread out the abilities a little more as I thought the boy having the \"most\" power really limited the film (while he wasn't exactly the most powerful), and I wish the SFX was more dynamic, but what we got was serviceable and really did a great job bringing the whole film together.I was pleasantly surprised by this film and while it was a little on the long side, I enjoyed every minute of it. Certainly not a film for everyone, and if you dislike children like I do you will find a lot of distasteful stuff. But if you enjoy good cinema, you can learn to grit your teeth and endure monster children and you will find a very stellar film.",

It is sweet the way Aisha interacts with Anna and teaches her to speak again.The children in this movie are very good actors.The movie has intense build up of tension and foreboding, the feeling of something bad is going to happen, again and again and it does happen.Ben takes revenge on everyone that has ever slighted him in the least.If children actually had these powers, we'd all be dead.",

Well done, well f..king done!!! My heart was racing so fast when * is trying to push * off of a bridge. There's not A moral to the story but the film explores a lot of things, mainly the way we as kids explore and experiment the limits between what's right and wrong and how cruel kids can be without really understanding the consequences behind their actions. The superpowers are a metaphor for \"power\" in general and the consequencues it would have if children hold it when they're not really prepared for that.

            "content": "Eskil Vogt's The Innocents is an even more powerful film than his The Worst Person in the World. It has an even deeper moral mission. With miraculous performances by the central four children, it's a gripping horror story with ever widening implications.The title recalls Jack Clayton's 1961 adaptation of Henry James's The Turning of the Screw. There a governess - emblem of Restrained Civilization - discovers a harrowing evil in her young charges, subverting the usual equation of children with innocence. In Vogt's film, four children discover an ability to communicate telepathically, to initially constructive but ultimately disastrous end.The drama occurs in a summer lull, when many neighbours are away on holiday and the school-free kids roam the playgrounds and forests. The setting is an apartment complex on a beach, i.e., the modern urban edging into the primeval source of life.The central figures are a family with two daughters, the observant young Ida and the older Anna, whose autism has suspended her ability to speak. As the opening shot is of a dozing Ida the whole story can be taken as her dream or as her narrative of moral awakening.The two girls' family is the film's only complete unit. Against Ida's wishes, they have moved to a new city for her father's job. The sisters' adventure and discovery derive from their relationship with two children from immigrant families, neither of which has a father. In contrast to Ida's family blondness, the sinister Ben is East Indian and the sensitive Aisha African. Aisha's facial pigmentation is a swirl of light and dark, heightening the theme of racial identification.As if personifying the richness of imported racial and cultural diversity, the abnormal mental powers are introduced by Ben and Aisha. But any human power is ambivalent. Ben's evil treatment of a black cat is an extension of the child's amorality we see when Ida early pinches her unexpressive sister and - even worse - places shards of glass in her sister's shoe. Aisha is the positive force, understanding, enabling, caring for the others and eager to oppose the evil.But with the innocence that still emanates from children, Ben is as much the victim as the proponent of his evil power. At first he's bemused by his ability mentally to move bottle caps. When he meets Aisha and her telepathy they bring Anna an ability conventional science couldn't. She begins to speak. Instead of her chaotic etch-a-sketch swirls she draws the shark in the distant Aisha's thoughts.Ben's power turns against him when he finds he can control other people. He sends one stranger to kill a playground bully. Another is unknowingly locked out of his mission to kill the sisters.With the moral order thus upset, one of the mothers is killed, another mother kills her daughter, and the third seems on the verge of being despatched to kill hers. The murders among the mothers reveal a human nature run amok. Yet at the peak of his power Ben recoils on his floor, crying \"Mommy!\" He is himself the tragic victim of his own unnatural strength.During the climactic mental showdown between Ben and Anna, several other children in the complex, newly returned to end-of-summer real life, show an awareness of the event that the adults lack. So this story is not about individual freaks of nature but of a lurking, potentially assertive class. Specifically, the film allocates this power to our most powerless, our children. The adults here don't know what forces they are suppressing in their ostensible control of their kids.Here the film shows its political dimension. In The Birds Hitchcock undermined human complacency by unleashing a natural force that mankind usually controls. The film revived the Copernican revolution by dislodging man from the the center of his universe. Here Vogt attributes a monstrous, ambivalent power to a suppressed underclass. These children can be read as the suppressed, the oppressed, the neglected, in any contemporary society. The film reminds us that such forces need not stay helpless victim but can collectively assert a power we might well be advised to start treating with sensitivity and generosity instead of oppression.As the genre classically works, this is a horror story about the disruption caused by some monster. But here the monsters are not from outer space, or the Hydean beasts within that disrupt the Jeckyll order. The monster here is not even the supernatural force that occupies the children in Villlage of the Damned. Even more chilling, the evil here is an obviously hopeful good, the mental power that could liberate the helpless, that instead is turned to the evil of selfish abuse. Ben's suffering from how he uses his power should be a global warning.",

            "content": "I don't know if this can be classified as a \"horror\" film, but any attempt at tension or suspense the director may have been trying to convey was spoiled for me by its slow, languid pacing. \"The Innocents\" centers around a group of four children who realize they have a telekinetic connection not only with each other, but that they can also harm others with it. For the most part I felt the child actors are quite convincing (although the performance of the young actor playing the part of Ben seems very stilted), but not enough to hold my attention for two hours. I think this would have been a much stronger film if it had been edited down to a little over an hour. Without giving away any spoilers, I did like the ending, especially the final scene.Lastly, I can't believe how many reviewers here are dissing the film just because of the cat-killing scene... it's a film, people, it wasn't a real cat, for God's sake. No mention in their reviews that there are human beings killed in the film also. That's apparently perfectly acceptable, lol...",

            "content": "The Innocents follows four children who become friends during the summer holidays. Out of sight of the adults, they discover they have hidden powers. While exploring their newfound abilities in the nearby forests and playgrounds, their innocent play takes a dark turn and strange things begin to happen.Even though a vast majority of the film's most crucial elements take place out of sight of the adults, The Innocents is a look at the various methods of parental nurturing and fostering the ability for the children to become their best selves. Three vastly disparate families with different ethnicities, backgrounds, and social situations yields an environment for conflicting approaches to the kid's newfound abilities. For every groan and eyeroll for a superhero movie that spouts about the responsibility that great power brings, this film is a direct response to what happens when power is bestowed upon people too young to fully comprehend its capacity and potential. The Innocents is a story about exactly that; the loss of innocence as unchecked power is given an environment to manifest and fester, and the unfortunate consequences that follow.Starring Rakel Lenora Fl\u00f8ttum, The Innocents starts as an analysis of Ida, a girl moving with her family to a new town. The idea of neglect is the central issue as the audience is privy to Ida's treatment of her older sister Anna (Ramstad), who lives with autism, demanding more care and attention from their parents. Fl\u00f8ttum as Ida is an absolute nightmare of a kid, inflicting any number of horrible acts upon her unsuspecting sister and her streak of cruelty is shown time and again. Fl\u00f8ttum delivers a magnificent performance that takes a full arc throughout the course of the film with a wide array of conflicting emotions that play out in both verbal and nonverbal cues. Ben, the first new kid she meets played by Sam Ashraf, veers in the opposite trajectory as Ida; after the initial bond is created, it's clear to see that the same dark current of cruelty Ida possesses also runs through Ben yet stemming from different circumstances. Ashraf is brilliant as the tortured young boy; with cold eyes and a colder demeanor, Ben's menace is possibly the creepiest aspect of the film.Also starring Alva Brynsmo Ramstad as Anna, Ida's sister, the actress tasked with the hardest role in the film: playing a non-verbal autistic character who slowly comes into her own as the kid's powers develop. While a neurotypical actress to play an autistic character could be seen as problematic, Vogt handles the characterization deftly, making sure Ramstad doesn't veer into a cliche of the illness, a la Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. With the material she's given, and the direction from Vogt, Ramstad turns in a stellar performance, transitioning into an awakening and awareness that is both stirring and heartbreaking. Rounding out the cast of kids that gain these strange powers is Aisha, played by Mina Yasmin Bremseth Asheim, who spends most of her time communing with Anna. Asheim, possibly the youngest, but by far the wisest of the group, is an old soul stuck in a young person's body. Asheim plays the role with an extreme clarity, the heart of the group that is the first to push back against Ben's whims. Aisha's bond with Anna is one of the sweetest aspects of the movie, facilitating not just a change in Anna but also a change in Ida's relationship with Anna.Directed by Eskil Vogt, who spent a majority of his career co-writing movies with director Joachim Trier (to include the 2021 darling The Worst Person in the World), The Innocents marks Vogt's shift into directing for himself. Starting with this simple, well thought out low-stakes film, Vogt shows a keen eye for mood and atmosphere, pulling incredibly haunting performances from his cast of young children. From a writing standpoint, Vogt's ability to knit three different familial stories into an overarching theme of being a product of environment is subtly and superbly handled. Directing wise, the filmmaker appears nearly fully formed after spending the better part of two decades with Trier, an accomplished director in his own right. Here, Vogt manages to unravel the supernatural mystery with a pacing that keeps the viewer on the hook to find out who will be left standing at the film's end.Overall, The Innocents is one of the more sinister movies to be released in the United States this year. The unsettling creepiness Vogt manages to convey compliments the equally creepy performances from the actors. With clean, often visually arresting cinematography, sensible low budget effects, and a quiet, thoughtful examination of the nature of family, the movie is a quiet gem hidden amongst the raucous, explosion filled blockbusters that rule the summer.",

The story follows their innocent play as it takes a dark turn and strange things begin to happen. Though the movie is slow, the payoff is worth it as the children's abilities are gradually revealed.The child actors' performance is outstanding, and they carry the movie. The adults are mostly relegated to the background, but they do a respectable job in their supporting roles. The movie's pacing is its biggest issue. It's a slow movie that requires patience, but it's rewarding.The movie has been described as a horror movie, but the horror is more psychological than anything else. The story is more about the children's journey as they discover their abilities and come to terms with what they can do. It is visually stunning, and the cinematography is excellent. It is set in the Norwegian countryside, and the scenery is breathtaking. The soundtrack is also excellent. Trier has a deep sense of direction, and he instils a feeling of dread and anxiety throughout the film.Thematically, the movie explores the nature of innocence and how it can be corrupted, and the power of friendship and how it can help us overcome our fears. The Innocents provides a disturbing insight into the complex emotions and development of childhood.It's a long film, but it's worth watching for the patient.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Norwegian filmmaker Eskil Vogt wrote the screenplay for last year's terrific THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD, and that's just one of his collaborations with fellow countryman Joachim Trier. The two seem to enjoy, or at least have a knack, for creating films that take viewers out of their comfort zone. This is Vogt's second feature as director, and you will likely find yourself questioning your ideals of the complexities of childhood, and debating what makes a kid \"good\" or \"bad\".A family moves to a new apartment so that their eldest daughter Anna (Alva Brynsmo Ramstad) can receive the best possible treatment for her non-verbal autism (seemingly trapped inside her own body). Anna's younger sister Ida (Rakel Leonora Flottum) spends an inordinate amount of time on her own as their mother (Ellen Dorrit Petersen is also Rakel's real life mother; THELMA, 2017) focuses on Anna. Immediately we are struck by how cruel Ida is to Anna, obviously envious of the time her parents devote to the child in need. The film moves meticulously as Ida befriends Ben (Sam Ashraf), a young boy from the same apartment building. Ben has an ability to move things with his mind. His telekinesis is in the early stages, and Ida pushes him to develop his powers. One particularly disturbing sequence involves the two kids and a local cat at the top of the building's stairwell. Aisha (Mina Yasmin Bremseth Asheim), another young girl from the building starts hanging out with Ida and Ben. This also draws in Anna, as the sweet Aisha has a connection with her and a way of communicating telepathically. It's at this point where our brains shift into overdrive as we realize there is something supernatural going on.As Ben's ability grows, so does his sadistic nature. He reacts (often violently) to situations where he feels disrespected. At the same time, Anna and Aisha grow closer, and Ida and her parents are thrilled with Anna's improved demeanor. As viewers, we come to realize that director Vogt has made the apartment building a character itself. Is the building behind the special abilities shown by these kids? Or is it the ominous nearby forest? Why are the powers strongest when the kids are together? For a film that mostly progresses very slowly, there is much for us to take in - although we do wish more time had been spent on the makeup of all four kids. We are only teased with what other kids in the building are experiencing, but the supernatural aura is clearly in play.None of the four child actors have any previous feature film experience, yet each is superb in their own way. They perfectly capture the curiosity and confusion that goes with childhood, and there is an insightful \"kid\" moment when Ida shows her one 'talent' to Ben. We are left to wonder if the film's identical title to the 1961 classic is coincidental or purposeful. It's not a remake, but it works as an homage. The staircase shot is even similar in the two films. Filmmaker Voigt excels at ensuring we believe something evil is just around the corner, yet he never rushes to the next moment. An eerie, ominous atmosphere is perfectly complemented by these four kids. Vogt's dark film sticks the ending, and stays with us for a while.Opening May 13, 2022.",

            "content": "Exactly the type of product you wouldn't expect to come from the Hollywood system, supernatural Norwegian horror The Innocents is an unnerving and original blend of genre film-making as The Worst Person in the World screenwriter Eskil Vogt takes the helm behind the camera to give a whole new meaning too what we consider to be \"playtime\".Set over a hot and humid Nordic summer where young girl Ida befriends a new group of companions that entails the plotting Ben and softly spoken Aisha, with the ragtag collection of misfits dabbling in some powerful supernatural powers they've become aware of, powers that have potentially deadly ramifications, Vogt's film never shy's away from his films confronting plot that showcases children can be just as nefarious as adults under the right conditions.Brilliantly played out by its core cast that includes Rakel Lenora Fl\u00f8ttum as Ida, Alva Brynsmo Ramstad as her autistic sister Anna, Sam Ashraf as the troubled Ben and Mina Yasmin Bremseth Asheim as the kind spirited Aisha, The Innocents is a complete package of a film that might not be for everyone but showcases once more that Europe is home to some of the most talented and boundary pushing cinema talents operating in the world right now and that if you want something slightly left of centre and unpredictable, European produce is the way too go.In its quest to give its audience an experience that doesn't feel entirely predictable and sign-posted from a long way from the endgame, The Innocents may go to some places audiences aren't willing to stomach but for many Vogt has taken things right too where they needed to go to turn his film into a visually memorable experience that manages to shock and entertain in equal measure.Culminating into a final act that is likely to have viewers on the edge of their seats, Vogt's venture may be a little slow in parts and has numerous components that need a suspension of disbelief to be fully enjoyed but overall provides a feature film experience that is haunting and gripping in equal measure.Final Say -Proving kids aren't always as carefree and blameless as they may at first appear to be, The Innocents is an unpredictable and unique Norwegian offering that is sure to get the skin crawling.4 highway overpasses out of 5.For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

            "review_title": "Cautionary Tale When Playtime Turns Deadly",
            "content": "This is a movie that I believe got on to my radar due to it showing at film festivals. I feel like the Horrorcast talked about this one as well. If memory serves, a couple of the hosts have seen this. I did catch part of the trailer, but when I realized it was horror I stopped watching. I went to the Gateway Film Center to catch this one when it was showing. It is also one that I rewatched for my end of year list.Synopsis: during the bright Nordic summer, a group of children reveal their dark and mysterious powers when the adults aren't looking. Playtime takes a dangerous turn.We start by getting to meet our main characters. There is Ida (Rakel Lenora Fl\u00f8ttum) and her sister Anna (Alva Brynsmo Ramstad). The latter has a severe case of autism where she can no longer verbalize. She is almost in an odd state where her parents, played by Ellen Dorrit Petersen and Morten Svartveit, have trouble communicating with her. Ida resents her for the attention she needs. We see her pinch her sister as a form of revenge. There is still love there though that we see.This family is moving to a new apartment for the father's job. Ida wants the mother to take her and go on a vacation. She tells her daughter that they can't take the time off with the dad's new job. Ida didn't mean for all to go. To make matters worse, it is summer so most of the families around here are gone as well.That doesn't mean everyone is though. Ida goes outside to play and meets Ben (Sam Ashraf). We learn through interactions with this mother, played by Lisa T\u00f8nne, that she is hard on him. He does show Ida that he has developed the ability to move things with his mind. It cannot weigh too much. He can alter its path when it is dropped before him.These children become friends. Ida gets upset when her mother forces her to take Anna with her the next day. She leaves her on a tire swing and goes off with Ben. Together they have a heartbreaking scene when they do something horrible to another girl's cat. This other girl is Aisha (Mina Yasmin Bremseth Asheim). She can hear Anna, even though this older girl cannot speak. Her homelife isn't great in a different way. Her mother is Kadra Yusuf and she is dealing with the depression of losing her partner who was Aisha's father.This group bonds over realizing that they have telepathic powers, at least some do. Aisha can hear Anna's thoughts. Ben realizes that he can read Aisha's thoughts and even can use this power to read Anna's through this other girl. He also learns that he has other abilities. He uses it to punish a teen that bullies him and even his own mother. Ben's power grows and it becomes scarier to the point that the others must stop him before he turns on his friends.That is where I'll leave my recap and introducing the characters. Where I want to start is something I saw while on the Internet Movie Database page. They said on there that this feels like an origin story for a superhero movie and I agree with that. That is what I thought while sitting in the theater watching this. It is done in a subtle way and makes it feel grounded despite these children having supernatural powers. I did like that element.To get more into the meat of this movie though, I want to talk about Ida and Anna. Ida is a character that made me mad in the beginning. She feels resentment toward Anna since she needs so much of her parents' attention. I get it though. I've been in a similar situation. When my sister was born, I developed a shutter for a short time. I still have some of the effects of that. What I don't like is her hurting Anna through pinching. Since I haven't been in Ida's shoes, I shouldn't judge. I did think that Fl\u00f8ttum does a great job at getting a reaction out of me. Anna is interesting as well. She is the one of these two that has powers from the start. I like this idea. Her affliction makes it tough, but it almost seems like her brain developed in a different way. It works for me. I also think that Ramstad does a great job at her portrayal of this character as well. Spoiler here, the acting is good despite mostly being children to be honest.Where I want to go next then would be Ben. I hated this kid. His mother is struggling and she takes it out on him. He is a psychopath from it. We see him hurt a cat. He doesn't take it well when he is bullied. That is probably another part of his issues. We see though that he gets angry with Ida and Aisha for messing with him, even if it is lighthearted. There are times where I've gotten annoyed when my friends keep on it for too long. They are lightly messing with him and he gets angry. Ashraf was good in this role. He does well at showing the hurt when he is home and then being the evil kid as the movie progresses. It is well done. It also had my anxiety going up with seeing how things play out as he grows his power. This is where it starts to seem like an origin story for a supervillain.That concept is where I'm going next. This movie is dealing with the idea of getting too powerful too quickly, something akin to Akira or Anakin in Star Wars. We have a character like Ben who is broken. He has a rough homelife and probably also dealing with bullying. He knows he has a bit of telekinesis, but when he meets Anna, he realizes that he is more powerful than that. He discovers the ability to control others and the powers we saw earlier are much stronger. What I like though is his counterpart of Anna. We learn that she is the most powerful one here, but due to her condition, she is unassuming. I did enjoy how things play out there.I don't think there is anything else that I wanted to delve into for the story and I've gone over most of the acting. There are some of the side characters that I want to discuss still. I did like Asheim and the struggles with her mother. She knows her mother is down. Aisha does what she can to cheer her up, but she needs time. She is grieving still. I'd say that Peterson, Svartveit, Yusuf and T\u00f8nne were all solid as the parents. They are distinct enough characters. Their personalities also have effects on how they're child act as well. It is also interesting that the children don't share information with them. They don't believe them when they do and that feels real. The rest of the cast help to round this out and push our children to where they end up for me.Then the last things to go into would be the filmmaking aspects. I think that the cinematography here is great. They do some interesting shots. It looks amazing. There is something they will do with shadows and changing how a scene looks when Ben is influencing them. I did like showing this. They do well in editing it with seeing what the truth is as well for the duality. The effects were good too. There is practical ones and a bit of CGI. I think how they handle both works well. It also seems like they hid things when needed, which helps. Other than that, I thought the soundtrack was good to help build the atmosphere that the movie needed as well.In conclusion, this was a movie that looked good, but I was still leery about it. I'm glad that I watched it though. We have a group of children that are different, while also having things in common. I'd say that the acting from them is good. The rest of the cast are solid in support. We don't get a lot of effects, which you would expect, but what we do get are good. I had no issues there. Other than that, the rest of the filmmaking aspects are well done, especially the cinematography. I think that this is above average movie that is just below being good. Having now revisited this, it has come up slightly for me. I now think this is a good movie.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",

The first half is quite slow, with little narrative substance and virtually no dialogue - just children being mean and creepy - so that by the end of the first hour it begins to drag. The pace eventually picks up over the last 40 minutes, which are delightfully tense and suspenseful and manage to keep you on the edge of your seat with some great spooky (and gruesome) scenes, but at this point it feels like too little too late. Nice cinematography and sound that enhance the eerie overtone of the movie; the kids' acting is excellent.Overall, a nice suspense/supernatural flick with a nordic vibe going on (one can't help but think of von Trier's similar nordic oddity Riget).

I never saw that coming and it made the movie less \"evil\" as it progressed.When the kids threw the cat down the stairs, I hoped they would focus on a destructive path of child psychopaths in the real world. By connecting the dots on how society have some lost souls that do evil as a cry for help.I know the symbolic \"take over\" of a loving mother that suddenly kills her own daughter, is a way to show crazyness that some psychos have. And it raises the question for Ida; could my parents kill me? But it was confusing since the mother cried a lot without telling her story.The ending was really predictable and focused on making the big sister with authism as the \"hero\" who killed evil... It would be more dramatic if they had a knife-fight right in front of all the adults and children at the playground.Short summary; This film is a story about moving to a new place, with children killing other children using jedi forces.

Here, the insular world of children -- which can often be as cruel as it can be innocent -- opens itself up to get revenge on the wrongs its been dealt on adults with no true concern for the consequences, at least in Ben's case.As a child, I always thought having superpowers would solve the bullying issues that I dealt with every day. Now, after watching the Innocents, I feel pretty happy that I just stayed a normal person.",

Stupid pet owners who didn't watched the whole movie shouldn't do reviews. I guess these people can't watch action/thriller/horror movies either because actors die in those movies too...If evil kids gain supernatural powers, they can harm others but they can also fight back. It's about good and evil but also how darkness can bring kids together.What starts as innocent games, then develops into something dark and terrifying. Too late, the children realize it, but get unexpected help. The story takes place in a sleepy nameless Norwegian suburb and the contrast between the everyday life during summer break and the evil forces that are set in motion could not be greater. When children are involved, it becomes even more unsettling. The strength is the simple format, as far from Hollywood as you can possibly get. It feels more real when visual effects are few.My only problem is that the editing is very odd and many scenes are unexplained or left in no-man's-land. But all in all, this is a slow-burner that proves it's possible to do more with less.",

Give normal ratings! We all have benefits of that. I saw the rating of a 7. And thats pretty good and i understand that kind of ratings better, for me it was a 9 and i have seen allot of movies and then i mean allot! More then 35 years of watching movies and still there are movies that catch me and suprise me, not often but once in a while they do! So if you want my opinion about it, go watch it dont listen to the dumb 1 ratings that destroys the movie before you watched it. This movie is very dark, great child acting, cruel scenes, even the title of the movie is very good. Again it may not be your cup of tea because its disturbing, but that doesnt mean its bad.

Well written, well filmed. Understated but skilful CGI really adds to it instead of taking away. Really unique concept and execution, I haven't seen a movie quite like this before, though I do feel it borrows some themes from other movies (Lord of the Flies rather comes to mind).I won't wax on about the interpretations here, because you can Google those after you watch and get anything from base ideas, to others that dive into representations of the ego, superego, etc. What I will say here, is this is a novel and surprising film. It caught my eye immediately with the trailer and I finally found it to stream tonight and immediately knocked it out. Talk about consistently building tension. I'm especially nervous with movies involving children, cause I have my own, so this definitely had my nerves going.******'SPOILER BUT NOT REALLY, MORE OF A TRIGGER WARNING*********\nI see a lot of people freaking out over the cat scene as if the director used a real cat. \ud83d\ude44 So maybe don't watch it if you're overly sensitive to animals dying in movies, I guess. It's weird to me how many people are freaking out over it, considering it's in a movie and obviously not real, and a commonly used trope to show signs of sociopathy/psycopathy/lack of empathy.

But for animal lovers, definitely skip this scene or just don't watch this.Warning: skipping through the scene will cause you to lose some of the plotline due to the fact that the camera switches and contrasts with another scene at the same time but I really don't think you'll lose too much.

And when I finally thought that this is it, the film couldn't sustain these darker, unsettling complexions anymore, it stood fast against my naive presumptions by taking things up a few notches there and then!We might have seen plenty of these 'origin' stories before, where some characters (mostly teenagers) suddenly discover certain powers, and then for the entire course of the film, they try to figure out what they could do and what they should not do with their newly formed abilities. The Innocents, albeit using comparable notions still somehow manages to set itself apart from the rest.Not only did the core approach seem to be quite different here with lesser showboating and more substance but it also had reinstated the traditional assemblage of teenagers with a very young group of pre-adolescents. And by doing so, they sought vital conversations regarding parental involvement and the ever-growing necessity for children's psychological assessments.",

You won't be able to root for anyone, but that's the point - you're supposed to feel bad.The fact that kids are involved make the whole process sickening - by design. Think \"Funny Games\" meet the \"Primer\" school of cinematrography, with outstanding child actors, understated CGI, and brilliant photography.The movie pulls no punch and at least has the courage of visualising its convictions, with no deus ex-machina outside of a surprisingly chiche 'what if' ending. I'll give it that.I'll also give it only 2 stars, simply because it uncessarily shoehorns an obtuse, heavy handed visualiation of a 'rainbow nation of norway', complete with a message on how selling dolls with blonde hair is somehow a greater 'evil' than say, animal abuse.

The handicapped girl cannot speak and she meets another preteen who brings out the best in her. Unfortunately, the cat hating boy shows a mind controlling power which he does not good to good use. The adults are all secondary to the story and the children are all terrific young actors. The atmosphere is sufficiently creepy but the ending was quite predictable.

From the first minute of the movie until the last minute of the movie, I was all the time very keen to see that what the movie shows next.There was almost nothing that I didn't particularly like. Everything just seems to work really well. The movie is pretty much carried by children and it works very well. They are directed well and they manage to give what is required from them. All the adults acts side characters where one or two of them are more important considering the plot. Very minimalistic use of special effects, and I think it works really well. Special effects are used where they really brings some value for the movie and those few moments where special effects are used, they are made with good quality. Scenery is small scope. I believe it's couple of shooting locations at the same suburb area in the whole movie and couple of different apartments. Nothing bad in that, like everything else, it just works.What I really like is that the movie just presents things and concentrates on that. It doesn't even try to explain the happenings. The movie gives facts that ok, this is what these people can do and this is what they do with what they have.I think this movie is almost perfect example of take full advantage of what you have and then it boils totally down to the fact that do very basic things right in movie like scripting, editing, shooting, acting and directing.Well done.It's actually really pity that the local cinema gives very poor show times for this movie. Almost all of them seems to be during the week 8pm or so. If you planning to see this, just go! It totally deserves it.",

Here, you almost feel like you are watching a fly-on-the-wall documentary - so good is the acting from such young children. All four lead roles are sublime, and the portrayal of autism, particularly authentic.Of course, the acting would be meaningless without a well-directed story. Filmed exclusively from a childs-eye view, one gets a unique perspective, unfiltered by adult morality, logic or reason. Very little is explained - just experienced - and one feels almost like a child as one watches: helpless, with no words to explain what is happening. The horror (and there is horror), is all the more horrific because of both the banality of the context (a rather nondescript housing estate) and the unpredictability of the children's actions, as I say, unfiltered by adult sensibilities.An excellent and unique film.",

We think that kids aren't inherently evil or they don't seem to understand the difference between right or wrong but it's not true. It's also about how children learn what's good and evil. Someone who seems casually evil can choose a different path; the path of good. Or they can learn when to control their evil urges and when to unleash them. It starts slow but if you're patient, then they pay off is good. Also, the scene with the cat is obviously a CGI ed scene. The director has also cleared that up.

Then a man came in, and a woman in a hat came out. Then I came out myself, I don't know how it ended.\"\nBut this film changed my vision not only of European cinema, but, it seems, of the perception of reality itself, when every glance out of the window, every everyday action is filled with meaning, even if this meaning is not only not expressed, but also not fully realized, as it happens with children who naturally have a lower level of self-realization and self-presentation than adults.

Vogt carefully sets up the situation, which, at first, seems like a positive for the kids as they unlock secret abilities even they were unaware of.THE INNOCENTS is a sort of VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED crossed with Stephen King's Carrie, and it certainly has its effective passages. It's when things get dark that the problems arise. While there is no doubt to the horror inherent of such power in the hands of youngsters, it becomes unpleasant above all else. Unquestionably, there are bad seeds and 'innocent' harm that can be done, but Vogt never seems to draw it all together to convey any sort of point to the enterprise beyond the basic concept of young people having their own common language and communication. Even as a pure horror film the pacing is quite slow and the shock value diluted by how obtuse the telling is.While Vogt shows some skill as a Director (it's his second feature) - especially, in the way he handles the young actors. Vogt the screenwriter lets himself downas a director here. The writing could certainly have used some of the wit and intelligence of his multiple fine collaborations with WORST Director Joachim Trier. And, a sharper focus, but there are some definite moments.Note: The film does contain animal cruelty.",

You can feel the pain these characters have, their thoughts and fears gnawing them from the inside. And so little do adults, their parents see of it. That's a part of what scared me. And led me to question my world as a parent. By all means, go watch it. Don't miss it. Slowburner, as described by others, yet once seen, it will stay with you. Solid 9/10 from me.",

I enjoy movies for a number of reasons, one being to observe how the movie was made and what the filmmakers might be trying to communicate.Which brings me to my main point, \"communication\" is faithful only if the \"receiver\" (audience) gets the message that the \"sender\" (filmmakers) intended to send. This movie doesn't do that very well. I feel sure the filmmakers had some very specific ideas but mostly failed to communicate them in a way that is clear. As a result I don't rate this movie very highly. And it is not one that I would want to see again.It is set in Norway, mostly several families living in a large multi-unit building about 8 to 10 floors high, with a pond and a playground just outside. It focuses on the kids, about 10 to 15 years old, getting together and playing. But this isn't ordinary play as at least one of the kids, maybe two of them, appear to have some sort of telekinetic powers. Maybe even the ability to influence others by thought. All this results in a few tragic scenes but after it was all over I was not quite sure what to make of all of it.\"The Innocents,\" a familiar horror movie made leaden by a slow pace and weak plotting.",

But every scene, every shot serves a purpose and sets the viewer up for what is yet to come.What is left is almost two hours of sheer cinematic beauty with some of the best camera work you'll see from the last few years, and a story that develops slowly and never states the obvious. It's arthouse cinema at its best, and maybe not supposed to be for everyone, but for those who appreciate high quality and original films this movie is a must.A film with children playing the main roles can be challenging to watch, but that wasn't the case with The Innocents. The kids are incredible, every scene is convincing and real, so much that it mad me remember being 9 years old myself.I can't wait to watch this again with my own children, although it might take a few years till they're old enough.",

It didn't feel like it was building up to anything significant, and the ending scene proves this. So it was just a scene after a scene. Some of which were very similar.Sadly, they didn't focus on a lead character, and the awaited reveal of her power was disappointing.So when it felt like it was trying to end, it just ended. They pushed a vague message of family or sistership, but that ultimately did nothing for the story, just common sense.Probably a deeper dive into Ben's character would've made this better.

Top-notch directing, editing, and cinematography. And if course, some of the best performances ever carried out by such a young cast of titular characters. These kids could arguably out-perform many leading names in entertainment today.All the characters (including the supporting cast) and every scene served an important function. There really wasn't much to pick apart.I truly can't think of another film that has evoked such a strong and visceral reaction in me. Not Schindler's List, not Saving Private Ryan, not Requiem for a Dream, not Sophie's Choice, not the Exorcist ...I could go on ad infinitum.So yes, I found compelling, engaging, and powerful, but it was also heartbreaking. It is a film that will have a lasting impact but not necessarily in the way you want something to stay with you.Maybe it's the fact that at the end of the day these were after all just kids, or the fact that there that there was little sense to be made of its tragic nature, but I was ultimately left with too many unresolved feelings to process and a heavy heart.I thought this was an excellent, masterfully made film and I'm also quite confident it's one I will not be re-watching.",

He is as powerful as the archangel Gabriel and can do no harm. He is an animal and nature lover and uses his powers to show kindness toward all things living.The documentary even follows him along as he uses his magical power to help a young and inexperienced soccer player on the playground have a new and amazing life experience. The soccer player is so overwhelmed with joy he screams out in gratitude.And the fawning girls just love their group leader. They know that when he grows up he will make an excellent husband so they all fight to get closer to him.This boy is multitalented and helps his mom boil water for cooking dinner. When she has an accident and falls (she is clumsy and dumb), he does his best to help her and even covers her to keep her warm. He says a prayer to help her. But she is not a good person. For even though dinner is already made, she is not grateful and complains for no reason.Overall this documentary is a wonderfully educational look at kids using magic nowadays. You will laugh and be filled with joy as you watch. A wonderful documentary for all ages. Plus it teaches the power of using magic for good in the world. Lots for everyone to learn!",

            "content": "This film had the potential to be a real gem, in my opinion: The 9 and 10 stars reviews are not lying when they praise its well crafted moodiness, its somewhat fresh take of a not-so-fresh horror topic, its psychological (and social) undertones.But for me, the indecisiveness of Mr. Vogt between a child-like POV and full-blown realism killed the film stone dead: In the best case scenario is owed to the dedication of maintaining that sense of eeriness and isolation at all cost; in the worst, to laziness.Whichever the case may be, the audience ended up with:1. A premise too outrageous to be plausible, and yet too unambiguously rooted in reality to be expressionist (I'm not a stickler for fully exposed plots, but the random presence of several \"gifted\" kids in the same block of flats is just ridiculous).2. Dreadful actions which pays extremely vague consequences, if any (parents seems rather chill when faced by clear signs of abuse toward their autistic child; after two freaky murders in a row in the same area, still there is no presence of authorities in sight; in Norway corpses left to rot in summer don't smell, and little girls are unfazed by their pet disappearance).3. The cat (to the reviewers who mocked the cries of outrage for that scene because \"it's fake\", I'd say that is also a horror trope old and lazy that doesn't belong in any relevant film that came out after the '90s unless is titled \"John Wick\". Using animal cruelty just to showcase the starting point of an escalation of violence is the most unimaginative trick in the book, and I gladly avoid films that relies on such trope. I would have done the same with this one, if they paid me the courtesy of a trigger warning).At the end of the day, artistically speaking \"The Innocents\" is graced by a good atmosphere and some striking scenes, whilst plagued by the lack of a credible and full-fleshed structure.Unfortunately, for me the former doesn't go anywhere near of balancing out the latter.",

Reading the reviews, I see a number of people turned the movie off. I get it. Luckily, watching this at home, rather than in a theater, you can fast forward through it. I knew it was coming so when a cat was introduced around 20 minutes in, I held down the fast forward button. I was able to look away. I stopped it at 27 minutes and the scene had passed. It ended up being a hell of a movie. One of the best \"horror\" films of the year, in my opinion.

Like why are the heroines white blonde girls and the evil one is a dark-skinned boy...\nAs it is, walking on a frail line between ethics, needs, frustration, friendship, alienation, differences, The Innoncents don't make any claim, the film holds its mystery and that is already a precious virtue.",

            "content": "Nordic horror films really have no filter when it comes to violence especially involving children, something that is not seen in Hollywood or Asian films. Thus probably why there is no rating for the film.This is a film centered around a group of children who slowly discover that they have supernatural abilities and their playing around with these powers leads to some dark events. These powers give some of these children the ability to let out and vent their internal struggles growing up in abusive situations with some devastating consequences. While others use their powers to help others. There is sort of a theme about how the parents treat their kids can affect the children's behaviour. As the kids play around with their powers and each other, there are some disturbing and mean things that kids do to each other which may very well happen in real life. Yet there are limits to how far one can go and the film shows that while kids may be cruel they do have a sense of what is wrong and right when it crosses a line. There are some racist undertones with the choice of the cast depicting certain characters and actions.Apart from the disturbing scenes, this film had some excellent cinematography which really puts you in in the children's (who are the main actors) shoes. The zooming out shots are especially effective at giving a bird's eye view of the world.Overall, would give it a 6.7/10 (rating system only allows whole numbers) for excellent acting by the children and vivid imagery. If they would have left out some of the violent depictions then it would have deserved a higher rating. The writer and director (same person), Eskil Vogt, certainly has some sick ideas that they wished to do as kids.",
