            "content": "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original \"Star Wars\" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first \"Star Wars\" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review \"Star Wars\" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to \"Star Wars\" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of \"Lord of the Rings\" or \"Star Trek\" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+",

The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.",

            "content": "Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi (1983) is a third sequel in the original Star Wars trilogy it is flawed, yet very entertaining solid third sequel and an epic conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Honestly in my opinion Return of the Jedi is far way better film than The Force Awakens, that movie was a disaster and it sucked, I rather watch this movie any time. It is not my favorite film in the series and I don't love this movie that much like I love the first two movies, but I like it and it think it is very good at some points. The film has a lot of problems, that hurts the movie. I still have enjoyed this movie and I had a lot of fun. Return of the Jedi (1983) is directed this time from Richard Marquand a different director than it was directed from Irvin Kershner and George Lucas. This movie was released on the same year that I was born in 1983. The film is pretty good on it is own way, but on the other thing it suffers from problems and flaws.Things I like in this movie: The first hour is set back on planet Tatooine which is a rescue mission which I like, the story is set where the first movie begins and ends here.Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO, and R2-D2 return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (who was encased in carbonite at the end of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) from the gangster Jabba the Hutt (voice: Larry Ward).A battle on ship, with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba's men. During the battle, Leia strangles Jabba to death with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2's help escapes from her bonds. The heroes destroy the ship, kills the bad guys and save Han solo. I love the explosion, the rescue and than they are all save.I love that we find out from ghost of Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that Leia (Carrie Fisher) is the sister of Luke ( Mark Hamill). I love that Luke revels to Leia that she is his sister.I like the battle on the Endor, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Ewoks are battling Stormtroopers to destroying the shield generator for the second Death Star and they do the destroy it. Lando and his assault team destroys the deaths tar on the end.Luke face Darth Vader and the evil Emperor and fights both of them, while they where both trying to bring him on a dark side of the force to join them.I love when Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle, slicing off Vader's right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut, and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son's blade.Realizing that Luke cannot be turned, the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him, Vader repents and turns on the Emperor, throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death.Luke try's to save Anakin but he dies before he could save him.I feel that Luke's transition from a teenager to calm and collected warrior of the Force feels very authentic. His conflict between Darth Vader and the Emperor contains some of the best scenes in the entire saga.Things I don't like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it: This movie's biggest flaw is the pacing, the Ewoks and their role in the film. Star Wars been in a forest, aren't Star Wars suppose to set in the Galaxy and not in the forest? Personally I don't mind the Ewoks, but their introduction causes the movie comes to a screeching halt. Another fault of this movie is its attempts at humor. It feels often unnatural and forced a lot of the time. The Phantom Menace has been notorious for having this problem as well, but they most likely originated here.Master Yoda dies in this film! Why? Watching Yoda in the prequels I have really enjoyed him much more than I have watching him in the last two movies. Little guy grove up in to my heart. So I disagree about him dying.I am giving this movie an 8, I watch A New Hope and Retun of the Jedi on TV as a kid I don't remember watching The Empire Strikes Back, but I have saw those tow movies and still I like Return of the Jedi a lot.",

            "content": "My five children were growing up but all still at home when 'Return of the Jedi' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.After the fantastic 'Star Wars' and 'Empire Strikes Back' (now called parts IV and V on DVD), the last episode 'Return of the Jedi' was bound to be somewhat of a let down, but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels' battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and the Princess, and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke's Jedi training at the hands of Yoda, as Luke becomes the Last Samurai, I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.",

            "content": "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Disney+. The storyline follows the Jedi and Luke needing to save their ally, Solo, who even after being saved will need to settle his debt with Jabba the Hutt. Meanwhile, Luke seeks out Yoda to finish his training and the Jedi sets out for one last battle against the evil empire. For them to be successful, Luke will likely need to face his father one last time.This movie is directed by Richard Marquand (Jagged Edge) and stars Mark Hamill (Sushi Girl), Harrison Ford (Blade Runner), Carrie Fisher (Sorority Row), Billy Dee Williams (Batman), Ian McDiarmid (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) and James Earl Jones (Conan the Barbarian).The entire Jabba the Hutt opening is always one of my favorite sequences in the series and a great way to start the movie. Harrison Ford was hilarious both in his lines and his body language. He couldn't have been better cast. The escape scene in this is everything you could want and every scene on Endor is magic. The chase through the woods opening and the mystery and unveiling of the Ewoks was super cool. The final two battles involving Luke, Vader and the Emperor is classic science fiction gold and a wonderful depiction of the force and the dark side.Overall this movie doesnt get as much credit for its greatness that it should. I would score this an easy 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",

            "content": "...Maybe my personal take? The original Star Wars (1977) was genre changing. The second Star Wars (1980) was an unexpected sequel, a blockbuster in every sense of the word. This third one....well, it made it easy to say goodbye for 16 years and to have lowered expectations when the prequels started arriving in 1999.It just takes itself too seriously. \"I know he's OK....I can feeeel it!\". Oh, brother. Talking about The Farce being with you. And no I did not just misspell that word. Obi Wan returns in spirit form to rewrite some history so Luke did not just get thrown over for Han Solo because girls just love the bad boys, but there is some reason and purpose behind it. \"So you told me a bunch of lies?\" Luke asks his one time mentor. \"Well that depends upon what your definition of the word \"IS\" is\"...being the gist of how Obi Wan answers him.And we have a fairly meaningless chase through a rain forest, and the most commercial purposeless creature ever created in cinematic history up to that date - the Ewok. Be sure to ask for a miniature for your kids when you order a Big Mac and fries.I've been hard on Episode VI in light of how great IV and V were. I'm giving it a seven because compared to other films, that is what it is. Compared to its two predecessors it is probably a six.

With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off.The Opening sequence, set on Tatooine, we see Jabba's palace, a pit of slavery and scum, and new home to Han Solo, as Luke and the gang prepare for his rescue, and with Luke's Jedi powers, they have the edge.We also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chewy battle it out on Endor, desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the Death Star. The Rebel Fleet led by Lando, battle with the Imperial Fleet while they wait for the shields to go down, and Luke has a final showdown with Darth Vader.

            "content": "So what made this movie a step down than its two predecessors? Well, forgive me for nit picking, but I didn't think the humour is as strong as it was in New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. Plus, while it was evident, the romantic elements weren't as developed either. However, putting these flaws aside, it is still enormously entertaining, thanks to the elaborate set pieces and the well choreographed battles(the final battle especially was a knockout). And I will say that it is a vast improvement over the prequels. The plot is still fast paced and sophisticated, and the screenplay while not as fun still is as imaginative as ever.I have heard many complaints about the Ewoks. I think it depends on your perspective whether you like them or not; maybe a delight to younger audiences, maybe too sickly cute to an adult. Being a 17 year old female, I thought they were very cute. The acting is still very impressive, with Mark Hamill spontaneously likable in the lead. Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda and his death scene is heart rending, and Ian McDairmund also steals his scenes as the Emperor. Harrison Ford, in an inspired bit of casting is great again as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher is still vivacious and Alec Guiness the great actor that he was is brilliant as Obi Wan. But my favourite is James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader, his majestic booming voice is very ideal for a dark menacing villain. And I must mention John Williams's music, brilliant and innovative, unquestionably one of the best film scores of all time. All in all, while my least favourite of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi makes for essential viewing. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",

But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!-The 3 Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (Led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Confronts his Father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (Lando's Moment)-The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: Like I said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the Ewoks but I think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.All in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story.",

            "review_title": "Its fun, but full of holes and inconsistencies",
            "content": "In many ways, Return of the Jedi cut firmly against the brilliant grain set by Empire Strikes Back. The reason Empire was so effective was that it showed us the rebels were still losing, you can't just destroy the Death Star and have everything go away. But here, Lucas rounds out the trilogy with another climactic space battle and everything wraps up really nicely with no questions ask. Return of the Jedi is clearly the least impressive of the original trilogy. It is full of holes, tonal inconsistencies and plot implausibilities. I'd chalk this up to Richard Marquand not being half as competent as Irvin Kershner, and the departure of Gary Kurtz from the project. Kurtz reportedly left because he and Lucas couldn't agree on whether story or spectacle should take priority (Lucas was obviously in favour of spectacle), and you can tell because Return of the Jedi's story makes absolutely no sense in places.The opening sequences in Jabba's palace entertained me to no end as a child, but now it just confuses me. How long has it been since Empire Strikes Back? Didn't Lando and Chewie go in to try and rescue Han? Chewie and the droids are turned over to Jabba, but Leia seems ready to get Han out of there and leave them behind. Was it the plan to get captured? Was Luke's plan to get captured? Since when can Luke do Jedi mind tricks? Did Luke go back and train with Yoda for a year, and if so, why wasn't \"is Vader really my father\" not asked then? The film's screenplay is quite messy and doesn't flow on from the rest of the saga. In one typical scene, Yoda admonishes Luke for rushing off to face Vader without proper training, then says he doesn't need anymore training and only when he confronts Vader will he be a Jedi. Again, maybe some concrete evidence on how long has passed would help. This film is the point where the story meant little to Lucas and the details even less (Solo is promoted from Captain to General where all he did was get frozen in carbonite, and Calrissian walks off the street into the role of General!). I've always regarded Darth Vader quite lowly on my list of movie villains, and watching Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back I found myself wondering why. I now realise its because Return of the Jedi completely nukes him. The idea of there still being good in Vader comes completely out of nowhere - he tortured his son with the knowledge that his father is the most evil man in the galaxy and then chopped his hand off and let him fall to his likely death. The addition of Emperor Palpatine also relegates Darth Vader to a side character - during the conversations between Luke and the Emperor, Vader sort of stands diffently to the side and chips in with the occasional \"yeah. what he said.\" Palpatine's character development pretty much begins and ends with \"evil\" - he seems so sure that Luke will join him, yet Luke's battle with the dark side emerges only as a plot point in those scenes. Even if Luke turns to the dark side, what will make him join Palpatine? The expanded universe implies more information about this, but its not very well established here. The execution is pretty inconsistent - Luke goes from being Alec Guinness-style calm to flailing his lightsaber around like he's never held one before. Now that I mention it, Mark Hamill seems to be playing two characters simultaneously. I've covered what I didn't like, but this is a Star Wars film and there's so much to love. The epic space battle at the second Death Star only reminds me how much I missed it in Empire Strikes Back. Ford is having a lot of fun in this movie, and the rest of the cast delivers pretty solidly as well. The gorgeously shot introduction of Red Guards in stark contrast with the white stormtroopers is a beautiful throwback to Vader's black/white contrast in the original Star Wars, and once again, it tells us the bars have been raised. The sound editing/mixing is always in good form in Star Wars - my favourite scene being a harsh lightsaber ignition sound just as Luke says Vader won't hurt him or turn him over to Palpatine. The Battle of Endor walks a narrow line between cheesy and genuinely exciting, and Marquand keeps the Ewoks just shy of the Gungans.Return of the Jedi is a really fun movie, but its not a cinematic artwork like its predecessors. I grew up watching this film, but when I read about where the story would have gone were it not for Lucas' toy revenue - the death of Han Solo and a tired Luke walking into the distance like an old Western - I'd be lying if I said the film's sickly sweet dance party ending didn't stick in my craw just a bit.",

That is one thing. The other is the hugh battle in space that has become a tradition in star wars films, to have large scaled battles in space. The final battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader is really remarkable and gives us a little father - son fight.

Luke pretty much wanted to redeem his father's good name and at the end Vader regains his humanity just in time not only to save his son Luke, but to destroy the Emperor, the man who cost Vader his soul.  I also liked the scene in the film where 3PO summarizes the events of the previous chapters for the Ewoks. This also helps to tie everything together as far as the saga is concerned. Also, even though many have called this the weakest film in the trilogy, it still has enough of a story and great special effects to put it on a par with the previous films.",

            "content": "After \"Star Wars: A New Hope\" redefined science fiction, and \"The Empire Strikes Back\" redefined \"Star Wars\", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job.  The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war.  There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor.  When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion.  This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader.  It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them.  There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well.  With the light tone of \"A New Hope\" and the more sinnister tone of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale.  The Special Edition for \"Return of the Jedi\" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it.  Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense.  Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved.  It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film.  A THIRD must-see for film fans.",

            "content": "Perspective is a good thing.  Since the release of \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\", claims and counter-claims of just how Episode's II and III will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' Star Wars films, making them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies.  What the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films.  This new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: \"Return of the Jedi\".  Often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect \"The Empire Strikes Back\".  Indeed the 'cute' element of ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series.  Did George Lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities?  Only he can answer that question.This cute factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle AND evolution of the saga.  Following on from the conclusion of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his Rebel Alliance friends to Tatooine, his home planet, to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the space pirate turned Rebel hero who was captured by Jabba the Hutt for overdue debts.\nSkywalker is a changed man since leaving Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight the evil Empire.  Now swathed all in black, Luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn.  His psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest.  While he might aim to always assist his Rebel friends, he yearns for another chance to confront the evil Darth Vader again, despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the Dark Side and join Vader at the Emperor's side.Early scenes in Tatooine are impressive, from Jabba's lair, to his floating palace and the 'almighty Sarlac' - an intenstine that lives in the sand. Lucas' CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the Sarlac, making it look fake and overdone.\nThe battle scene on Tatooine is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga.  Luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates Jabba and his cronies, proving his prowess as a Jedi is now almost complete.When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit the ailing Yoda one more time, the viewer is let down by Yoda's distinct lack of screentime. Undoubtably the star of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of Luke's destiny is played out on screen.\nROTJ really is Luke's film, perhaps even more so than the original.  His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate.  The other Rebel characters certainly work in his shadow.  The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is all but non-existant, unlike in \"Empire\".  In fact only Leia's character is developed in ROTJ, Solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.Their roles are consigned to working alongside the Rebels to destroy an all new Death Star that nears completion.  This time the Emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction.  The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful Skywalker to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?) Darth Vader.  The Emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than Governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) from \"Star Wars\", more deeply psychologically dark than anything else.  Played brilliantly by Ian McDiarmid, the Emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate.All the other actors are well entrenched in their roles.  Hamill surprises as the more wisened Luke, making his character's progression from whiny teenager, impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series.  Ford's role is waring thin, as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films -- he was the REAL star of the first film after all.  Fisher's Leia is more of a prop, at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about...  Add in favourites like Alec Guiness as Kenobi, Yoda and the loveable Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast.Despite the film's corny forest battle involving the Ewoks and the Empire, it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence: on Endor, in space and on the Death Star, each with very impressive special effects.  The music, as always, is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance.  Just as the 'Blue Danube' worked perfectly for \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", John Williams' score is as much a part of \"Star Wars\" folklore as light sabers and the Force.Lucas left the ending open to interpretation, meaning there could have been more episodes made.  Indeed sci-fi fans have created their own versions of Episodes VII, VIII and IX in their heads over and over again.  ROTJ works when given a chance, and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series.When all six episodes get to be viewed together, this saga could well be the best ever made.  Is it already?  The addition of Episode I changed the landscape of the series.  This is why \"Return of the Jedi\" can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release.",

Besides, they ARE cute, and I don't care if they're marketable.  Yubb Nubb!This movie always leaves me in tears.  It's perfect.  The end could not be better.  I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin.  I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way.  So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it.  It's very effective.  Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man.  He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.I don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope.  They all do so well.  They are believable characters.  Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development.  Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on!  She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!).  Harrison Ford - need I say more?The music is once again brilliant.  It's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts \"NOOO!\" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle.  John Williams is nothing short of a genius!  What an amazing man!Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I.

            "content": "At last, I am covering the final installment of Star Wars' original 6 films, before I have to take on the unholy duty of discussing the more recent Disney entries. Even though this film is leaps and bounds ahead of whatever nonsense the franchise's new owners can create, many people don't feel this way about it. Surprisingly, I kind of agree with them. Return of the Jedi is sort of the black sheep of the first 3 movies, and while the first 3 Star Wars films are all excellent, I feel that this one is the least best. I'll explain why later. ROTJ takes place a year after Han Solo has been frozen in carbonite to be transported to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, a large slug-like alien, for a bounty. C-3PO and R2-D2 travel to Jabba's palace on the desert world of Tatooine in order to show Jabba a recording of Luke saying he wants to rescue Han. Princess Leia, disguised in a bounty hunter garb of her own, sneaks into the palace, thaws out Han, and rescues him, but is caught by Jabba and chained to him as his slave. Luke shows up and tries to assassinate Jabba himself, but falls through a trap door into an area where he must fight off a large, carnivorous beast called a rancor. Jabba is infuriated when Luke manages to kill his pet by dropping a portcullis on its head, so he sentences Luke and all his friends to be executed by being eaten by a sarlaac: a sand dwelling creature consisting of a beak, sharp tusks and tentacles. Jabba and the others are taken by floating yachts to the area where the sarlaac is, and as Luke is condemned to jump into its maw, he has R2 shoot his lightsaber to him from Jabba's yacht. After Luke kills almost everyone, Leia strangles Jabba to death with her slave chains and is freed by Luke. After speeding away from Jabba's exploding sail barge, Luke once again flies to the planet Dagobah to hopefully complete his Force training with the help of Master Yoda, whose physical body has become very ill by now. As Yoda's 9 centuries of life come to an end, he tells Luke that it is true that Vader is his father. Outside Yoda's hut, Obi-Wan's ghost tells Luke that he will never be a true Jedi until he comes face to face with his father. Meanwhile, the Rebels find out that Emperor Palpatine is building a new Death Star, which, despite its incomplete appearance, has a fully working superlaser. Han and the others manage to hijack an Imperial shuttle and fly to the forest moon of Endor in order to destroy a shield generator which is providing the Death Star with an impervious defensive forcefield. While there, the group comes across a tribe of what appear to be man-eating teddy bears called Ewoks. While the ewoks and Han's strike team fight the imperials and try to bring down the shield, Luke surrenders himself to Vader's forces so he can meet with his father. Vader tells his son that he's been following the path of evil for too long, and that he will always be part of the dark side. While Luke is brought before Palpatine, a large space battle erupts around the Death Star as rebel forces try to destroy it. Palpatine taunts Luke and urges him to give in to his anger, saying only his hatred and dark side energy can destroy a frail, unarmed old man such as him. Luke tries to swing at Palpatine, but his attack is blocked by Vader's lightsaber. The two fight somewhat inconclusively, until Vader tells Luke that if he won't submit to his inner evil, maybe his sister Leia will. Luke savagely batters Vader with everything he has and cuts off one of his robotic hands. Palpatine is pleased, and says he wants Luke to finish him off so he can replace Vader as his malevolent enforcer. Luke refuses to end his father's life. His plan thwarted, the infuriated Emperor starts using the Force to electrocute Luke to death. Vader watches helplessly, but finally decides to redeem all his past sins by lifting Palpatine up and throwing him down a reactor shaft. Fatally wounding himself by doing so (but saving his son), Vader then asks Luke to remove his helmet so he can see him with his real eyes, if only for this one time. Vader says Luke was right about there being a bit of good in him, and then dies. Luke then puts his father's body in an imperial shuttle and flies off the new Death Star just as it explodes, since the rebel attack on its power core was a success. Back on Endor, Luke attends a party to celebrate the entire galaxy being freed from imperial tyranny. As he cremates Vader's corpse, he sees the ghosts of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and his now redeemed father Anakin watching over him. While I think this movie is still great because (obviously) it's Star Wars and also gets quite sad at the end, there are a few things fans like to harp on it for. For one thing, I thought it was pretty stupid how Leia manages to choke Jabba to death inside his sail barge full of his servants/associates and nobody tries to stop her. A more obvious weakpoint of this film is the introduction of Ewoks. Some people love them, but I personally couldn't stand watching the Empire's soldiers get turned into stooges trying to fight these furry things half their height. The ewoks use ridiculous traps more fitting of a faction such as the Vietcong rather than something out of Star Wars, and they literally show stormtroopers being subdued just by rocks and spears. At least it kind of highlights the fact that huge military industrial complexes can be defeated just by a few people determined to defend their land. As for the positives, there are too many to list. We finally get to see Luke become a Jedi while managing to keep his mind clear of hate; something his father never accomplished. After watching the prequel movies, it's sad when you realize that Anakin has basically been a slave his entire life. He was born one on tatooine, was a slave to the Jedi, and was a slave to Palpatine as Darth Vader. Seeing such an evil character like him turn good was deeply moving. Speaking of Vader, there is a somewhat annoying inconsistency only present in the last 30 or so seconds of the film. For some reason, George felt it necessary to replace the original actor playing Anakin's ghost (Sebastian Shaw). Now, it's Hayden Christensen. I know the logic is that they're trying to make Anakin look like the way he did before he became evil, but didn't he redeem himself by killing the Emperor? Aside from the various changes made in the re-releases of this movie, it is still my belief that Return of the Jedi is an enjoyable, moving, and fitting end to the original Star Wars saga.",

            "content": "This final entry in George Lucas's STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.The first third of the movie, where Luke and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, is a classic. Jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabba's court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster. It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where Luke discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks. Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that I've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. I don't totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. However, their leader, Wicket (played by Warrick Davis) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.By the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops, Lando and the Rebel Forces launching an attack against the Empire's all-new half-completed Death Star, and Luke's final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor. The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. Mark Hamill flexes his acting chops once again as Luke Skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured Jedi Knight makes for an unforgettable performance. Also, as iconic as James Earl Jones' voice as Darth Vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like Emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by Ian McDiarmid. The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. Of course, given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. The acting is classic STAR WARS fare; Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all mature and deepen into their roles, and Anthony Daniels provides more hilarious moments as C-3PO. Frank Oz's Yoda only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it. And yes, there's also John Williams' music.All told, while RETURN OF THE JEDI falters a little bit in the middle, the first and third acts deliver in style, making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.In 1997, George Lucas re-released the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored (and revamped) \"Special Editions\", which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements. Of the three, RETURN OF THE JEDI appears to have caused the most commotion with STAR WARS fans. Perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you're not so easily offended) \"Jedi Rocks\" musical number in Jabba's Palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film. However, I DID like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. This DVD version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on Naboo, where we hear what sounds like Jar Jar Binks screaming, \"Wesa free!\"), and, in what is probably the most controversial change, Hayden Christensen as the specter of Anakin Skywalker in the closing scenes. Probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. However, if you're watching the STAR WARS saga chronologically (and contemplating about it), chances are you may react a little differently. Nonetheless, it is an issue that fans have raised, so it's probably best to be warned beforehand.As nice as it would be to have Lucas release the original versions of these three classic films, he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the \"definitive\" editions of his classic trilogy, and, when viewing the STAR WARS movies altogether as one complete saga (as Lucas intended), it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. The original films will always be engraved in our memories, but these new incarnations are just as much fun, if one can give them a chance.",

The empire is defeated, Luke becomes a Jedi, Han and Leah get together, the emperor's plan back fires and Anakin proves that he is the chosen one.The force does prevail but not how the Jedi thought. Anakin's \"mistake\" is what makes him see the error of his ways when Luke is dying. Why? Because we see the world through our kids eyes. And Anakin is still there feeling empathy. If he didn't have kids he wouldn't have turned to the dark side. And if he didn't have kids he wouldn't have come back from the dark side. If he was able to express his love he wouldn't have had to hide his human nature and could have openly talked with friends and not turned to the dark side.Because Luke proves that love wins in the end. I wonder if Anakin's purpose wasn't just to kill the emperor but also to bring balance to the force by screwing up so the Jedi could go extinct so they could start fresh? Because they were going wrong as an order. I guess they always were by surpressing people's natural urges, as history has shown doesn't go so well.The three most innovative Jedi are the ones that break the rules: Qui-Gon, Anakin and Luke. Not to say that the Jedi are bad but they aren't doing things as well as they could, they are flawed. Their method created an opening for Anakin to fail, when in the end he was doing the right thing by falling in love.Luke doesn't listen to Yoda and Obi and goes to save his friends, which was the right thing to do. His love for his friends is the right choice. He delays his training but saving his friends does so much for the future. And he never wants to kill Vader, he couldn't and because his refusal to be an assassin and to trust that his father was still good he won. Because even if he killed Vader he wouldn't have killed the emperor and everything that he fought and suffered for would have been for nothing. Yoda and Obi are using Luke to kill Vader and don't want to tell him the truth. But the truth makes him do the right thing.It must be said that Mark Hamill did a great job in these movies. It kinda seems like he's not acting in 4 because he's so natural, but when you get to 6 you see how different he has become and that he was infact acting the whole time. He really transitions Luke very well and matures him nicely.I really love the Ewoks. They are the fiercest things in the Galaxy, only problem is that they're three feet tall. But that doesn't stop them. I really like how willing they are to help the rebels. A joke I read long ago that has always stuck with me is that they ate the Stormtroopers. Think about it there's helmets everywhere and they were going to eat Han and the others.The first half an hour is awesome because it's a little self contained story that is only about saving Han. Which of course you want to see. It's really a short on its own and a celebration of Star Wars really because no plot comes from it. We get to see our guys have an adventure of saving their friend. There's great monsters and action scenes.Jabba is great, so gross and evil. And such a work of art as well. So much work to get him alive, but it paid off because he's so real.The Emperor delivers in every way. You thought Vader was evil, no way, this guy is pure evil. And since 3 he has been living as his true self and his evilness is out in the open. I also love now that 3 told us that he has a lightsaber up his sleeve so during these scenes you know it's there.Just like with Revenge of the Sith there weren't really any innovations here, just perfection of what had been started with the first movie.The best change from the Special Edition for all 3 was the end song to this movie. The Ewok song was fine for an Ewok song but this new song really has such a reflective, end of the road, sad and happy feel to it. It feels like an ending, bitter sweet. It always pops into my head when something in my life is ending. It really says it all and nothing needs to be said because the music conveys the mood perfectly.A perfect end to the saga.

At the same time, the Galactic Empire is doing in secret, the construction of a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this station stays totally constructed, it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new Death Star,and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule.R2 and C3po are inside Jabba's palace to send a message from Luke to Jabba,where Lukes pretends to negotiate Han's life. He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept the negotiation,since he is using Han Solo as a piece of his palace's decoration.(Han still is frozen in carbonite) Lando is hidden as Jabba's guard and Chewbacca is also gave to Jabba by a reward hunter. When the same Hunter tries to save Han solo and makes him stay in human form again, we see that is actually princess Leia in a disguise. The problem is that Jabba discovers Leia's plan and takes her as his slave,while Han is thrown away in Chewbacca's cell.Luke comes as a Jedi knight to rescue his friends. At his first try to kill Jabba,he falls into Jabba's monster cell (Bantha),but easily kills it.

Luke,Han and Chewie has success in scape again, and even Boba Fett dies when Han accidentally throws him in to Sarlacc's mouth. Leia kills Jabba and goes after Han,Luke and Chewie as well c3po and R2. Everybody's safe again,Luke decides to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a Jedi,as well his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick, since he already has 900 years old, and before he dies, Yoda says to Luke that he does not need more training,but to really be a Jedi, he must fight with Vader again. He confirms to Luke that Vader is Luke's dad, and that there is another Skywalker besides Luke. In his last moments, Yoda asks to Luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side, and to Luke transmit his Jedi knowledge to other people. When Yoda dies,Obi wan's spirit shows up to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader, and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith. Luke stays worried about killing his own dad, and says that he feels that his father still has kindness. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia, and says the reasons why Luke and Leia were separated since babies. He gives his last advice to Luke saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war.At the same time, the Emperor says to Vader that he must give Luke to him when he shows up, since Luke is stronger than before, and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring Luke to the dark side.Now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series,when the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station, the '' Death Star 2'', Luke will confront Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Han and chewie needs to turn off the 'Death star 2' power field, with the help of the EWOKS. (little creatures who looks little bears)This is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all!",

            "content": "The Return of the Jedi was George Lucas's last Star Wars film for 16 years, until he followed it up with the disappointing prequel The Phantom Menace in 1999. At the time that I am writing this review, Episode II has come out and proved that George Lucas is still able to produce an action packed space adventure (although he also proves that he is relying far too much on computer generated effects), and we are eagerly awaiting the release of Episode III in 2005, the film which has more possibilities than any of the Star Wars films since the original in 1977. The Return of the Jedi is the film in which we are introduced to the hideous Jabba the Hutt for the first time, as well as a score of other repugnant creatures. When I first watched this film, the first thing that struck me was an enormous increase in the level of gruesomeness that is seen in the creatures in the film. In the first film, even the antagonist creatures were at least mildly pleasant, but now we see Jabba, we see Jabba's disgusting sidekick with the snake things growing out of his head and around his neck, that tooth-riddled pit in the ground, as well as scores of other sickening things. We also get to the first glimpses of the badly damaged Death Star, whose post-explosive appearance is probably even more famous as an image in film history than its original appearance.  The Death Star is the focus of much of the conflict in the film. The Rebellion is making an elaborate attempt to destroy the Death Star, a nearly impossible excursion that involves timing an attack perfectly so that star-fighters can make an internal attack on the Death Star at just the right moment that their rebel partners are on a nearby planet, shutting down the defense mechanism that the Death Star is deriving from it. Clearly, this is not going to be an easy thing to do, and the majority of the film presents the efforts to get all of the forces coordinated to pull this task off, with the ultimate climax occurring as the rebel attack coincides with the revelation that the Death Star is fully functional as a weapon despite massive damage (a little secret they have tactfully decided not to reveal), and that they are already aware of the impending attack and more than capable of squishing all of the attackers like a lot of space-bugs. \nGreat story, I think. And it's a good thing, too, because there were at least a few other things that I was less than impressed with about this particular installment in the Star Wars saga. The Ewoks, for example, just didn't strike me as something that belonged in a Star Wars film. I am more than willing to accept them, if for no other reason than the fact that they are now one of the more recognizable things from the old Star Wars films (although it seems like there are thousands of recognizable things from the old Star Wars films), but there were several battle scenes that failed to generate much excitement due to all of the cuddly little snuggle bears running around. Besides that, the Ewok costumes were some of the least impressive outfits in any Star Wars film to this day. You could almost see the seams along the sides, the faces were about as realistic as any stuffed animal, and the pads of the feet, which occasionally were in view, were just as toy-like. They were little more than cheap Halloween costumes.\nOn the other hand, the rest of the film is so entertaining that I am willing to forgive things like this. It's 1983, for crying out loud, so I'm not about to downgrade the movie for something like that, even though both of its predecessors had universally better costumes despite being older films. It's clear throughout the film that we are watching the conclusion of the conflict between the Imperial Forces and the Rebellion that we saw develop in the last two films, which is why it does not quite reach the same level of stupendous excitement and entertainment of them. There are a lot of fascinating characters and creatures introduced here, and some of the battles scenes in space far surpass anything in Star Wars or The Empire Strikes Back, but despite the fascinating story, there is just too much an element of conclusion and tying up loose ends for this movie to be as fresh and exhilarating. There is great concern in the last act of the movie with the metaphorical presentation of the dark side and the, well, the light side, I guess. Maybe the bright side? Yeah, the bright side, that sounds better. The dark side and the bright side. Luke is being held captive by Darth Vader and the Emperor and being forced to watch his friends careen helplessly into a battle, unaware that they have no chance of winning. As this happens, we are just itching to see Luke go for that light saber and strike someone down with it and do something heroic, but then the Emperor starts trying to convince him to do this. He encourages Luke to give in to his anger and officially become part of the dark side. It's easy to see how Vader was seduced by the dark side, if all it takes is the killing of someone that you bitterly hate because they are forcing you to watch the deaths of your friends. Throughout the entire Star Wars saga, one of the things that I always wondered about was how exactly Vader was seduced by the dark side, and in this scene I found myself seduced by it because I so badly wanted to see Luke do exactly what the Emperor was asking him to do. \nClearly, the story of The Return of the Jedi leaves very little to be desired, with the exciting battles that come from the struggle between the Rebels and the Empire, and with Luke's struggles against the dark side as well as his interaction with Vader as Vader lay dying in his arms (another heavily metaphorical representation of the dark and bright sides). And despite a few elements of the film that prevent it from really rising to the level of quality and pure entertainment that it could have risen to, this is a powerful installment in the Star Wars saga. Given the relatively cheesy end that we saw in this film, with all of our heroes partying and hugging at an Ewok party in the woods (and with Luke giving the stereotypical grin to the ghostly images of Obi Wan and Yoda and the image of his father before he became Darth Vader (?)), I am curious about the future of the Star Wars saga. I've heard rumors about the production of Episodes VII, VIII, and IX, which seem a little far-fetched at this point, but it also seems almost as far-fetched that old George would end one of the greatest film sagas of all time with the closing scene of The Return of the Jedi.",

From the start this film begins with action and drama as Skywalker returns to his old stomping grounds his home of Tatooine, but a special mission in plans that's the rescue of Han Solo from the slimy Jabba the Hutt. Princess Leia, and the rest of the gang are along side Luke for the journey that after the defeat of Jabba they land on the forest moon of Endor, it's here that Lucas introduced us to furry little creatures we loved that's the Ewoks! The Ewoks join up with the rebels to fight the empire, though Luke must handle his own business against Vader and the evil that is tempted upon him. The showdown between Luke and Vader is classic as it's over before the death of evil a final sad good bye is said, and Luke gets to see his father without the mask. The torch has finally been passed and the rebels are free and Luke the Jedi Knight rules superior. Really again a super film from Lucas with drama, and action and excitement from start to finish he picked a good way to end the saga. We will always remember George's creations, his characters, plots, and the musical scores of John Williams will never leave your mind, and final thanks to Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill who all were magnificent in all three legendary classics.",

Once free from Jabba, Han joins with the Rebels to prepare to launch an attack on an all new Death Star being produced.  Luke goes for further Jedi training with Yoda but is later captured by Vader himself. Battles rage in space but also on the moon of Endor as the Rebels try to prevent the Empire taking over the Galaxy.This should have been the best of the series \u0096 the Jedi striking back after getting a kicking in part 5.  Indeed the battles and plotting suggests that it could have been.  Certainly the final confrontation between Luke and Vader could have been even better than the end of part 5, however it just doesn't feel as good as it could have been.The focus is very much on Luke and how he has changed since his discovery of this father.  Now he is dressed all in black and seems more ruthless than before.  This is explored reasonably well but it isn't as dark as it should have been \u0096 I never really believed that Luke could go to the Dark Side. The rest of the story is spoilt by one thing \u0096 Muppets.  This was supposed to be the big climax of the `three' films, we get that but we also have lots of puppets.  The Ewoks are OK as characters but the whole film has far too many puppets in it to be good.  Coming off the back of a much darker empire, Jedi is like walking out of a dark place into the light \u0096 it's just too bright and cheerful.  It should have had layers.Hamill is good as Luke but I wanted more depth \u0096 that said was good here but not as good as in Empire.  If you watch his three films together then you see him change which makes you appreciate him more.  Ford has little to do \u0096 it's like we've seen his space cowboy act before.  Fisher is the same but has more to do.  Ian McDiarmid is good \u0096 but again I appreciate his character even more now that I've seen parts one and two.  Yoda is cool but after Empire his screen time seems cut down (mind you part 2 made up for that).  Darth Vader is interesting \u0096 it's a bit sad but how many other characters have been played by three people (at the same time \u0096 not at different ages).  Vader's body is Prowse, his voice is Jones and his face is Shaw.Overall this is good \u0096 simply because it's a Star Wars movie and has plenty of action and thrills.  The muppets and brighter mood stop it being as good as the two before but at least now the Phantom Menace has shown us what a bad Star Wars film is like, now we know that Jedi isn't the weak link in the series.",

            "content": "Despite the original Star Wars trilogy being considered one of the greatest trilogies of all time it's final instalment Return of The Jedi is only considered to be good and I have to say that not only do I think this movie is on par with the past two entries, I actually think this is better than them. A large part of why I love this movie so much is how satisfying it is, the entire trilogy has built up to the events in this film, so we're completely invested in the characters and situation, it all came together perfectly. All the characters in this film are different than they were in the last two films and if adds to there characters to see that there are still consequences to every action they take. I thought that The Emperor was a fantastic villain for this film as we truly realise just how powerful he is and it was interesting to see how he controlled Vader. The physiological and physical war that goes on between Luke and Darth Vader is done perfectly, now only is is incredibly intense but it's also very Eye opening to see a more personal fight for Vader and we understand just how much the emperor has taken from him. The final three way battle against the empire and the Death Star is done just right because we understand just how much the characters need to rely on each other to succeed, all the arcs feed into each other and I found it to be extremely well done. Now I wanted to address in this review some of the most common complaints with this film and why I disagree with them, for one I thought it was an interesting idea to bring in a second Death Star because it created a new sense of urgency as we know from the get go in this film, the power that it possesses and I thought the way they destroy it in this film was better executed than in the original. While most people were willing to understand that complaint, the Ewoks are extremely hated upon when talking about this film but I really liked the idea of them and found it somewhat inspiring that they went up against the empire. The most powerful scene in this film is that of Vader funeral it was an extremely personal scene and thought that ten silence of Luke staring at his fathers bodies was extremely heartfelt and was a satisfying conclusion to the arc they have built across the series. I really do think that this film was the best Star Wars films, it's got all the characters back in satisfying and well done ways, all the character arcs all come to a close nicely and the final scene of this film was just a perfect way to wrap up the trilogy and will always make this one of my favourite movies of all time and one of my favourite sequels of all time. 100%/A+",

When completed, it will spell certain doom for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the Rebels. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is a prisoner of crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) soon finds herself in the gangster's hands. Luke Skywalker, aided by C-3PO and R2-D2, makes his way into Jabba's palace, hoping to secure his friends' freedom. But the Hutt has no intention of doing so and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the Rebel fleet, which is massing for an attack against the new satellite battle station at Endor. Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is pressed into action to lead the Rebel fighter attack, while Han is put in charge of a group of soldiers to take out the shield generator protecting the Death Star. Luke, however, surrenders to Vader's soldiers on Endor, and is taken in front of Vader's boss - the Galactic Emperor - on the Death Star for final corruption to the Dark Side of the Force. The fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers ambushes the Rebels, cutting them off. Worse, the new Death Star begins turning its giant laser on the Rebel carriers. It appears that nothing will stop the Empire's triumph - unless things start to change quickly.I thought it was a great end to the Star Wars series.But in 1999, the story took itself back into the beginning with Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and ended with Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.So far, I'm finished with the Star Wars original trilogies, and there will be more reviews in the summer.Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi gets 10 stars.",

Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this movie in perspective. The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what Anakin Skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter considering the love he felt for Padm\u00e9 and the love she felt for her children. Actually while the new films (especially Episode II) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only. They make the old films seem even better.Mark Hamill does an exceptional job in this movie. He really brings the changes Luke has gone through seem real. In all fairness I believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you can feel that he has done Raiders and Blade Runner in between the two final chapters of Star Wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit. He adds more comedy (obviously inspired from Raiders) to the character which works brilliantly. In short Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable. Ian McDiarmid appears in this film and having seen Episode III I can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever. James Earl Jones still provides the voice for Vader and he is still very, very good.In terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than in either of the previous (two) movies but this was always Lucas' fort\u00e9 so that is really to be expected. The final battle over Endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise. It was also a nice touch that Lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax. The only thing I feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the Ewoks. These little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in. Besides I find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of Storm Troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery.All in all Return of the Jedi is a very good movie but the fact that Richard Marquand is a less accomplished director than Irvin Kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant. Also George Lucas' stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.8/10",

            "content": "As a child, I owned all of the original Star Wars trilogy on VHS, purchased when 'remastering' was all the rage and the iconic sci-fi saga found itself on the receiving end of a much-needed cleaning-up. This was, however, before George Lucas tampered with his already- near-perfect legacy, adding unneeded special effects and elongating certain scenes for seemingly no other reason to show how far CGI had come (although it now looks incredibly dated). Despite the perfection of episodes four and five, my go-to Star Wars movie on a boring Sunday afternoon was always Return of the Jedi, the third instalment now widely remembered as the poorest of the bunch. I don't quite know what it was about Jedi that always caused me to reach for it. It certainly wasn't the Ewoks, those cuddly fur-balls shoe-horned in to sell more merchandise, although they aren't as annoying or distracting as I remembered.Jedi is most certainly the least effective of Lucas' creation, but there's still plenty of charm and excitement to solidify the entry as, at the very least, a satisfying closure to the saga, despite Disney's welcome efforts to further explore the Star Wars universe. The Empire Strikes Back broke up its characters but managed to keep a firm grasp on the various story-threads. Jedi does the same again, but is less successful at holding all the action together. Nevertheless, the characters get to enjoy an early reunion at Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine, where the slug-like abomination hangs Han Solo (Harrison Ford), still frozen in his carbonite prison from the last movie. C- 3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) all arrive at various intervals as part of a rescue operation, as does Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the latter having completed his Jedi training and going about his business with a brooding confidence.A horrific car crash may have robbed Hamill of some of his boyish good-looks, but it did nothing to dampen his skills as an actor. Skywalker's newly-found intensity, which no doubt stems from his flourishing grasp on the Force and skill with a lightsaber, is matched by Hamill's execution. He stops by to see Yoda (Frank Oz), who confirms that Darth Vader is indeed his father and a fallen Jedi, and has a brief chat with the spirit of his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). Skywalker's thread is by far the most interesting, inevitably heading towards a showdown with his father and the puppet-master behind the Empire, the rasping Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). Although Vader's brutality has been turned down as he plays lap-dog to his boss, audiences back in 1983 must have been holding their breath as the Emperor tortures Luke in an attempt to turn him to the Dark Side, and Vader is clearly shown to be wrestling with his allegiance.The rest of the action fares less well, as Han Solo and Leia find themselves captured by the community of Ewoks who seem to want to eat them, while C-3PO bares a close resemblance to the God the little critters worship. Their aim is to take down a generator controlling the energy shield of a brand new Death Star - yes, they have somehow managed to nearly complete a bigger, meaner planet- killer in a remarkably short space of time. Lando and the remaining Rebel Alliance are forced to repeat the climax of A New Hope, and while it's certainly a spectacular battle, it can't help but feel like more of the same. Jedi is best remembered as a series of memorable moments than a truly great film. It's easy to forget the film's messy narrative and cynical desire to boost merchandise sales, especially as a child, but it's hard to forget Leia in a gold bikini, Jabba's grotesque rat-like pet, the high-speed chase through the forests of Endor, or the shockingly crap death of fan-favourite Boba Fett. Nowhere near the annoying child-pandering misfire some believe it to be, but also some way off the magnificence of its predecessors.",

Harrison Ford was betrayed by Billy Dee Williams to the Empire who turned him over to Jabba, but the others affect an escape helped by the selfsame Billy Dee who did not like being reduced to a hireling in what was his former planet.Mark Hamill as the budding Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker learns the true nature of his existence and of the temptation to go over to the dark side of the Force. The path of light might be rougher, but it does not carry the same burdens. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia finally chooses between Hamill and Harrison, although the script kind of makes the choice for her.George Lucas when he made additional films opted for the prequel showing how the situation came to be in the galaxy far away.

After \"Return of the Jedi,\" Lucas never really got back on track, and particularly with the recent \"Star Wars\" prequels it is apparent he has sold out and lost grasp of how to make a good film. The Eewoks aren't very far off from Jar-Jar Binks.That's not to say \"Return of the Jedi\" is a bad film -- in fact it's very good. But we all remember, \"May the force be with you\" from \"Star Wars,\" and \"I am your father!\" from \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" There's nothing particularly memorable here -- it is not one of the greatest films ever made, just a very satisfying (if occasionally goofy) conclusion to the trilogy. It is not as bad as \"The Matrix Revolutions,\" for sure.Han Solo (Harrison Ford), now cryogenically frozen by Jabba the Hutt, is being held captive. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) both try to rescue Han, to no avail, and Luke -- now a Jedi -- ends up being thrown into the pit of a dangerous beast, which he defeats to the surprise of Jabba. Jabba then decides to have all of them murdered, but Luke and co. make a daring escape with the help of all his pals -- C-3PO, R2-D2, Leia and Chewbacca -- and eventually end up on a faraway planet where they arrive under the car of the friendly Eewoks, who help them with their attack against The Empire's new and improved Death Star. Luke uncovers a startling secret about Leia, revisits the dying Yoda, and eventually comes face-to-face with Vader, where he is faced with a bit of a moral dilemma after the Emperor decides that Luke would be a worthy addition to their army.It's pointless divulging into the plot in-depth basically because everyone has already seen these movies. What can be discussed are the special effects, performances, and general plot of the film, as that is what most people will take from this film -- those looking for meaningful dialogue should look elsewhere. Released in 1983, six years after the original, special effects had evolved even more -- with a larger budget to expand upon director Richard Marquand tops off both prior films in terms of SF/X. There's an exciting chase sequence, lots of hyper-speed battles, space ship exteriors and \"lightsaber\" fights -- enough to wet the appetite of anyone looking for mere action.Unfortunately what \"Return of the Jedi\" lacks is originality -- \"Star Wars\" was unique when it came out, recycling old storytelling clich\u00e9s in a modern update; the sequel was very dark and impressive with arguably the best performances of all three films; the only thing to look for here is Luke's sudden evolution from Jedi trainee to Jedi master. Oh, and the final showdown, which is still impressive, even by today's efforts.All in all, \"Return of the Jedi\" is not on the same level as its predecessors but it is an exciting movie that manages to satisfyingly end the series on a high note. About those prequels...well, they're just unfortunate.",

A great story with Luke now being a full Jedi Knight and his last mission is to face Vader.The opening to this one on Tatooine is my favourite opening in a Star Wars movie its just incredible and Luke kick ass in the beginning with his Green Lightsaber the effects and the creatures look incredible especially Jabba he still to this day looks amazing.The battle of Endor is incredible and I for one don't mind the Ewoks I think there a great addition to Star Wars and I like the idea of something so small defeating this big empire.The space battle is great and has some wicked effects. I also really like the final scene with Yoda it's a great emotional moment.Palpatine is amazing in this one and his a great villain and the acting by Ian McDiarmid and he plays the role to perfection as always. I love the twist that it was all a trap by him to end the rebels once and for all.My favourite moment in this one is definitely the final fight between Vader and Luke it's my favourite Lightsaber fight in the whole of Star Wars I love Its full of emotion and I love the moment Luke dosent turn and wants to stay a Jedi its a brillaint character moment. And Vader turning good again to save Luke was amazing.Verdict 10/10 a Masterpiece and the final chapter in my favourite movie trilogy so many great moments and the Lightsaber fight in my opinion.",

They had previews for new characters on the back of the action figures boxes I'd get at Toys-R-Us and I'd eagerly wonder what the blacked out Ewok characters would look like. Must have really been something special! I even remember how they switched the name around as \"Revenge of the Jedi.\" This was just going to be THE movie of the summer, and waiting in line to get in while hearing the thunderous noise of the climactic battle as the audience of the screening just wrapping up applauded enthusiastically, I was just SO excited. When I saw it even as a kid I knew it was somewhat of a disappointment, watching it now as an adult...Uhgg! Now I see how Lucas went so wrong with the abomination of the prequels, all the threads started to unravel with this Turkey. (Though Return of the Jedi is still much superior to those aforementioned prequels which had a plot harder to follow than Dune.) First of all are notoriously unbearable Ewoks, even as a kid I HATED them. No adult could possibly find anything watchable about the whole Ewok sequence on Endor. The Emperor is ridiculously \"comic book\" evil, tyrants usually have charisma and are more like gangsters than lunatics. The choice to add another family revelation by making Leah Luke's sister is stupid and ruins the relationship from the first two movies. The original Cantina scene with the various aliens was creative, here Lucas has gone overboard with a new bizarre rubber masked actor or puppet cropping up every minute. In some respects this whole thing is nothing more than a commercial to sell action figures to eight year olds. And the Climax: Another Deathstar? Lucas, you already did that before, but considering the fecal ideas he spewed out in the prequels, perhaps a rehashing of the end of the first movie was the best we could hope for. After all, to sum up the cinematic ideas going through Lucas' head during this period: Howard the Duck. Don't even get me started on the vandalism Lucas did to the Original Trilogy with the CGI additions to the new copys of the Star Wars movies for sale. The original 1977 print is a piece of American History, to alter the imagery that swept the nation that summer is akin to someone painting over the Mona Lisa.Still Return of the Jedi it did have it's moments. The Jabba the Hut character is ubiquitously reknown and to this day everyone knows what your talking about if you refer to any gluttonous tard as \"Jabba the Hut.\" The chase scene through the Redwoods is also quite memorable although the excitement came to a quick end with the ridiculously infantile Ewok scenes beginning moments later. The final showdown between Luke and Vader was also a glimpse of what this movie could have been had the same people who worked on The Empire Strikes Back had control over this thing. On the whole, a disappointing, childish end to the first two movies.",

            "content": "As tends to be the case with a lot of movies for me, I disagree about the majority opinion of \"Return of the Jedi\". This movie tends to be looked down on as the worst of the original trilogy of Star Wars films. I find it to be just the opposite. This is my favorite movie of the franchise. IMDb ranks \"The Empire Strikes Back\" above \"A New Hope\", with \"Jedi\" coming in a distant third. I'd go in reverse order, arguing \"Jedi\" and \"Hope\" are better than \"Empire\", which to me just feels like an interlude between the two main films in the series.That little bit of polemics aside, what I love about this film is that unlike \"A New Hope\", \"Jedi\" has a lot going on--the story is comparatively complex and fast paced. To me it stands out as the funnest of the three films, and also the best storyline.But the real thing to love about this movie is the climax--Luke's confrontation with both Darth Vader and the Emperor. That showdown brings the entire six movies into harmony--and dare I say, the Force finally finds the balance that the prophecy foretold of (just through Luke rather than through Anakin--although perhaps Anakin did bring the balance...you could have quite the nerdy discussion about that).I also like the spaceship battle scene in this movie. It's arguably the best of the original trilogy. And the Ewoks! I know they get criticized, but I think they're cool.All that said, my scores for the first five Star Wars movies (having watched them all now, in preparation for \"The Force Awakens) are: 7, 8, 9, 10, and 7. And, finally, for \"Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\", I give a perfect 10. It and \"A New Hope\" are the best. I like them all (although, honestly, seeing those scores, I think I'd even put \"Phantom Menace\" above \"Empire\"), but \"Return of the Jedi\" takes the cake. Bravo, Mr. Lucas. Bravo.",

Ever since the first time I saw it, it's depth, intensity, special effects, and moving story have overwhelmed me. The film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years. Filled with powerful action, as the climax of the original trilogy, George Lucas gives us a rousing finish of the \"Star Wars\" saga in \"Jedi\".Film Summary (Contains Spoilers For Those Who Have Not Seen It)After \"The Empire Strikes Back\" left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in \"Return Of The Jedi\". Darth Vader, in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted Death Star to oversee it's construction. The Emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the Rebel Alliance and bring young Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side. Luke, Lando, Leia, Chewie, and the droids all travel to Tatooine to rescue the frozen Han Solo from the crime Lord; Jabba The Hutt. After Han has been rescued, and Jabba defeated, Luke returns to Dagobah to find a dying Yoda where he learns the awful truth; Darth Vader is in fact his father. The rebel heroes regroup with the Rebel Fleet. Now joined by other species and races including the Mon Calamari the Rebels must make a all-or-nothing plan of attack to destroy the Death Star before it is completed. While Lando heads the space attack in the Millennium Falcon, the Rebel heroes must disable the Death Star's shield generator on the Forest Moon Of Endor. It is here that the Rebels happen upon the furry, but mighty Ewoks. During the the two part intense battle, a third battle must take place as Luke willingly delivers himself to Vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the Dark Side. In emotionally charged sequences Luke must face his father as the Emperor lures out his dark emotions. As young Skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of Palpatine, Vader turns on his wicked master to save his son's life. Filled with a deep timeless story of good vs. evil, \"Return Of The Jedi\" is a spectacular, emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us.",

He wasn't menacing, merely a second hand fiddle to the Emperor who was by far more sinister. His age really shows when he battles with an also-aged looking Luke! I actually winced when he deliberately threw himself down so Luke could really give his old man a hiding. Darth looked like he'd put on a few pounds and was too tired to put up a good fight! Maybe he needed to do a few aerobics classes!The cast seemed bored with their roles. Dialogue was hokey. Felt like I was watching a typical Disney flick with typical Disney dialogue. Again, much cringing as the large cast simply 'goes through the motions'.Cliches abound.EWOKS!!!!! Amongst the worst movie creatures I have seen: but not quite as bad as Jar Jar Binks. How could these ridiculous furry toys wipe out a highly advanced Imperial navy that employs walking tanks, flying bikes and space stations that blow up planets - with a few stones, wooden clubs and slings????It was dumbed down for the enjoyment of the little kids in the audience. The addition of cuddly cutesy pooh bears was obviously for the entertainment of toddlers. Mr Lucas aimed this flick primarily at the youngest movie-goers, to the detriment of older audiences (those over the age of 8).The franchise has grown woefully tired. Mr Lucas intended the awful Ewoks as torture devices to be used by kids to force their parents into buying everything Ewok for them!CONCLUSION? Well, it WAS better than Phantom Menace....",

            "content": "This film is to my mind the weakest film in the original Star Wars trilogy, for a variety of reasons. However it emerges at the end of the day a winner, despite all its flaws. It's still a very good film, even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments.One problem here is the look of the film, which isn't very consistent with the other 2 films. I put a lot of that down to the departure of producer Gary Kurtz. The first 2 films have that dirty, lived-in look with all the technology and so forth. In \"Jedi\" on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned. This makes for a much less textured film. Also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy. At this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself.Another aspect is its lack of originality. Where \"Star Wars\" created a whole new experience in cinema and \"Empire\" brought us to alien worlds of swamps, ice, and clouds, \"Jedi\" lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film. First we are back on the desert planet Tatooine, and then we are watching them face ANOTHER death star (maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new... but you'd think Lucas or Kasdan could). Also we have these ewoks, who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears, in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of \"Star Wars\" if they hadn't run out of cash. It just feels like lazy construction.The most unfortunate aspect of \"Jedi\" for me is the weak handling of the Han Solo character. Whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time, trading one liners with the droids. Instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame pretense that Han is still convinced Leia loves Luke -- as if the conclusion of \"Empire\" where she confessed her love of him had never happened. The whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the Solo character was not part of this film's central story after his rescue. Ford, for his part, looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances. This is more like a 1990s Ford performance, bored and looking \"above\" the film itself. Fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes. Lando, an interesting character introduced in \"Empire\", here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle. Only Hamill, given an interesting development in the Luke character, is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character. Probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work. And to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters. Really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package. Ian McDiarmid does excellent work as well as the Emperor. The film would sink if he had been too far over the top (as he was at times in the new films).Visually and in terms of effects work, other than the \"clean\" look of everything it's hard to find fault. Jabba is a very effective animatronic character, one of the most elaborate ever constructed. The space battles towards the end are very impressive.Ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears. But on its own, it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and IMHO far superior to any of Lucas' later productions.",

That's not to say there are not fans who prefer it of the original trilogy, because there are many, and like minded fans of George Lucas' space saga shouldn't have a problem with that.However, it is the weakest of the three. The characters we have come to love, and to be a part of their universe, are performed with gusto - but they are mostly thinly written, reduced to playing second fiddle to special effects, while the dark heart has been replaced with - well - smokey hokey (furry teddy bears with sticks and stones, I ask you). Then there's the lack of sexual tension so evident in the previous two films. Oh we love Han and Leia because that's love! But one can't help missing the sparks that was once between them - and Luke of course, hmm...Yet for all that, of the irks and complaints, Return of the Jedi is still a thrilling film, the budget up on the screen to entertain the children and the adults with the child within. Characters and creatures wander into this wonderful world for super impact. The Emperor, Jabba the scene stealer, Rancor and Sarlaac, while the speeder bike chase, further lightsaber shenanigans and the space battle ensure the action is never far away - even if one can be a little underwhelmed by the big finale not being all it can be.Ultimately it was not without faults, but still it was one hell of a conclusion to a genre defining (then) trilogy. 8/10",

While I prefer the adult-oriented space science-fiction of Star Trek, I can't deny that the space fantasy of Star Wars always grants you an entertaining couple hours.This one features lots of sci-fi action, cartoonish characters, great sets, Carrie Fisher at her fittest in an alluring costume, space ships, alien bogs and awesome forest sets (shot in the Redwoods of Northern Cal). Ford and Williams are at their charismatic best. Even the more obscure Hamill shines as the boyish hero and the Darth Vader story arc is notable. Then there's RD-D2, C-3PO and Chewbacca.The film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes.GRADE: B",

The final consists of three major battle sequences: Luke confronting Vader and the Fall of the Evil Emperor, the defeating of the Second Death Star and the Battle of Endor all of which are filmed superbly and remain memorable.The growth of the characters, especially Leia and Luke, is depicted smoothly. Fisher's Leia is more sexual and mature. There's a motherly side to her as well. Hamill's Luke is no longer the boy he was in 'Star Wars'. He's ready to lead an army and battle evil. Han too is more responsible here.The cast is great. Fisher is much sexier in this movie (for obvious reasons) and she's charming all the way. Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill are fantastic as usual. David Prowse and James Earl Jones (with his strong voice) are stupendous as Darth Vader. Frank Oz, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, Kenny Baker and the actors playing the Iwoks provide fine support.Overall, for me, this is perhaps the most memorable of what I would call one of my all-time favourite trilogies. I'm a tad disappointed that it's finished but now that I have the boxset, I'll be revisiting it again and not twenty years later.",

For the most part, it's done well. It's kind of shocking to see just how negatively this and the second in the series were received when they came out, and how much their reputations have improved.

            "content": "`Star Wars' ended with Luke Skywalker's assault on the Death Star.  We followed Luke and Luke alone.  `The Empire Strikes Back' split the action at the end into two streams: we saw Leia and Han fighting for their freedom, and Luke Skywalker confronting Vader.  `Return of the Jedi' split things three ways: Endor, Death Star, rebel fleet.  And what do you know, `The Phantom Menace' divides the final action into FOUR streams.  If this trend continues things will start to get silly.  They already have.It's tempting to view `Return of the Jedi' as a sour omen of things to come. Lucas hired Richard `\"whatever you say, George\"' Marquand to direct his third Star Wars movie, which accounts for the general sluggishness.  He threw in pointlessly cuddly Ewoks.  Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher abandon the more adult romance of the previous film in order to play unconvincing second fiddles to all these furry things.  While John Williams's score retains its power, his source music is pretty weak.  Compared to the first two movies the dialogue is bland.  (It would get much blander come 1999.)  The story is an unimaginative re-hash of earlier work, except for Lucas's idea that bigger is better.  If the rebels have to do THREE things at once to travel INSIDE the EVEN BIGGER, DEADLIER Death Star with MORE SHIPS THAN EVER BEFORE in order to achieve an EVEN GREATER victory, it will surely make things more exciting - right?  Whatever you say, George.Special effects are particularly disappointing.  They're actually weaker than in the first two movies, with unbelievable - and I mean, literally unbelievable - muppets strewn all over the landscape.  (The blue vinyl elephant thing in Jabba's court gets my vote for most ridiculous alien.) Oddly enough the digital adjustments of 1997 only made matters worse.  The computer-generated pop singer Lucas created looks every bit as fake as that stupid animal with the big lips it replaced - it merely looks fake in a different way; and, furthermore, the presence of the computer creatures makes the puppets look more fake than they would otherwise look, and vice versa.  Perhaps it doesn't matter very much.  The special effects, creature effects, costumes AND art direction, had all deteriorated, with or without digital vandalism.Yet despite all this the release of `The Phantom Menace' makes `Return of the Jedi' look better than ever.  The chief difference between the two is that the latter, unlike the former, has a reason for being made in the first place.  The story begun in the first two movies needed a conclusion.  It DIDN'T need a prologue.  If the conclusion stumbles a bit, well, we must take the rough with the smooth: obviously the story had to end SOME way.  In any event, `Return of the Jedi' isn't a bad movie.  It coasts on the energy of the early movies, but it gets where it's going.  If you've just watched the earlier films this one still brings a lump to the throat.  Yes, it could have been much better.  Be thankful it wasn't worse.",

But I said I'd review everything that I watched, and here we are. I do have a couple of observations that hadn't hit me before.Though a second Death Star is nearing completion, and the war against the Empire is in full swing, several high-ranking figures in the Rebellion, and literally the only known Jedi left in the universe, risk their lives on a dangerous mission to rescue one decent pilot. Mon Mothma (Caroline Blakiston) must have been pulling her hair out!I do, of course, love \"Return of the Jedi\" another absolute classic of the original trilogy. I accept it's not as cool as \"Empire\" or groundbreaking as \"Hope\" and it's reusing the plot of the first film (at least this is the last time we'll see a planets size gun though... right?... right?).This is, I think, the first time I've seen the new ending and allow me to say \"booooooooo\". Changing Anakin to Hayden Christiansen is fine, even if it doesn't make sense as all other force ghosts look like they did when the died. I don't even mind the universe wide celebration, even though it doesn't really make sense as they'll be years spent battling the remnants of the Empire to come. The changing of the celebration music though is jarringly horrible though and I missed the nubnub song terribly.I've also never noticed before how essentially the film is just two set pieces. One, Jabba's palace, then almost immediately afterwards we see the plan for Endor and off they pop. Luke has a little detour but mostly it crashes on at quite a pace and that's before the expert triple finale of the battle between Luke and Vader, the space battle and the destruction of the deflector shields.I don't really have anything new to add but it's one film from my past that doesn't disappoint at a rewatch.",

It's just not quite as brilliant as its predecessors.Han Solo, trapped in carbonite, has been delivered to the palace of Jabba the Hutt (by bounty hunter Boba Fett), where he is displayed as a trophy by the huge slug-like space criminal. However, Han's rebel pals successfully carry out a daring rescue mission and, with the gang reunited, an attack is launched on the Empire's new improved Death Star, which is nearing completion.Luke's somewhat strained relationship with his old man is explored further, and it is also revealed that another member of the Skywalker family exists (providing the bad guys with an additional potential convert to the dark side of The Force).Return of the Jedi may not be perfect\u0097the overly-cutesy Ewoks who aid the rebels are hated by many viewers, whilst the final attack scene is really nothing more than a rehash of Episode IV's assault on the original Death Star\u0097but it is still a damn sight better than the abominations that are the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. The visual effects are superbly executed, the action sequences genuinely exciting (in particular, the speeder bike chase gets the old neck hairs standing on end) and the whole movie looks great. If you can overlook the occasional silly 'comedy' moment and the odd lapse of logic (how did those Ewoks get those elaborate traps set up so quickly?), you'll have a blast!Just make sure not to watch the 1997 Special Edition, which saw Lucas add several nasty GGI 'improvements', including a terrible new musical number set in Jabba's palace, a poorly realised Sarlacc monster, some naff celebration scenes, and the iffy inclusion of Hayden Christensen as Anakin's 'ghost'.",

            "content": "Return of the Jedi is one of my favorite Star Wars movies and one of my favorite movies of all time. And while I do not think it is a masterpiece in cinema like episodes 4 and 5, I actually do enjoy it more than episode 5. I feel like this film is paced better than Empire and I find it to be a much easier film to just turn on and enjoy.The practical effects are one of my favorite things about Star Wars and this film has some of the best the franchise has to offer. Jabba the Hutt looks so cool as well as the Ewoks, Rancor, and all of the other creatures throughout the film. I really love the Rancor scene with Luke I feel like the stop motion holds up and the scene itself is intense and fun to watch. It even gets emotional when the trainer starts crying. I love that. There is a scene where the effects don't hold up well and that's when they are traveling to the Sarlacc pit. Those shots really don't look too good especially compared to the rest of the film and the previous films.I have never liked the way they take out Boba Fett but now that we have the show it's cool. But, they totally did his character dirty. Also, when Yoda dies it happens pretty quickly and unexpectedly. It is a great scene in the movie but it does come quickly almost rushed. Also, Han and Lando are just cool again even though Lando did betray him. Could have had an emotional arc between them but it just glosses over it really.I am actually a fan of the Ewoks and Endor. A lot of people don't like this and think this is where the movie stalls but I love it. The Ewoks are cute and funny and I love the style and look of Endor.One of my favorite scenes in Endor is the scene with Vader and Luke where Luke tries to get into Vader's head. It is the first time we see the other side of Vader barely peering out. This leads to one of the best scenes in the movie which is where the Emperor is trying to make Luke upset and there is the shot of the lightsabers crossed with the Emperor in the background. The fight between Luke and Vader juxtaposed with the Endor battle and the ships in space is one of the best final acts in Star Wars. The fight with Vader is dark, tense, and emotional and you can feel the stakes. The electricity from the Emperor is terrifying and Anakin finally fulfilling the prophecy was really well done. It's cinematic poetry. And I love how Luke was the only one at Vader's funeral.Overall, I think Return of the Jedi is an amazing movie. Although, it does have its flaws and it is lower in terms of quality in comparison to episodes 4 and 5. But, I love this movie for how simple it is. There are only three really big events that happen in the movie. Jabbas, Endor, and the Death Star and the film feels easy to watch and enjoy. There are certainly moments where the movie decides to be lighthearted and not take itself seriously instead of taking the opportunity to be emotional and serious. But, there are moments in the film that are very emotional. The music again is phenomenal and this is still one of my favorite movies of all time. I love Star Wars and I believe that it is one of the greatest franchises ever created and contains some of the best films ever made.",

After watching this installment just recently, however, it become very clear to me that \"Return of the Jedi\" needs to be in that sixth slot due to the fact that it provides such a proper ending to the saga.For a basic plot summary, \"Jedi\" focuses on two primary plots: the final \"all in\" battle between the Rebels and the Empire, and the epic confrontation between father (Darth Vader) and son (Luke Skywalker).To be sure, there are some things that this movie struggles at: the Ewok characters are an odd choice, the Rebel battle is utterly predictable, and none of the auxiliary characters get much development. However, the Vader/Luke/Emperor scenes are so emotionally gripping and intense that they more than make up for any lag elsewhere. I consider those scenes to be the best of the entire saga (and that includes the incredible ending of \"Revenge of the Sith\"). You will be cheering, crying, thinking, and remembering all in the span of minutes.Thus, I firmly believe that \"Return of the Jedi\" is the film that definitively ends the epic saga. Everything comes together in an emotionally gripping finale that closes out perhaps the most incredible film series ever created. George Lucas makes a few questionable moves here and there, but what he does right far outdoes anything else.",

            "content": "For some reason I, out of all the Star Wars movies, always enjoy watching \"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\". Perhaps its because of the humor, the action and battle sequences, or the great new characters introduced in the movie, or the fact that everything ties up brilliantly at the ending, or maybe its due to the bright atmosphere of Endor. The real reason is possibly a combination of all those elements, plus some more.\"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\" is a breathtaking action packed and fast paced science-fiction adventure movie. The movie never has a slow or dull moment. Still it also knows how to emote at the right moments. This is necessary because the story of the movie is quite emotional on its own. It's about the redemption of Darth Vader, the temptation of Luke to the Dark Side and about the downfall of the Empire and the Emperor. This are some heavy subjects which are told brilliantly and without ever making the movie go over-the-top.Still perhaps the biggest power of the movie are in its character. The three main heroes, Luke, Leia and Han all get their stuff to do again for the last time. Their characters are so incredibly strong, well written and portrayed by its actors, that all of them have become classics over the years. And not just they, many characters from the Star Wars universe has grown into well known movie characters. I think this says something about the brilliance of the whole Star Wars saga and how it is written and brought to the screen with lots of passion and talent involved, behind and in front of the camera. This movie also introduces some new well known characters, such as Jabba The Hutt, The Emperor (OK he also was in \"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\" but this time he is fully correctly introduced and used in the movie.), the Ewoks and many more memorable characters.Out of all the Star Wars movie this one is quite possibly the most spectacular, even though \"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones\" comes close. It has many action sequences and the end battle is memorable as well as impressive. It's a three way-battle, where we have Han, Leia, Chewie, 3PO, R2 and the Ewoks fighting the Imperial troops on the forest moon of Endor, we have the Rebel Alliance in space battling the Empire and the Death Star II and we have Luke fighting on the Death Star II against Darth Vader. All three battles are just as important and are given just as many screen time. It makes the final battle sequences something unforgettable and totally awesome to watch. Especially the space battle is without doubt the most spectacular, tense and adrenaline pumping space battle out of movie history. Yes, even after \"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\".The special effects for especially the battle sequences look better as ever before. But it are not just the spaceships that are made to look great. Also the sail barge, the Rancor, the battle for Endor with its AT-ST's..it all looks incredibly spectacular and convincing. So are the costumes and make-up. We get to see some crazy looking but oh so cool new characters this time.The whole totally imaginative world, characters and weapons is conceived brilliantly in the movie. Perhaps even better than in any other Star Wars movie. Most credit for this really has to go to George Lucas for creating and realizing all of it. Also an amazing amount of credit has to go to composer John Williams, who helps to make the imaginative world look even more convincing and likable and giving every sequence and character its own feeling and atmosphere through the music.Spectacular, humor filled, imaginative, action packed,...unforgettable.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The story doesn't flow as smoothly, the ending climax isn't as exciting as the two previous ones (we have to blow the Death Star again?), the characters are not as good as they used to be and the new stuff, which there is still a lot of, to the film's credit, is not as good as in the previous one. In this film we see for the first time the signs and phenomena that would come to haunt us in the prequel trilogy.To go over a few of the highlights, we have the ewoks. Now, apparently they were supposed to be wookies, which would have been amazing. Chewbacca is a fan favourite, and we would have gotten to see his people, his culture, more laser crossbows, all that good stuff. Instead we have the elite troops of the Galactic Empire being beaten back by an army of teddy bears. I'm not the only one seeing the problem here, right?Plus, the characters. Luke, Han and Vader are still very good and especially Vader has some his best moments in this film, especially near the end. But Leia, for example, has been relocated to a complete support role, to the point that she really has no point in being in this film. She's a far cry from the nail hard, snarky, blaster-toting space princess she was in the first film. Not quite on the Padm\u00e9-level of chickification, but heading in the same direction. Ian McDiarmid also has his screen debut as the Emperor in this film, and while he is amazing and will pretty much carry the prequel films alone with his charisma, here his over the topness is a bit unsettling because you're already wary and looking for flaws because of the ewoks.Then again, the effects are still amazing, the battle scenes are exciting, the final confrontation with Luke, Vader and the Emperor is one of cinema's finest for a reason, the space battle of Endor is a good one and the story is by no means bad one. It just isn't as good as the two previous ones, which are two of the best adventure stories ever put on film. So go ahead and see the film if you've liked the trilogy so far. It's not as good, if you ask me, but it's still a fitting conclusion to the saga.",

The creativity of the first Star Wars made it a great movie, and the shocking twist in Empire made it quite possibly the greatest sequel ever. Yet this incredible scenario presented at the end of Empire was wasted in a movie full of rehash. First of all, could Lucas really come up with nothing better than a SECOND Death Star??! And just like the first one, the movie ended in an all out assault on it. Luke and Vader fought with light sabers (again!). Not to mention, in a desperate attempt to recapture the emotion created in the audience after Vader said his famous \"I AM YOUR FATHER\", Lucas made Leia turn out to be Luke's long-lost sister. Give me a break! A little competition between Han and Luke might show some semblance of conflict among the good guys. Just because it's sci-fi doesn't mean it can't be somewhat realistic in character presentation. Vader's unmasking was disappointing. Instead of Lon Chaney unmasked as the phantom, we got Uncle Fester with acne. Carrie Fischer can't act worth $#\\&*! Although I could go on and on, I'll give just one final reason. Three words: Ewoks! Ewoks! Ewoks! I hate those furry little muppet wannabes. They were added for one reason and one reason only, so Lucas could line his pockets by making Ewok stuffed animals, talking Ewok toys, Ewok lunchboxes, and even an Ewok TV show!

The acting is slightly better this time around, but the story is the major factor in its downfall.As aforementioned, the acting is much better than A New Hope, but only under-par to The Empire Strikes Back. The moments between Luke and Leia are nicely done, and Harrison Ford steals the show whenever he reappears.The music by John Williams is also sub-par compared to the first two. Not nearly as emotional as The Empire Strikes Back, nor new in themes, the score for The Return of the Jedi is a real miss.As always, the special effects are grand, though lackluster from the re-releases. Jabba is cool, and the various set designs are as well. The speeder-bike chase through the jungle is probably one of the best scenes in the franchise.The screenplay is the ultimate part in this film's disappointment. The character development, while fully realized, is very dull upon completion. To fans, Darth Vader's appearance under the mask will be a disappointment (it wasn't to me). The inclusion of Ewoks, while a nice idea, comes off as a foreshadowing factor for what will become The Phantom Menace. The action is poorly done, making the pace of the film suffer greatly.Overall, while an immense series, the final conclusion of the Star Wars saga is a minor letdown due to a lack in an exciting story. Some of the revelations are disappointing, and the action is less than engaging. The characters are in dull scenes, though fully developed as characters.

Except we never really understand why because we never really understand why a supposedly good man (as Luke describes him) would support the emperor to start with.Conversely, we can't really respect Obi-Wan and Yoda. They are essentially setting this kid up to kill his father.Oh, yeah, and Ewoks. Did we really need the Ewoks? I mean, they were like little cannibalistic teddy bears? Were they serving Imperial Stormtroopers at that party at the end?In many ways, I think the Star Wars universe has deep philosophical implications that are hinted at and never explored. Maybe because unlike Star Trek, the thing was always too busy selling action figures.",

            "content": "If you watch all three of the original Star Wars films, by the time you reach the end of Star Wars: Return of The Jedi your jaw will be on the floor and you will be forever a fan of the Star Wars universe. Return of the Jedi is the most brilliant of the original three films. It is mind blowing and the best story, battles, creatures and more!! It also ironically is the film that probably has the most memorable and pop culturally significant moments. Right from the beginning you have the world of Tattooine and Jabba The Hut and eventually Princess Leia's infamous gold slave bra and outfit. The object of every teenage boys fantasy in the eighties. Yoda's touching death and Luke's full circle training as a Jedi. The intense and special effect driven escape from Jabba The Hut with Han Solo and the incredible final showdown between Luke and his father Darth Vader while an incredible battle rages on Endor with the adorably creepy Ewoks. All of this is packed into the third installment and it is truly a spectacle to see. Considering the film picks up exactly where Empire Strikes Back ends you really need to watch all three films but this one installment makes the entire original series worth while. Return of the Jedi is by far the best!!The entire original cast returns as well as the new characters picked up from Empire Strikes back. I would love to go into detail of the entire cast but I can only break it down slightly. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are still brilliant feisty heroes and their romance comes to full fruition. Mark Hamill definitely gets the biggest character arc as he becomes full on hero from his original rather naive young Skywalker in the first film. While Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew return to their infamous sidekick roles they don't change much from the previous films but there is nothing wrong with that by any means. They are great characters and fun to watch and there is no reason to change them. David Prowse and James Earl Jones reprise the best villain in movie history as Darth Vader who has also come full circle in his character and the final battle between him and Luke with the Emperor goading them on is just awesome...worth watching just on it's own.As good as the original cast is returning in this film the true brilliance of it is the masterful special effects. Jabba The Hut and his entire world around him, the Ewoks and their world and the incredible battles that happen, can all be mostly attributed to the brilliant creations of George Lucas and director Richard Marquand. Marquand actually appears to be a mostly new director but he handles this project like a complete pro and probably set him for life. However you feel about the Star Wars Universe you can't help but respect the original films and how they progressively got better. Return of The Jedi stands alone as being an absolutely brilliant film in story, characters and special effects. One of my favorite films hands down. 10/10",

Speaking of Leia, there is a shocking revelation in this film that will floor you (I won't go and spoil it for the 6 remaining people in the world who haven't seen it yet). There is also a spectacular equipoise of the poignant and the absurd in this film. It has more poetry and humanity than all S.W. movies before or after it. I laud all involved.

Mark Hamill is Luke once more and he looks bad ass in the all black Jedi outfit. Especially with the new green light saber, yes!!!! Chewbacca even gets a new hairdo, which I prefer over the 'greased' back look. But now let's get serious. The opening scene on Tatooine is great to say the least and Jabba's palace is excellent. When Luke enters it gets only better, the dark and mysterious entrance being great. Now a true Jedi, Skywalker has no need for a blaster and simply uses the force to silence his foes....PERFECT!!! The Rancor was a nice monster but the next scene is even better at the pit of 'Sarlac' where Luke nearly single handily defeats Jabba and co. The action here was great, Lando (Billy Dee Williams) having a bigger role in this film and I like his performance. Boba Fett seems to die, but if you're a fan ( a FAN- FAN) you know this isn't so.Any who, Luke visits Yoda on Dagobah for the last time and it is a sad moment. We learn Liea is actually Luke's sister so in the end it's a good thing they didn't get together (lol). Would've been kind of awkward if they had. Apparently the Empire has a new Death Star under construction and the Rebel Alliance mobilizes immediately to try and take it down before its completion. It is here my opinions jumble a bit...The Barc Speeder sequences are just incredible, my second favorite action scene in the film. The SFX here were simply amazing. Sigh, then the Ewoks arrive.. The admittedly cute little teddy bears totally backlash on the film's darker story. They somehow not only stand a chance but actually defeat the Imperial forces with minimal casualties, despite using rocks and trip wires! The tone is nearly ruined here thanks to the annoying Ewoks. At the same time, we have THE GREATEST LIGHT SABER DUEL EVER going on!!!!! Luke finally gives into his rage and attacks the Emperor, only to have to confront his father, Vader. This leads to one of the greatest duels in Star Wars history! It's emotional and cleverly choreographed and the music by John Williams is probably the darkest and one of his best pieces EVER!!!! Luke defeats Vader in a fit of rage, an excellent performance no doubt and the music continues to be no less than stunning. Darth Sidious, aka the Emperor, now prepares to kill Luke for his \"lack of vision\" (my favorite quote of his) and the all the emotional turmoil finally ends as Darth Vader himself destroys his Master. We see his sacrifice and now realize he is no longer Darth Vader but once more Anakin Skywalker, and I just loved that part of the story. The music really embraced this moment and it all seems to be one of the greatest movie moments ever, until we see the Ewoks celebrating...damn!!! In conclusion, Episode VI is still emotionally powerful, has great action and compelling music, but the Ewoks still take a star off. 9 out of 10, not so bad.",

I found myself bored in this movie more than the two predecessors.All problems aside, the character growth by the trio, with Luke in particular, is masterclass. Watching him grow from a whiney boy on Tatooine to a full blown Jedi Knight is remarkable. His force sensitivity is intriguing to observe, though I would have liked to explore Leia's relationship with the force a bit more.The finale is strong, unfortunately everything leading up to the third act climax is a little weak.Additional Note: I love the scene with Leia and Han on the bridge.

The movie runs along two storylines: the darker Luke storyline of him becoming a Jedi and confronting his father, and the lighter storyline of Han and Leia continuing to be in love and work with the Ewok. The latter storyline was cute, but utterly uneventful. Nothing new happens with Han or Leia, and the Ewoks are given far too much screentime for their one-dimensionality as just cute and somewhat strong things, so that storyline ended up being rather boring. The Luke one definitely held more tension - the late scenes with him, Vader, and Palpatine were exciting and built well to the climax. Unfortunately, that climax was quite a disappointment, for several reasons. First, unlike the previous one, we get little in the way of Luke's character development and have little reason to be invested in or root for him. Second, Luke's ability to hold his own with Vader and Palpatine was unrealistic - why not pout some physical restrictions on him until he agrees to serve you? But the biggest frustration is what the plot hinges on: Vader's transition to help Luke. Luke doesn't really do or say anything novel, and Vader is a smart guy who has thought about this issue long and hard, and yet Luke being there is enough to just get him to switch? Vader is so deeply established and has been working as a head of the Empire for years, a conviction that should not be so easily shaken. He didn't raise his son but left him at birth, so there's hardly even a huge familial connection. We aren't given anything to latch on to in explaining Vader's monumental shift. Between the lack of interest in the other storylines and the disappointment in the way the climax is resolved, the pleasant effects, acting, and other peripherals present in all three are not enough to save Return of the Jedi from fun but easily forgettable mediocrity.",

            "content": "Return of the Jedi is the third film in the Star Wars series, and the last of the original trilogy. It is sometimes seen as the weakest of the three. The reason? Ewoks, ewoks, ewoks. These furry aliens have been deemed too cute for Star Wars, too much for kids, too much for merchandising. But personally, I don't loathe the ewoks like some do. I actually think it was neat to see how such primitive weapons could beat the Empire, which after all was Lucas' intent. Nevertheless, I agree this is the weakest film of the original trilogy. It is, however, a sufficient conclusion.What's good about it to make it an adequate conclusion to the film series? A few things. This is where we first see the gangster Jabba the Hutt (not counting a bad new scene inserted into the first film). He has become a famous movie villain in his own right. The best part about this is that we see Princess Leia half-naked when Jabba puts her in a golden bikini (though, arguably, she's *still* wearing too much). And, some of the scenes with Darth Vader and the Emperor, complete with the famous music associated with them, recaptures some of the feel of The Empire Strikes Back. There's emotion when Luke finally fights Vader, especially when Vader brings up Leia, and the music in this scene works well.On the down side, we have some fake-looking puppets here. Granted the 1977 original had some fake-looking aliens too, but Return of the Jedi came out only a year before Gremlins and that movie shows Hollywood could have done better. Also in Return of the Jedi, we have a death star blown up, and that had already been done in the original. I don't think the conflict Luke felt about his father was intense enough; the idea that Vader was good after all was unconvincing. If this film could have been darker like Empire Strikes Back, instead of having questionable compassion for Vader, Luke could have felt self-loathing, a kind of guilt for being the offspring of a monster. Luke's compassion could have perhaps shown up only at the end. Still, even if Return of the Jedi isn't great, it's a must-see to get closure on the first two classic films.",

I mean, Princess Leai is in some wooded area on some planet or whatever, and she sees these oversized teddy bears running around in what appears to be bandanas and sling-shots. What? Where? Who? But what really insulted my mind about the Ewoks was that they were able to kill Vaders henchmen (what were they again?) with stones and arrows while the henchmen are wearing hard plastic and metal. What?Oh yeah, and the ending. Vader supposedly becomes a good guy. What? And his face is powder white as I remember it. So, going to the Dark Side pales your face? Was that caused from the lack of light in his helmet or was that supposed to be suspicion of disbelief, or the mystery of science in Star Wars? Well you tell me, how could something like that be Mystery of Science in Star Wars? It isn't even in the same theme as the other MOSISWs, nor even in suspicion of disbelief. It's just idiocy that Lucas thinks the fans will call a MOSISW. Why? Because MOSISWs are words like midicholorines (sp?) or what's going on, they aren't supposed to be of your skin going pale. Or can they be? I dunno. Big hole there.Yoda dies. C'mon, Lucas, he has only been friends with Luke for half an episode, you should have made Episodes 7-9 where he would have been a more devolped friend/Jedi-instructor for Luke. Hell, Luke didn't even finish his Jedi training by this episode well enough to really call him a Jedi.

Most of the same characters from the first two films appear again, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Darth Vader and Chewbacca, but somehow they don't have the same impact as they did before.The main problems with Return of the Jedi are the general tone and the uneven script. The film is at its best when at its darkest, but unfortunately the film is less dark overall than the original Star Wars, let alone The Empire Strikes Back. Most of the film's best scenes are those featuring Emperor Palpatine, who is finally seen in the flesh for the first time. He exudes a believable aura of malevolence, and many of his scenes are electrifying (no pun intended).Return of the Jedi is hampered by an over-abundance of set pieces, which are entertaining enough while on screen but don't do enough to advance the plot, and are quickly forgotten as our heroes move on to tackle the next leg of their adventure.Unfortunately, a large chunk of the film is spent on Endor with the Ewoks. The appearance of these small furry creatures indicates that Return of the Jedi is aiming for a younger demographic than before, but in doing so it sacrifices much of the cross-generational appeal the series used to have.Return of the Jedi marks the point at which the Star Wars series began to lose its way. It undoubtedly has some memorable sequences, but there are also long sections where it becomes boring (yep, the Ewoks), an accusation that couldn't be levelled at the first two films. Viewed on its own terms, or compared with the more recent Star Wars films, Jedi's faults can be forgiven, but as part of the original trilogy it really should have been better.",

            "content": "To finish off the original Star Wars trilogy it is time to review Return Of The Jedi, a truly iconic film that had to really deliver as the payoff for the first two groundbreaking films and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Luke Skywalker have to return to Tattoine to confront Jabba The Hutt in an attempt to rescue Han Solo, while Darth Vader & The Emperor are in the midst of builing a new Death Star in order to crumble The Rebel Alliance.Main Character\nMark Hamill as Luke Skywalker gets his final run out as the main character of a Star Wars film and I actually think this is his best performance as the character in the original trilogy. You can see he has progressed plenty since his encounter with Vader in Empire Strikes Back and you see he is truly on his way to being a true Jedi. But as I have mentioned in previous reviews he still makes some mistakes and acts out of emotion, I think you appreciate his performance more after you have seen the prequels and seen how the Jedi act there it shows Luke has more personality and feels more human and easier to connect with.Supporting Characters\nHarrison Ford & Carrie Fisher are back as Han Solo & Leia and they both do good jobs in their roles and still give their all to the characters, however, I think it is clear to see their characters aren't given as much time to shine as they did in the previous film. Reports were that Ford wasn't keen to do this film but they convinced him to do it and maybe that was the reason their characters weren't given as much to do. Now we get to such an interesting performance and character and that is Darth Vader, he is more then just the intimidating monster in this film. He has so much depth to his character and you can see how much turmoil he is going through due to his deep feelings and even though you don't see his face you know exactly what he is thinking and you can see that turmoil very clearly. Ian Mcdiarmid plays The Emperor in the film and he was the perfect big bad for this film, for the previous films you wonder how this guy has so much power but you see it in this film. He is the ultimate evil in the film and his complexity and motivations are really dastardly and it is really easy to hate him and root for Luke against him.Story\nThe story has some really interesting things about it, the turmoil in Darth Vader is easily the most interesting part of the film and easily the dynamic between Luke, Vader & The Emperor is captivating and keeps you interested throughout. However, my main criticism for the film is the lack of interest I have in the Han & Leia story on Endor and really my main gripe for the film The Ewoks. I know the empire are never really shown to be that strong in the films but I just can't take seriously that a bunch of bears can deal with The Empire. It also shows the first time that I feel George Lucas chose merchandise over the film by making the ewoks more child friendly instead of a legitimate threat, honestly, I feel like this film would have been better if they had just replaced the Ewoks with The Wookies and used that to give Chewbacca a bit more to do and I feel like this was a missed opportunity.Script\nThe script for this film was great, the relationship between Vader, Luke & The Emperor is handled perfectly in the film and the dialogue moves you incredibly. The drama is off the chart in the film and it is a perfect emotional end to the franchise, mixed with a bit of well placed humour, with mainly Harrison Ford being Harrison Ford.Style\nThe style of the film is great, the action scenes are really exciting and they are really varied from the venture to Jabba's palace to the final lightsaber battle on the Death Star. They are all exciting and look great especially for the time it was made, I loved how physical the lightsaber battle is and really uses the story to drive the fight as a very personal situation instead of the gymnastic style used in the prequels. Also even though I complain about The Ewoks I cannot deny the action scenes they are in are quite entertaining and feel very different to the previous two films. As the other films I watched the special edition and there is only one big difference that I really had an issue with but it doesn't cause the film to go down a rating.Overall\nOverall this is one of the greatest final parts of a trilogy ever made, it really delivers on the stories that you care about and gives a very satisfying conclusion to the original Star Wars franchise. This for me is the weakest of the trilogy but is still fantastic and a worthy end to this trilogy.Rating - 9/10.",

We get to finally see Luke settle in to his confidence as a Jedi Knight starting off by showing his Force chops against Jabba and his crew. However, the film lacks the charisma the first two had, and the scenes on Endor are sometimes a bit too cheeky.Darth Vader and the Emperor demand our attention in every scene. We also really see the power of the Dark side in action through the Emperor and his manipulating tactics. This is true Star Wars, and while some things feel off it is a solid conclusion to a masterpiece trilogy.Final grade: 9/10",

            "content": "\"Star Wars\" brought together elements from various works of art to create an eye-catching, distinctive, and fairly original film which took the world by storm. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" fleshed out the characters, gave us some absolutely terrific action scenes and beyond all that consisted largely of really, really great scenes and moments. \"Return of the Jedi\" was at a disadvantage in following \"The Empire Strikes Back\", not only a great piece of genre fiction, but a genuinely lasting work of art, and one which promised an incredible finale at that.I don't know if \"Return of the Jedi\" could have ever really been absolutely satisfying as the final film in this trilogy, but I certainly hoped that Lucas and Kasdan (who was primarily responsible for the great \"Empire Strikes Back\" writing-wise) would return with something other than thirty minutes of the insanely annoying (seriously, how does anyone like him?) Jabba the Hut, followed by a great action scene in which our heroes escape from him, followed by a seemingly sharp increase in the quality of the film, as the focus shifts back to Luke, his relationship with Darth Vader, Vader's relationship with the Emperor, and further immersion into the \"Star Wars\" mythos.Well, that's wonderful. They've righted their wrongs, the Emperor is creepy, and this is a lot of fun. Right? Ooops. I guess they weren't done with the puppets just yet. But that's quite alright, these muppets are adorable and cute and fun. Okay now. Hmmm, 20 minutes of Ewoks is a bit much, don't you think? Ah, there we go, the focus is now firmly back on Vader, Luke, and the Emperor. Right? Nope. Here come the Ewoks again. More not-so-well-shot action and puppets jumping around making noises. Er, are they ever going to go away? I mean, come on already. Ah, now there's barely any emphasis on them. Wonderful.What? There's barely ten minutes left?! That's it? Oh well, here's the epic final battle. It was great, and a fitting close to the series. The movie's ending is terrific, and fairly touching. Does it excuse the majority of the movie being made up of f***ing puppets making weird noises, and some awful dialogue and acting, not to mention the whole thing being a step down from \"Empire Strikes Back\" technically? Hell no. Does it excuse this script looking like it was written by a 12 year old except for the scenes with Luke, Darth Vader, and the Emperor? Hell no. Disappointment isn't the word. \"Return of the Jedi\" has a great ending, and a suitably epic final battle, but after two films which built up a great mythology, wonderful story, great characters, and promised a fantastic third film, we get two hours plus of f***king puppets, with a few good scenes here and there. The above barely qualifies as a review, I suppose, but I felt a rant was more suitable. The music's good, I guess.Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh4/10",

The movie starts out well, but gets lost a bit in the middle, and is uneven at the end.Spoilers, but who doesn't know what happens in these films?The introduction of the new Death Star is fine, as are the scenes revolving around the attempt to rescue Han. Luke's entrance as a full Jedi has impact. The only problem here is how far advanced Luke seems, compared to how much time appears to have passed since the end of Empire.  Hormonal teenagers got to drool over slave girl Leia, an image that came from a Frazetta painting and entered into many a fanboy's fantasy.  Han gets thawed out, but doesn't really get to lay the smackdown on Boba Fett.  Fett only gets dumped into the most Freudian image yet in these films.The middle drags a bit.  The introduction of the Emperor is great, as he definitely looks like someone who could control Vader.  The Endor mission is straight out of every WWII commando movie.  The speeder bike segments are good; you can only really detect the models in a few shots.  Then, enter the Ewoks.Rumor has it that Wookies were originally intended to be the primitive force that helps bring down the Empire.  Since they were shown to be too sophisticated, the race was changed; to a bunch of teddy bears.  OK, the Ewoks have a few moments, but mostly they were there to be cute for the little kids.Aside from the Care Bears, er, Ewoks, we have the Luke, Leia revelation, that puts a weird spin on Star Wars and makes Allen Dean Foster's Splinter of the Mind's Eye really twisted.  Quite frankly, this was too big a pill to swallow.  The Vader-Luke relationship was one thing (and I still maintain that it wasn't in the cards, initially), but this is just another surprise for the sake of replacating Empire's big secret.  It's also a convenient way to get Luke out of the love triangle without a fight, or something that might require good writing.The finale works for about two thirds of it.  The space battle is spectacular and the lightsaber duel tops Empire's.  It was fun watching someone other than Luke take out the Imperials.  The shots of the damaged Star Destroyers always bring cheers.  The problem is the Endor battle.The forest battle is too cute.  There are too many spots played for laughs, in what should be a serious battle.  The one death of an Ewok is the lone serious moment, and it it just too, \"aw, the little bear got smooshed.\" Had this been played more seriously, as it was in the novelization, there would probably be fewer Ewok-haters.In all, this is still a good film; but, with big flaws that presage the mess of the prequels.  The problem seems to come from George meddling to much, a weak director, and too much emphasis on commercialism.  Irvin Kershner was strong enough to check Lucas' more extreme tendencies, but Marquand wasn't. In fact, most stories tend to hint that Lucas pretty much whispered instructions into Marquand's ears.  That may be fanboy jealousy, but there is some truth in that idea.  Still, the film does end on a high note and delivers enough of the goods that you forgive its shortcomings.  The music change at the end of the Special Edition is unnecessary, but the celebrations were a nice bonus.  My only quibble is that the Empire wouldn't crumble that quickly.  Yes, without the fleet, much of the Empire's firepower was gone, but there still had to be a strong stormtrooper presence in the key areas.  This was an idea that Timothy Zahn explored beautifully in his first Star Wars trilogy.Hopefully, on that grand day when the Star Wars dvd's are released, George will have listened to the large number of people who want to see the films in their original state, warts and all.",

Here, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Chewbacca rescue Hans Solo from Jabba the Hutt, and are set to complete their mission of restoring freedom in the Galaxy. Joining them are the little furry friends called the Ewoks. This time, the Emperor himself oversees the construction of the new Death Star by Darth Vader. From there on, it is the fight to be finish, in an epic battle of good vs. evil. What results is another breathtaking action-filled movie, with great direction by Richard Marquand, awesome script by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, superb music score by John Williams and terrific special effects. This film offers hope and rebirth, character development and beautiful sceneries like the galactic city. In addition, there are two spectacular battles: one in the forest and one in the Death Star. Fast-paced and action packed - no boring fillers or sub-plots. This film unlocks mysteries of Luke Skywalker and the truth of Darth Vader. 3PO and R2-D2 are silly, yet courageous as they always get mixed-up in one battle after the next. The dancing scene in the beginning of the film is a treat. Ian McDiarmid star as the Emperor, as he did in the first three Star Wars movies of the trilogy.

Han and Leia fights on the ground of the forrest moon of Endor, being aided by the Ewok natives, who adds a sense of cute and charming campiness to it all. Meanwhile, the Rebel fleet is engaging the entite Imperial armada in space, as Luke confronts his father Vader and The Emperor, who tries to turn him to the Dark Side.It all makes for a very epic three-part battle, and it all comes down to the investment you have in these well-written characters. Leia is revealed to be Luke's sister in an interesting twist, raising the stakes even further. Vader even shows he has a heart in the end, sacrificing himself and saving Luke.The new villains must also be mentioned, The Emperor, like Jabba, has been built up in the previous films and McDiarmid does not disappoint. He comes off as a sinister, somewhat over-the top and manipulative old man - like Yoda, seemingly very old and frail, but extremely powerful, you get a sense that he has been the mastermind behind it all. Jabba, a giant slug-like creature, is an iconic, silly and fun villain; the puppet looks fantastic.The effects overall are, of course, ground-breaking. The puppets for the aliens in Jabba's palace and the Ewoks looks great, and the model work in the final epic space battle are incredible.Overall, it is not as dark as the first movie, but it shouldn't have been. The lowest point of the journey was over and it was time for evil to be overcome, and so it was. Richard Marquand gave us a thrilling finale that closed the book on the story of Star Wars in a memorable manner. The force will be with us, always!",

Then it's off to Tattooine where Luke and company escape from Jabba the Hutt in a great light saber/blaster shoot out.  Yoda confirms Luke's fears and Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must confront Darth Vader.  The speeder bike chase, the blooming relationship between Han and Leia and that forest battle!  Wow!  But the main crux of the film is between Luke and Vader, and The Emperor.  The duel between Luke and Vader is spectacular, and when Luke loses it after Vader goads him into it is just amazing.  In defeating Vader, Luke stands to become him.  Vader turning on his Emperor is outstanding.  The force theme swells on the soundtrack and the Emperor is tossed down to the bowls of the Death Star.

            "content": "I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies. I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted. To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. I have heard many strange reasons such as: a) Because Yoda died b) Because Bobba Fett died c) Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) Because Darth Vader was revealedI would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely. First off, WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died??? If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. Don't get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett's name!!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think... Secondly, many fans did not like Yoda dying. Sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic. All the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie, you know. Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon. Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yoda's death.. Well, nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope. (Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy)  Why was Obi Wan's death okay but Yoda's not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible. That is utterly ridiculous!! I can not believe this one!! First off, the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there. If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage. (Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) They had swinging vines, ropes, logs set up to trip those walkers, and other traps. The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. The only thing they had was their blasters. To add,  it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves, they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest. I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars heros, the band of rebels, as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain, that would have been a great upset. Lastly, if this scene was still unbelievable to you.. How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the Princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! And not only that, the heroes , of course, always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters. The troopers must have VERY, VERY bad aim then! At least in Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. Don't believe me? Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Lando's base. Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at  (somehow they missed)as Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Star.The last reason that I care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed! Well, in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie. Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his father, Annakin Skywalker. It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete. By Annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker (by removing the helmet). The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about. In fact, that's is what I would have done in that scene too if I were Luke's father...Isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet?On another note, I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves. I never go into a film with that deception in mind, I always try to go into a film with the attitude that \"Well, it might be better or worse that the original .. But I can not know for sure.. Let's see.\" That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was.I am not sure who criticizes these movies but, I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that A New Hope was their favorite) that it is ROTJ. I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading.Bottom line, the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy. This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes. There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful, exciting, surprising, or all of the above. For example, the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any day!!!Finally, I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as \"just another sequel\") to trash the movie such as \"This movie stinks because Luke is not in it!\" then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunately.",

Turns out it has the most story of all the Star Wars movies.The movie began with answering the question as to what happened to Han Solo. He gets rescued by Luke and Leia. We even get to see the iconic Boba Fett in that scene. Later on we get to see Lando. Even though I haven't heard about him and I actually had to look up his name while writing this review, he looks pretty iconic. I don't know if this was a popular look or this movie made the look popular, but I guess the latter is true. There were many other NPC characters throughout the movie, but for me the selling point were the Ewoks. And I don't care what all the \"die-hard Star Wars fanboys\" say.The Ewoks are so adorable! I wanted to pull their cheeks. Their scenes were so cute and funny. The way they fought the Stormtroopers or treated C3PO like a messiah was really wholesome. I really wanted to see that kind of stuff in Star Wars movies. Just because it's set in space doesn't mean it always has to blast out laser guns or have huge flying ships. After all, it's set long long ago in a galaxy far far away. There could be many tribes living over there as well. And seeing them hold up makes me believe they still exist somewhere in today's time, having evolved into becoming teddy bears as advanced as humans.And finally Darth Vader's final fight scene in this movie, in my opinion, was way better than The Empire Strikes Back. We actually get to see what Darth Vader looks like, and he hasn't cut Luke's arm for this. This is the correct way of drawing out emotions. The one who is making the audience emotional should be in pain, and not the one being made emotional. Darth Sidious was really intimidating, and I really wanted more of him rather than the trash that Palpatine was.Star Wars: Episode VI is even today my favourite Star Wars movie. It doesn't matter what others say about it, it's gonna be the most OP in my opinon. In just 2.5 hours it managed to tell more story than the entire sequel trilogy combined. And the best part - the spoilers from this movie aren't even as popular as Episode IV or V, so I could watch it without already knowing what I'm about to watch. I'd absolutely watch it again.",

            "content": "\"Return of the Jedi\" loves the Star Wars franchise so much, it even decided to bring the Death Star back for a second go-around. That's how much Episode VI is truly a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of all things Star Wars. We get new spaceships in the rebel fleet, a slew of new and bizarre creature/characters, better special effects and the climax of our hero, Luke Skywalker, on his journey toward his destiny.In the third installment, a new-look demi-jedi Luke and the crew save Han from Jabba the Hutt and then offer their services to the rebellion's plan to stop the construction of the second Death Star. All this time, Luke is aware he will have to confront Darth Vader, his father.Luke's maturity reaches an apex in \"Jedi\" that we got a sense of at the end of \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" Only this time, he's not only confident, but got the skills to prove it. He becomes the true hero of the series, taking that cool guy spotlight away from Han Solo entirely. This is a film about him above all else and the way it unfolds does his story justice. The idea that we are to identify and transform as Luke does in the trilogy unfolds beautifully in the final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor.Visually, \"Jedi\" blows away the previous two films. The space scenes in particular are much more stunning. Other than that, there's not much of a difference. \"Jedi\" prides itself on continuing to add to and expand the Star Wars universe as well as your imagination.Whether \"Jedi\" is the best Star Wars film is simply a matter of which part of the saga resonates most with you. A lot of it will depend on your opinion of Ewoks, the fuzzy midget bear creatures that inhabit the moon of Endor. If you find them cute and entertaining, \"Jedi\" is probably your favorite of the saga. If you find them annoying and just a bunch of small, furry jokes for characters, \"Empire\" is probably your favorite film.A lot of it is also about what aspect of Star Wars lore appeals to you. If you're more into the Han and Leia subplot, \"Empire\" is better. If you're about the evolution of Luke and are riveted by his confrontation with the Dark Side, \"Jedi\" is about as good as it gets. Either way, you can't really complain with \"Jedi\" because it offers a lot to be entertained by.",

Thankfully this saga successfully integrated that in so the eye candy doesn't overpower it all. This last installment has got a bit of a bad wrap due to its over-emphasis on action, and less on emotional pathos, but I disagree since it all wraps everything from the previous two up perfectly. Some have frowned upon the Ewoks, but I love them. They're cuddly and they prove very resourceful against the Imperial Empire (they're the Birnham Wood that came to Duinsane Hill). I actually adore Leia in the Gold Metal Bikini, very gorgeous eyeful!! My favorite part however, is Luke's last battle. Returning the favor with a hand slice finish, he prove's what a real Jedi is. My favorite quote is \"You failed your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me!\" The way Mark Hamill handles Yoda's death is touching, he's come a long way.

The Jabba the Hutt section is terrific. Slave Leia taking control of the deck gun is amazing. Almost everything is perfect. The speeder bike sequences are terrific action and the space battle is great. The allure of the dark side is powerfully shown. The only drawback are the Ewoks. They simply look too much like teddy bears and speaks to Lucas' need to play to the kids. Some at-st destruction seems too unlikely. It's like a kid imagining fun silly ways to destroy his toy at-st. Those are minor problems. As for the Special Edition changes, most are fine and unnecessary. There is one glaring, horrifying change. The song and dance at Jabba the Hutt's palace is undeniably bad.

The Empire that terrorized the galaxy and can destroy an entire planet with a single laser blast can be defeated by cute little teddy bears armed with sticks and stones? Ewoks were an obvious merchandising ploy. It's a damned shame Lucas sold out his masterpiece saga to sell a few cheap toys.2. Luke. He's no longer the young wide eyed panicky novice we knew him as in the first two. He now plays a Mr Migagi like character who talks like he's reading a fortune cookie. \"Your overconfidence is your weakness\" is a perfect example. 3. Han Solo. The man who played vital roles the first two movies is now reduced to comic relief with a few unfunny wisecracks. And I'm no military expert, but how can he go from a self centered smuggling scoundrel barfly who wanted nothing to do with the rebellion against the empire to a general overnight? 4. Luke and Darth. They were furiously swinging light sabers at each other in the previous film but are now calling each other \"Father\" and \"My son\"? And when Luke said \"I know there's good in you\". Really Luke? He murdered your mother, mentor/teacher, aunt & uncle, your buddy Biggs, the entire planet of Alderann, and many of your rebel colleagues. He also froze your buddy Han after he tortured him for no reason, and he chopped off your hand. Where exactly do you see the \"good\" in him?5. Darth Vader. The dark, menacing, most bad ass villain in movie history is now a cowering wimp in front of the emperor. Until the end of course.6. Jabba the hut. This ugly wormlike blob who laughs like santa claus with a hangover and speaks some orcish language but always manages to throw about two or three English words into each sentence. \"ME WONG UGH DOOG MA ZUL GUV OLD JEDI MIND TRICK\".7. Boba Fett. This lurking villain has little dialogue in the whole series and none at all in \"Return\" so why is he even in this saga? Just to end up a burp joke? What a waste.8. The Sarlac Pit. OK first of all, who lives to be a thousand? And secondly, with no oxygen in it's belly, they'd probably be dead in less than an hour. \"Slowly digested in over a thousand years\"? Wow, just like when you eat a bagel. 9. The Luke/Leia sibling thing. OK George. It worked in \"Empire\" when you shocked your audience with Darth Vader announcing he's Luke's father. But the Luke/Leia thing was an obvious attempt for a second shocking but it missed this time. Don't you remember they tongue kissed each other on Hoth?10. The Death Star.

Arthur. It's a cruel fate, really, as such a child might ultimately have been better off being born in a family where they're the first to get their high school diploma (GED, of course). In the land of the blind,... but I digress.There are flaws here, and they've been dissected ad nauseam for over thirty years now (Ewoks, burp jokes, Ewoks, rehashed plot devices, Ewoks, the dumbing down of Han Solo, Ewoks). I have nothing fresh to add to this, but suffice it to say, none of them is fatal. Third acts are notoriously difficult, and 'Return Of The Jedi' had more challenges than most thanks to its predecessor's leftover story baggage. The entire first act is spent tying up loose ends. By my math, that only leaves 2/3 of its runtime to, I don't know, wrap up the definitive work of cinematic mythology of the late 20th century. No small task, that. But it does it, and in grand, rousing fashion. And, at a time in the story when you don't really expect any twists, we get perhaps the biggest of all; the redemption of Darth Vader.People talk about Vader's reveal in 'The Empire Strikes Back' as one of the greatest shockers in movie history, and it is, but I contend that his redemption is at least as shocking. You have to remember, this was Vader when he was the icon of evil, before the prequel trilogy (clumsily in my opinion) humanized him. To think in 1983 that Vader would ultimately come back to the light after what we'd witnessed in the previous two films... not many saw that coming.'Return Of The Jedi' stumbles, it even falls, but it keeps getting back up on its feet and races to a thrilling climax that puts a triumphant exclamation point on the saga... or so we thought.",

Following on from the entrapment of Han Solo by Jabba the Hutt and the news broken to Luke Skywalker by Darth Vader, explaining that the Sith Lord is in fact his father. The two famous droids R2-D2 and C-3PO are integral characters to the Star Wars saga, with 3PO supplying his protocol skills and impressive memory bank, and, R2's navigation skills and ability to hack into various systems. The pair begin the watch when they are sent to Jabba's palace on Tatooine in a trade bargain made by Luke Skywalker to rescue Han Solo. Disguised as a Bounty Hunter, Princess Leia infiltrates the palace under the pretence of collecting the bounty on Chewbacca and unfreezes Han, but is caught and enslaved, held hostage by Jabba himself. Jabba the Hutt is a puppet character, marshalled by three men inside his thick rolls. He is best known for his large size, slimy skin and low-pitched voice that produces saliva when ever he speaks. The crime lord has connotations with a slug, in his overall appearance and lazy nature, there is an extreme lack of movement from Jabba as he is predominantly placed on a stand and surrounded by his slaves, doing things for him. His profession entailed trafficking in illegal good, piracy and of course slavery that generated the planet of Tatooine's wealth, making his business so successful. Luke soon arrives to bargain for his friends' release, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be executed by rancor, an immense, warm-blooded predator native to Dathomir. After Luke kills rancor by brutally slicing him by opening and closing an escape door, Jabba sentenced him, Han (who can barely see) and Chewbacca to death by being fed to the Sarlacc, a huge, carnivorous plant-like desert beast. Having hidden his new lightsaber inside R2-D2, Luke frees himself and battles against Jabba's guards, on a ship hovering above the sanded trap. As Luke engages battle, Leia cleverly chokes Jabba with the chains she was connected to whilst enslaved by the gangster, killing him. Han and Chewbacca combine to save a fallen Lando, inches of sliding into the Sarlacc's trap, obtaining the pilot and fleeing with Luke and Leia. As the others rendezvous with the Rebel Alliance, Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his training with Yoda, whom he finds is dying. Yoda confirms that Darth Vader, once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and becomes one with the Force. The ghost of Obi Wan Kenobi reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister, and tells Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training and defeat the Empire. The Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a second Death Star under the supervision of the Emperor himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of Endor; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. Luke and Leia accompany the strike team to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. In a sequence of chases, Scout troopers, also known as biker scouts, were plotted in the forest as a part of the Imperial army, many of which were defeated in a high speed bike race, featuring Luke and Leia. Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of Ewoks and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. The Ewoks are bear-like and seem to occupy their own language. Their tribe are all small creatures and armed with sticks that they poke to those alarming them or trespassing. Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is he father, and that he must confront him. This overwhelms Leia who struggles to believe the news, but trusts Luke and knows he is doing the right thing. Surrendering to Imperial troops, he is brought before Vader, and tried to convince his father to reject the Dark side of the Force, to no avail. Vader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, intending to turn him to the Dark side, as he did to Anakin. The Emperor - withered and weak - reveals in his sinister tone that the Imperial forces are prepared for a Rebel assault on the shield generator and that the Rebel Fleet will fall into a trap. On the forest moon of Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a cleverly executed counterattack by the Ewoks allow the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator, purely due to the Ewoks teamwork and knowledge of their village. Meanwhile, Lando Calrissian in the Millennium Falcon and Admiral Ackbar lead the Rebel assault on the second Death Star only to find that the Death Star's shield is still active, and the Imperial fleet waits for them, cue Ackbar's famous line... The salmon-skinned admiral is a member of the amphibious Mon Calamari species, his role as military commander of the Rebel Alliance is crucial to the organisation of any mission. His large fish eyes and unusual appearance, encouraged his voice actor Erik Bauserfeld after just one look at the character, although, Ackbar is a puppet portrayed by Timothy D. Rose. The Emperor informs Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its massive superlaser, destroying one of the Rebel starships. The Emperor tempts Luke fo give in to his anger. Luke attacks him, but Vader intervenes and the two engage in another lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and threatens to turn her to the Dark side. Enraged, Luke severs Vader's prosthetic hand. The Emperor is impressed by Luke's attributes, almost a carbon copy to when he saw Anakin defeat Count Dooku, and entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke's loyalty to the Rebellion means he refuses, declaring himself a Jedi like his father before him. Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightening, the same that helped kill Mace Windu. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader considers Luke's pain and suffering that the Emperor is causing, seeing that his son can't fight back he lifts up the Emperor and throws him down a reactor shaft to his death, but Vader is mortally electrocuted in the process. Luke supports Darth Vader until the Sith Lord can't continue, resting on the ground, he requests his son to remove his mask, so that Anakin Skywalker can take a proper look at his son, the redeemed Anakin dies in his son's arms, in a moving scene. After the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads a group of Rebel fighters into the Death Star's core. While the Rebel fleet destroys the Super Star Destroyer's executor. The colossal capital ship is both utilised as a forward operating base and as a mobile weapon systems platform, the Star Destroyer is known to be the headquarters of the Empire. Lando and the X-Wing fighter pilot Wedge Antilles destroy the Death Star's main reactor. As the Falcon escapes the Death Star's superstructure and Luke escapes on a shuttle with his father's body, the station explodes. Returning to the Forest Moon of Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother, and she and Han kiss. Luke cremates his father's body on a pyre before reuniting with his friends. As the Rebels and the Galaxy celebrate the fall of the Empire, Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Obi Wan and Anakin watching proudly over him. As the original saga ends, 6 well-directed films make up the achievement of bringing peace and prosperity to the Galaxy. The 6 Episodes feature incredible characters, intense battles, defeat leading to despair, and success leading to celebration. With many deaths along the way, the journey beginning with the 'Phantom Menace' and ending with the 'Return of the Jedi' reinforces the key message, and how integral teamwork and leadership skills are. The power of the Force is something not to be tampered with and is the heartbeat of the Jedi credentials. With major setbacks, the Republic was no more, the Galactic Empire evolved, so too did Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. The Empire's target of dominating the Galaxy was imminent with the construction of the Death Star, but with help of many unsung heroes who sacrificed themselves to obtain and pass on schematics of the superweapon, allowed the newly formed Rebellion to counteract the Empire. Luke - the 'New Hope' - destroyed the Death Star, and witnessed the death of Palpatine and his father, who helped him by killing the Emperor, before dying in his arms.

Irrespective of YouTube's, the general internet's and general society's right-wing possession, of Luke Skywalker, and irrespective of The Rise of Skywalker's artistic undermining of the Throne room, Return of the Jedi's Luke, Vader and the Emperor are part of a pre-universe, pre-evolution, pre-Big Bang fight to uphold their stand against Han Solo and Leia.And now I want to invoke Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals (Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi's artistic mirror); as a teenager, I would watch and re-watch Return of the Jedi, even being immune of freedom from it during my early adult life, in which I would venture out to the local woodland and raise my hand to the Sun, each time for a time.

The entire rescue sequence is so creative, so well thought out. The ending is amazing. I love the ewoks, who might look weak and little, but in a group together with the rebels are brave and strong, that's a message that Star Wars always has. Luke being tempted to hate but strong enough to resist is such a cool thing to see. The entire battle between Darth Vader and Luke is classic. And then their last emotional moment is just...wow. The original trilogy contains only masterpieces and joy. When I think about it, I transform into the kid who watched star wars for the first time, not knowing what it is, and then getting a feeling of true passion. And George has passion. We even see it in the prequels. And since Disney runs the show, things have not been quite the same. The magic dissapears. Vader, Luke,etc are milked dry until the spark is gone. They're not special anymore. That's what Disney misses. Force Awakens had it, but it hasn't been quite consistent. GIVE US STAR WARS BACK DISNEY!!!",

I always loved A New Hope [which I always called Star Wars up until the re-release because we had the original VHS set], had a semi-dislike of The Empire Strikes Back [but, I have grown to like it now], and absolutely loved The Return of the Jedi. My favorite scene was always the ending scene of Luke looking at the three Jedi Masters of his life.And now I after watching the DVD edition, I miss Sebastian Shaw, the original Anakin Skywalker. Now, I am forced to watch Hayden Christensen take his spot. Yes, he is who portrays Anakin before and during his fall to the dark side in the beginning trilogy, but I feel that Mr.Lucas should have left Mr.Shaw at the end of Return of the Jedi. It is almost like forgetting that Darth Vader turned away from the dark side and became part of the light in the end. Unfortionatly, my family no longer has our original VHS of RotJ due to over watching. It became so well worn with use that it would no longer play. I am deeply enamored of those who still have the pleasure of the original VHS, for I believe that to be the better rendition of a favorite movie of mine.",

The final space battle was truly excellent and far better than those of the rest of the original trilogy. And the lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader was even better than the one in Empire. Even the Ewoks could not ruin this for me. Like Empire, Jedi was unable to be as dramatic and amazing as A New Hope. Return of the Jedi does not even come close to A New Hope but it is still a good film. Don't miss it.",

            "content": "Return of the Jedi is certainly the weakest of the original Star Wars trilogy, but fortunately we have the redemption of Darth Vader arc which goes and salvages the entire film. Without it the movie would be a disappointment on par with the Matrix 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3, The Godfather 3, the Hobbit 3, and all of cinema's other failed three-quels.\nThe road to Vader's redemption is quite bumpy, however. All the Jabba's palace scenes, while relentlessly creative, really add nothing to the overall story and function simply as a protracted and needlessly convoluted procedure into bringing back Harrison Ford. That being said, these scenes are probably where the original trilogy gets closest to its pulpy inspirations as possible-I've read a fair share of 1930s pulp sci-fi, and everything in these scenes (goofy monsters, rancor pit, bikini slaves) simply SCREAMS 1930s sci-fi. It's interesting but ultimately not that necessary.\nOnce we get to Endor the movie improves. After some sluggish pacing and a perfectly shot speeder bike chase, we finally get to see Luke's confrontation with the Emperor, which is where the movie really succeeds. The scenes with Luke and his father on the Death Star are probably the most powerful of any Star Wars movie ever; they also give the story meaning, and even achieve a moral statement that nearly no American blockbusters even try to show. Kudos to Lucas for pulling that off. (Also, it's not against Vader's character that he turned to the light side; is it so surprising that he would chuck Palpatine down the chasm when the latter was literally trying to get his son to kill him a few minutes ago?)\nMeanwhile, the rest of the battle of Endor is pretty excellent. Lucas likes multi-front battles woven together-the Phantom Menace had an even more complex one-and he delivers here. While a second Death Star implies creative bankruptcy, the space battle above it is more exciting and massive than in the original film. The Endor forest battle is controversial, and the Ewoks defeating the Empire's 'best troops' is a little cheesy, but it's still exciting for what it is. (And when watching it for the first time, I was probably one of the only kids who got the references to the Swiss Family Robinson film from 1960.)\nAnyway, the fact remains that the ending is perfect for the Skywalker saga, bringing the two previous movies, and yes, the prequels, full circle. Why follow it up with a mediocre sequel trilogy bent on giving all these characters terrible ends? The empire was destroyed forever, and balance was restored. Let them celebrate. They won.",

Anybody old enough to drink however will be left fairly unimpressed by George Lucas' third Star Wars film, unless they're some kind of sci-fi obsessive. I fail to understand why Star Wars is consistently voted one of the best series of all time. Sure the films have their moments, but its very concerning that people have devoted their lives to them! There are too many ridiculous and immature moments in Return of the Jedi to make it anything other than a good kid's movie. The army of teddy bears at the end lowers the quality of the film immensely. The obese frog creature Jabba is welcome, but they go and kill him off too quickly. Harrison Ford steals the film, but isn't in it enough. Skywalker is at times far too worthy and righteous. The robots are just plain irritating, one of them just making inane beeping noises and the other sprouting out nonsense in an ultra-camp English accent. Overall, not one of cinema's best offerings......",

The entire sequence at Jabba the Hutt's palace is a tour-de-force in the grand tradition of pirate adventure films and the resolution of the Darth Vader/Luke Skywalker storyline displays some tremendously powerful emotions.  Additionally, one might argue that the climactic light saber battle between Vader and Skywalker is the best duel of the whole series, combining brilliant editing, lighting design, and amazing music cues.  Finally, I can hardly imagine a more exciting cinematic thrill ride than the potent Endor speeder bike chase.  My favorite image, however, is the silhouette of Luke as the smoke from Vader's funeral pyre rises into the night sky.",

Ewoks didn't have any credibility but still Stormtroopers made to look like incompetent clowns..Ground battle was nothing like in the Empire strikes back.As for space battle. That was disappointing too. We didn't get too see what Star destroyer could do in the battle. Actually they didn't too anything. Even the Super Star destroyer was destroyed too fast and too easily.

The scenes toward the end where the Emperor tries to persuade Luke to turn to the dark side, and Luke simultaneously tries to get Vader to turn back, are deftly managed and quite terrifying.Oh, and we're treated with all the usual delightful characters of Leia, Solo, C3PO, R2-D2 et al.The only time the movie does show its age is in some of the initial scenes where alien monsters are shown using unconvincing stop-motion techniques.

            "content": "Where do I stand on Star Wars? Well, all 6 of George Lucas' films are strong, iconic, and technologically brilliant displays of childhood imagination writ large. Youthful space adventures bound together by universal themes. Fan Fiction entries aside, Star Wars is great. That said, the official end of Lucas' saga, Return of the Jedi, may be my favorite of the whole bunch. With a mix of the jubilant excitement of A New Hope, the sophisticated themes of Empire Strikes Back, and a surplus of new wonders from the mind of George Lucas, Return of the Jedi is the ultimate realization of the Original Trilogy.Coming off the to-be-continued ending of Empire, Episode VI opens with guns a-blazing, as it were. Luke is a Jedi, Han is frozen in carbonite, and the rest of the gang have descended on Tatooine to set him free. Right from the start, Jedi exudes confidence. It's Richard Marquand as the credited director this time, but the film is 100% George Lucas' DNA. The quirky world-builder he is, Lucas' imagination is freed in Jedi. Just as his first Star Wars sequel exponentially expanded the world of A New Hope, so does Return of the Jedi expand on Empire. One might have assumed that there was nowhere else to go after the previous film. No new characters or locations to match up with the icons that had come before. Enter Jabba the Hut, the giant gangster slug and his opulent palace, The Emperor, lord of all evil, Ewoks and the forest moon of Endor, and loads more aliens, creatures, and technology than Star Wars had seen previously. Even the places Return of the Jedi revisits, like the deserts of Tatooine or the halls of the Death Star, are given vivid life. Bigger, brighter, and more detailed in every respect.There is confidence in the special effects and action too. No longer can I describe any of the chases, battles, or duels as \"clunky\". They're all first-rate. Return of the Jedi is where technology and budget finally caught up with Lucas' vision. If the prequels would take his untamed subconscious into the digital infinitude, Jedi represents the most he could do within the confines of the practical world. The armies are big, the speeder bikes are fast, the space battles are sprawling and intricate, and the creatures have that particular silly Lucas-ian charm. For me, Return of the Jedi is clearly the most fun of the Original Trilogy and maybe the entire saga.Return of the Jedi is everything I love about Star Wars, all at once. It's the spirit of adventure, the childlike innocence, the serious themes, and the mythic grandiosity. It's the greatest example of the promise of George Lucas' world; of the brilliant colors and the strange worlds that A New Hope suggested. It's all here to experience. If one film had to stand for the entirety of the Star Wars saga, for the fableistic storytelling of the Original Trilogy and the liberating grandeur of the Prequel Trilogy, it would be that film in between both worlds.90/100",

There is action, humor, action, honor, and more action... and the special effects... whew, light years ahead of its time. We were treated with two epic battles: the inter-galactic battle between the federation and the rebel forces, and the smaller but equally important battle between Luke and the Emperor, Luke and his father, and Luke and the Dark Side. Luke was in a perilous struggle internally with his feelings. You could see as he was slowly being poisoned with anger, concern, and perhaps a bit of fear. The Emperor had a very grand plan in mind for Luke and the rebel forces. That plan was all coming to fruition except for the will power and intelligence of Luke and Han Solo.

The relationship between Han and Leia seems to have regressed from the last film, with Han suspecting Leia's affections have transferred from him to Luke even though they confessed their feelings before he was frozen in carbonite (Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher also look like they're bored most of the time, but seeing how little they're given to do, can you blame them?). The revelation that Luke and Leia are siblings is unexploited and goes nowhere narrative-wise, aside from Vader threatening to convert Leia to the dark side toward the end. And while I don't like the cutesy Ewoks, I could have stomached them if their antics didn't eat up so much of the screen time.Still, what works is great. The battle scenes are tense and full of spectacle, sporting some of the best special effects in the entire original trilogy. Mark Hamill portrays Luke's new-found maturity well while still retaining his character's youthful idealism and emotional nature. The confrontation between Luke, Darth Vader, and the Emperor is full of well-realized dramatic intensity. Vader's ultimate fate is cathartic and still moves me to tears. Perhaps the ending is a bit too happy, but after all the sacrifices and suffering our heroes went through, I feel they deserve it.I cannot help but be disappointed by ROTJ, but by no means is it a train wreck. It's an adequate ending to a fantastic trilogy and though I wish it measured up to its illustrious predecessors, I am grateful that it wasn't the nightmare that Episodes I-III turned out to be.",

It's just not as good as the other entries in the franchise. What saves it is the storyline leading up to the final scene with Darth Vader, which is incredible. The rest of the movie isn't. The Ewoks especially are terrible. Not only do they look like puppets, they feel completely out of place. It's the only Star Wars movie during which you're taken completely out of the immersion by the movie itself, and it does this repeatedly, only to be saved at the last moment.

Certainly Lucas could have placed a more dignified race rather than one that worships C-3PO?

            "content": "The third & final instalment of the original Star Wars trilogy, Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi may not be as impressive as its revolutionary predecessors which at least had an interesting storyline at its core to fall back on once its visual encapsulation deteriorated in quality, as is the case at present, but it manages to cross the finish line before running out of fuel and is a satisfactory conclusion to the saga set in a galaxy far far away.Set one year after the events of The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi finds Luke Skywalker & his friends teaming up to free Han Solo from Jabba's captivity following which they learn of another Death Star being under construction by the Galactic Empire, this time under the supervision of the Emperor himself. With an opportunity to end the battle once & for all, the Rebel Alliance launches an all-out attack against the Empire while Luke & Vader confront for the final time.Directed by Richard Marquand, Return of the Jedi picks up the story from where the previous instalment signed off but takes its time to get moving. The whole sequence at Jabba's palace is overstretched & is at times cringeworthy. Being the final chapter, the film still finds time to meander on moments that should've ended up on the editing room floor. However, there is some solace in the fact that the arc of every character is brought to a satisfying conclusion, even if it takes a longer route to get there.The set pieces put forth by the production design team are more extravagant but the upgrades from one chapter to another isn't that big a leap, or at least it doesn't appear so. Cinematography continues to leave a positive impression with its inventiveness and the camera movements are a bit more energetic this time. Editing could've trimmed a few more moments to give its story a more compact structure & swifter pacing while John Williams once again delivers a fitting score that slightly enhances every moment.Coming to the performances, the cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams & others return for one last adventure and exhibit greater comfort with the roles they'd been playing for a while. The input by Hamill, Ford & Fisher is in tune with what's expected from them while the character of Darth Vader continues to amaze, and the finale is a fitting resolution to his arc. The first half lacks the sort of excitement that was prevalent in the previous instalment but the film does make few amends in the next half to finish on a fine note.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi neither has the freshness of A New Hope nor has the shocking appeal of The Empire Strikes Back and is definitely the weakest instalment of the three. A more coherent & tightly packed narrative in addition to a better pace would've resulted in a more enjoyable experience but despite all its shortcomings, it isn't entirely the disaster it was turning out to be in the first half. A scattered final piece that has its share of positives & negatives, Return of the Jedi may not be the perfect finale but it still bows out with its head in tact.",

            "content": "WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERSIn this post-Phantom Menace age the superficial thrills of Return suddenly don't seem all that bad. Particularly entertaining when watched alone, not after the maturer Empire, it's a worthwhile movie.The opening breakout from Jabba's palace is genuinely exciting (the unmodified original still the best - the updated version retains the ropy matte effects on the rancquor beast and inserts a dumb Ike & Tina dance combo) though thereon it does falter slightly.More contrived than usual, with Leia being Luke's sister undeniably stupid. Not only is it silly in itself, but it also destroys the Han-Luke dynamic, leaving Solo nothing to do but fire toy guns like a spare part. Suddenly upgraded to full lead status, Mark Hamill does adequately here, his more distinguished features (he looks about 80, basically) adding to his dramatic appeal. He even manages to look genuinely upset over the death of that silly old glove puppet, Yoda.I remember an amusing French and Saunders spoof of The Phantom Menace with John Inman as an Emperor. This could easily have been inspired by Iain McDarmid here, who is the campest Emperor you'll ever see. Maybe the whole thing is a homophobic fable, Darth and the Emperor trying to \"turn\" Luke to their side. \"His compassion for you will be his undoing\" notes McDarmid - Hamill for his part counters that \"You won't convert me as you did my father.\" Face it - the dark side is all about dressing up in black leather and calling people \"master\". Vader is an S & M fetishist destroying the rebel alliance merely as a pastime.It is weird how - as with the speedbike chase - most of the state of the art special effects now look extremely dated. However, unlike some modern efforts, the movie doesn't hinge on such endeavours and so it still stands up. It also moves at a cracking pace, so that while the events are perfunctory, the dialogue functional, it's rarely boring.\nYet what eats away at the film's core is its Disneyfied perspective. Jim Henson gets his foot firmly in the door, while Luke being visited by the ghosts of his father, Yoda and Alec Guinness is vomit inducing. As with Phantom, Lucas reasons that any old writer could come up with brand new plots time after time - it takes a man of rare mettle to do the same story three times over. Go get that Death Star, boys!!The Ewoks are of course rubbish, but I loved 'em as a kid. I loved its neat, loose-ends-tied ending when I was ten, too, just in the same way that I hated Empire's open-ended resolution. Okay, so this is the most kid-orientated Star Wars movie (pre Jar-Jar, obviously) but it shouldn't necessarily be knocked for that. In fact, all of the comic set pieces are strictly of the \"cringe inducing\" variety, but they made me very, very happy as a child.There are questions: the chief Ewok smokes a pipe. As their culture seems to be partially based on Native American culture, then what is implied to be in the pipe? Or did Embassy just have shares in the picture? Why does Darth's arm grow a foot longer when his hand is chopped off? And whoever would've thought his death would be so sad? And why IS Boba Fett so popular? I mean, what does he actually DO? Generally, though, this is a movie without any kind of subtext, which can make it disappointing.  The climax doesn't pack the potency it once did, but Luke's conflict - how to defeat the enemy without giving way to inner hate - is an identifiable and enjoyable turmoil.We get told the Death Star is operational twice just in case we don't get it, Billy Dee Williams is wasted, and Harrison plays toy soldier the whole time. But I last saw this on satellite when I had an overnight stay in a hotel. You know the sort of thing - a dull work course, no free bar - and this film became an admirable distraction. Yeah, all in all, this is not that bad a movie. It has a clear three-act structure, a decent pace and compared to The Phantom Menace it's BBC Shakespeare. And I didn't even mention the bit with Carrie Fisher in THAT bikini. 5/10, I think. 8.0 average on the IMDb? Let's not get carried away...",

            "content": "As a kid I was never interested in star wars, for one reason or another i just never watched any of the movies. It wasn't until I was 17 years old, that i was visiting my grandparents for the day and i decided to watch some cable, I came across a star wars marathon, it happened to be the final battle of Ep 1, where Darth maul fights Quigon and kenobi, i was literally spellbound and i never once took my eyes off the screen. I was blown away by star wars so much that i decided to watch the rest of the 6 movie saga in one night. My life was forever changed that day. Recently I decided to have a star wars marathon, and give a up to date review of the 6 movies.Story: Han solo is being held captive by jabba the hutt and Solo's friends perform a complex but amazing rescue. The ancient jedi master Yoda dies, leaving Luke Skywalker as the last jedi. Which is bad timing, since the empire has already finished constructing a second death star, and the rebels are getting ready for one final assault that will decide the future of the galaxy. luke is emotionally conflicted, because his duty is to save the galaxy from the emperor and Darth vader, but he cant help but feel that he can save his father from the dark side. A physical and spiritual battle takes place in one of the greatest saga endings ever conceived.Characters: Luke has finally matured and has become a jedi knight, accepting his parentage, luke is determined to save his father from the dark side, even at the cost of his own life. Despite luke being the hero of this trilogy, when he confronts the emperor and vader, he decides not to fight them but instead redeem anakin, which makes luke a unconventional type of hero. Darth vader is humanized more than ever in this film, despite being the villain, we see him being conflicted, depressed and resistant to hurting his son. Also we witness how he is the slave of the emperor, and that anakin skywalker is still alive within him, which is why luke never gives up on him, even to the point of sacrificing himself, just so anakin could resurface, fulfilling the chosen one prophecy. Han solo has the funniest lines in the movie and he is shown to be the spearhead of the rebel attack. leia is put into uncomfortable situations in this movie, which she overcomes by being the determined leader of the rebellion, and as she learns certain truths, she remains focused on the mission at hand. Lando redeems himself for his betrayal, by being one of the most heroic and influential rebels in the final battle. Darth Sidious the emperor in his only appearance in the original trilogy, steals the show, he is truly evil incarnate, and despite appearing frail, he proves to be the greatest threat he has always been as he attempts to force luke to give into his anger and the darkside, so he can make both luke and vader his slaves. Jabba the Hutt is only shown for a little while, but his ego and puppetry make him very memorable, grotesque, but enjoyable as the first villain in this movie. Yoda has a small role but a meaningful one as he gives luke his last advice before he dies. despite being a puppet, yoda death feels so real and sad, but you feel he deserves it after a 1000 years of constant struggle and war.Action: The battles seem to have been scaled down in this film, but there is still plenty of action adventure to go around. The battle over the sarlacc pit is one of the most engrossing fights in all of science fiction. The speeder chases and battles with the ewoks are very atmospheric in the forests of endor. The final space battle against the second death star, can seem repetitive, but is shown just enough to keep it fresh. The final battle between vader and luke does not have the best choreography but it is full of raw emotional energy as the souls of these 2 men hang in the balance. Most of the special effects still hold up, such as jabba's puppet work, the lightsaber fights, and the emperors force lighting.The Special Editions: A lot of critics and fans had issues with the special additions Lucas made, but because i didnt grow up with the versions before the added effects, im less bias. While the first 2 movies had cgi effects inserted they weren't as heavy as the ones used in this movie. The most egregious one would be the jabba palace song and dance number, its not necessary and its too weird. Most other effects are too obscure that i just notice them. i truly appreciate the addition of several planets and cities we saw in the prequels being used during the celebration scene, it really makes the universe of star wars feel bigger. The original Anakin seen in this movie was played by Sebastian Shaw and while he still portrays a dying anakin, he is replaced by Hayden Christiansen's anakin as a force ghost, i honestly prefer this, while it doesnt make much sense in universe, seeing Hayden, connects this movie with the prequels better, and makes the saga more satisfying, for me it doesnt ruin this heartwarming scene but improves it. The soundtrack also had several changes, the best ones being luke and vaders lightsaber fight and the final celebration song made by john williams, that replaces the original song \"Yub Nub\", is far more emotionally powerful and melancholy.Legacy: On its own, this movie is not the most impactful, besides the luke and vader dynamic the rest of this movie can be lackluster when it comes to the battles and effects. Which is why this movie was intended to be watched with the previous 6 films, to create a unbearable amount of stakes and story development. After i watched all 6 films from episode 1 to 6, I felt I had been through a life altering experience. The Skywalker Saga is one of the best cinematic experiences i have ever seen, and i feel it is the reason why i and so many other fans are obsessed with the universe of star wars, even beyond the movie's story. Lastly, I don't not acknowledge Disney's trilogy in any way as a sequel to this saga, and i personally believe their efforts, attempted to sabotage this monumental saga, which is why there are only 6 episodes in my canon. This is the only ending to the star wars saga that i recognize, the prequels and the other 2 movies, together successfully create a profound and compelling story that i would dare say rival most Greek tragedies, I will say with confidence that this saga is one of the greatest works of fiction ever. Thank you George Lucas.",

            "content": "This film completes the initial trilogy of the saga, with the defeat of the imperial forces and the destruction of its military power. Directed by Richard Marquand, it has script of Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, and has most of the cast who entered the first two films.In my opinion, this is the worst movie of the saga so far (I have not seen the latest film yet), but that doesn't make him a bad movie. It's a good movie, but wasn't able to keep the expectations generated by its direct predecessor. The director fulfilled his role and the actors were very good although a little less inspired than in the earlier films. Action scenes are many, and continue to be worthy of merit and memory. The make-up and costumes also deserve the highest congratulations. The appearance of the aliens was quite well imagined, and we realize that the designers tried to think outside the box, with some great successes and some great failures. The \"bikini\" worn by Princess Leia in this film became iconic and was often copied in other contexts. The special, visual and sound effects continued at the highest level, although its possible to see some absolutely unbelievable scenes, due to lack of credibility. The soundtrack, unsurprisingly, remained excellent thanks to the work of the (already established) composer John Williams. The script is very interesting and closes, in a positive way, the cycle of events of these three films, without plot holes to solve. The climax is very good and it's full of action, holding the audience's attention. However, it's precisely in this moment that comes the factor that brings this movie down: the Ewoks, friendly and peaceful creatures, cuddly like teddy bears, which will be decisive in the final battle despite their weapons, rather than improvised, be the equivalent to that used for Humanity in prehistorical times. In fact, the simple interaction of the cast with these... animals, seems to have caused a great drop in the quality of their interpretation. These things are lovely, but they don't fit in the climax of an action/adventure film. It's like watching a Rambo movie and, in the middle of the final fight, the main character decides to become pacifist and supporter of the doctrine of nonviolence. Not to mention the end of the movie: it's ridiculous! I was expecting to see Bob Marley and marijuana being smoked there! This decidedly affected, by the negative, the quality of this film and make it disappointing to many fans.",

It has lost a star for additions to it post prequel trilogy, one of the worst of which turns that disgusting Sarlacc creature (sand beast that devours people dropped into it) into Audrey from the Little Shop of Horrors, and some other additions. I forgot about that particular addition, and it made me rage again upon seeing it when recently watching the movie on Disney+. It's original version was far more impressive, as a giant thorny hole in the sand, and much more menacing as a result. In addition I didn't much care for adjustments to the entertainment in Jaba the Hut's base, those moments seeming to be particularly disjointed. With respects to original elements, the Ewoks, while cute, do seem to be something of a mistake, in that they occupy too much movie time, with no meaningful amount of Ewok character development - there was indeed a regular one that popped up more often than the others, but they didn't go to any lengths to make that really resonate. Endor also seemed a location that had little meaning, in so far as that new death star's development was concerned - I suppose it would have been a tactically discrete location for construction, and testing maybe, but it didn't make all that much sense either, in terms of ramping up the stakes! Had it had its sights set on Tattooine, for example, the stakes may have elevated a good deal more.",

In addition, the Empire, contrary to Vader feeling, is pretty fast to build such a big, ultimate weapon while it took 20 years to build the original! Episode V was Luke forbidden to leave Dagobah because he had to finish his training. And now when he comes back, Yoda tells him that he doesn't need anymore training : Never been clear to me ! It's true that Leia has nothing to do : she barely speaks and as dear late Carrie told us, she spends her time firing guns ! On the other hand, Harrison is really good here.

The story for this movie is excellent, the movie itself is just so half-assed.  I think the entire movie can be judged on the scene in which Luke is fighting off the giant monster creature in Jabba's lair.  The blue screen my weatherman uses looks better than that.  There was really no point in adding new scenes to this film, if not to clean up at least that one shot.  And although Lucas never expected to shoot Empire or Jedi, I'm sure that somewhere in the back of his head he must have been thinking that Mark Hammil would mature into an actor with a more Jedi-like screen personality.

I need to get someone who holds me like Chewbacca holds Han.But seriously, they couldn't have ended the story on a better note. The story starts out with the iconic scene at Jabba's Palace, where we get to see the battle with the Rancor, Boba Fett die to the Sarlacc (or so we think), and of course Princess Leia in her famous get up. But then, we soon find out of the tragic death of Yoda, one of the most beloved characters in all of Stars Wars. At least it was of natural causes, which proves just how powerful of a Jedi he was to not be slain in battle. In his final moments, he tells Luke that there is in fact another Skywalker, to which he immediately identifies as Leia due to his own internal feelings with the force.Everything in this movie was building up to the final face off between Luke and Vader/Palpatine, which was poetic justice. Luke does not turn to the dark side like his father did and uses the help of Anakin to defeat the Emperor. Anakin sacrifices himself to save his son, proving that there was still good inside of him like Luke said.This film ends in the perfect way, with Leia telling Han she loves Luke, but because he is her brother, which makes Han extremely happy. I can imagine he was thinking at first \"wait, you kissed your brother?\" but then realized she only had feelings for him. We are left with a scene that shows the ghosts of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker looking out at look, which really puts into perspective just how amazing Star Wars truly is.",

After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of \"A New Hope\" and the thrilling sophistication of \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" I remember awaiting \"Return of the Jedi\" with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair, this \"film\" was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from \"A New Hope\" and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: \"I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich.\"There may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit.",

            "content": "Quite an amazing ending to the original trilogy. Little did I know when I was 9 years old watching this that this was not the ending to STAR WARS, but rather a door was open to create another 9 movies to date. This was my favourite film for a time being until I fell in love with another George Lucas creation in Indiana Jones.The group of rebels including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) to name a few are now off to the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt's palace. The bounty hunter Boba Fett has brought him his new prized possession in Han Solo (Harrison Ford) frozen in carbonite. Meanwhile, the Empire is recreating the Death Star and yep she is fully operational. So Luke must turn and face Darth Vader to complete his Jedi training and also save the universe.I truly love the first 45 minutes or so of this film and really to me out does the amazing battle on the ice planet of Hoth from THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. It really is an amazing way to open up a film. Quite action-packed. While there really are no boring moments in the rest of the film at times in a couple scenes it does seem to become dialogue heavy while there is very little visually going on. A very minor problem though, as it doesn't lessen the film really. Written by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas with excellent score by John Williams.There are a couple scenes that were changed in 1997 that personally I prefer the original. First being a scene in Jabba's palace when in 1997 they added a couple very-CGI characters that sing a silly song. In this version it seems that the movie stops so it can go into a musical number. The second being the very end of the film. Even though the music in both versions are similar, I seemed to love the music from the original 1983 release. While the 1997 release added footage making it seem more universal.So, if you did enjoy the first two you must watch this one. You will likely enjoy just as much as the other two.",

            "content": "I hadn't seen this movie in a very long time. In fact, as a kid, this was my favorite of the Star Wars movies. It wasn't the Ewoks, but, I think, the whole climax and every other action scene. It is the most actiony of the original trilogy. However, upon my revisit, I find myself with a far more muted reaction, and it kind of makes me sad.The movie has no real dramatic structure. It seems to start in a similar way to The Empire Strikes Back with an extended sequence that feels a bit removed in terms of what will eventually come regarding plot but feeds into it well. However, it doesn't do that much. It does re-introduce us to our characters who have gone through some changes since the last film (Luke, in particular, is a far more confident and adept Force user), and it undoes the ending of Empire by rescuing Han Solo. And yet, once off of Tattoine, the movie just continues as though they hadn't been separated for months, Han has just been through a traumatic experience, and they just killed a major and notorious gangster. There's a disconnect between the first major sequence and the rest of the film that I simply couldn't ignore.The emotional core of the movie, as far as I can tell because nothing else gets nearly this much attention, is the relationship between Luke and Darth Vader. However, it doesn't get mentioned until about forty minutes in, and then it only occasionally pops up through the rest of the film. Almost the entire time on Endor, Luke feels like he's just on the adventure in the same capacity as everyone else until he suddenly decides to break off. Really, the center of my problem is from the moment the heroes land on the forest moon of Endor until Luke hands himself over to Vader. It's a meandering excuse for relatively pointless action sequences and the introduction of the Ewoks, which feels both unnecessary and laborious. The lowest point is when Luke talks to Leia about leaving to meet Vader. The scene is way overly serious and Luke's reveal to Leia and Leia's \"I've always known\" reaction feels like the writing of a pure amateur.The Ewoks get a bad rap because they were created to help George Lucas make more money from toy sales, and that's completely true. It wouldn't be hard at all to rewrite all of the Endor sequence, excluding the Ewoks entirely, and it still works mechanically. As it is, the rebels feel incompetent because they land somewhere and then seem to get immediately lost on their way to their target and need the help of the local teddy bears. And, yeah, the image of the teddy bears taking down an Imperial garrison never quite rises out of silliness. The most embarrassing bit, though, is what becomes of Han Solo. He's gone from rogue who shoots first to pining over a woman's kindness to another man, ready to simply step aside and not fight for the woman he loves. He's become pathetic.And yet, there is still quite a bit to like. When we are dealing with Luke's conflict between Vader and the Emperor, it's handled quite well. It's not perfect and could use a lot more screen time, but it works. The special effects are easily the best of the series. There are individual sequences that, when taken out of context, have appeal. The opening sequence around rescuing Han from Jabba makes a really good Star Wars short film with lower, but more emotionally meaningful, stakes and ends with a great action sequence. And the final battle (controlling for the Ewok silliness variable) is huge, complex, and really quite exciting.Suddenly looking back at the trilogy at this point in my life, I've begun to wonder if Lawrence Kasdan was the great creative force that I thought he was. Yes, he wrote Empire, but he also wrote this. Maybe it was Gary Kurtz, who quit the franchise after Empire, who was pulling it all together, and Marcia Lucas, who divorced Lucas during Return, who cut it into the right form. Losing those two gave us a purer George Lucas, unfiltered by people who had greater understandings of how storytelling actually works.Oh well, it's a bit of a downer to revisit a childhood favorite and discover it's not as good as it was when I was a kid, but it happens.",

            "content": "I recall the controversy some time prior to the original theatrical release regarding the title. \"Revenge of the Jedi\" was scrapped because it was deemed too harsh for mainstream movie audiences and didn't fit in with the noble character of the Jedi Knights. I couldn't quite understand that argument considering all the country had gone through after Watergate and Vietnam, and since movies and other forms of entertainment were getting more and more outrageous. Still, \"Return Of The Jedi\" works pretty well to convey the essence of the story, as Luke Skywalker stays true to his promise to avoid falling to the peril of the Dark Side of the Force.As I watched the film today, I wondered about the chronology and aging of the principal characters against the progress of the story, so I managed to dig up a Star Wars time line as published in one of the Dark Horse Comics from 2000. Even though \"The Empire Strikes Back\" occurs three years following \"A New Hope\", 'Return' occurs only one year later. It appeared that Mark Hamill aged considerably more than his co-stars in the intervening years between the first and third movie, a period of six years. Maybe it's just me, but since it was noticeable, I thought I'd mention it.Though I found 'Return' as compelling and entertaining as the rest of the series, a couple of things did bother me back in the day, and those thoughts still linger. After the destruction of the original Death Star in the first film, I thought it was a little lazy to return to the same concept with an attack strategy that was fairly similar the first time around. The Ewok population on Endor may have distracted from that scenario, but the resolution was basically the same.The other thing, given the huge popularity he achieved after brief appearances in the films, it was somewhat disappointing to see how easily Boba Fett was taken out during the battle at the Sarlacc Pit, given his vaunted reputation as a fearsome galaxy bounty hunter. With the back story created for Boba Fett in \"Attack Of The Clones\", I wonder if Lucas would have offed him so unceremoniously if Episodes IV, V, and VI were made chronologically following I, II, and III. Something to think about, considering how much more was written about Boba Fett in comics and books after his death in 'Return'.Say, did anyone else notice that Lucas cleverly reversed the \"I love you\"/\"I know\" responses between Han and Leia as he prepares to join the battle on Endor? I only managed to catch that because I watched the films back to back over a couple of days. Not that I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but that's something that stood out.With the original trilogy completed in 1983, it would be a long wait until \"The Phantom Menace\" appeared to begin the story of Anakin Skywalker some sixteen years later. Yet it only seems like yesterday that all the episodes burst on the scene to create the greatest sci-fi adventure ever. The Force will be around for generations to come to thrill and entertain as they did from the very start.",

Fans of the possibly biggest franchise in film history often consider this one the weakest from the 3 early films, but I cannot agree with this sentiment. It may even be my favorite from the trio. They included many interesting new characters, elaborated nicely on the old ones and there is one of the most famous villains in film history in here. The locations are fairly great to watch as well.The film is pretty long, runs for roughly 135 minutes, but there was rarely a moment when I felt it dragged and to me it also seemed as if most of the actors have stepped up their games by 1983. George Lucas only appears as writer in here and the director is Richard Marquand, probably not a name known to too many outside the Star Wars universe. Unlucky for him, he also died way too early. But I think he did a fairly memorable job here. What I liked the most about his film here are probably all the colorful, memorable characters, especially the cute furry ones.But the film also delivers on the dramatic side, especially in terms of Yoda and in terms of tragedy involving core characters. And for the great sci-fi lovers, there are also many great locations in space and spectacular special effects sequences. I am not one of the latter, which is also why I only give the film a ***/*****, but this should not keep you from watching this one here, especially if you are bigger on the genre than I am.

Lucas thinks he knows so much about such topics as military tactics, politics, religion, and so on, but he is no more than a teenager with an overactive imagination.  He doesn't understand these concepts unlike more mature filmmakers like Oliver Stone and Ridley Scott.  Lucas' head is so far in Never Never Land that reality, even in his Star Wars universe, becomes something he constantly changes the rules to fit his needs.  He isn't a smart creator.  James Cameron was the same way with The Abyss, but that product was ten times better than this.  Both of them have their naive fantasy traits locked in this series, but Cameron has gone to the modified Heavy Metal routine.First of all RotJ tries to go in an Indiana Jones-style of film akin to the original Star Wars (\"comic book hedonism\" as Pauline Kael called it) and dumps any true emotional power for merchandising and dollar power.  How else to you explain the ewoks and plethora of new characters and hardware?Secondly, Lucas hires a sap to direct.  Obviously this was so he could keep pulling the directorial strings while remaining \"creator\", \"writer\", and \"producer\".  I am sorry for the production.  The visuals are uninspired and ineffective this time around and Jabba the Hutt is as threatening as colon cancer.Overall, the weakest link in the original trilogy, the ball only falls harder from here on.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",

Especially disappointing is Luke's confrontation with the Emperor, who in truth is a rather drab villain.On the up side is the fact that this digitally remastered version from ILM and Lucasfilm is a real treat when viewed on a widescreen in a theatre equipped for THX or Dolby/Sony Digital Sound. \"Jedi\" features fantastic sound effects and some exciting action sequences. Highlights include the escape from the clutches of Jabba, the excellent speeder chase on Endor (sight and sound both brilliant) and the clashes between the all too cute Ewoks and the new, two legged Imperial Walkers. Even the assault on the new Death Star isn't bad, though the original \"Star Wars\" trench run was much more thrilling.Certainly all these pluses made for me an enjoyable evening, especially in light of my lesser expectations.

I idolised him. He was powerful. He was self-sufficient. He was all in black. I trace my mania for world domination back to him, and I just could not wait to see more.I urged my parents to rent the other Star Wars movies (this was back in the days of video stores). My parents cared little for chronology, and skipped over The Empire Strikes Back, and rented Return of the Jedi. Continuity issues were easily rationalised by my 5 year old brain; \"stuff happened in between. I get it.\"To this day, when I watch this movie, I still (re)experience the thrill I felt as a 5 year old watching the final half hour for the first time. As the action cut between the three battles, on the ground, in space, and in the throne room, my heart near burst; what would we see next? What was happening? When will Darth Vader kill this uppity Skywalker? Eeeeeeee!!The emotions I felt as the final scenes unfolded was too much for me; \"Nooooo! This wasn't how it was supposed to end! Vader lives!\"The following day, as we stood in the driveway, my mother explained that now we had to bring the movie back to the store, I began to cry.\nMe: Don't bring it back.

Luke then returns to finish his training, this time finding Yoda (voice of Frank Oz) on the verge of death. Before he passes away, he confirms that Vader (David Prowse's body and James Earl Jones's voice) is Luke's father and moments later, the spirit of Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) tells Luke that he must face his father in order to become a Jedi Master, ultimately revealing that Leia (Carrie Fisher) is his twin sister. As Emperor Palpatine plans to personally supervise the final stages of its construction, the Rebels initiate a large-scale attack on the Death Star, to prevent its completion and to kill Palpatine, effectively ending the Empire. Luke confronts Vader in the presence of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who expects his son to kill his father and become his new disciple. The boy, on the other hand, struggles to rescue Vader back from the Dark Side of the Force.All the actors and their main characters are once again back to the conclusion of the series. The highlight is given to all, who manage to close the dramatic arc of each of them in a satisfactory way, and this is precisely the great merit of The Return of the Jedi. In fact, the closure is satisfactory, even though it is not daring. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, Kenny Baker, Frank Oz, James Earl Jones, David Prowse, Alec Guinness and Billy Dee Williams are back. Even Harrison Ford, who with the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Blade Runner - The Hunter of Androides (1982), was in danger of not returning. Fortunately he can come back and his story with Leia can be finished.Firstly, it is worth noting the inexplicable translation. Translated as \"The Return of the Jedi\", it gives the impression of being someone, a person, and not the group of Knights who maintain peace in the galaxy. \"The Return of the Jedi\" is a great film, but inferior to the previous two. George Lucas chooses to end his saga without daring. Luke and his partners are at the height of the conflict between the two sides of the Force, and the battle of the rebels against the Empire has reached a turning point. After delivering a darker film in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", George Lucas, perhaps thinking of the commercial return, wanted to make the film more accessible and child-friendly. Out of that desire came the Ewoks, small, furry and fluffy creatures. In addition to them, several other passages also denote the greatest insertion of humor in the plot, as in the scene when 3-CPO is declared a deity and refuses to save his friends from the fire, or when the same 3-CPO says to R2D2 that \"no it's time for heroism \"in the battle on the planet of the ewoks. After the darker atmosphere of the previous film, fans expected something along the same lines in \"Return of the Jedi\", but on the other hand, it was the ending, the final chapter of the saga. Perhaps the dark atmosphere of The Empire Strikes Back was not the best way, although the infantilization in several scenes really bothers.The repetition of theme is also another factor to be considered. Again we have the Death Star as a threat. Something even more grandiose could have been conceived by Lucas for the great conclusion long awaited by all. The events of this episode also do not contribute much to the story. A full half hour of the film is lost in rescuing Solo from Jabba's hands. Only then, with this pending \"The Empire Strikes Back\", does the plot begin. And when it starts, we have ewoks that take some of the strength and urgency out of a decisive period of war. For wasting a lot of time, we have a limited expansion of that world, limited to a tropical forest where the Rebels must disable the protective shield of the Death Star and return to the Tatooine desert. On the other hand, the action scenes are all great and very well designed and work well, no matter how much we get the feeling of the battle between the giant machines and the ewoks that use prehistoric bladed weapons to fight the high technology of the Empire. The battle in the middle of the forest took on a more circus-like appearance at times. The mystery of how those beings managed to defeat the modern and powerful weapons of the imperial troops I believe can never be answered. This parallel plot does not have the impact it should. In addition to the scene with the ewoks, we have the other parallel plot that is the attack led by Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), which is practically a copy of the attack on the first Death Star, already seen in \"A New Hope\".But the film is also full of good times, like the third parallel plot of the climax. The crucial moment is at the end of the scene with Luke, the Emperor and Darth Vader on the Death Star. The tension and construction of the entire sequence of scenes is well directed. The Emperor shows Luke his friends being trapped in an ambush to increase his anger, trying to take him to the Dark Side of the Force, leaving the lightsaber at his fingertips. Luke's resistance is put to the test and his and Darh Vader's conflicts are exposed and the atmosphere of tension is growing more and more when the Emperor attacks the young boy. These scenes are the best in the movie.This is where we also have other important scenes, such as the controversial sequence in which Leia appears in a bikini to please Jabba during the rescue of Solo. Even with a more childlike focus, this more \"bold\" scene appears played in context. We also learned in this episode that, Luke was not the only Skywalker still alive. If it wasn't a revelation as bombastic as that of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", it also ended up surprising everyone.The edition by Sean Barton, Duwayne Dunham and Marcia Lucas again impresses agility with precision and is very competent especially in the scene of high speed chase in the middle of the forest. . Alan Hume's photograph adopts bright colors, reflecting the cheerful and daytime tone of the narrative, in the desert scenes, but maintains the darker and more intimidating atmosphere of the scenes that take place inside the Death Star and also in Jabba's palace, passing the intimidating climate of the two places. The art direction of the duo Fred Hole and James L. Schoppe once again excels, especially in the detailed scenes that take place inside and near the ships, in the scenery of Jabba's palace, in the visual of the various planets that celebrate the defeat of the Empire for the Rebelde group.The effects of ILM are even more incredible, in the visual of each of the beings present, especially those present in Jabba's palace. The evolution for the first film is even greater and even today it does not seem so outdated. The movement of the ships and the effects in the battles are also a spectacle apart.This last part does not have the same impact as the previous two chapters, but it still has some important revelations for the entire series, some striking scenes and ends well, without leaving loose ends one of the biggest and most profitable franchises in the history of cinema.",

Han Solo has become a caricature who gets nothing to do after he has been freed. Leia, who had potential, was let down by the writers and had to stay on Endor and become as redundant as Han Solo.

            "content": "I, like most others, have found Return of the Jedi to be the weakest of the three original Star Wars films, albeit with wonderful strengths that mostly make up for the failings. Yes, the Ewoks are just too cute, yes Darth Vader was way too evil to be be accepted into the fold just because he comes around at the end, yes Jabba's palace scene, the monster in the pit aside, was hoaky. But, each time I see this film, two things strike me as so perfect that I forget about the rest of the movie, and it seems nobody else comments on these. First, I find John Williams music to be spectacular but somewhat derivative, but nowhere else does he shine as brightly as the background music during the scene when Luke finally goes nuts and almost kills Darth Vader. This is perfect wrought mood music (it is understated but is key to making this scene work). Second, Ian McDiarmid's performance here must be just about his best in any film, and I think certainly the best in this movie. (Ian who? He's the Emperor). A quick check of IMDB's actor list shows quite a few other movies in which I can now recall his character, such as in Dragonslayer, Gorky Park, etc; (all bit parts). But his scenes in Jedi seem to me a master stroke of really hitting the nail on the head. The postures, the movements, the facial movements behind the make-up, the voice, especially the small details of lip movement and little sneers. The eyes like a raptor's. None of this seems to be due to makeup. I can't imagine another actor who  would have done better in this role, and for me it makes the movie.",

The premise of the confrontation is that the Emperor hopes to turn Luke to the 'dark side'. However, he never becomes tempted, which renders the whole thing pointless. Of course, there is the other plot line, namely the attempt by Luke to bring his father back, and that does provide some emotional payoff, but it doesn't save the film.\nThe best part of ROTJ is actually its first act, in Jabba's palace.

The film picks up where the last one left off, with the gang descending upon Jabba the Hutt's palace to rescue Han. Of course, there's also the Empire to contend with, including Luke's father, Darth Vader.The cast is virtually unchanged from the previous film and the characters had been quite refined by this point. Lawrence Kasdan, the screenwriter for \"The Empire Strikes Back\", returns here and brings Lucas's story to life with more of the same energy and humour. While some may consider the Ewoks to be a little too kiddie-oriented I don't see them as being particularly out of place.Richard Marquand took over the directing duties this time around and turned in a workmanlike effort that's not particularly worth remarking upon. Once again the special effects won a special achievement award from the Academy. Obviously, the effects are no longer as impressive as they once were but they haven't aged badly either.John Williams provided the score once again and was again rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Also, like its predecessors, the film features Oscar-nominated sound courtesy of Ben Burtt and his crew.In the end, the film provides a satisfying conclusion to the \"Star Wars\" saga. However, for most people it's their least favourite of the trilogy and I'm inclined to agree. Nevertheless, the film does contain elements that strengthen the quality of the trilogy when viewed as a whole.By the way, I strongly recommend that you watch the original version instead of the 1997 or 2004 'Special Editions'.

            "review_title": "A Worthwhile Conclusion To The Original Trilogy!",
            "content": "After the first two Star Wars films became enormously popular with critics and audiences alike, the original trilogy closes out with 1983's Star Wars: Episode VI- The Return of the Jedi. I remember watching the movie for the first time all excited considering I thought the first two films were perfect (and still pretty much do!). I was wondering how this film would conclude the story arcs especially after how dark The Empire Strikes Back was. With Han Solo frozen in carbonite and the reveal of Darth Vader's lineage to Luke, I was very excited. Now I have seen this film many times since, but my thoughts remained the same. This is a very fun, satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy. While it does not reach the height of its predecessors, there are enough highlights to make this one memorable sci-fi adventure.Just like in The Empire Strikes Back, creator George Lucas decided not to direct the movie. He teamed up with Lawrence Kasdan to write the screenplay, as well as executive-produced the movie. He also remained on set to assist his hand-picked director, Richard Marquand. Marquand worked very well with the actors, but this is Lucas's movie. An interesting tidbit is that originally, Lucas wanted Steven Spielberg to direct. Due to some issues with the Director's Guild, he was unable to. That is somewhat of a shame because the notion of Spielberg directing a Star Wars movie truly excites me.This is Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) movie. After the events of the last film, he is messed up psychologically. He wanted that urge to face his father again. But with the Emperor himself now in the picture, there is a chance Luke may be lured to the Dark Side. This time around, the Empire is near completion of a second, more powerful Death Star. This would certainly end the Rebel Alliance. Frozen in carbonite, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is now the prisoner of Jabba the Hutt, and so eventually does Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). With the help of C-3PO and R2-D2, Luke goes on a rescue mission in the desert planet of Tatooine to rescue his friends. After this rescue, they join up with the Rebels to attack the Empire on the forest moon of Endor. There is a three-pronged attack with Luke, Han, and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) in charge. Unfortunately, Luke ends up surrendering to the Stormtroopers and is taken to meet the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid)-which may spell doom for the entire galaxy.The performances remain consistently great. At the beginning of the film's production, it was not a given that Harrison Ford would return since he was not contracted for two sequels like the other actors were-which is why he was frozen in the previous film. But he was able to return, and Lucas was able to write him in the screenplay. I like how they dabbled with Luke and the Dark Side, and I really liked his quest to understand his father. Mark Hamill does an incredible job working these darker themes into Luke.The puppetry and the visual effects need some mentioning. Out of all the original Star Wars features, this film uses the most visual effects. Even in today's blockbuster filmmaking, these visuals do hold up well and are a feast for the eyes. These visuals go hand-in-hand with the thrilling action sequences we see in the last half of the movie. The Endor battle sequences are very well-made. I also liked the looks of these new characters/monsters that are introduced to us. I loved Roger Ebert's description of Jabba the Hutt-a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat. Spot on, Mr. Ebert! Then there are the Ewoks, perhaps the most controversial of all Star Wars characters (outside of Jar Jar Binks). They are cute and cuddly, but do they serve a purpose other than throwing sticks and stones at the Imperial Troopers? These creatures, while a pleasure to look at, may be the weakest link of the movie. I also dug the look of one of the Alliance's generals-Ackbar. Finally, although he does not have much screentime, it was nice to visit Dagobah and see Yoda again.Just like how Star Wars cannot exist without lightsabers, I can argue that Star Wars cannot exist without the magnificent contributions of John Williams. His musical compositions are very important and they remain so in this movie. Just listen to his work during the Endor scenes-very powerful stuff!Return of the Jedi may be no Empire Strikes Back, but it does stand on its own. It is a more fun, more adventure-like movie when compared to the last film. This movie still holds some darker themes, but Lucas was able instill a better sense of fun. Sure, those Ewoks may have been created for marketing and toy purposes, but we like cute creatures, right? The action scenes are very good as one would expect-just watch the final battle sequence. However, the rescue attempt from Jabba and Luke's climatic duel with Darth Vader also make for strong cinema. After watching this entire trilogy, I was ready to join the celebration as seen in this movie at one point.My Grade: A-",

Without seeing the earlier films; without having some degree of personal investment in the \"Star Wars\" franchise of movies, books, videogames, and the rest; without having some knee-jerk reaction of contempt about those fuzzy Ewoks?I doubt it. I know I didn't, when \"Return Of The Jedi\" was released in theaters in the spring of 1983. By then, I had watched \"Star Wars\" on videocassette many times. I fantasized about how I wanted the story to end, who would end up with whom, what would become of the droids, and who got to kill Darth. I wondered if the filmmakers would forget about that guy Wedge that was flying Rebel craft in both the first two movies, figuring they would.I guess I left the theater feeling impressed and disappointed. Impressed because the film played with my expectations some, and managed to bring the story to a satisfactory close. Disappointed because it wasn't more than just satisfactory after all the imaginative aspirations I had invested in the film going in, that the ending felt too neat by half, and that I wouldn't be seeing any more of the characters who pulled me into the world of \"Star Wars\" nearly six years before.Watching \"Return Of The Jedi\" again reminds me of the title of the Robert Graves memoir, \"Goodbye To All That.\" It's a sloppy piece of work when seen with adult eyes, horribly acted by performers who seemed to have lost interest in the franchise that made them stars. The story has none of the sweep of the first two installments, that sense of a band of outlaws riding through the night of space one step ahead of Imperial predators; it's all formal with lots of talking-head scenes. Director George Lucas seems to be carried away by his desire to connect every character through some familial bond, but his new role as an epic-ologist leaves little room for the entertainer I enjoyed. And yes, I STILL hate those Ewoks.Goofy dialogue, too: \"Soon I will be dead, and you with me.\" I mean, rilly...But you know what? \"Return Of The Jedi\" is not a bad film. It's actually pretty good. It is entertaining, throws all the fans their bones (like Wedge for me), wraps the series up on an up-note after the downer that was \"Empire Strikes Back,\" and manages to have its share of funny moments. I love the scenes of Darth Vader hotfooting the construction process of the new Death Star with some of his subtle pricking: \"Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.\" Leia in that slave outfit is a hottie highpoint, and the final attack on the Death Star is still an apex of special effects work.Even those Ewoks. Still worse than Stalin with herpes, don't get me wrong, but they do make a nice point about technological progress not being everything. If cute was so bad, why aren't more fans up in arms about the constant presence of R2-D2? It's funny to read that Lucas was stuck for ideas for the first half of the movie. Definitely it's underdeveloped, with various heroes popping up here and there, but the battle around the Sarlacc pit is a terrific thrill-fest, with a line by Lando (\"Hey, wait, I thought you were blind!\") that still kills me after more than 20 years. Jabba is the one cool new character in this film, a slimy blend of menace and humor. I kind of wanted the rest of the film to keep going like that, but Luke had to seek out his Jedi destiny and break up the team once again.The changes Lucas made to the later editions of the film seem improvements to me, taking out lousy music and bad special effects. Too bad he couldn't do anything about the acting.There's a lot of things that bother me about \"Return Of The Jedi,\" but at least it answered the questions I had and sent the series out on a happy note. Now if only I could pretend he never went back to the well and did those prequels...",

            "content": "Back in 1983, Star Wars was the hottest thing that had come out of Hollywood. Ever. Children were lining up in droves to get their hands on the toys (which were actually well-made in those days) and adults were either lining up with the children, or buying tickets to see the film. Repeatedly.Sadly, it didn't take film studios long to realise after this film had finished its theatrical run that merchandising, not ticket sales, was where the real money could be made. This fact is quite wittily referenced in Mel Brooks' Spaceballs, but today, we have really bad films with childish merchandising like Harry Potty, or really great films on which some mediocre merchandising is based, such as The Lord Of The Rings. Or really mediocre films on which good merchandising is based, such as Tomb Raider.After The Empire Strikes Back was mostly done without George Lucas' creative input, he threw a tantrum and basically promised the world that he'd never let go of creative control again. A real tragedy, I am sure you'll agree. While Lucas was still vaguely aware of his creative deficiencies, and he hived off the direction and writing tasks, he just had to slip more merchandising tie-ins for the benefit of the audience, and his wallet.Most of these merchandising tie-ins weren't too bad, however. The Ewoks made for good symbolism, with an evil, technologically advanced empire being defeated by midget teddy bears who have only the forces of nature (and the Rebellion) on their side. The creatures in Jabba's palace were an example of Lucas at his most outrageous, but the Special Edition of 1997 turned them into a farce. However, what I really craved at the time, and I still do, is a proper scale replica of the Super Star Destroyer. Sure, the cost would have been horrendous, but it would be worth it.The conclusion of the whole Skywalker saga is surprisingly effective, if a little sappy in places. The motivations and the acting are done well, but some of the dialogue is utterly appalling. Half the time, I didn't know whether there was going to be a lightsaber battle or a Blues-Brothers style Christian revival meeting. All they needed was for James Brown to come out from behind the Emperor's throne and all would be lost in a sea of madness.One area where the Special Edition is an improvement, however, is the celebration scenes after the end of the battle. With the Emperor dead and the entire galaxy liberated, the original theatrical release just got plain silly. Many overzealous fans have claimed that the lyrics of the original finale music translate into something like \"Have some droppings, bad actors, but please pull the burrs out of my butt fur\". Seeing the revelry in all the places we've visited in the previous two films, as well as Coruscant, makes for a far more satisfying conclusion by comparison.Okay, it's not a perfect film, but at least in 1983, George didn't insist on complete control over the films, and that is exactly where the new episodes are going wrong. Sure, the special effects are a thousand times better and the lightsaber duels make those of the earlier three films look like old men hitting each other with their canes by comparison, but at least they managed to make us care about the characters in this effort.",

Of course, if the tone was all it was, this could still be great... but, alas, in neither case is that true. Marquand presumably also deserves portions of the blame. I don't know if he just can't do action, I haven't seen anything else by him. This just never actually engages, it certainly didn't, me. The light-saber stuff somehow never goes beyond \"dull\" and \"flat\". I know that it should, but it doesn't. The universe... honestly isn't that heavily expanded in this. A handful of new creatures, several of which are at least one of the following... irritating, more or less poorly realized visually and too cute. Designs aren't that imaginative, for a few. Places and ideas are revisited and redone. The sound comes off as not very unique. The score is still magnificent. Situations tend to be silly, their solutions, as well as how they come about. There are points of this where it seems like George forgot he wasn't writing a script for Indiana Jones. The effects don't particularly get better from the preceding entries(though, admittedly, some do). The pacing is reasonable, the film runs fairly smoothly. This doesn't have memorable or quotable lines. There is little of interest in the characters and their development is basically all in episodes IV and V. The DVD has a commentary track and it's worth a listen. I recommend this only to those who really must watch all of the Original Trilogy. 6/10",

            "content": "The STAR WARS films are a hallmark of our culture. Everyone who wants to study film should see them, because they display quite accurately how not to make a movie, and in particular how not to write a script. I cannot even express how much is wrong is these movies, in every possible respect. Obviously they are cynically manufactured with money in mind (Ewoks!? C'mon!), and obviously they wrecked the notion of film as anything but lightweight, even dull and stupid, entertainment. What even some of the series' detractors fail to see is how awful the movies would be with or without the hype.Let's start with the acting. I can't believe anyone ever took Mark Hamill seriously; meanwhile, Harrison Ford's attempts at emotion are downright laughable. Carrie Fisher does what she can, but like everyone else, she's saddled with some unspeakable dialogue. Far more offensive is the storyline that runs through the three films (and presumably the three prequels as well). You tell me with a straight face that no loser thirteen year-old who reads sci-fi comics couldn't come up with this tripe, and I will applaud you. George Lucas has created a masturbatory set of films in a remarkably self-indulgent attempt to take advantage of the notoriety he achieved with AMERICAN GRAFFITI. Let's not beat around the bush, these movies have one of the dumbest plots ever transferred to celluloid. \"The Force\"? Wow, talk about covering your tracks... to try to avoid plot holes, Lucas creates this invisible dimension that can let people do anything, like pick up out-of-reach objects (as seen in the remarkable \"Luke retrieves a Kenner toy which you could go buy right now from the snow while he hangs upside down\" scene, the stuff of great cinema, in the second film). How exciting. I'd like to have a Force in my house so I won't have to get up to change the TV channel when this idiotic movie comes on.The script? Don't even get me started. To be frank, what little plot there is doesn't make much sense. And talk about episodic! It's just one toy commercial after another, from the completely pointless \"speeder-bike\" scene to the seemingly endless chunk of partying from the Care Bears or whatever those things were. Any fan page or even the IMDB will hold a nice collection of ludicrous quotes, and the fans will probably shiver with glee, while I sit and gawk at how a screenplay with no trace of talent to be found can gain the respect of millions. Most offensively, you've got a score that screams and manipulates like a sitcom laugh track or a Nazi anthem (but then, John Williams never offered anything but recycled schmaltz to start with).In essence, I remain fascinated by the fact that more people have seen this than will sit through the infinite number of films that have more imagination and emotion in a single second than the entire \"Star Wars\" series can muster. The worst part is, if you issue any kind of a dissenting opinion on this boring junk, a million raging fanboys will assault you for not showing the proper degree of worship to a supposed American classic. Jonathan Rosenbaum said in 1997 that destroying every print of the Star Wars films wouldn't solve any of the problems caused by them, but that he wouldn't shed a tear at the loss. I would agree. I don't claim to have any authority over anyone's love of the series, and if you genuinely love these films, that's great. I just don't understand why those who disagree are so frequently labeled \"flamers.\" I apologize for not wanting my brain to turn to mush.My rating: 0/10",

Following an exhilarating rescue on Tattooine, the Rebels find themselves up against a Second Death Star. While the assault ensues, Luke Skywalker must confront his fate at long last, and face off against the evil Darth Vader, as well as the long-awaited appearance of the sadistic, tyrannical Emperor.As with the previous films, \"Return of the Jedi\" is a great movie. While it isn't nearly as dark as \"Empire,\" it doesn't have to be. It does its job just fine, wrapping up the trilogy in the most excellent way possible. The sequences in Jabba's palace and the speeder bike chase are some of the most enjoyable in the entire series, again showing how far technology advances from film to film. This is by far the most action-packed entry in the series, a high-energy movie that never leaves you bored.What makes this movie for me, however, is the climax. The three overarching battles are incredibly engaging, and a complete thrill to watch. The battle on Endor is a very enjoyable action sequence, the dogfight with the Death Star is the best space battle of the series, and the scenes in the Emperor's throne room are simply captivating, completely commanding your attention whenever they are on screen.\"Return of the Jedi,\" while a bit lighter in terms of its tone, still retains that incredible level of \"Star Wars\" magic that its predecessors had, wrapping everything up in a simply perfect way. I consider it to be one of my favorite movies, along with the rest. \"Return of the Jedi\" confirms the Star Wars series as one of the greatest trilogies of all time.

It ends the chronicles of the pivotal human characters in the series, mainly Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Darth Vader. It brings back other characters who seem either more or less than human, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Chewbacca, and the darling robots C-3PO and R2-D2. I wonder how fascinating it would've been for Chewy, 3PO and R2 to have arcs the way the humans did. After all, humans seem to be the minority in this galaxy: In this sixth and consummate episode in the Star Wars saga, we meet various inimitable characters, including the implacable Jabba the Hutt, who is like a goiter that was possessed with a life of its own and grew and took control as an evil leader of other strange beasts; the adorable, fuzzy Ewoks, the mammalian aborigines of the forest moon of Endor; a terrifying desert monster made of sand and teeth, and obnoxious little rodent creatures that hasten across the corners of the frame. And there is an admiral for the Alliance who's like a sapient dinosaur who began a career as a general and statesman. These are the most intriguing characters, to me, anyway, which is never more apparent to me in the original trilogy than in Jedi, with its overtly trite soap opera passages between Han, Luke and Leia that resemble General Hospital more than anything else.Regardless, one thing this film and its two predecessors never do is blow much time on establishing first acquaintances. Unlike countless visual effects and monster movies, where new creatures are introduced with elaborate entrance moments, each of these films immerses its alien creatures into the heart of the action right away. That's possibly why the film has such visual ebullience. Jabba's throne room, for instance, is peopled with countless oddball creatures, some of them just half-gleaned in the periphery of frame. The camera in this massive soap opera coasts nonchalantly past organisms that would supply the highlight for other movies.There's a whirlwind chase through a forest, aboard airborne motorcycles. After many of the bad guys have run into trees and gotten pulverized, you find yourself wondering why they couldn't have just flown above the treetops, but never mind, it wouldn't have been as much fun that way. You could probably guess that my favorite Star Wars film is Empire based on what I name as my favorite sequence, where Jabba and the bounty hunters take our heroes into the desert on his hover-barge to be fed to that terrifying sand and teeth monster, because I find great inherent tension in any scene where the characters are hovering above a depression in desert sand inhabited by this creature, in whose belly \"you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.\" The director is Richard Marquand, whose previous film was the wonderful dramatic thriller Eye of the Needle which, aside from mainly being a great character-driven performance piece, evinced his deft hand for suspense.Now that I've discussed the initial film, I will close by discussing the Special Edition, the turning of a 134-minute movie into a 135-minute movie by means of a solid minute of garbage. I'm speaking mainly of two features that likely aren't news to anyone reading, the first being the awful dance sequence in Jabba's throne room early on. I cannot comprehend why one would wedge in a set piece that drags the pace and provides brainless shots of aliens doing modern pop dances. Maybe I'm a purist, but a film that was an unheard-of spectacle fresh to the technological vanguard in 1983 should not delude itself with modern-day trivialities. The second objectionable annex is the ridiculous Hayden Christensen superimposition in place of the original elder Anakin Skywalker's spirit. Why in hell would Luke see a vision of his father that he never knew? Other than that Lucas wanted to merge the external chronology of a series of films spanning several decades, it has no other purpose but to annoy me personally. My own little opinion of Lucas' career and what he's done to and for the film industry could be boiled down to this: Just because you opened the door for the next generation of filmmakers doesn't mean you have to hinge your career on opening more doors, because some or most or all of those doors will be Pandora's boxes.",

Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance must first set out to rescue Han Solo from Jabba The Hut's clutches before they embark on their ultimate mission; to destroy the second death star that the Empire has built....One thing you have to know going into this 3rd film from the original trilogy is that it does have a slightly different feel to it than the first 2 films; for a start it isn't as dark as its predecessors and it's evident throughout that director Richard Marquand has applied a more comical approach to the material. This won't sit well with all fans, but for me I actually thought it worked really well and made a 2 hour film pass by fairly quickly. If I was to be super-critical I would probably say that The Empire Strikes Back judged the balance between humour and serious plotting to better effect, but Return Of The Jedi clearly deliberately used a different approach (which was risky, but for me was a risk that paid off).The cast are on good form again, but here they get to have a bit more fun and send themselves up a bit more; Chewy's 'stomach' as it were getting them into trouble and the idea of the Ewok's worshipping C3PO as a god was also an amusing touch.Comical elements aside Return Of The Jedi still plays out more or less the same way as its predecessors resulting in it still being equally as enjoyable.

We had waited three years, speculating and reading anything that might give a hint at how the cliffhanger of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" would be concluded. And here we were in rapt anticipation.When the credits started to roll two hours later, we were happy. We had finally seen it! What a film! What fun! What action! The special effects! What a ...And then, as we actually thought about it, we realized that we had just seen a very average film. The acting was far worse than in the previous two films. The story was poorly mapped out and the humor badly timed throughout. Leia was hardly the strong and determined heroine, and Han was *stupid*. They were all caricatures of the people we grew to care about.\nI decided to see it again. I mean, was it really that bad? Yes, it actually was. I was embarrassed to talk about the film, it was so bad. And there was a political correctness to the story that annoyed me beyond words. For example, the Millenium Falcon should have been destroyed. One of the main cast probably should have died (besides Vader). The evil characters could have stood to be less one-dimensional. But Lucas was pandering to the audience and the marketers. Twenty minutes of the movie was an elaborate Muppet show.And then, there were the Ewoks ...Question: How do you kill the tension of the danger you and your entire rebellion is constantly in? Answer: Just add Ewoks.I personally had no problem with them as a race or as characters. They were quite clever. But they diminished the tension factor in the *ENTIRE STORY* by a factor of 10. Watch the movie again and notice how the movie goes from a rapid action film to an extraterrestrial \"Wild Kingdom\" when they meet the Ewoks.

He has a difficult choice to make: bring back his daddy or, in case that's impossible, kill him. In the meantime, the Rebels are getting ready for the ultimate battle against the Death Star, rebuilt after its destruction in the first film.The saga has lost none of its magic, as we approach the conclusion while still hoping it will go on some day.Now, let's talk about the one thing die-hard fans dislike about Return of the Jedi: the battle on planet Endor, more exactly the inhabitants of said planet, the teddy-bear like Ewoks (the originally planned Wookies were to expensive to achieve). They may have been created for business reasons rather than creative genius, and they may seem a little stupid since their technology ain't a touch on the rebels' or the Empire's. Still, they're cute and enjoyable, not to mention more memorable and better than a certain Jar Jar Binks...The Empire Strikes Back is the king, but Jedi is a worthy, though underrated, ending (?) for an amazing saga that began a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...9,5/10",

Not anymore. A lot of the special effects don't work as well as they used to. They look very dated. That normally wouldn't bother me but as the look of \"Return of the Jedi\" diminishes, the weakness of the script becomes more pronounced. The acting by the three leads (Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford) isn't so hot either. All three of them seem to be going through the motions most of the time. Often when I watch this movie now, I feel like I'm watching a two hour toy commercial. There are still some exciting moments in \"Return of the Jedi\" but the bloom is definitely off the rose.",

This is Star Wars after all, three of the most entertaining movies ever made.Since about everyone over the age of 12 knows the plot of the saga, I'm not going to restate it here, what I will talk about is why I was disappointed with the DVD.Let me say that I don't mind the special edition of \"Jedi\", the changes aren't extensive, save for the ending sequence and most of the alterations exist simply of some added visual effects or sharper appearances on FX elements like ships and lightsabers.Sadly though, I do miss the ORIGINAL Return of the Jedi, the version I watched probably too many times as a kid. The DVD version is great, but it's just not the same. It's too bad the original theatre versions weren't included in the release. I know many a message board are dedicated to this debate right now so I won't go in to a long tirade.I think the one thing that I dislike most about this version of \"Jedi\" and the special edition was the drastic change to the celebration song at the end. I much preferred the original song to the more syrupy tune in the new releases. Well, at least I still have my VHS copy of this film...which likely WON'T find its way to my trash bin simply because this has now been released.Take it for what it is...but it is ISN'T the original.",

Oh, because that would make too much sense. And the Empire that we've come to know as nearly invincible and galaxy-threatening can be beaten by little stuffed animals with sticks and stones?!

I remember warning some ardent fans back in '83 that it wouldn't take too long for the much vaunted special effects to wear thin and start curling at the edges, to be met with almost universal scoffing. I felt vindicated when looking at it again to discover thanks to cgi cartoonery it's become almost laughably ludicrous, or it would be if the story wasn't so dull.Not freedom fighters/terrorists up against the Empire/baddies yet again, pulleez \u2013 or as C3PO says Here we go again. The four heroes Hans, Leia, Luke and Chewbacca are off again in their corny quest for victory against the Dark Side. There's an interminable affray with Jabba, space dogfights, cute Gummi Bears on parade, bits that make the old UK TV advert for Smash mash look stylish, I was even fondly recalling Za Za the cat out of Hector's House too. Shame they couldn't have got Stevie Nicks out of Fleetwood Mac to take over the part of Leia from the cardboard stereotype on view, but with cgi anything is still possible! It all looks and feels so olde and tired that I wonder how jaded and faded the original version is now, but maybe many millions of people would lose part of their childhood if they did see it. This is now a monument to Revision, Lucas altered the look of the original work of Art to extend the life of the franchise. After all, even the great painters did it! But why not have done with it and run the revised opening credits to the Muppet Show or maybe more aptly the glorious Banana Splits TV show theme? There's some good imagery, pitifully few though eg Vader meeting the Emperor with a starry backdrop, some good slapstick eg dopey Chewy inadvertently entrapping them all in the Care Bear net - or should that be Snare Bears?At the time of the original hullabaloo it was generally considered the weakest link of the three movies, the rose-tinted spectacles used by an ageing generation who saw it when they were children have imbued it by now with a mystical worthiness that really is unwarranted. I understand and appreciate the power of viewing favourably as an adult the precious things of youth, but it never blinds me as to the real worth of the aforementioned precious things in the manner Star Wars does with its fanbase. And I see yet again just how inspirational and memorable Star Trek TOS was. It's merely OK as a time passer and much better than catching a cold; sadly I saw it too late to think it great.",

One must also remember that this movie and movies like it are, in literary terms, considered \"escape fiction,\" which, unlike \"thematic fiction,\" centers itself around plot. in escape fiction the watcher, reader, or listener expects to \"get away\" into another time, place, or even universe, and when the spectator puts himself in the position of the hero he doesn't like it to end in a negative way.in summary, if you don't like happy endings go read hemingway; however, if you enjoy action-filled, thought-provoking, suspense-building, adrenaline-pumping sagas with visual effects and plot-lines that paved the way for science fiction as we know it. go out right now and rent or buy the greatest movie of all time: Star Wars VI: The Return of the Jedi.",

Meanwhile, on the planet of Tatooine, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are representing Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) by a message, and trying to convince Jabba the Hutt to release Han Solo from being frozen in carbonate, but he does not listen. Disguised Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) does release Han, and Luke shows up, having to face a giant monster, but the eventually escape with the help of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), and Leia strangles Jabba to death. Luke quickly returns to the Degobah system to see master Yoda (voiced and performed by The Muppets' Frank Oz, aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear) where he confirms Darth Vader is Luke's father, and he speaks of another Skywalker, before naturally dying. This other Ben (Obi-Won) Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) says is Luke's sister, and he realises it's Leia. When they get back to the Rebels, they see the plan to destroy the shield generators of the new Death Star (from plans) by destroying the satellite on the planet Endor. Meanwhile, after a little rapid speed hover craft chase and meeting the cute and cuddly (for kids) Ewoks, Luke tells Leia of his revelation, before leaving to face Vader. He hands himself in to the Empire, and soon enough, Vader takes him to the psychopathic Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). As the battle between the Rebels and Empire goes on outside, and the Emperor convinces him of his friends being in danger, Luke eventually catches his light sabre to have a fight with Darth Vader, and release the Dark Side that the Emperor wants to see. Eventually, Han, Leia and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) knock out the satellite power, and Lando in the Millennium Falcon head for the centre of the Death Star. Luke ends the fight after cutting his father's hand off, and refuses to join the Dark Side, to which the Emperor starts electrocuting him with his Syth power. Darth Vader has a sudden change of heart though when he grabs the still electrocuting Emperor and tosses him off the edge. In his dying moments, he asks Luke to take his mask off so he can see him with his own eyes, and you see why he wheres the mask, and then he dies. Lando meanwhile reach the centre, blow it up, Luke gets away just in time, and the Death Star explodes. The ending has Darth Vader, or Anakin Skywalker rather, cremated, and everyone having fun at the concluding party, where Luke sees all three people that have helped him, the ghosts of Ben, Yoda, and of course, his father. Also starring Sebastian Shaw as Anakin Skywalker. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound and a Special Achievement Award (for visual effects), and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Sound.

The whole first act is a slow burner, hooking the audience before the second portion of the film begins.During a brief visit to the swamp world of Dagobah, Luke witnesses his little green mentor, Yoda, die, but not before a huge revelation is made, that he in fact has a sister (wonder who that could be huh?)The second portion of the film is then staged, our heroes alongside the Rebellion hatch a master plan to take down the new Death Star and cripple the Empire for good. But of course it's not that easy, hiccups along the way there are but alas somehow the Rebellion pulls it off, the second Death Star is destroyed, the Empire is indeed mortally crippled..., but that isn't the biggest story.Luke confronts his father one last time in the presence of the Emperor, mortally wounded and inches away from certain death, Luke calls out to his father, grasping tightly at any goodness that may be left in the half-man half-robot, just as you think it's all over, Vader rises up and throws the Emperor to his death, fatally wounding himself in the process.The cycle is complete, the former Anakin Skywalker has come good and redeemed himself, dying in his sons arms.Like all three of the original Star Wars films, Return of the Jedi has an ace plot and a very simple story that doesn't take much to understand.The visual effects are, as should be expected, at a very high standard: Jabba's sail barge, his palace in the desert, the design of the second Death Star, everything is immaculately polished and just looks REAL.Han and Leia's love cycle is wrapped up at the end, and we wish them a very happy life together (until The Force Awakens came along and completely spoiled it) A lovely film there by George Lucas, and not even the obligatory tampering and changes he has to make to all his film's could spoil it.You want a genuine film that can make you smile and fill you with a satisfying sense of nostalgia, well my friend just watch Return of the Jedi.",

The books deal with some of those issues.I, for one, am very disappointed that the third trilogy may never appear on the silver screen.  I want to see what happens next in Lucas's eyes, not in the eyes of the novels' authors.Postscript:  I don't care how many people hated the Ewoks!  They served exactly the purpose Lucas wanted them to--to be the bunny by the side of the road that saves the big bad monster from certain death.  Sometimes fairy tales just have to work backward, and usually those are the ones that are most interesting!

The long awaited last film of the Star Wars universe ends well but falters slightly on the way. Strong detail and a quick drive pushes the plot forward, hitting a bump when the Ewoks make their appearance. Han and Leia's mission's halted by the furry little creatures, spoiling what we want to see with what George Lucas wants us to see. The humans' story is sacrificed by the Ewok's screen time. At least a spectacular big space battle and Luke's personal endeavor compensates for the events on Endor. One small blip won't trouble the fans too much.",

There's little to go at this point and the forest moon of endor is a bit plain compared to Tattooine. I like the Ewoks I just think they should have been contextualized better.And Luke is a bit...gone. He's become this kind of monk, he's a bit full of himself.

            "content": "Return of the Jedi is an excellent conclusion to George Lucas' Star Wars saga. It brilliantly closes all loose ends and characters arcs (even one created decades later, that of Anakin/Vader) in an elegant way with an entertaining story. While it may seem slow at times, this is not only necessary and includes interesting character development but also works as build up for the big epic finale.The mission free Han Solo has great build-up and its awesome to see so many interesting creatures, all of which still look convincing even today. It's also effective at establishing that Luke has changed; no longer is he a rash, reckless teenager, but calculating and calm. While some have argued against the logistics of Luke's plan, it could be argued that he's using his Jedi foresight and was trying to get Han out with as little casualties as possible. The scenes on Dagobah are very emotionally effective (my only grievance being that I wish these were at the beginning of the film and that Luke had been training with Yoda between the movies), the scene with Vader sensing Luke aboard Shuttle Tydirium has so much tension, and the Ewoks add comic relief to an otherwise pretty dark film. Both the space battle and ground battle on Endor are entertaining, but definitely the best part of this film and why it deserves a 10 star rating is the finale with Luke, Darth Vader, and the Emperor. It is Star Wars at its finest, with an intense battle between the light and dark sides of the force, both externally and internally. Darth Vader and Luke's conversation before boarding the Death Star is a perfect scene that successfully turns someone people regarded as a complete monster, Darth Vader, into a sympathetic character, and it shows us just how much Luke has grown. Sidious toying with Luke, the lightsaber duel for Anakin's soul (while not as entertaining as the duel in the previous film, this battle is more about the emotion and characters then it is the fight), Luke's completion of his journey to becoming a Jedi Knight, and Anakin's return and redemption is all magnificent. Vader's redemption is my favorite scene of any film ever, a perfect masterpiece, and with the context of the prequels it has even more weight: Anakin finally fulfills the prophecy of The Chosen One and brings balance to the force by destroying the Sith while also learning how to let go of things. Anakin's death is incredibly poignant; it's almost unbelievable how one film managed to make people feel sad over the death of one of cinema's greatest villains, and yet, it worked, and it worked beautifully.As usual for the Lucas' Star Wars saga, Return of the Jedi pushes the envelope for special effects, with visuals that are a feast for the eyes. The soundtrack by John Willaims is also perfect and the performances are top-notch. The special edition changes are hit or miss. I despite Jedi Rocks and Vader saying \"Nooooo!\", but I like other additions like making Anakin's force ghost Hayden Christensen (as well as removing Anakin's eyebrows) and the new Sarlacc.Overall, Return of the Jedi is great, and for me, the true ending to Star Wars.",

            "content": "After The Empire Strikes Back, which built masterfully on the success of the first Star Wars film -- deepening characters, fleshing out the universe in grand and dramatic space-opera fashion, and adding more ambitious themes about the true nature of heroism -- Return is a significant letdown.On the plus side: it has some enjoyable action sequences and fun special effects. Also, particularly with some brief scenes added at the end after the prequels were made, it manages to do a respectable job of drawing the narrative threads to a close.On the minus side: the Jabba the Hutt episode at the beginning is overstuffed with wacky creatures that are not as interesting as the filmmakers seem to think, and is simply not compelling enough to justify all the space it takes up. (Princess Leia's infamous slave girl costume during these sequences, however, does get the fan-boy seal of approval.) The principle aliens that show up later on are too cutesy to take seriously, especially when they suddenly 'get religion' at a critical point in the narrative. Perhaps most disappointing, the beginnings of a deeper and more challenging characterization of Luke from Empire seem to have been largely abandoned in favor of rather slapdash moral drama. When the forces of evil try to trap Luke in an emotional vice near the end of the film, they are so heavy-handed and obvious about it that it's quite hard to take them as seriously as the logic of the story seems to demand. (I have a similar problem with Darth Vader's conversion to the Dark Side in Revenge of the Sith, although that film has a far more convincing tone overall.)If you're just in it for the gosh-wow, and love the wacky critters, you'll probably enjoy it. It does also feature the Millennium Falcon, which has to count for something.But, yes, in case you are wondering, I find even The Phantom Menace to be a significantly deeper, more compelling, and overall much more enjoyable science fantasy film experience. Give me Jar-Jar over Ewoks (they were supposed to be Wookies, dang it!) any day of the week. Besides, Menace has Qui-Gon, the most spectacularly pointless fusion power plant in the history of cinema (or whatever it is -- but notice how similar it looks to the interiors of the Death Star and to the underbelly of the Cloud City, also settings for crucial light-saber duels; I believe Lucas has dreams of this place), and an evil emperor (to be) who is a convincingly diabolical threat to everything good in the universe.",

This movie, on the other hand, is little more than mediocre. The first 35 minutes is spent on a drawn out rescue mission that is stretched to the point of tedium and has maybe 3 interesting or noteworthy moments. That's an entire third of the movie wasted on something that should've taken half the time. How anyone can call the opening of 'Revenge of the Sith' too long while defending this is anyone's guess.After that, we get some truly cringe dialogue and character interactions that make no sense. The one that hits you in the face like a sledgehammer is the relationship between Lando and Han Solo. Like, okay, I could understand Han forgiving Lando for what happened in episode 5, but for God's sake *actually include the forgiveness scene.* Han doesn't even seem to care that Lando was the reason why HE WAS TORTURED. They become instant best buddies chumming it up out of nowhere. It's like he's saying \"Hey man, I know you screwed us over and almost got us all killed before, but oh well boys will be boys amirite?\"As for the climax, the space battle is pretty good, and the scenes between Vader, Luke, and the Emperor are the best parts of the movie by far. The fight against the Empire on Endor, on the other hand, is bloody awful. There are exactly 0 stakes in anything, and we essentially get a pack of teddy bears beating up the empire by throwing rocks. There's no tension, and the \"struggle to win\" is played as a joke.How is this the 80th best movie ever made? I bet you there are 10 thousand better films than this one (at least!)\nIt seems as though only episode 5 actually deserves the praise it gets - that movie is legitimately great. The rest of the original trilogy falls well short of the God-tier quality people attribute to it - and episode 6 is the worst offender by far. It seems like this movie is playing with house money; and not in any positive way where the story takes some risks. Instead, it feels as though not enough effort is put into this, and very poor writing choices are made with far too much confidence. This is a movie that doesn't attempt to hide its flaws, they are all out in the open and blatant - as if the bad writing was intentional.",

This is the film 2001 a space odyssey could have been. It surprises, it delights, it inspires. Highpoints to note: Sarlaac pit rescue (stolen by Hamill , using his thespian talents to give us the most convincing and devastating portrayal of a Jedi to date),the final scenes with Yoda( beautifully directed by Marquand; sensitive yet empowering),the climactic father and son confrontation (I dare anybody to say they didn't feel a chill go down their spine as Vadar hissed the word ` sister? '), Admiral Ackbar's scene-stealing charisma (surely the greatest performance ever given by an amphibian ), but it will surely be the Endor scenes which Lucas will be remembered for !! Who didn't leap out of their seats as the ramshackle collection of ewoks stole victory from the jaws of defeat, dismissing an entire legion of the Emperor's finest imperial troops?

After a massive fight the attention turns to Darth Vadar who Luke hopes to bring back from the dark side.RETURN OF THE JEDI is the weakest of the original three films but don't for a second think that it's a bad movie. In fact, it's another very good entry in the series and for the most part it's a nice way to end the original trilogy. This film, once again, tries to be even bigger than the previous one, which it is in many ways but at the same time there's no denying that you start to feel the 134 minute running time.Still, there are so many great moments here that you can't help but get caught up in everything going on. You've got Hamill, Fisher, Billy Dee Williams and Ford all in top-gear and they obviously deliver strong performances. Chewbacca is back and naturally steals every scene that he's in. The action scenes are some of the best of the series with the stuff in outer space looking 100% authentic but we also get some fun stuff on land including the aircraft race through the forest.Yoda, R2-D2 and C-3PO are all return but we're also introduced to the Ewoks. It seems fans are split on how \"good\" they are. I'm sure kids loved seeing these little creatures and while I won't deny they're cute, at the same time I'm not sure how much they add.

It ties up all the loose ends and also has a lot of memorable outstanding moments.Luke and Leia travel to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, where he is still trapped in carbonite. The Emperor meanwhile is overseeing the construction of a larger and more powerful Death Star. Also he is planning on assisting Darth Vader in turning Luke over to the dark side of the force.The characters are great once again. Luke is great as a true Jedi Knight and really has matured greatly over the films. Leia continues to be a strong female character which pleases feminists all over the world. Solo comes full circle and truly is helping the rebel alliance as well as others and learns to care for others instead of just for himself. Vader also gets to develop more of a good side as he talks with Luke.Once again there are a lot of great new characters as well. Jabba the Hutt appears for the first time. Huge, disgusting, and vile, he really is one of the most memorable characters from Star Wars. Overall I think Jabba may be the most disgusting character from a film and makes for a unique style of villain.The Emperor makes his first physical appearance in a film in this film. (Empire Strikes Back he is in but just as a hologram so this is his first real appearance.) As a bad guy he is legendary. Completely obsessed with the dark side of the force, there is nothing good about him. You do not get characters more evil than this.There are a lot of great scenes in this film. Like the entire sarlacc pit scene, Luke's battle with the Rancor, the speeder bike scene, and tons of other scenes. The effects in this film are great for the time it was made.One complaint though. THe Ewoks show up for the first time. While I think that the one Ewok, Wicket, is cool, I really can not stand the rest of the clan. THey are just little furry bears that I think do not fit in the film. The entire idea of them being able to hold their own against the Empire's troops may seem like a good message of determination and courage, but I think it is a joke. I could have gone without the Ewoks, they make it seem too childish.I do not want to say too much about this film, it is great though. Not as good as The Empire Strikes Back in my opinion but easily the second best from the original trilogy and one that I highly recommend.",

Meanwhile on Tatooine Luke and the gang are attempting to rescue Han, who is still frozen in Carbonite, from Jabba the Hutt. Things don't appear to be going according to plan as most of them get captured and Jabba plans to execute most them by throwing them in to a pit inhabited by a strange beast. Leah however was put in a very skimpy costume and chained to Jabba which might be a fate worse than death. Not too surprisingly our heroes escape and head back to the rebel fleet.On the way Luke pays a visit to a very old friend on Dagobah to finish his training but he is told that he has finished but to become a Jedi he must face Darth Vader once more. He gets back to the fleet as they are planning their attack on the new Death Star. Before the main assault can take place they must disable the shield generator on the planet below, a mission will me lead by our heroes.On the planet they meet a strange race of creatures known as Ewoks who after a little misunderstanding is sorted out trust the group and help them confront the Imperial forces. Luke however realises that Vader is there and knows his presence is endangering the mission so he surrenders and is taken to Vader who flies with him to the Death Star where he meets the emperor and has his final battle against Darth Vader whilst the rebel fleet is attacking.As with all the original Star Wars films the isn't the cluttered CGI of the new films however some of the once great effects took dated as the blue screen scenes are fairly obvious, they are still exciting though, especially the chase though the forest on \"speeder-bikes\".

It's an emotional journey, to be sure, more emotional than the first two films, but it offers enough excitement and humour to make it great diversionary entertainment. The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters. With the directing reins now turned over to Richard Marquand (hired for this gig based on his direction of the thriller \"Eye of the Needle\"), the story is broken into a few major set pieces.Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian and others reunite to rescue their good friend Han Solo from the decadent palace of loathsome alien slug Jabba the Hutt, the powerful crime kingpin for whom Han had once smuggled goods. The action moves to Dagobah, where Luke confronts Yoda over the matter of his parentage, and on to the woodsy moon of Endor where the Rebels are plotting to destroy the shield that the Empire is using to protect its latest Death Star battle station. And Luke finally has the confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the deadly, seductive Emperor (a deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid) that Ben and Yoda had insisted would be inevitable.While lacking the innovative nature of the first film, and dark, more mature quality of the second, this entry does bring a satisfying conclusion to the saga, in the spirit of those old adventure serials of decades past. John Williams' music is as rousing as it's ever been, and the filmmakers once again plunge us into an assortment of different environments (desert, swamp, forest, etc.) The chase and battle sequences are truly breathtaking and impressive. The early scenes in Jabbas' palace allow the creature and makeup departments to come up with moments that can rival the memorable cantina segment from \"Star Wars\". That brings this review to the matter of the Ewoks, those fuzzy teddy bears whom a fair amount of the audience profess to hate. All this viewer can say is that he's never had a problem with them.Particularly enjoyable is the resolution to Luke's relationship with Vader, as the black clad villain rediscovers his humanity when forced to make a choice. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't bring up certain scenes with Leia, which have intrigued scores of boys and men over the years.\"Return of the Jedi\" may not be as good as its predecessors overall, but it's still quite a bit of fun.Eight out of 10.",

I'm probably letting nostalgia get in the way, but the Ewoks never bothered me. I can see why people don't like them, and I know that the idea of teddy bears using bolas and sticks to defeat highly trained soldiers is ridiculous. But hey, at least it wasn't Jar Jar and I'll take the Ewoks over Jar-Jar any day of the week. All in all, I love Return of the Jedi just like I love the other two films in the trilogy.Story: After rescuing Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt, Luke Skywalker and Leia rejoin the Rebel Alliance to destroy the 2nd Death Star while Luke prepares for his final challenge to confront his father, Darth Vader and the Emperor.What makes this movie great? Like I said in my review of the first Star Wars movie: the characters and the story are the main focus and not the spectacle. The acting once again delivers 100% with Mark Hamill giving in my opinion probably his best performance as Luke Skywalker in the entire trilogy. Luke has matured at this point in the trilogy, more patient and the scene where he first uses his new green light saber at the Sarlaac pit is so awesome. Harrison Ford once again is great as Han Solo with the character being more mature in this one than the first two outings. Carrie Fisher once again is great, and I remember the first time I was watching this and the revelation of Leia being Luke's sister really surprised me. Billy Dee Williams once again brings his own charm as Lando, and Ian McDiarmid is really great at playing Emperor Palpatine.There are so many other things that work in this movie: the Sarlaac Pit sequence, Yoda telling Luke there is another Skywalker which Luke learns through the spirit of Obi Wan that it's Leia, the speeder bike chase on Endor and the space battle where Lando destroys the 2nd Death Star. But most of all the final confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader with the Emperor relentlessly taunting Luke with lines such as \"Use your aggressive feelings boy! Let the hate flow through you!\" Luke of course has learned to use the discipline that he learned from Yoda and Obi Wan and not give in, and tries to get Darth Vader to come back from the dark side. But Luke nearly falls into the dark side when Darth Vader threatens to turn Leia to the dark side and Luke loses it and cuts off Vader's hand. Luke stops himself and refuses to give into the dark side, and the Emperor responds by shooting lighting out of his hands at Luke. Then comes in probably my favorite scene in the entire movie: while the Emperor is electrocuting Luke, the camera pans up to Darth Vader's mask showing Vader looking back to the Emperor and back to Luke, and all of a sudden he lifts the Emperor and throws him down the reactor pit and the Emperor dies. The reason why I love this part so much is that the way the camera focuses on Darth Vader with the music playing in the background, the audience gets the impression that Vader's conflicted and then without saying a word, he decides that he will not let Palpatine kill his son, and is redeemed (Whatever you say, don't even get me started about the change George Lucas made in this scene). I have to admit, the scene where Luke removes Vader's mask gets me a bit emotional, especially when Vader says \"You were right about me\".Watching this again recently made me realize how great and underrated this movie is despite the common complaint about the Ewoks. Again, the Ewoks don't really bother me and the Yub Nub song (the one before came another change I'd rather not talk about) makes me feel like a little kid again. This film works terrifically as the final chapter in the original trilogy with the character arcs ending on a positive note for the main characters and all is right with the galaxy. \"Return of the Jedi\", along with the other two will always have a special place in my heart. This set of movies shaped my life in so many ways and gave me so many great experiences with my friends who also loved Star Wars, and my Dad who saw them in theaters back in the 70's and 80's and even my Mom (though she isn't really into Star Wars, even after she watched them with me. But it was worth a try). Regardless of how much hate George Lucas gets these days because of the prequels and \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", people need to watch this and the other two original films again to be reminded of how great a saga George Lucas gave to the world. This is in my opinion one of the best conclusions in any trilogy, and like I said about the Ewoks, the fans need to let that go. In light of the recent news of Episode 7 currently in the works, let's hope whoever decides to direct the new trilogy in the future can bring back the spirit of Star Wars that was missing from the prequel trilogy.",

Where the film does succeed is a sense of humour when the first half concentrates on the droids R2D2 and the camp and cowardly C3PO as they find themselves at the mercy of Jabba . Some fans of the series might complain that this loses some of the darkness that EMPIRE contained but as someone who isn't this was welcomed by me since it makes the film more watchable as a neutral audience member The story then jumps to the forest world of Endor which is populated by Ewoks . Lucas is on record as saying a technologically advanced power being beaten by a backward guerrilla force was inspired by Vietnam and you can see the parallels to an extent and while you won't be reminded of APOCALYPSE NOW you are aware that that Cameron had the same idea with AVATAR but at least the scenes on Endor don't suffer from the ponderous effects laden self importance we got with CameronRETURN OF THE JEDI ends the trilogy that became part of a great number of peoples childhoods . I was never taken too much by the STAR WARS films though I was impressed by the costume design and I can see why so many people fell in love with the original movies . They are entertaining where the story telling and special effects compliment one another rather than the story being written around the effects and set pieces as happens in so many films in the 21st Century so even for nostalgic reasons I can understand he affection the films are held in . Just a pity Lucas had to go and ruin things by later making a trilogy of product placement",

From the Droid Torture Chamber to Jabba the Hutt's \"Party Palace\" to the \"Rancor\", the Movie Starts almost like a Horror Film.The Middle with the Ewoks is Cringe Worthy Cuteness and of course the \"Ending\" with Father and Son is Extremely Melodramatic. The Emperor's attempted Killing of Luke and His Taunting to Embrace the Dark Side is Excruciatingly Drawn Out.The Fluctuating Feelings and Changing Tapestry throughout the Movie render a somewhat Clunky Tonality to the Overall Effort.There are still Plenty of Things to Admire in the Production. The Space Battle Sequences and other SFX Heavy Scenes, like the Speeder Bikes can Impress even Today.The Film can also be Burdened with the Enormous Popularity and Excellence of \"Empire\" and the Groundbreaking Awe of the First Film. These are only a Few of the Reasons that \"Jedi\" doesn't quite measure up to the Previous Pictures.The Movie did make more Money, because of the Growing Fan Base, and the Anticipatory Aspect of the Intervening Three Year Wait. While not a Perfect Finale to the Trilogy it is still a Fine Effort and can Entertain Cultists and Newbies with its Rich Legacy and Retro Appeal.",

            "content": "I think you can't really say this was ended poorly, and its quite the feat to end (the trilogy) such a franchise. And it definitely got me emotional during the ending celebratory festivities. An extremely well done story, with beautifully done characters and in a fantastic fantasy rich world with a exceptional score. What more can you ask for? Harry Potter and Star Wars are the only two franchises in the world that have had such a strong influence, and they deserve it.Now about this movie, now having completed my Star Wars watching journey, viewing all films from 1-6 as an adult, and not just childhood memories (primarily the prequels) I can definitely see that this movie showed a lot more of George Lucas's more ''out there'' ideas and decisions. From Chewbacca yelling the Tarzan call out to the super cute Ewoks. Compared to the previous movies this one felt a lot more ''prequel'' than the others as weird as that sounds.Is that bad? Not really, perhaps having seen the prequels its a little less jarring, but I still found these elements to be enjoyable (albeit the Tarzan yell was a bit of an eye roll).First this movie starts off in jabba's palace and I love that entire sequence, such a fun starter and with some nice twists to get everyone together again. Boba's demise was a bit awkward I think could've been handled more elegantly because he had quite a significant role in both films (mostly in the ROTJ). Him just rolling in the sarlacc pit was..eh. And this is honestly where another critique of my lays, Palpatine's death was incredibly underwhelming in my opinion, Vader just throws him into another endless pit (they should stop building those ;). Ofcourse before the prequels Palpatine had very little screen time so I guess they didn't care to give him a longer death scene.Another thing I had with this movie that I felt that it moved a bit slow around the midsection, before/during the ewok scenes. The other 2 films never had a real slow moment in them for me, the witty dialog would keep me busy or something else. In this movie I also found myself laughing a lot less and not enjoying the dialog as much, there are some odd scenes where characters feel a bit robotic. A notable one for was where Han and Lando say goodbye and Han lets Lando use his MF to attack the new death star. The dialog there felt edited oddly and very wooden.The directing was fine, I wasn't as amazed by the cinematography in this movie, I still think ANH has the best cinematography of the prequels and sequels.Also, I loved the twist of the death star actually being operational, did not see that coming. Too bad they only use it once though and is never really seen being used again.The fight between Luke and Vader when luke comes out of the shadows is amazing, the soundtrack there and how its shot gave me goosebumps, my favorite scene of the film, the entire confrontation with Vader and Luke are my favorite parts really.Now what about the Ewoks? I loved them, I mean.. I succumbed to the cuteness of them, so that wasn't the issue, but fact like I mentioned before is that they should've shortened the Ewok sections a lot more. Also now that I remember it, the speeder section suffered from the same issue of just dragging on for a little too long.All in all, I finished my journey watching all Star Wars movies and am super happy with how I feel about them, I was afraid I'd hate the prequels, and be overhyped for the OT.. But both of that didn't happen. Did the prequels have issues, yes.. a lot, were they still extremely enjoyable though, yes! Moving on to the OT from them just elevates that with better characters and better writing! If the OT has one thing its actor synergy/compatibility, thet mesh so well together and it just feels real.My full rating for all six movies go like this:1: 7.52: 63: 84: 105: 96: 9\nFor the sequels.. I fill need to see the finale for that but I don't think it will top either the OT or Prequels for me.SIDENOTE: Regarding the OT I watched the 2011 editions, with added CGI and slightly edited scenes. Some added CGI was a little too much, especially the stuff on Tatooine, but regarding the rest I felt perfectly fine with it. I think it helped watching 1-6 in order because you are already adjusted to the standard of CGI in the prequels, thus there isn't really a visible transition to the CGI in the OT.I definitely think some edits were needed and really good as well though compared to the original versions.",

Yes, Welcome to Return of the Jedi - the episode where Luke starts to dress like a guest at a wake and nearly gets eaten by an unconvincing stop motion animated monster.It all looked very bleak for Luke and company at the end of EMPIRE, and now its looking like game over as the Empire build a second Death Star, a moon sized can of whoop-ass. Return of the Jedi also sees the return of the incredible stupidity with which they quite reasonably had become associated, only this time its the Empire's turn to leave their brains at the door. Hedging his bets in a big way, the Emperor (Ian McDarmid), decides the easiest way to wipe out the rebellion is to tell them where the new Death Star is, how to destroy it and where they can disable its protective shield. The plan hinges on the ability to the Imperial forces to wipe out the rebel fleet. So why is he so confident? A look at history should have given all concerned a bad feeling about this. These are the troops that a hundred strong can't lay a single hit on an untrained boy and a taped down 19 year girl (A New Hope), these are the star-destroyers that can't capture a single ship (Empire Strikes Back) and hang on, aren't these the same Imperial forces that lost the original Death Star to a farmer with a penchant for bombing womprats 'in the caverns back home'? It all looks like a cock up of epic proportions and sure enough it is only this time the Empire is up against forces even more sinister than girls, farmers or old men... Say Hello to the Ewoks - Teddy Bears armed with sticks, rocks and swing ropes. An Empire this damn unprepared doesn't deserve to survive so their end must be a welcome relief for them as well as us. Admiral Needa certainly looks as if hes had enough.Jedi is a feel good conclusion to the original trilogy but isn't as tight as its predecessor. Before we can get into the meat of the plot they're is unresolved business with Jabba the Hut to get through. Thus the first 40 minutes of Jedi looks like an explosion in a puppet factory as Lucas and puppet director Marquand (bullied and undermined throughout apparently) opt for a child friendly environment at the expense of a harder edge, with one eye firmly on the cash tills. Blue Elephants, bletching alien frogs and a horrid creature that laughs like an evil old woman provide the 'menace', while Luke's rendezvous with the Rancor will scare all those who can stop laughing for long enough to watch.Once thats out of the way the story moves to Redeeming Anakin Skywalker/Vader, destroying the Emperor and camping in the forests of Endor. Lucas returns to his favourite theme of the a high tech enemy being overwhelmed and defeated by a low tech, god faring opposition (was he on the American's side in Vietnam I wonder?). Fans looking for the dark character dynamics of the previous episode have to wade through a lot of kiddie friendly cuteoids (its a word now, OK?), almost compensated for by MacDarmid's terrific turn as the Emperor. Vader's redemption seems a bit forced with the benefit of hindsight, taking just an hour of screen time, a bit of amateur reverse psychology from Luke and the sons impending death to reverse years of ingrained evil doing. There are precious new elements to the story too thanks to the decision to stick with the original climax despite it having been already used in Episode IV. So alls well that ends well and its good to know that despite having been complicit in the death of millions and being a right bastard for most of his life, killing the Emperor and saying sorry was all that was needed to join the happy glow-lucky Jedi afterlife.Gives us all new hope doesn't it?*Some notes on the 1997 Special Edition*The pit of carcoon looks a bit like Audrey II from Little shop of Horrors thanks to some ill advised digital additions and the musical number that Lucas thought \"might be funny\" in the middle of a Star Wars film, isn't. We all know what George's sense of humour can produce - the likes of Jar Jar Binks. The nights must fly by in the Lucas household. The extended finale works quite nicely, tieing the film to the prequel trilogy and makes for a more universally satisfactory conclusion. This is one film however that looks set to be in a constant state of revision. At time of writing in 2003 there are reports that Lucas is planning further additions, such as scenes of Padme being pasted in (during the Luke/Leia conversation perhaps?). Fine George, just don't add the prefix \"Indiana Jones and the...\" to the title OK?",

Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, and the Empire Strikes Back it's now time for Return Of The Jedi. I thought A New Hope was the weakest one, okay it's the oldest one and so the special effects are not of the same level as more recent ones but the truth is that the later ones are just of better quality in every domain. the Empire Strikes Back was already a bit better and so is Return Of The Jedi but still not of the same quality as the others. I probably watched it as a kid and gave up after that as it's just not that good. I don't know why this one gets such a high rating, it's definitely not better than any of the previous titles mentioned. I agree that the used special effects at that time might have looked good for 1983 but still it doesn't make it better. For that the story and the acting were just not of the same quality. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing.The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One that I thought was of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the eighth movie of eleven in barely 72 hours for me, next one today will be the series The Mandalorian as I saw they recommend you to watch it between Return Of The Jedi and The Force Awakens if you want to watch it in chronological order. I'm sure the quality will be even better as it's so more recent, looking forward to it.",

The Emperor is so unfathomably twisted it's sick he's worse than the Wicked Witch of the West, the Evil Stepmother, and that kid from the Omen all rolled into one. But damn he's so cool. I guess that's why he's in every Star Wars movie except \"A New Hope\". Lucas probably had a field day dreaming him up. I still can't understand why he didn't make the top ten villain list he deserves a spot no doubt about it in my mind. Maybe since the last three they will realize they have made a mistake and put him in. He's a really good actor probably the most talented of the bunch.

That is just an epic portion of the movie! Very iconic moments in Jabba's palace and the pit in the desert. That part never gets old, and has stuck with me since childhood. Leah in a skimpy slave bikini and a chain, which she later uses to strangle the fat turd? AWESOME. Boba Fett being eaten? Sad, but funny. The warning of Yoda to Luke about the dark powers of the Emperor? AWESOME. I used to rewind and play this over and over with that forbidding music and warnings. Actually meeting the Emperor in his sinister lair, with all that great and evil dialogue? LOVED IT. Amazing ending to a great saga. I am still quoting(and so is Family guy and everyone else) Palpatine to this day, and people who didn't like his acting are just crazy in my opinion LOL. Incredible characters.The Bad= The rehashed Death Star destruction plot(which is now getting absurd with the new movies), the wasted time on Endor with silly kid crap.The Ugly= The ewoks killing stormtroopers and AT-STs with logs, sticks, and stones-- absolutely retarded. Snuggles bears running around everywhere talking like jawas and throwing primitive weapons at armored troops twice their size-- come on, people. Apparently, Lucas worked all this in to sell a bunch of cute kids toys and collectibles, and they still are fun to laugh at, but could have been written into the story in a more credible and less distracting role. They ruin the dark themes and the suspension of disbelief in places, which many folks have noted.Overall= Amazing film with a ton of MEMORABLE scenes and quotes. This could have easily been the best film of the entire series(even beating Empire), if Lucas had opted to stick to the gritty realism and dark subject matter, and didn't stray into a goofy cartoon in the middle portion of the movie. It is still one of my favorite movies of all time, however, and holds a high place in cinema and Star Wars history.",

            "review_title": "A fitting conclusion to a masterful franchise",
            "content": "After the technological innovation that was the original 1977 space opera Star Wars, and its convention-defying, unbelievably dark sequel The Empire Strikes Back, my expectations for the conclusion of the iconic franchise, Return of the Jedi, were soaring into galaxies far, far away. Not long after, I fell back to Earth somewhat wowed but considerably disappointed. Return of the Jedi is a solid end to the franchise, competent, alleviating, and without a doubt, intriguing, but simultaneously bland and underwhelming. To, yet again, quote Dante Hicks from the everlasting Clerks, \"all Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.\" Of course, that's a vast oversimplification of what the film really features, but it's not an inaccurate statement. The last thing I ever expected to call a Star Wars picture is artificial-looking, but it must be said. Occasionally, the film will have points of sheer beauty and marvellous technology. Consider the briskly-paced sequence where Luke and Leia race through the forestry, evading a slew of enemies closely on their tale. Yet, frequently, much of the film looks like it was shot on the backlots of studios where the presence of a fully-designed set was dually noted. The mystifying qualities about space's contents and other-worldly galaxies seems to have been traded for modestly-interesting scenes, confined to solid land mimicking that of a forest preserve. It looks good. Not beautiful.The second issue comes when we spend much of the film either listening to Ewokese or dealing with the language's speakers, the Ewoks, which don't even seem to belong in a Star Wars. The past gangs of creatures we've had to see, whether it be the Jawas or the Ugnaughts, were at least interesting, mysterious creatures. The Ewoks possess a cute, cuddly, warm persona that feels alien (pun intended) to the world of Star Wars. Not to mention, they often feel like cute, cuddly distractions to the more interesting plot developments and set-ups we're dealing with here.For example, the drama between Luke Skywalker (reprised by Mark Hamill) and his newfound father Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) would've been the perfect thing to predicate this entire film on, rather than more or less shifting it to the side so we can watch the gaggle of Ewoks interact with their own culture and the new humans placed in the middle of it.Another thing I began to start to get frustrated at with The Empire Strikes Back is its focus on the cutesy relationship between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia (Carrie Fisher). There's really no surprise that there is a relationship in \"the greatest franchise in history,\" but did it have to be this hesitant, restrained, and plodded out for three movies? Because both characters refuse to recognize their feelings strongly until the second movie, we get an abundance of joking dialog, senseless banter, and redundant little arguments between the two that easily become more obnoxiously spliced in than entertaining. This relationship either needed to not have begun or been greatly minimized here. Not shifted more towards the foreground.However, I fear I'm making Return of the Jedi sound like the worst movie-going experience this side of the Millennium Falcon. There are still scenes of genuine ambition and prevalent imagination here, and the fact that George Lucas co-wrote this picture Empire writer Lawrence Kasdan gives more of the vibe that Lucas wrapped this story up the he wanted to. While Empire, my personal favorite of the original trilogy, benefited tremendously from Lucas' bravery in welcoming new talent to the film, it's nice to see the original pioneer, regardless of my opinions on him, finish what he started and finish it the way he wants it. I can respect that above all. Even the director at hand here, Richard Marquand, is given a nice range of variety, regardless of whether or not it's good variety. There is still a respectable amount of creativity and life in this project, despite its gradual inferiority to its predecessors.The Star Wars films, as stated in my blog post before I finally sat down to watch them, formally stood as an annoying little blind spot in my rear-view that I was too lazy to wipe clean. When I finally did, I realized what I was missing. When you see this films in present day, there still is no lost wonder or the overwhelming feeling of datedness. It feels just as fresh, moving, and powerful as a thrilling sci-fi epic made in recent time. Return of the Jedi isn't necessarily the way I wanted the entire series to end (for, I would've rather had some more of the unrelenting darkness and bleak storytelling Empire used to its success), yet I simply can't bring myself to say I didn't like the film mainly because I feel that it's a pretty creative piece in and of itself. It's a fine movie that deserves its place in history, regardless of my opinion.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and James Earl Jones (voice). Directed by: Richard Marquand.",

            "content": "\"Return of the Jedi\" always struck me as the weakest of the trilogy but after the groundbreaking first opus and its spectacular sequel of Shakespearian undertones, I wonder if any third film wasn't deemed to be the lesser one anyways, if only be default. In many aspects, its status equals its chronological rank, but that doesn't say much. It is compared to masterpieces, it's nothing short of a masterpiece itself as far as sequels go, and it's still better than all the prequels put together. Still, I didn't like it at first.And I knew to which direction I could point an accusing finger: the Ewoks. I thought the film lost all its credibility with these cute cuddly creatures that look like a crossover between the CareBears and the Gremlins. I couldn't believe that the evil galactic army would be defeated by a fistful of rebels helped by tribal furry warriors. As a matter of fact, I had a hard time taking seriously all the grotesque creatures populating the film, especially in Jabba's territory. But what does \"to take seriously\" mean anyway? I blamed so much Nolan for being so pompously dark in his film that I should only praise Lucas for not taking himself seriously, always finding the right balance between fun and gravity.This is a trilogy that miraculously appeals to children and grown-ups, adults become like children again marveled by the visuals while children can also appreciate the coming-of-age of Luke. The film doesn't provide the visual space opera extravaganza and the action is mostly on the ground from the battles in Jabba's dungeon to the sand creature and finally, the chase sequence across the forest, but the whole texture is different. The first sequel was mostly made of black and white, the second is all in brown and green tones, it exudes more adventurous vibes and if the film had lost the epic scale of the previous battles, and the rebellion turned more into a form of guerrilla, it's a credit to Lucas for having renewed the material while still keeping faithful to the heart of the story.Everybody's still here, and when the film begins, with another iconic introduction, we feel like meeting friends again, and this time, it seems like the relationships are all set up. Leia is in love with Han, Luke isn't the boyish Jedi wannabe but a mature warrior waiting for his time to come. And even Darth Vader seems to have evolved from the ruthless evil Lord to the fallen hero under the spell of the evil Emperor (Ian McDiermid). There's richness in both the backgrounds, the effects, the characterizations and the plot, and all these elements converge to a spectacular confrontation that never reuses the same material. The light saber confrontation was unavoidable but Lucas find the little twist to make the scene memorable, and ever since, it inspired countless parodies.So, something happened that I didn't expect, watching the film again, I actually enjoyed it. And the enjoyment was driven by an experience that was nowhere like \"The Empire Strikes Back\". The first sequel completed the initiation of Luke Skywalker and deployed more visual effects than the original; it also introduced us to Master Yoda as the driving Force of Luke. But what \"Jedi\" does is to reassemble all the pieces of the puzzle without giving that impression, and it took the exotic backdrop of the forest and the Ewoks' world to provide the film with its memorability stamp. But that still doesn't say why I suddenly enjoyed the film. Well, something changed in the Jabba's sequence.Jabba's voice and jargon and the translation from cowardly C3PO they made me feel this was a real language spoken and I had the exact same impression with the Ewoks. After all, isn't the film set in a galaxy, far far away, this is the best MacGuffin the film can have, anything is possible but Lucas find the way to make everything, if not believable, strangely plausible and maybe the mistake would have been to overlook these elements and keep it visually \"sci-fi\". I suspect George Lucas was a little carried away by the success of Indiana Jones and found the right way to differentiate \"Jedi\".And you can tell by the enthusiasm of Harrison Ford playing Han Solo, the little thing he does with his cheek when he smiles and his expressive eyebrow,s you can tell he has fun playing Han Solo, even when he's supposed to demonstrate anger. Ford injects a vitality and fun in the film that contrasts with the seriousness of Harmill; but even Harmill exudes a sense of maturity that confines to virile magnetism, something has changed in his eyes. As for Leia, she has her shining moment, and I'm not just talking about the bikini, but she's the one who defeats her ten-times her size Jabba, proof that girl power didn't wait for the Force to awaken. And at the end, Luke finally confronts his father and we get to have the inevitable unmasking moment, I wasn't sure I wanted to see Vader but ultimately, this was the film's highlight, after having bid farewell to Yoda, revealed the truth to Leia, he can watch his father one last time and his tender smile was perhaps his best acting in the trilogy, the proof that there was more than space opera in the film, it was also a Shakespearian father-and-son tragedy, there's \"Star Wars\" and there's \"The Godfather\", Michael Corleone and Anakin Skywalker, the most fascinating characters' arcs of Cinema's history.With this film, Lucas makes history again, closing the greatest trilogy of all time, scale and tone wise. The celebration at the end strikes for its anticlimactic and modest setting but it is comforting and emotionally rewarding, six years have passed since the first films, these characters evolved and became part of American myth and Cinema itself wouldn't be the same, forever.",

            "content": "The last \"Star Wars\" sequel avoids some, but not all, of the pitfalls that the series had so deftly steered around before. Luke (Hamill) must rescue his friend Solo (Ford) & foil the Empire's latest diabolical plot while facing down the demons in his own heritage. \"Return\" undermines one of the great strengths of the series--the excellence of its villains-- by introducing not one but TWO new ubervillains. One is the Emperor himself (McDiarmid), an arthritic, dermatoligically challenged fugitive from \"Kung Fu,\" while the other, wholly unrelated badguy is the giant, sexually depraved worm (yes, really a worm) Jabba the Hut. After slowly building a tough damsel-in-distress under her enveloping costumes in the first two films, Carrie Fisher is reduced to a harem-girl plaything for the huge, slimy puppet Jabba, which has to be some kind of record-setting low for an actress. Hamill, though talented, doesn't have the presence to be an epic hero while Ford is mostly reduced to comic relief. Much of the film is taken up by events on the planet Endor, a Disney Adventureland inhabited by teddy bears. Except for the rousing theme carried over from the earlier films, John Williams's music is heavy & ponderous to the point of parody. Still, \"Star Wars\" is about spectacular, heroic action & \"Return\" delivers, with the opening battle on Tattooine & the climactic space fleet action making up for the mushy molasses of Endor. Billy Dee Williams helps take up any heroic slack left by Hamill & Ford. As with the rest of the series, \"Return\" isn't science fiction but outer-space fantasy adventure, so forgive any pretense of technological or social commentary. \"Return\" is aimed at devotees of the \"Star Wars\" but is still an enjoyable thrill ride for anyone.",

It's a very pleasing finale to one of the most renowned trilogies of all time, it ties up all the loose ends perfectly, while still being its own original story, having the majority of the film set on a planet that isn't seen or mentioned in the previous films was a clever move, and the Ewoks are a fun and lovable addition to the series. There's only two problems I have with the movie, one is that we never really see the main characters in too much danger, in the Empire Strikes Back the villains have the upper hand for the majority of the movie, but here it feels like Luke Skywalker always does, we never feel frightened or worried for him or his associates as it always seems that they have dominance over Vader, I also felt like the movie tried to be too cute with the Ewoks, with long shots of them silly running around and doing something adorable, I do like these characters but I felt like this was overdone at times and took away from the story too much. There are a lot of characters to follow in this franchise and it seemed like a tough job for any writer to have to wrap up all of their story arcs in just two hours, but hats off to George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan, who did so here perfectly with the significant and even smaller characters, and also managed to never make it feel cluttered or rushed. Though it may not live up to its predecessors, Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi is a great finale to a terrific trilogy, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure film or sci-fi. In his final adventure against the Empire, Luke must save Han Solo and the rest of the crew from Jabba the Hutt, destroy the second Death Star and face the fact his father Anakin Skywalker really is Darth Vader.Best Performance: Harrison Ford",

Considering the popularity and box office success, this Star Wars trilogy tops all time ranking by margin and the reason is quite certain. Hollywood saw great trilogies like Lord Of The Rings and The Dark Knight in 21st century but no trilogy could match the global hysteria created by Star Wars trilogy in the 70s and 80s. Return Of The Jedi is another frontloaded blockbuster and equally explosive like predecessor even thought it lacks the unpredictable and bombastic climax. Empire Strikes Back left us all with the excitement for Return Of Jedi that the Jedi Knight will complete his training, come back and smash the Empire. He certainly came back but quite calmly and helplessly when we expected him to come back strongly having all the powers of the Force. The climax doesn't actually get anything really big as far as action scenes between The Jedi and Emperor are concerned, however, the alliance is seen doing lot of action. Nevertheless, it has a perfect and fulfilled ending to the Star Wars Trilogy and it answers all the questions by the end. It also finds emotional segments during the final parts and completes the love and family stories too. George Lucas had it scored perfectly in mind while writing all three films but it would have been amazing if he had directed all three parts. Return Of The Jedi is a sensational film when it comes to visual effects and construction of sci-fi elements. I must say, it is a film that defined the Structural Engineering of Sci Fi Genre which inspired many films over the years. Nothing much left to say as it's cult following says evrything loudly. Star Wars Episode VI is a third classic in a row in Star Wars Trilogy, that's it.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "review_title": "The weakest...",
            "content": "This is often thought of as the weakest of the original trilogy, and whilst I would agree with that, that's not to say that it is bad. The phenomenon which had begun with\"Star Wars\", six years earlier was about to conclude, or so we thought, with Jedi.The first film had pioneered the technology and concepts of which to present and achieve such a franchise in the 1970\u2032s and '80\u2032s, and \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is still the benchmark for part twos, but where this film falls down is that it has sacrificed narrative quality for Lucas' realisation that he could finally do what he wanted, without any hindrance from studios or production limitations.He had the best of best in visual effects with his Industrial Light and Magic, and he had a vision which had remained unrealised in the previous two films, such as the so called failed Cantina scene in \"Star Wars\", which is presented here, only this time in the walls of Jabba's palace.The first half I believe, is George Lucas' real film. Monsters and Muppets, pure fantasy as our heroes wrap up the events of the previous film, and make their daring escape from Jabba the Hutt. The second part is almost a separate film, focusing quite rightly on the Empire and the destruction of the second Death Star. But this plot is very matter of fact, and has no real charm or heart, just epic visuals and a theatrical sense.Meanwhile, Han Solo and Princess Leia are leading a rebel assault on the forest moon of Endor, populated by the most annoying Muppets of all the dreaded Ewoks! The Ewoks must be one of cinema's greatest misjudgments, the first real misstep in Lucas' handling of the \"Star Wars Saga\"; but with the prequels and the constant tinkering with the originals, this was to be the thin end of the wedge.Don't get me wrong, there are plot elements revolving around the Muppets which I liked, such as the nature vs. technology metaphor, but that doesn't excuse the Ewoks and nothing ever will! But elements such as the Speedbike chase and the final battle, all of it, the final Vader/Luke dual, the assault of the Death Star itself, and even the ludicrous Ewok assault, are excellent, visually stunning and exiting and it is enough to save this film from being bogged down by the bad.And like I said, the money grabbing, almost narratively illiterate George Lucas has damaged and defamed his franchise with his constant tinkering, firstly with the Special Edition in 1997, and then with his Enhanced Special Edition in 2004 for the DVD release.Lucas is a visionary and has done so much for the film industry and we should be grateful but in the end, he needs to stop milking this franchise, stop pretending that it is never finished, when he has finished it THREE times now and realise that the best of the original trilogy was directed and written by other people, all of which display more talent. Lucas is not a good director but he is a good producer and he has brought this franchise to the screen and the movie industry is better for it. But the Special Editions bring nothing important to the mix, with the exception of the finale, which does carry more scope that 1983 original.Overall, the weakest of the \"Star Wars Trilogy\" is a fair assessment and at its worst, it's still leagues above any entry in the prequels, even the Episode III, which is the closest to this high standards of this series.",

            "content": "Well, this is the third and final of the initial trilogy, and I have to admit that it doesn't seem to reach the dizzying heights that the previous film did. I guess in part it was that it had a huge bar to cross in that regards. In another sense it does seem to do more in tying the story up, though in another sense it is providing a conclusion to the massive cliff hanger that was left at the end of the previous film.So, basically Han Solo has been captured, and frozen, and the Empire is in the process of building a new Death Star. As such the heroes have two tasks ahead of them, and that is rescue Han Solo, and destroy the second Death Star, hopefully putting and end to Darth Vader and the emperor in the process. Actually, while the emperor is seen in the second film, it is this film in which we actually meet him.You could say that the film has been divided into two acts (unlike the previous two films which have been divided into three acts). The first act is back on Tatoine where they have to rescue Han Solo, and the second is on the forest moon of Endor where they have to take out the Death Star (though the scenes do change between Endor and the Death Star where Luke is confronting both the Emperor and Darth Vader).The thing that I do appreciate about this film is how the final combat takes place. In a way the whole series is about the struggle between the dark side and the light side, but it is interesting that Luke must somehow defeat his adversaries without actually becoming like them. This does tend to differ from many of the other films out there in that there actually doesn't seem to be much difference between the good and bad guys (except that maybe the good guys have some sort of altruistic motive). The thing with Luke is that he must defeat them without succumbing to anger and hate.Actually, come to think of it, it does play out much better than a lot of other films that I have watched, which I do appreciate. Honestly, one does get somewhat tired about the whole good guy and bad guy fighting, and the good guy suddenly pulls a swift maneauver which results in the bad guy dying. In fact, in a lot of them the good guy kills the bad guy, which is quite disappointing.Anyway, this film is pretty good, despite it not meeting the same level of the previous one, but Empire Strikes Back was always going to be a hard act to follow. Still, for the final film in a trilogy that has pretty much defined science-fiction films ever since, this one is still pretty good.",

I disagree, and even with George Lucas's tinkering I find it a lot more entertaining that \"Empire Strikes Back\" but accept I will be I the minorityPlot In A Paragraph: A long time a go in a galaxy far, far away the classic tale of good vs evil is heading towards it's conclusion, Our heroes set about rescuing Han Solo from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, whilst the rebels attempt to destroy a second Death Star, while Luke attempts to make Vader turn from The Emperor and the dark side of the Force. What can you say about this movie that has not already been said?? Princess Leia in THAT gold bikini, Luke's new lightsabre, A new Death Star, another revelation about Luke's family oh and the controversial Ewok's (I'm pro Ewok, as the rebellion would have failed without them) Once again the story is filled with the standard elements, (love, friendship, over coming your fears and good vs evil) but the movie is anything but standard and it is a lot more enjoyable than the preceding movie. Helped in no small part by the thrilling rescue of Han Solo taking up the first 30 to 40 minutes.I'll get what I didn't like out if the way first. Mark Hamill has ages a lot since the last movie (hardly his fault, but my young son questioned if it was the same actor) and Luke does a lot of waffling and moping about (to go with his new all black wardrobe) and I'm not a fan of Darth Vader saying \"no\" before screaming \"NOOOOO\" being inserted by Lucas!! Just leave them alone George. It's the longest running of the trilogy (yet it feels shorter than \"Empire Strikes Back\") and could have done with a little bit of trimming. We watch a lot of The Emperor goading Luke on the Death Star, and did we really need the Han Solo jealous of Luke and Leia storyline?? Now that's out of the way.....This is my second favourite of the original trilogy. I loved the rescue of Han at Jabba's Palace, Luke's new green lightsabre, (the only time we seen a green lightsabre until the prequels) Lando, Yoda's scene isn't as sad as it should be, (but that's nit picking) the battle of Endor and the \"It's a trap\" attack on the Death Star. Oh all this and I've not mentioned Princess Leia in the gold bikini. The main stuff my early fantasies were based on. I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Everyone is spot on. Mark Hamill is still excellent as the hero Luke Skywalker (Hamill is not to blame for the problems with his storyline). Harrison Ford is still perfectly cast as the cocky, but at times insecure Han Solo, he is good looking with charisma in spades, whilst Carrie Fisher looks great in THAT gold bikini, and is OK in the action scenes on Endor. David Prowse does what is need of him as Darth Vader, but it's still James Earl Jones who makes Darth Vader.Unfortunately with the exception of Ford, the success of these movies type cast them and despite starting in some interesting movies with a good story and good performances. Sadly these pictures never found audiences as movie goers refused to see him as anything other than their characters here. The score by John Williams is once again another valuable asset to the movie. All in all \"Star Wars: Episode VI: \"Return Of The Jedi\" is a highly professional piece of work, suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for excellent entertainment and a perfect end to the trilogy.",

            "content": "The original Star Wars franchise here goes out with a bang and not a whimper, in the 'sixth' episode of the popular franchise, as it certainly deserves to. Conspicuously, the \"Star Wars\" brand name and its original trilogy had eluded me until a fairly recent point in my life, when a combination of chance and sheer bloody mindedness saw me finally sit down and see them. While it would be dishonest to remark that I share in the unabashed, unchecked and often maddening enthusiasm for the films that others certainly have, I cannot say I disliked them and the way \"Return of the Jedi\" rounded off loose ends; did well to keep fresh characters who might otherwise have become tiresome and told its own narrative, was satisfying.Principally, this Episode Six is a combination of what worked best in Episodes Four and Five: the old tale of a rebel alliance looking to destroy an intergalactic structure known as the Death Star is back, while a secondary narrative to do with the franchise's protagonist Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) simultaneously confronting Darth Vader and learning to conquer a mythic pseudo-philosophy known as 'The Force' props proceedings up. Action-packed and romantic do battle, in a sense, with contemplative and familial melodrama.What is, perhaps, most peculiar about the film is that it does not blast off into being a full-on action-adventurer until exactly the 50 minute point. Also quite striking is the fact that, from the moment C3PO utters his first lines, there is not a single instance of two characters that are not either robots or alien creatures communicating to one another for about forty minutes. On my first crack at the film, I did not even notice this but realised it suddenly on my second go - credit must go to those responsible for being involved in such fantastic makeup and costuming.The film's opening captions finally inform us that the war which has dogged the franchise is over \"freedom\", something the alliance fights for and something the Empire, seemingly, wish to do away with. A new Death Star is being constructed; the opening shots reveal it to look about 80% finished, so there is a sense of urgency to events from the off. Darth Vader lands on it, looking for answers on why it isn't finished - he speaks of the yet unseen Emperor, who runs the entire outfit, and reminds us that he's much nastier, which cleverly builds the off-screen character up through dialogue.The film's opening act is essentially a continuation of where we left off prior: Harrison Ford's Han Solo is still frozen-solid in a block of something-or-other, and is captive to a large slug-like alien known as a Hutt named Jabba, having been taken to him in-between episodes. Our heroes, led by Luke, set out to rescue him from Jabba's decrepit desert-set palace-prison with a scheme which seemingly involved Leia (Carrie Fisher) being caught as well; Luke doing battle with a giant monster in an inescapable pit and then later standing on a plank looking at oblivion in the form of a creature consisting of tentacles and a mouth buried in the sand. Was this all part of the plan? How did he know the entire crew would even be taken out into the desert at all?Eventually, differences are settled, one way or another, and the film moves on into territory perhaps more synonymous with the franchise when, as in Episode 4, the force behind the push to defeat the Empire congregates in a control room and deliberates a plan of attack. The Star itself is orbiting a moon known as Endor, which consists largely of dense woodland - the attack will break off into two parts: a fleet of ships will hit the Star directly while a platoon of soldiers, led by Solo, will infiltrate the moon in order to find and disable a power station allowing the Star to shield itself.This is all standard stuff, perhaps made a little less interesting than Episode Five by the fact Solo and Leia know how they feel for one another. More interesting is the character of Skywalker, who has an emotional heart-to-heart with mentor Yoda (Frank Oz) in which, subversively, the protagonist realises he must fight the antagonist, although does not want to. Luke is now a trained Jedi, so is no match for anybody in the combat stakes - in a lesser film, he would be the invincible lead too easily hacking his way to the endgame, but is here made vulnerable to falling, potentially, to the 'dark' side of the force thus undoing all his training. This being prone to something is vital for a sense of there being something at stake; for there being a sense the hero might fail. Scenes involving Luke; Vader and the Emperor on this strand are the best in the film. When the final duel arrives, it is as much a war of words fought in the minds and souls of the characters as it is between lightsabers.The other strand involves the rest of the gang gunning their way towards the power station, although are seemingly no match for a tiny race of neutral furry creatures known as Ewoks who capture them, but then befriend them. There is a peculiar moment whereby C3PO and R2D2 retell the entire Star Wars narrative to this point to these tiny animals, sort of a cross between a bushbaby and a Yorkshire terrier, in order to warrant their support and they listen on in absolute fascination - is the point here that WE are the primitive Ewoks, who have thus far fallen for all of it too? Whatever anything is supposed to point towards, \"Return of the Jedi\" is a ripping yarn which, say it quietly, even graduates into being halfway intelligently made on more than one occasion.",

After Han is thawed from being frozen in carbonite, they become prisoners and escape after Leia kills Jabba. Luke visits his ill master, Yoda (Voiced by Oz) while his friends head to the rebel base where they learn about a new death star being built by the empire. Yoda passes away and Luke talks with Ben \"Obi-Wan\" Kenobi (Guiness) about Darth Vader being his father. Luke learns that Leia is his sister and that they were hidden from Vader and his master, Emperor Palpatine (McDiarmid) when they were born. Luke surrenders to Vader and tries persuading him to let go of his hate. Vader tells Luke it's too late and takes him to meet Palpatine who forces Luke to join him. Luke resists Palpatine and fights Vader again. The rebels get help from furry creatures called, Ewoks who join them in battle including, Wicket (Davis). This is my favorite of the trilogy, McDiarmid is great as Palpatine and John Williams' score is excellent as usual. I recommend this.",

            "content": "Following Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and the others successfully rescuing Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from Jabba the Hutt, the group set off for a final battle with the Empire, who in the interim have created a new more powerful Death Star. As Luke revisits Master Yoda on his death bed to confirm Vader's claim from the previous film that he's in fact Anakin Skywalker, Luke finds himself torn between his duty to the galaxy and his desire to find redemption for his father. Meanwhile Darth Vader (David Prowse: physical, James Earl Jones: voice) confers with The Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) their plan to bring Luke to the Dark Side and wipe out the Rebellion.The concluding chapter in the original trilogy, the script, like the previous films, went through a number of revisions due to uncertainties with certain cast members and shakeups in the production team such as Howard Kazanjian replacing Gary Kurtz as producer on the film. Once again credited to writing input from Lawrence Kasdan and even uncredited input from Blade Runner scribe David Peeples, the script went through a number of revisions due to influence by the marketing ancillaries that had proven quite lucrative for George Lucas with Star Wars leading to ideas surrounding killing off certain characters and giving Luke a pyrrhic victory being rejected early on to give the film a more triumphant note in order to sell toys. The fact they were even able to get Harrison Ford who had shot to superstardom with Raiders of the Lost Ark was a minor miracle due to Ford's agent being on vacation at the time, and the film had so much issue with inadequate sound portraying the film correctly in theaters that Lucas created THX in order to ensure proper acoustics. Return of the Jedi doesn't reach the heights of the previous 2 entries, but it's still a very solid conclusion to the series.Much like Empire Strikes Back, there's a sense that the characters we've come to know and love have experienced growth and development throughout their three film journey. There's actually quite a bit of buildup before we see our heroes Luke, Leia, and Han with the first act setup being R2 and C-3PO going around Jabba the Hutt's palace as part of a plan by Luke. When we do once again see Luke, Han, and Leia we see Luke has become a more confidant Jedi and carries himself with a similar authority to Ben Kenobi, Han has become less arrogant and shows more humility, and Leia gets to showcase some guile and combat prowess such as disguising herself as a bounty hunter. We also see some solid character payoff for the revelations in the previous film that left Luke both physically scarred as well as emotionally with his return to the Dagobah swamp as we see Yoda one final time carrying solid emotional weight that's earned and well paid off. We also get some new characters this time around such as The Emperor as portrayed by Ian McDiarmid who absolutely owns this role and makes a solid pairing alongside Darth Vader as a credible antagonist whose performance is oozing with contemptable manipulative evil.It seems like the movie should have setup to be as good or better than the previous films, but unfortunately there's some weak points that hold it back. The first act for instance feels a little disconnected from the rest of the story as once we're done with Jabba the Hutt, nothing that happened in regards to Han's capture or Jabba's palace is revisited in the third act where we wind up on a whole other planet. In many ways the Jabba's palace segment feels almost like a short film that plays before the actual story takes off because it really isn't until about a half hour in that we see Luke talk about the plot revelations from Empire which is really where the story begins. The movie also does some slight copying of the climax from the first film with the Death Star battle pretty similar to the one from Star Wars: A New Hope, but it is one of three ongoing conflicts in the film along with one set on the forest moon of Endor and another set on the Death Star itself so it does try to remix things to avoid too much repetition. And then we have the Ewoks. While people often single out the Ewoks as one of the major problems with this film, there are other elements such as the various creatures in Jabba's palace or the ill defined purpose of inexplicably popular bounty hunter Boba Fett who doesn't do any bounty hunting and hangs around Jabba all the first act until being killed off in an anticlimactic fashion. The Ewoks would be ruthlessly marketed by George Lucas and Lucasfilm with two TV movies and an animated TV series and they're a pretty shameless excuse to sell toys (much like a lot of creative decisions). With that said however, the Ewoks aren't annoying and their ability to take down Stormtroopers while silly is at least a solid thematic play on nature vs. Technology.Return of the Jedi borders on great as it has great moments, but it's also got a number of moments that feel motivated by commercial tie-ins and toyetic appeal. While the previous movies had both those things and arguably got the ball rolling on them, they did a better job of hiding them and making their films feel like cohesive wholes. Return of the Jedi carries a lot of goodwill from the previous films and also gives the characters enough payoff that it's deserving of respect as Star Wars, even if it's not on the level of its predecessors.",

Maybe its the Ewoks- Lucas' idea of the determination of primitive civilization to topple the mighty empire seems less of a good idea today. Maybe it's the fact that Darth Vader, so anonimously evil in the first two films, is revealed. Maybe it's just the fact that everything fits together seamlessly, and the dawning realisation is that it's all coming to an end. Perhaps the answer is with the force. All that is sure, is that Jedi is a valuable, nay, essential part of anyone's collection, and is still really great- a classic to many- but not AS great as the first two.",

Whilst Return of the Jedi was the weakest of the original trilogy, it is still a very entertaining film and Star Wars is one of the few trilogies which is a great as a whole.Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamall) and his allies have to save Hans Solo (Harrison Ford) who at the end of The Empire Strikes Back sealed in carbonite and in the clutches of the gangster Jabba the Hut. Luke and his allies Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), C3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2D2 (Kenny Baker) set out to launch an audacious rescue of the coolest pirate in the galaxy. When that business was taken care of they go back to the Rebels where they have receive intelligence that the Empire were building an even more powerful death and that Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) and the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) himself were overseeing the construction. The rebels have one chance of a surprise attack, which requires a ground assault on the forest moon Endor. This is led by Leia and Solo and they ally with the local, primitive tribe of Ewoks to destroy the shield protecting the Death Star. Luke is also on a personal mission, to try and save Darth Vader from the dark side to help defeat the Emperor, but the Emperor believes he can turn Luke. This leads to a mental and physical battle of the soul.Return of the Jedi is a very enjoyable film with great action sequence to match the first two. There is a very good light sabre fight and Luke's skills as a Jedi are truly expanded. There is a good battle which shows a futuristic force are having to fight a primitive race using spears and bows and arrows. There is a interesting battle of wits between Luke and the Emperor and shows this is more then a sci-fi action film, but a emotional battle for souls. There is excellent art direction in the film like in the first two film and there is more ambition in showing a wide range of alien race compared to The Empire Strike Back. But some alien designs were not as good as others, the Ewoks looked like teddy bears, whilst the Admiral for the Rebels looked ridiculous. The acting sticks to form with the other films, with Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones being the best performers and Ian McDiarmid was wonderfully slimy and evil as the main villain of the piece.Return of the Jedi is not as dark as The Empire Strikes Back, which in itself not much of a problem, but the including of the Ewoks made the film a little too childish. There were some interesting ideas to be had with them, but as stated they look like teddy bears that children would want to hug not a realistic alien race. As well the general plot of the film was basically very similar to first film, development of a Death Star, action set on Luke's home world and attack a weakness in the Empire's defends.Return of the Jedi is a very good and entertaining film which closes the circle of the Star Wars saga.",

The characters in this movie gets bigger; I remember Jabba The Hutt from the 4th installment, then there's The Ewoks of Endor. Lando Calrissian(Billy Dee Williams) went from Bespin outcast, into a General for the Rebels to fight against the Empire. The Rancor monster in Jabba's pit was very fierce. And Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher) was elegant in that metallic bikini when she was the slave of Jabba. Of course, she made him limp and lifeless when Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) jumps into action. The final showdown between Darth and Luke is a classic. Luke shows he is much stronger than his father when he became a Jedi. He didn't give in to the Dark Side of the Force. After Darth tossed the Emperor down the shaft, he became Anakin again; wounded, humbled, and redeemed. Seeing Luke with his own eyes was the sign of redemption and the facts are revealed. That part was a little sad that Anakin died, but he was with the Force again, and he joins the other Jedis. I would rather be a Jedi than a Sith, any day!

I must say that this is my least favorite of the Original Trilogy. It is a wonderful story, the great original cast from the first two (Episodes 4 & 5), and the story is excellent. The execution is superb, and the entertainment value is every bit as good as those before it.That having been said, I'll also say from the start, that the reason I like this installment much less was the addition of the child-friendly Ewoks and their subsequent marketability. It was a cheap and obvious ploy to market yet another Star Wars toy. It worked, but it was still cheap and common. I am very dissatisfied with this practice. If a character \"sells,\" then fine. But do NOT create a character, or as in this case, a group of characters merely to up-sell the merchandise.Okay, I'm done with that.This third installment (which works out to be the sixth of the series) was fun, and spirited. The dark and suspenseful atmosphere built by the story is negated by too many \"light\" and warm, fuzzy moments, thereby lessening the worth of this attempt. It was not the deeply pondering, mystically oriented, action-fest as were the previous two blockbusters.It was still fun, however. Enjoyable and entertaining, it was.In the 2004 DVD edition, there are superfluous additional scenes designed to distract you from the realization that there was a blatant waste of film time present, but that ploy fails to work if you are like me, and own the original original on VHS. That smoke screen is not evident, and these contrivances are thereby more obvious.This installment is colored with beautiful vistas, rousing action, and a quiet sentimentality which permeates all. Yoda is old, and he is sick. Skywalker is done with his training as a Jedi, save for one small final test: He must face Vader once and for all.There are some added scenes and characters in the background of this installment; edited in no doubt for the DVD release of the 2004 box set. These were undoubtedly designed to lead us into the third trilogy which Luca$ now says will never happen. If watching through that media, you will doubtless see clandestine meetings and furtive exchanges which lead no where in this work, leading one to only suppose that Luca$ intended something, we just were not supposed to know what. And yet, Luca$ neither directed, nor wrote this work, so we can only assume the writer was going off of the fact that there were three more Episodes for which to write tie\u0096ins.As much as I disliked the Ewoks, I must say that I was delighted to discover that Warwick Davis, beloved Willow, was Wicket the Ewok. That makes them almost bearable.\"Ewoks. They blow.\" Scream 2 While this chapter does have a satisfying ending, it is obvious that it is not THE end.

The supposed special moments (Yoda's death, Obi-Wan's surprise about Leia's hidden fact, Luke's confession to Leia that she's his sister..) weren't portrayed especially at all. There wasn't much of a drama, romance or relief. And it had a certain sense of boredom all over it. The movie is divided into 2 halves; the first is an adventure one that reminded me of Tarzan's movies in the 1940s, and the second was a pure war of a movie, running semi-randomly and uninterestingly for most of the time (20 years later, The Matrix Revolution would fall in the same mistake). And by the way, hasn't Deathstar been destroyed in the first movie (Star Wars)? Where were the creativity and the imagination in a sci-fi saga produced by millions?!!The Ewoks are proofed to be the most dull and unattractive creatures ever appeared in movies (Did you see their plastic dead eyes?!!). John Williams's music wasn't as memorably impassioned as it always is; in fact, it was silly and weak. This is surely one of the worst movies Harrison Ford had to do; unlike the first 2 movies, he got nothing respectful, or only nothing, to do! Mark Hamill is now a better actor, but sorrowfully with nearly no emotional stuff to perform. Carrie Fisher looked 20 years older, and putting her in skimpy clothes was wrong, JUST WRONG! And why I felt that the face of Sebastian Shaw, as Darth Vader's real one, was so laughable, fitting more a shaved Santa Clause!Except the Hayden Christensen's appearance as the good Anakin at the last shot, the added CGI was a bad-taste joke, being distracting and made by Lucas for Lucas. For instance, the music act in the Jabba's palace was completely re-cut and altered.. so what?!! Watching things like this made me think that Lucas has an inferiority complex, whereas he got once not enough money to fulfill his dreams, then now he avenges on these days BADLY! I'm afraid that after the \"Special Edition\" in 1997, then the other new version of \"the DVD release\" in 2004, one day Lucas would give us the \"Special Edition of the DVD release\" where we find ourselves seeing Hayden Christenson in older makeup as Darth Vader in the unmasked scene, modified CGI shots for the Ewoks' eyes, then a never seen moments having R2-D2 playing hide and seek with C-3PO, or Darth Vader doing morning exercise!Despite the fights, the explosions, and the big bucks it made in 1983, (Return of the Jedi) is the least important movie in the old trilogy of (Star Wars). Something is hasty, cheap, and lifeless about it. I believe Lucas was satisfied with having just a large battle and happy end, making an empty spectacle that lacked being human along the way. It's where the movies began relinquishing being movies anymore, and approached being a frank video games. So as a movie, I rank (Blue Thunder), (Uncommon Valor), and (Christine), from the same year, over it. Simply, they got more exciting characters, places, and events.Finally, for the sake of saying something good, compared to ALL the next trilogy of prequels, (Return of the Jedi) is nice piece of entertainment; at least here the CGI, the chatter, and (Ian McDiarmid) aren't given much on-screen time!",

Episode VI does the very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, yet also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more to the hinted back story. suddenly, it's Darth Vader at the front, and viewers realize that it's the story about Anakin, not just Luke. but even before 1-3, there was amazing depth to it all. it felt real, as if capsule fell from the sky into Lucas's lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far, far away.Star Wars is definitely something far above the norm, and i must admit, whenever i see them, particularly this one, i feel very small. i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. i get a tingling feeling when i see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope.",

Cardiff born director Richard Marquand does a good job at handling so many locations, effects, characters and so on. However, and I'm not sure why some effects are not executed well compared to aforementioned instalments. That said, there are multiple setups action scenes, the attack on the Death Star, the battle on Endor and showdown between Vader and Luke. The scenes involving Mark Hamill and Vader (David Prowse) give weight and emotion to ROTJ but are few and far between. Also the moments on Dagobar with Yoda, faultless Alec Guinness (as Ben 'Obi-Wan' Kenobi) and a revealing scene between Luke and Leia feel hurried. The make-up is excellent and the score once again is stirring. Both Anthony Daniels C-3PO and Peter Mayhew Chewbacca are given the chance to shine a little more. The supporting cast are solid, Ian McDiarmid is outstanding as the The Emperor and the puppeteers do a fantastic job of bringing the droid and alien-like characters to life.There are stand out moments notably the speeder chase, and there's atmosphere created especially in Jabba's palace segments and in the stark Death Star scenes. There are humorous one liners within Lawrence Kasdan's dialogue and some family friendly fun courteous of the Ewoks, pint size bear like creatures.Nevertheless, there's contrast in look and nature to Return of the Jedi that at times makes it feel disjointed, crammed and rushed, as if George Lucas is trying to hastily tie his story up.Overall, it's great entertainment and everything you'd expect from a sci-fi including laser guns, light sabres and spaceships.",

            "content": "As far as I'm concerned, I think Randal's right. There's really only one \"Return\" that I prefer to watch over & over again and that's \"Return of the Jedi,\" directed in 1983 by the late Richard Marquand and is the final film in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. We should all know by now that Kevin Smith is a staunch \"Star Wars\" loyalist, so I won't fault him there.I honestly have nothing personal against the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy that was so meticulously constructed by Peter Jackson from J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark fantasy novels; it's just that I'm a life-long \"Star Wars\" geek and Jackson had it comparatively easier in trying to get those movies made, not to mention a deeply entrenched fan-base supporting his efforts. \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas had to start from scratch and fight an uphill battle almost every step of the way to get \"Star Wars\" (1977) and its sequels to the screen, with little help or backing from the studio and most of all, almost no one believed in his story or vision, creativity or ingenuity.And only now, more than a quarter of a century later, do people finally \"get\" the significance of \"Star Wars\" and what Lucas achieved in 1977.\"Return of the Jedi,\" for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) is my favorite \"Star Wars\" film all around (2005's \"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\" is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion). At different times, I've considered all the original films a \"favorite,\" but a long while ago I realized the towering achievement and perfection that was \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that \"Return of the Jedi\" is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason \"Return\" suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in \"Star Wars\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga. This was a swift change considering the darker story and direction that George Lucas decided to take with \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"The film still flies high on its revolutionary special effects - which, 30 years later, still knock most of the CGI-laden spectacles of 2013 Hollywood out of the water - captivating story, entrenched multi-dimensional characters, and brilliant action sequences. \"Return of the Jedi\" is still a first-degree special effects spectacle.10/10",

The Ewoks don't suck.Wrapping up the trilogy, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and company head back to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from the clutches of space gangster Jabba the Hutt (Big Ass Puppet). After succeeding, they have to deal with the threat of the Empire building a new Death Star. That leads to a three-way final battle where Han and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) have to blow up the force field generator protecting the under-construction Death Star, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) leads the attack to blow it up and Luke engages both Darth Vader (David Prowse, James Earl Jones) and the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) in moral combat for Luke's life and Vader's soul.Return is a great conclusion to the Star Wars trilogy, but it's not much more than that. Star Wars had the best story and the best character moments. Empire didn't expand much on them but did take them in a new direction and give them a different tone. Return doesn't do much more than wrap things up and taken on its own is probably the least complete Star Wars film of all, though it's still better written and acted than any of the prequels.Return gets criticized more than the first two films and I think we all know the reason why. Ewoks. The fact that the Star Wars saga ended with pint-sized alien teddy bears playing a major role in defeating the fearsome Empire drives some folks up the wall. To you people I say\u0085get over it. I liked the Ewoks when the movie first came out. YOU liked the Ewoks when the movie first came out. There was an Ewok Celebration song playing on the radio back in the Summer of 1983 and I remember it winning the \"Best Song\" contest for several weeks in a row on a local station. Widespread Ewok-hate is something that only developed years later, as the Star Wars audience aged, got a bit jaded from watching the films so many times and had to blame something for the fact that Return has some serious weaknesses as an individual film.The fact is the Ewoks really aren't offensive or irritating (See Binks, Jar Jar) and actually fit in with the overall message of the movie. Return is all about how evil can only be defeated by good people working together. Return casts evil as acting on your own for selfish, destructive ends. Good is people joining hand to resist that kind of self-directed power. In that light, the Rebels needing the help of primitive (and cute) aliens to win the day is perfectly in line with Return's story.I hadn't watch the original trilogy for a long time when I sat down to review them, and it's interesting how I didn't quite remember them exactly the way they are. For instance, Empire and Return do not logically flow from Star Wars. To some extent they go against many elements of the first film and you can see how the story could have legitimately gone in very different directions. I also had forgotten or not appreciated just how much Luke's story comes to dominate Empire and Return. He may be the hero of Star Wars, but many other characters play significant roles and have their own stories that unfold. But just compare Luke to Han and Leia. Over the course of the films, Luke grows from na\u00efve young farm boy to almost otherworldly warrior-poet, and we get to see a lot of the evolution happen in front of us. Han, however, kind of devolves from the hardened, cynical, somewhat puffed up mercenary of the first film to a somewhat goofy, common man shlub who's mostly out of his depth but getting by on bravery and reckless stupidity. Leia is a tremendously strong character in Star Wars who is reduced to just Han's love interest in Empire, before getting to don a gold bikini and do a little bit more in Return. The truth is that Han and Leia don't have much in the way of stories in the later two films outside their romance, and that's largely sprung on the audience full grown.Star Wars is genuinely one of the best films in history. Empire isn't on that level as a film, but is a bold twist on a wildly popular story. Return wraps everything up in a satisfactory way, but is a pretty thin story on its own. If you really want to understand why the Star Wars prequels sucked so very, very hard, you only have to recognize that they are all much more like Return than they are like Empire or Star Wars.",

            "content": "After the shocking ending of Empire Strikes Back, audiences had high expectations for Return of the Jedi. Unfortunately Jedi fell short of many people's expectations. This used to be my favorite Star Wars movie, but as I've grown older I've come to favor Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars. I will start with the bad: The most common criticism of ROTJ has always been \"there were too many muppets.\" I agree wholeheartedly. There were several scenes where I think Lucas went out of his way to make these creatures just to sell toys. Originally the Ewoks were supposed to be Wookies, but since Chewbacca had been established as an intelligent alien, Lucas replaced them with Ewoks. The muppets do not ruin the movie completely but they do degrade the quality of the final battle scene and both versions of the celebration scene. But this is not ROTJ's biggest flaw at all IMO.Return of the Jedi just lacks the freshness of the first two Star Wars movies. The first thirty to forty minutes of the movie bring us back to Tattooine, a planet we've already seen. The only new location is Endor, which is pretty boring compared to Mos Eisley and Hoth Base. The Death Star plot from the first movie has been rehashed, probably because Lucas needed an easy way to cramp the Emperor's death and the fall of the Imperial navy in one movie. The movie has a rushed feel as well, from Han Solo's rescue to Endor to Luke's conflict with his father. As an example, take the scene where Luke tells Leia that they are siblings. Never mind the fact that this makes certain scenes in Star Wars and Empire pretty disgusting, you would think Lucas would have included a scene or two with Leia having trouble coping with the fact that her father is Darth Vader, one of the most evil men in the galaxy! But no, Lucas had to wrap things up in two hours, so there was simply no time.By this point, most of the characters had developed as much as they could. Han Solo and Leia are marginalized big time. Ford is visibly bored in many scenes, and he just doesn't have the same flare anymore. Carrie Fisher is a zombie in this film (possibly due to her drug problems). Their material simply was not as good as the previous films. Harrison Ford didn't even want to be in Jedi; he thought Solo should have died because the character had developed as far as he could. Co-writer Lawrence Kasdan agreed with Ford. It is certainly an interesting idea and I think it could have worked. It would have finished Solo's character arc nicely, going from a selfish pirate to a martyr. Alas, the supporting characters are just there for the ride, which is all due to the cramped nature of the script IMO. I wonder how much Ford was paid. Trivia Section: It is interesting to note that Gary Kurtz, the producer of the first two Star Wars films, insists that George had never agreed to only make three Star Wars films. The number was up in the air. I think Kurtz wanted to make a fourth star wars film, maybe even a fifth and a sixth. Lucas, however, had gotten tired of the series and wanted to wrap up all of the ideas they had for the future sequels in one movie. To be honest I don't know who is telling the truth, but the fact that ROTJ feels so cramped makes me think there is at least some truth to what Kurtz said. For example, Kurtz's Jedi would have been split into two parts: Leia looking for Han Solo and the Luke/Vader story. That means no Death Star Battle and no Emperor.After all of my ranting, here is the good stuff. The Jabba the Hutt scenes are fun with the exception of the dance number. Jabba himself is an interesting puppet creation. Luke's story, aside from the embarrassing twist that made Leia his sister, was handled very well. Luke is the only character who actually has something interesting to do, which is to turn his father back to the good side. Luke and Vader's interactions are very moving, and you can almost see the emotion on Vader's face through the mask. Luke's character arc over the course of the three movies was done very well.This movie's other treat is Ian McDiarmid, who makes a deliciously evil Emperor Palpatine. Aside from Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker, McDiarmid has been in more Star Wars movies than any other actor. It's amazing that make-up from 1983 can be superior to make-up from 2005! The final scene where Vader lifts the Emperor and throws him into the pit is one of the best scenes in the series.Even though I think the Death Star II plot hurt the film, I have to praise the technical qualities of the space battle. Even without CGI it looks just as realistic as the space battle in Episode III.Despite all of my criticisms, ROTJ is still a fun movie. The scenes involving Luke, Vader, and the Emperor really save this film. We can speculate all we want about how the movie would have been if Solo had died, or if they had made a fourth movie, but this is what we got. So we have to enjoy it for all it's worth.",

            "content": "The Return Of The Jedi is somewhat divisive amongst Star Wars fans for possibly going in too much of a \"family friendly\" direction with the addition of The Ewoks and it's lighter tone after The Empire Strikes Back. However, there is a lot of good stuff here and it does tie a lot of things together. The film originally could have gone in a different direction with it's original working title Revenge Of The Jedi. Luke does appear to be well on his way to the dark side, dressed entirely in black and uses his force powers for much more than \"knowledge and defense\" when he slaughtered fifty or so people on Jabba's sail barge. The warm and fuzzy corniness of the Ewoks is balanced out with sometimes having a darker tone that was prevalent on Empire. The film looks fantastic and is probably the most action packed of the series with epic space and land battles and another excellent final lightsaber battle with Luke and Vader. Return Of The Jedi does have its flaws for sure, but it ties things up and is the last good Star Wars movie until Rogue One.",

After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks, they weren't so bad. I enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods, and I felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter. The ending (with some new additions, I presume?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy. I know many true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what I didn't already know, I think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity.

Chewbacca is still pretty annoying. C3PO? Annoying, but at least far less than The Empire Strikes Back. Perhaps the most annoying one, though, was Jabba the Hutt. I mean, his disgusting physical appearance was bad enough, but the fact that he spoke nothing but \"Huttese\"? The inability to interpret his speech really got on my nerves. Lucas should've been more careful as to what characters spoke plain old English.The acting was superb! James Earl Jones has this really neat, powerful, and consistent voice. The trio of Hamill-Ford-Fisher was splendid as always. But one of the film's highlights was the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). He is more powerful and more menacing than even Darth Vader, and McDiarmid absolutely eats up the screen every moment! His creepy laughs, enjoying his sadistic form of torture, were as bone-chilling as Dath Vader's constant heavy breathing.The action scenes were epic. They were much better directed than the original (the same pattern here\u0085 curious\u0085), more thrilling, easier to follow in many ways.John Williams' music is absolutely amazing.

            "content": "The Star Wars saga concludes, as Luke Skywalker and his friends set out to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, whilst Darth Vader and the evil Emperor make plans against him from a new Death Star. Both Luke and Vader must confront their destinies in a climactic showdown, where the freedom of the Universe is at stake ...Maintaining the incredibly high standards of drama, imaginative storytelling and eye-popping visuals from the previous two pictures, the concluding Star Wars movie is a masterpiece of fantasy film-making. As before, the sheer scope of the landscapes is breathtaking - Jabba's grimy palace, the sand dunes of Tatooine, the vast Imperial ships, the Emperor's mausoleum of a throne room, the Ewok village in the trees - all brilliantly realised. The movie also boasts possibly the most dazzling inventive model shots (by Richard Edlund, Dennis Muren and Ken Ralston) ever attempted - there is an amazing sequence where Lando and the rebels fly inside the Death Star and destroy it from within, in which the speed of motion through the frame is just jaw-dropping. Most importantly however, this a movie with extraordinary dramatic resonance, as all the threads of the stories come together - Luke's temptation towards the evil path, Leia's birthright and the fulfilment of her mission as rebel leader, Han's rebirth as a true hero, and Darth Vader's ultimate redemption. The cast are tremendous as before, but of particular note in this film is McDiarmid's unforgettably villainous turn as the Emperor - a creepy, piercing, vicious, truly dreadful, fear-inducing monster. The film is an amazing patchwork of both stunning action (the Sarlacc scene, the speeder-bike chase, the Ewok battle) and incredibly tender drama (Yoda's death, Luke's scene with Leia in the village, Vader's unmasking), yet is beautifully edited into a seamless adventure. Brilliantly written by George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan, with a terrific score, dynamic photography, astounding visual effects and fine performances. Unmissable. This review is of the 1997 re-release, featuring some additional effects shots (most notably in the Sy Snootles dance band sequence in Jabba's palace) and a new piece of music for the final celebration scenes.",

Star Wars is an every day phrase now, and it's hard to find someone who hasn't at least heard of it, and the force. Blending real life morals (I'm not getting into the theological side of Star Wars) with outer-world settings, with sweeping action and emotion Return of the Jedi provides exactly what this third installment needed, closure. If the other trilogies hadn't happened, these three films would be among the elites of all trilogies.

Once again I am appalled that this movie was made and worse, made money.Don't get me wrong, I loved the first Star Wars and respect it for the tour De force it was for the genre. Unfortunately, the rest are rubbish. The problem (and there are many), is that Muppets belong in Manhattan and not in a galaxy far far away.Jabba may work. His minions are crap. His pet, the worst. The guards look like rejects from The Dark Crystal. Most of these creatures should have surely bought the farm a millennium ago according to Darwin's theory. The acting during these scenes is so bad it makes soaps look like Shakespeare.Ewoks are the undying joke of this movie. The costumes are total crap. I would definitely not put \"Ewok costume designer\" on my resume. Their movement is that of midgets in furry costumes (political incorrectness intended) with casts on both legs. Darwin would have been out there clubbing Ewoks himself so as to not embarrass his natural selection theory. Again the acting in these scenes is terrible. Only Chewbacca has any credible acting in this portion of the movie.The rest of the film plays out as a regular B movie. Even the latest installments, with all of the latest special effects, are sabotaged by the stupidest characters (JarJar Binks) and terrible acting (Samuel L. Jackson, et Al), a running curse for these movies.Some say I'm over critical. I don't believe this. I am however, a stickler for details. A great movie, The Hunt for Red October, was ruined for me when the Russian under sea map had English in parenthesis, under the Cyrillic, cow towing to what the producers must feel are the more feeble minded viewers. If the actors say they are heading towards such and such a place, why wouldn't I assume that when they point to the map, in Russian or not, that this is not what they are talking about? I just think it's sad that I have to recommend Star Trek, Next Generation and the Aliens trilogy as the better examples of science fiction to my kids.",

            "content": "This is probably the best of all of the Star Wars movies. The starting point of the movie was almost like Episode IV--spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place, where the seriousness of mobster Jabba the Hutt was getting even more serious. He ordered Luke to die in a basement pit by the bone-crushing teeth of Bantha, who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. Luke's Jedi powers eventually finish the monster off. Adding to the sneaky rescue of Han Solo, who was frozen alive at the end of Episode V, Jabba was very angry about this that Luke was sentenced to die at the Sarlacc pit outside.But all of the Star Wars \"good guys\", especially R2-D2, had other ideas...and those other ideas fended off Luke's execution; in the end, most of Jabba's soldiers died and Princess Leia was able to use the force to fatally choke Jabba to death.Like in Episode IV, the Death Star in Episode VI makes its appearance. As I analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the Imperial fighters around the Death Star, the Star Destroyer personnel, I guessed, sped up the arming of the main laser, using the Imperial fighters as a diversion. The 20-25 Star Destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the Death Star was fired in surprise. Once it fired, the rebel fleet's only hope was that the Death Star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out, and this affected Lando so much because he wanted to destroy the Death Star but he couldn't until the shield was taken out. And it was taken out with Lando's increasing impatience.Like in Episode V, the Imperial Walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons, killing at least one of the Ewoks...but the Ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them. For instance, Chewbacca, as well as another Ewok, was able to commandeer one of the walkers (and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers), and the other Ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers.It is amazing what Luke could do with his Jedi powers on his Light Sabre, like, for instance, the scene on Endor where Luke deflects incoming laser shots from a Storm Trooper speeder bike, and using the Sabre to knock out part of the bike. Or, in a climax, using the Sabre to break off his own father's arm during the final Sabre fight with Sith Vader.You probably know the Ewoks celebration after the Death Star was blown, complete with a short display of fireworks, drumming on the spoils of victory (e.g., Storm Trooper Masks), and Luke finally meeting up with Leia after Luke's own nemesis---Darth Vader, now dead, is burned on a pyre. The celebration include Ewoks singing but I think Lucas did not buy that--even with the strong respect of film composer John Williams.On the home movie version, I think Lucas himself wanted a different ending. In addition to the celebration on Endor, he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets, including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the Sith. The Ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. He probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the Death Star's destruction, balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies.",

            "content": "I remember George Lucas stating that he was making a children's film with his first Star Wars movie, and although that was the intent, I think that film was one of the great film making accidents in history, because pretty much everyone loved it. It didn't matter what age you were, nor your personal background, the film was enjoyable on all levels. It had no sexual moments, no excessive swearing, but lots of action and thematic intrigue.With \"Return of the Jedi\" I think we get a vision more true to what George Lucas was aiming for in terms of a target demographic. Simply put this movie is a bit warmer than the previous two. The first film was truly a classic science fiction film with a kind of fairy tale setting or background. The second film was a dark second act challenging the characters. The third film is a reunion bringing about mostly happy conclusions to lots of circumstances.In Jedi we aren't given nor shown lots of angst and extreme weighty matters. We see endings, deserved and expected, and some realizations, which add emotional weight (perhaps unnecessarily) to the complete story Lucas wanted to tell the world. To this end it's almost Wagnerian not only in terms of scope of the story (that is, it's actual size) but in terms of the connections and back story that is revealed.My one real critique of Jedi is that the live action sequences are not as well shot as the first two films. But perhaps that's unfair, because few can compete with Carole Ballard's magnificent lensing from the first film, and the exceedingly competent Kirshner's direction of the second Star Wars film is unsurpassed. With Jei the shots are a little more basic and feel more staged than the previous films. I think that, more than anything else, perhaps weighs the film some, and in the minds of die hard Star Wars fans, keeps it a notch or two below the previous films in terms of esteem. The first film had dramatic shots. The second film had intriguing shots. The third film, apart from the live action SFX sequences, has functional shots. That, more than anything else, perhaps holds back a better film. One wonders how Carole Ballard would have shot Jedi.There's criticism of the Ewok characters as being too implausible (cute, fury, appealing, etc.) to muster an Opposing Force to the Imperial Elite occupying Endor. But again, I think some of the previous feelings generated by the look of the film add a sense of warmth that counters the dramatic conclusion of the film by adding another layer of warmth to the newly introduced native forces for the Rebels. That is it isn't so much the Ewoks that the Star Wars fans object to (though that's what they state), but perhaps their execution combined with the basic look of the film from the previous hour, that's resonating with a Star Wars' audience.To get back to the lensing, there's a number of matte paintings that have always bugged me in this film. I won't point them out, but, if anything were to have been done for the special edition, it would have been nice for those elements to have been cleaned up, tweaked, or just altogether replaced.All of this is Monday morning quarterbacking. When you're in a production it's difficult to step back and see what later on becomes obvious. The script, plot and story are fine. The special effects are impressive, but the direction appears to be a little basic though highly competent, and perhaps this is the other element that holds back a more fantastic conclusion to our favorite space opera saga. As it is now, the film is great as is, but there's a couple of hidden missteps that perhaps resonate subconsciously with viewers.Even so, this is a children's film, as was always intended. As such it does have a slightly sugary feel to it. It lacks the \"realism\" or grounding that helped us link to the first two films. Combine that with the other elements I mentioned, and you get Jedi. But, regardless, we get to see our favorite characters reunite for one last adventure, and that itself should bring a smile to the viewers' face.We see more derring do, incredible action sequences, and revisit our favorite heroes and villains, and the galaxy in which they reside and fight for. That makes it a great film unto itself.Relax and enjoy.",

Can you say 'Carebears'? Smurfs? Monchichis? Gummy Bears? Well the Ewoks are right in keeping with'em. Nope! Not good! A simple $$ grab by Lucas. I wish he had edited them out and replaced'em with his original Jedi idea-a planet of Wookies. Now THAT I woulda bought...\nHarrison Ford Thorazines out for the whole film. Clearly glad to be getting done with the series. He and Billy Dee Williams weren't all that into it from what I can see. Some pretty flat performances. Too bad, too. They have done better work elsewheres.No way in hell Han Solo winds up playing Delta Force man on the ground, not the Han Solo I know from the first two films. He'd have lead the attack on the Death Star inside his ship instead. Yanking him and Chewie outta the Falcon and plopping them onto the moon always bothered me, kinda like making Indy Jones drive an 18 Wheeler. You know he could do it, but WHY BOTHER ?!!! Oh well...characters not staying true to their histories always yanks my chain outta joint. Here especially.I never bought the tacked-on 'Luke and Leia' as siblings bit either, now THAT means that Owen and Lars aren't Luke's relatives after all, nope-they are Obi-Wan's...Somehow I really doubt that is what Lucas had in mind back in'77. Takes some of the intrigue and fun outta the first two films if you think about it.And I thought it was wayyy too Muppetty, the whole Jabba sequence makes me wonder why Lucas didn't just CIG Fozzie and Animal in there too while he was at it...Gimme a break...I didn't mind Jabba himself, though. Pretty cool.\nWhat I liked:The final attack on the Deathstar, and the whole space battle are both great; well handled and believable as far's they go. Right up to par.I liked the Emperor, little more like an evil Merlin than Emperor to my thinking,but fine, he was convincingly slimy, evil and in control. I think Diarmid did a good job in Phantom Menace too.The final big sabre-duel with Vader and Luke is pretty good if laced with overblown dialogue and all that, somehow I never can concieve of Anyone beating Vader, don't care how strong Sonny boy had become. But they did a good job, the Emperor's demise and then that of Vader is handled well, having a lot of excitement and pathos mixed in to boot.This film nowadays bores me, I have trouble with the Ewoks big time and can't get past some of the things I mentioned above; but it certainly is a good film-if you like the Carebears or the first two in the series a lot....myself...I give Jedi a *** rating, for the effects and whatever, but it should have been a lot better, more coherant and tighter paced...",

The others either ended on an overblown note or a bittersweet one. \"Jedi\" has a nice, subtle happy ending. The story this time is that the Death Star II is nearing completion which leads to a final showdown between the Empire and the Rebels. While all this is going on, Luke becomes determined to redeem the soul of his father-Darth Vader.The performers are simply terrific. Mark Hamill does a great job (probably his best on-camera performance) Carrie Fisher turns in another great job as the beautiful yet spunky Princess Leia and Harrison Ford, although somewhat superfluous to the main story, turns in another first rate job.The veteran actors- Alec Guinness, Sebastian Shaw and Ian McDiarmid- are all perfect although I consider Shaw to be the stand-out. Last but not least, Frank Oz as Yoda who goes out with one of the best death scenes ever.With a few exceptions (the Ewoks, the slave girl outfit) this is a fantastic film with great characters, slick special effects and a touching story. Plus some good old fashioned puppet effects bringing our favorite space slug, Jabba the Hutt, to life.In short, \"Jedi\" rules.",

            "content": "It is almost depressing for me to watch \"Return Of The Jedi\". Every time the end credits start rolling, I remember that I have just watched the last of an awesome trilogy of films and the only word that comes to mind is \"Damn\". I have seen this movie countless times (definately more than I have seen any other movie) since I was a kid and it never gets old. I fell in love with the story of the Rebellion overthrowing the Galactic Empire and Luke Skywalker's journey to becoming a Jedi. Fortunately, Lucas delivers an exciting finale to the series equal to \"Star Wars\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back\".\"Return Of The Jedi\" picks up shortly after the last movie left off. Luke Skywalker travels to the planet Tatooine to rescue Han Solo, who has become prisoner to Jabba The Hutt. Meanwhile, the Galactic Empire nears construction on a brand new Death Star. Of course, this makes more sense if you have seen the first two movies (if you haven't, I recommend it). Once again, the entire cast returns and puts in awesome performances. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams...I couldn't imagine anyone else filling their positions. This cast really helps you care for the characters throughout the movie.Once again, one of my favorite aspects is the film's visuals. This film contains my one of my favorite battle scenes ever put on film. Despite the technology they had to use to create the battles in space in 1983, I still think it looks better, even more realistic, than a lot of the more modern films (including the new trilogy). Stop-motion animation and green screen shooting was all it took to bring this movie to life. Lucas didn't need millions of dollars in CGI backgrounds to make the galaxy feel real to the audience back then.If you haven't been exposed to Lucas's trilogy before, check it out. I would suggest seeing the original trilogy in order, then if you want to, move on to the newest trilogy.",

(PG)Third and final film in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy opens with an effort to free Han Solo from the clutches of gangster Jabba the Hutt, then sends the heroes on a mission to confront Darth Vader and destroy the newly rebuilt Death Star. Visually spectacular outing has oodles of creativity, sensational special effects, child-like wonder, technical credits to put most other crews/films to shame, but it lacks the dramatic fireworks it strives for and mishandles its own priorities by stranding most of the main characters on a forest moon for half the film, far from the \"real action\" in the stars above. Performances lack zip (clunky dialogue does them no favors) and, cute as they may be, far too much time is spent with those furry little woodland teddy bears called Ewoks. The climactic lightsaber duel is underwhelming compared to the one in \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" but the space station assault, despite having a familiar ring to the climax of \"Star Wars,\" is still the most exciting and well-staged space battle the franchise has yet produced.

            "content": "I just finished re-watching all six Lucas-era Star Wars films in episode order (I-VI) with the commentary and want to give my reviews of each film. Let me preface by saying that I am a lifelong Star Wars fan who grew up with the original trilogy and literally have no memory of a time in my life before SW. As such, I am not going to be totally unbiased in my reviews, but I will try to be somewhat objective.A year after Luke's fateful confrontation with Vader, his father, he and the rest of our heroes (including Lando now) are back on his home planet of Tatooine to try and free Han from his carbonite prison in the clutches of Jabba the Hutt. Afterwards they reunite with the Rebel fleet, now much larger and more powerful than ever, where they plan a strike to destroy a second Death Star being constructed under the direct supervision of Emperor Palpatine. The resulting mission climaxes with a dramatic confrontation between Luke, his father, and the emperor to decide the fate of the Skywalkers, the Jedi, and that of the entire galaxy.Coming to the end of the saga is always such a bittersweet experience for me. I know that RotS was the last one made, but watching this movie is when it really hits me that George Lucas will not be making any more movies like this. The SW saga has had such a treasured place in my heart for my entire life, and the pale imitations that Disney keeps pooping out are more of a reminder of something I can't have any more of (new SW material) than any actual consolation. That said, this is unfortunately a rather flawed movie. I think it's the most inconsistent in quality of the six movies, with very high high points but a lot of mediocre stuff as well. Lucas really tied his hands by not resolving anything in ESB, especially by leaving the Han Solo cliffhanger, which leads to the awkward situation where the first act of this movie is not really related to the overall plot. As such, the whole story here feels disjointed and not smooth. Let's get into it.THE GOOD-All the scenes with Vader, the Emperor, and/or Luke are really the core of this movie and what saves it from mediocrity. I'm constantly impressed by Palpatine's skill at manipulating people. Even though Luke KNOWS he is being manipulated, he still can't control himself. And sure, part of that is the Skywalker impulsiveness, but major credit goes to Palpatine for being so good at what he does. -As a kid, the final space battle is really why I loved this movie. To see how far the ILM team came in just 6 years is very impressive, because the scale of that battle is something they could only imagine when ANH was made, and it probably pushes the limit of what can realistically be done without cgi.-It's really satisfying to see Luke finally as a fully-powered Jedi. The way he completely dismantles Jabba's private army hearkens back to Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan being utterly unstoppable against the battle droids in Episode I.-I know I've mentioned it several times before in other reviews, but Ben Burtt's sound design is just fantastic. The sounds of the speeder bikes in particular are something that has always stuck with me for how cool and unique they sound. -The choral music that comes in during the final part of the duel between Vader and Luke is amazing and gives me goosebumps every time.-There are some strong Messianic themes associated with both Luke and Anakin. Luke has come to redeem the sins of Anakin the same was Christ did for Adam. Anakin and Adam both chose themselves and their selfish and prideful desires over doing what was right. Luke, son of Anakin, and Christ, son of Adam, make the opposite choice, choosing self-sacrifice over evil, thus redeeming the sins of their fathers. But in the end it is Anakin, conceived of a virgin, who ultimately destroys death (Palpatine) and restores life (bringing balance to the Force)--sacrificing his own life to do so before being reborn in the Force. So in a way he plays both Adam and Christ in this particular Messianic tale.-I know this isn't a popular opinion, but I absolutely love that the DVD/bluray version has Force ghost Anakin played by Hayden Christensen. There's something so powerful about seeing him the way he was before he defiled his soul with evil--smiling and happy with his old friends and mentors again. It gets me in the feels every time.THE BAD-The entire first act on Tatooine. The only benefit of it is that it establishes Luke as a full-on and very powerful Jedi now. Aside from that, it serves no real purpose for the plot.-Boba Fett's inglorious end.-The Ewoks. They bog down the story and it's not really believable to see them beating the Imperial troops. It was an interesting idea to try and parallel them with Germanic tribes beating the Roman Empire, but the execution was ruined by the fact that they are 2 foot tall teddy bears. -Death Star rehash. I get that this is the way Lucas originally wrote it and that the Death Star stuff was moved to ANH just in case that was the only movie made, but once it became clear that the whole trilogy was getting made, he should have come up with something different for this movie rather than just doing that again.-I don't like the special edition diegetic music at all. Give me back the Yub Yub song, please.-I also don't care for the beak they put on the Sarlacc. Overall, the special edition changes were definitely not a improvement for this film.THE UGLY-It's a little odd that Palpatine doesn't struggle at all when Vader picks him up. He just like \"Yep, this is my life now\" as he gets tossed down the shaft.-The look of betrayal by Vader when Palpatine tells Luke to kill him (great job by David Prowse portraying that shocked reaction without any facial expressions or dialogue to work with). It's the exact same look Dooku gives Palpatine when he tell Anakin to kill him. I really don't know what Vader thought would happen when he brought Luke to the Emperor. He knows there can be only two Sith at a time, so either he was hoping Luke would kill Palpatine (no indication given of that in this movie) or that Palpatine would kill Luke (in which case why bother capturing him). My only conclusion can be that Anakin is just not very bright at all. Which retroactively make Vader much less cool than we used to think he was. He really does seem like a tragic Shakespearian character in the end, a fool like Othello who wasn't smart enough to see how Iago was manipulating him the whole time and his lack of perception and critical thinking was what undid him. The difference between him and Othello is that the latter is a pawn all the way to the end, while Anakin seizes some small measure of agency by killing his Iago at the end. However, much like with the Shakespeare play, I think it's possible that the SW saga can be interpreted in such a way that the villain is actually the protagonist and the supposed hero is merely a pawn in his game. Throughout the saga, it is Palpatine who always is in control and proactive in pushing forward his own goals. He has almost all the agency in these movies and thus in many ways he is the protagonist, just like Iago.",

Other than its dramatic aspect, there's still the fun robots and alien-like creatures. The robots and aliens probably make the film more appealing. They're well-designed and executed perfectly.Although fans will stumble and think a few times about it, Return of the Jedi is much more entertaining and engaging than A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back.

Another Death Star.The Galactic Empire has returned with another planet-sized space station to terrorize the galaxy - a fantastic visual of skeletal steel framework on the scale of a planet. And the Rebel Alliance has returned to break it. The Jedi Knights have returned as well, with Luke Skywalker continuing the legacy of the humorless old farts by dressing in black and channeling Burt Lancaster.George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan write, and Richard Marquand directs RETURN OF THE JEDI, opening once again with a text crawl that says nothing. In ominous chords, the Imperial Sith Lord Darth makes a visit to the Death Star to ensure progress continues, for the Emperor himself (Ian McDiarmid, wizened beyond the help of Olay) is scheduled for a visit.Meanwhile, Our Heroes (C-3PO, R2-D2, Han, Chewbacca, Leia and Luke) are in another fine mess, in the palace of evil Jabba the Hutt. (a combination of stale blubber and cancerous liposuction runoff). Han Solo (Harrison Ford), frozen in carbonite, is almost rescued by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), who, in turn, is made the tastiest slave girl fourteen-year-old boys could possibly fantasize over.Into the belly of Jabba's lair strides Luke (Mark Hamill), like an out-of-work acolyte, to rescue Our Heroes with his \"hokey religion and ancient weapons.\" Like a True Jedi. And gets captured. Like an out-of-work acolyte.After Luke battles the aptly-named rancor (a triumph of stop-motion spectacle) and wins, no one in Jabba's employ advises the cancerous blob that it would save on energy, resources, manpower, screen time and efx budget if someone would just blast all the Rebels and be done with it. Instead, they invent the Batman Procrastination-Death: Jabba tries to cast everyone into the Pit of Sarlacc, all pomp and circumstance and a thousand opportunities to escape. Which they do.A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a galactic empire fell, and we descendants of those worlds at war, only hear the WINNERS' points of view. That is, the Rebels Without A Cause. Like all history, it is skewed to make the winners look \"right.\" But were they? The Empire kept order. They battle the Rebel Alliance seemingly just because the Rebel Alliance are battling them.Viewers never question what the rebels were actually fighting for. Well, \"peace,\" for one thing. But the galaxy was AT peace until the Rebels started fighting FOR it. The Empire are so powerful \"star systems bowed down before them\" but what exactly does this mean? Why must \"empires\" be synonymous with evil, like corporations? There is really no difference between the Empire and the Alliance, except the costumes were shinier and the music was scarier.In EPISODE I, slavery is condoned - in a political system long before the Empire came to prominence. Did the Alliance fight to stop slavery? No. By EPISODE VI, there are still no salient issues they are fighting \"for.\" I guess that's why they're called Rebels, for the mere act of \"rebelling.\" We are told they are the good guys unquestioningly; blindly. And you know what happens then - religion is invented.Cue the Jedi.Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) appears to Luke and rationalizes his lie about Vader \"killing\" Luke's father by saying, \"So what I told you was true... from a certain point of view.\" With steam comin' outa his ears, Luke retorts, \"A 'certain point of view'?\" The story of STAR WARS Compleat is \"a certain point of view.\" And if the Empire runs business networks and trade routes galaxywide, in defeating them, the Alliance would only throw galactic business into disarray. But then, Luke and his pals are only dethroning figureheads. Like any corporate machine, it could run automatically until new figureheads are in place. Now I'm all for keeping order in the galaxy, through the use of reasonable taxes, the trade federation and the Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet \u2013 it's the freakin' REBELS throwing things out of whack with their spies and ersatz princesses and wookiees wearing no pants.Climactic action is split into three parts - Han and Leia on the forest moon of Endor ally with Ewoks (were these things meant to be cute or annoying?) to nullify the Death Star's deflector shield; Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and a puppet lead a space battle against the Imperial star destroyers; and on the Death Star itself, Darth Vader (now a good guy who only wants the best for his son) must stop Luke doing Burt Lancaster impressions in front of the Emperor, who is having just too much fun being fey.In space, the dogfights continue like Spitfires against Messerschmitts.At the end of the day, the Empire only lasted about thirty years, from EPISODE I to EPISODE VI. The Jedi would constantly pule about some \"chosen one\" bringing balance to the Force (meaning Darth Vader) while the Sith would sneer that the Dark Side was stronger (meaning Darth Vader). Both hokey religions were wrong. But no one seems to notice.The biggest mind trick the Jedi ever played on us was making us believe George Lucas knew what he was doing. No doubt RETURN OF THE JEDI is exceptional stuff, with John Williams's orchestral score once again simply magnificent, the best effects money could buy, the broad strokes of redemption, friendship and unity amidst the matte paintings and explosions; yet ROTJ is full of gaping holes, ignorant non-science and silly rationalizations, which no amount of \"authorized\" websites can re-imagine into sensibility.I'd go through all the asinine plot holes and physics anomalies, but - as some gutless pilot once wailed, \"There's too many of them!\" --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",

How would they get them out if Han's rescue had been successful?Now a little controvential opinion, Ewoks.Han and his team go to destroy the shield generator on Endor in order to destroy the second Death Star, however before they can set charges to destroy the base an Imperial army then ambushed them and fight against the Rebels.\nThe fight soon turns to the Imperials advantage however the Ewoks then join the fight; using primitive catapults, trip ropes and stones they somehow defeat the Imperials and enable Han to destroy the shield generator.\nThe Ewoks seem like they were only placed in the film as a means of ensuring victory for the Rebels, the Imperials would have defeated the outnumbered Rebels were it not for them, and the idea that such primitive weapons could defeat the Imperial troops seemed a stretch anyway.Prior to this Luke left Hans team and allowed himself to be captured and taken to the Death Star to confront Palpatine and Vader where he is forced to fight Vader, Luke bests the Sith Lord however his compassion for Vader (after he revealed himself as his father) stops Luke from killing him. Instead he throws down his weapon and faces Palpatine unarmed.\nPalpatine attacks Luke with his Force lightning however before he can kill Luke, Vader switchesd allegiance.\nDriven by love for his son Vader lifts Palpatine and throws him down a chute into space and kills him, this act however damages his life support suit and soon after he too dies.\nVader seems like a very selfish man and an unreliable ally, having already turned on the Jedi in Episode III when he saw an opportunity to help himself (to save Padme) he again switches sides to save Luke.The Death Star is then destroyed, typically just as Luke escapes with Vaders body.\nLuke then holds a private Jedi funeral on Endor attended by ghost Obi-Wan and ghost Yoda (the ghost of an old man then appears and is presumably Anakin) meanwhile everyone else has a pre-fight party in the Ewok village.\nThe remastered version is good how the head of the old man ghost is replaced with the head of Hayden Christiensen (who playes Anakin in the Prequel series, as this presumably depicts Anakin the last time he was a Jedi) But where is Qui-Gon who was hinted at being able to appear as a ghost to Obi-Wan while in hiding on Tatooine between the two trilogies?\nIn the remastered version they also show clips of worlds across the universe celebrating the destruction of the Emperor, which is odd since word cannot have spread that fast?",

            "content": "By 1983, the market had become so saturated with Star Wars and science fiction clones that programs were beginning to fail left and right. Even the mighty Doctor Who was faltering under the weight of its own canon, and new ideas had become thin on the ground. Many people criticise Return Of The Jedi as suffering from creative burnout, or Lucas getting too offended that the best film in his series has been the one he had the least amount of control over. There's a certain level of truth to this theory, but when you strip back the Hollywood politics and look at the story, you simply see Lucas being Lucas.At its heart, Return Of The Jedi is the story of one boy who has (finally) grown into a man, and started to face his destiny. He starts off in this by demonstrating that he has mastered one aspect of the Force, in that he can reliably use its powers to his advantage. After doing so, he is told by one of his old mentors that he is just about to face the real test of resisting the temptation to use it in an overtly evil fashion. It's painfully oversimple at times, and sadly indicative of Lucas' tendency to see everything in black and white, but it works.What makes it work is not Lucas' creative direction, but rather the input of others. The climactic phase of the duel on the new Death Star is a perfect example of this. Here, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Mark Hamill, John Williams, and Richard Marquand all band together to deliver a performance that, in 1983, had every audience member holding their hands over their mouths in sheer tense panic at what they thought was happening. When it twists and turns back and forth to its climax, the surprise factor is enough to make the audience forget that it really is clich\u00e9d to an extreme. In other words, it works.It also highlights one thing that Lucas seems to have forgotten in the past twenty-two years. Namely that in any film, regardless of its theme, the human performance element is always the most important. In contrast to later films, the majority of what the viewer sees here was built on a set and could be interacted with in front of the camera while the film was being shot. In simpler language, the performances have more impact because the actors aren't struggling to plant themselves in the reality of a scene where they are almost the only things on the set.Another area where Return Of The Jedi excels is its sense of humour. The numerous booby traps and improvised war machines improvised by the Ewoks deliver some well-timed laughs. Peter Mayhew must have been glad at this time to not be the only person on the shoot who had to struggle with being covered head to foot in fur, too. Matter of fact, it seems the entire cast is more relaxed this time around.If there is one problem with the film, it is that dialogue which would have helped the human element of the story to some degree has mostly been left out. Questions like what Yoda would think of his last student going on such a major rampage against an admittedly despicable crime figure, for instance, are never answered.Delving for a minute into another slight problem, the special edition \"improvements\" were just a bit unnecessary. One has to wonder what the crew who invested countless hours into making the puppetry work for the musical number in Jabba's palace thought of the new number. Putting aside the annoying performers for a second, the number they chose is really awful. It seems we are going to have two competing visions of the future, music-wise. Lucas appears to support the Backstreet Boys version. Seriously, the number in the palace is so clich\u00e9d and predictable you can predict every repeated line without having heard the song before. Give me Basil and Zo\u00eb Poledouris' number in StarShip Troopers, any day.Overall, however, I felt Return Of The Jedi was worthy of nine out of ten. It was a slight improvement over A New Hope, and a slight letdown after The Empire Strikes Back. However, even compared independently of the prequels, it is a fun ride that involves a little higher thought on the part of the viewer, which is always a good thing.",

            "content": "Though not quite up to the standards of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi is a satisfying end for the Star Wars saga. This one doesn't seem to have quite the same pace as the first two. It kind of meanders about with little bursts of energy here and there before it comes to its thrilling grand finale.When last we left our heroes and villains Darth Vader had just told Luke Skywalker he was his father and Han Solo had been frozen in carbonite to be taken away by bounty hunter Boba Fett to Jabba the Hutt. Here, Luke will deal with Han first, Vader later. We begin on Luke's old home planet of Tatooine where we learn Han is being held, still frozen, as a captive of the giant slug-like creature Jabba. Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO will all be involved in a mission to free Han. Suffice to say things don't go quite according to plan and among other indignities Leia ends up wearing a skimpy bikini and chained to the monstrous Jabba as his slave girl. Soon Luke arrives and we see his powers with the Force have grown but not to the extent that he can avoid finding himself in quite a predicament himself. We end up spending quite a bit of time on Tatooine, perhaps a bit too much as the film struggles to really get going. Finally (and inevitably as otherwise we'd have a really short movie) our heroes manage to free themselves from Jabba's clutches and we can move on to what will be the central theme of the movie. Luke Skywalker's attempt to redeem his father, Anakin Skywalker, and turn him from the evil he has become, Darth Vader, back to the good man he once was will be the main focus from here on in.Before he can confront Vader, Luke returns to Dagobah to finish his Jedi training with master Yoda. Here he learns his training is in fact complete. All that stands in the way of his being a Jedi Knight is to confront (and presumably defeat) Vader. After the stunning revelation in the last film in which we learned Vader was Luke's father another branch of the Skywalker family tree is revealed here. Not quite as stunning but something that certainly will change the perspective of some of the key characters when they learn the truth and also change how the audience perceives them.Travelling with Han, Leia and a rebel party to the forest moon of Endor, Luke will be part of a mission designed to bring about the destruction of a new Death Star the Empire is constructing. Those on the moon will be responsible for bringing the battle station's shield down so the rebel fleet can attack and destroy the Death Star. If the mission fails it will be the end of the rebellion and there will be no hope of freedom in the galaxy.Unfortunately as we move towards the film's climax we get bogged down on Endor as our heroes encounter a band of Ewoks, tiny primitive bear-like creatures. While they certainly may appeal to kids (and therefore sell a bunch of toys) the Ewoks have no place in this story. They do not bring the requisite level of seriousness required considering all the serious things which are occurring around them. There it seems only for comic relief the Ewoks are in fact not funny. Instead they are incredibly annoying and the film slows to a crawl as we learn more than we could ever want to know about them and their way of life.Eventually, sensing his father's presence, Luke leaves the rest of the rebels (and their new furry friends) to confront Darth Vader and try to turn him away from the Dark Side of the Force. Vader may seem to waver a bit but he is convinced it is too late for him. Vader will bring his son before the Emperor, briefly glimpsed in the last film and now played wonderfully by Ian McDiarmid. The Emperor, determined to turn Luke to the Dark Side, is pure evil personified. Soon, Luke will be faced with a choice. He must turn to the Dark Side or be destroyed.Meanwhile, back on the moon of Endor, Han, Leia and company are running into their own problems. If they don't get the Death Star's shield down the rebel fleet will face certain annihilation. It all builds to a thrilling conclusion as we cut back and forth from the efforts of the rebels and Ewoks on Endor to the confrontation between Luke, Vader and the Emperor on the Death Star to the rebel fleet's attack on the battle station. The ending certainly does not disappoint. It is dramatic, emotional and ultimately thrilling. The Star Wars saga ends with a bang.Return of the Jedi does have its problems, most notably a slow pace and the presence of the insufferable Ewoks. The performances of the actors aren't quite up to their prior standards. Harrison Ford at times seems to be going through the motions as Han Solo although that may have something to do with the fact he's acting with a bunch of little furballs. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia seems strangely emotionless, especially when faced with some rather startling news. Mark Hamill does do well to capture the earnestness of a son who never stops believing there is good in his father despite all evidence to the contrary. McDiarmid is terrific and even in voice only James Earl Jones gives a terrific performance as Darth Vader. Of course, the visuals and special effects are typically dazzling. After the majesty of the first two films, Return of the Jedi may be seen as a slight disappointment. But all in all it is a worthy conclusion for a grand, sweeping, epic saga unlike any other we have ever seen.",

            "content": "Return of the Jedi has the conclusion of the trilogy's Skywalker and Darth Vader's redemption at its core, which nevertheless does not save it from being the weakest of the trilogy. In many moments, it seems to echo its previous instalments, but with a lesser sense of wonder and escapism that Star Wars first wowed audiences with, and which Empire improved upon. There is another intergalactic band entertaining at Jabba's palace, but although the design and costuming of the aliens is creative and often unique, the derivative jazz song is not nearly as memorable as the Cantina Band theme. In Tattoine we had endless deserts, twin suns, houses submerged blow ground to avoid the heat, sand creatures and scavengers roaming the cliffs...here we have a impressive looking sail barge and an imposing creature in the dirt, but it does not feel entirely otherworldly, and the conflict and threat (specifically the iconic Boba Fett) are quickly extinguished, and it does not feel nearly as engaging as the Battle on Hoth. I point to a different little moment that expresses the world of Star Wars more effectively; as Jabba's rancor beast is killed, its handler emerges and sobs at this personal loss, and this is something which we can all identify with, and speaks volumes of the depth of Lucas' universe. The technical accomplishments remain, and are even crisper in the last of the trilogy. There are three particularly stunning matte painting backgrounds; Jabba's palace jutting out from the rocky cliff as one sun is already half submerged, the legions of stormtroopers saluting the Emperor's first live appearance as the Imperial theme blasts, and the last shots of the Ewok's treetop village huts where spots of light and celebration sing of the Empire's defeat. Jabba's costume is amongst the most impressive of them all; an immense animatronic puppet which took six people each controlling a different segment of the body and whom booms in a deep guttural Huttese. The various fighter jets, pod- racer and star destroyer miniatures are likewise lovingly crafted and detailed; some of these bluescreen backdrops create the most immersive and chaotic space battles yet in the series. The problem lies not in those areas but issues in the story. Star Wars, for the immense achievement that it was, was more an intro to the world and did not delve too deeply into the Darth Vader narrative, or the peril of the galaxy, and it was up to Empire to establish those strands. It perhaps left too much for RoTJ to lift; there are blocks of time in the film where characters will simply bring us back to speed and talk at length of the next plot development. Obi-Wan's ghost is conveniently informative (and the mention of the thematic relevance of point of view is not quite as bad as the infamous line in the prequels, but still slightly shallow), as is Yoda, who proclaims Luke battle-ready immediately after he returns to complete his training, and the reveal of the siblings is painfully drawn out, which perhaps exposes a small weakness of the dramatic acting of the main cast. Luke has a mission, and a climatic reunion with his father. The rest of the cast is pushed aside to Endor, the home of the Ewoks, whom twelve year olds loved because of their likeness to teddy bears, but everyone else despised because of their irrelevance and ability to so easily decimate high tech legions of stormtroopers. The cross-cutting of this battle with Lando's assault on the second Death Star only further emphasise the tonal issues with the entirety of the Endor subplot; not only does it seem ludicrous that the shield generators are located on a separate moon (so what happens when you need to leave this random planetary system), but the methods in which the Ewoks wipe out the stormtrooper battalions have become laughably cheesy in time and lacking compared to the tension of the real battle high above. The real strength of the movie is within Hamill's changed Skywalker, and in Sebastian Shaw's brief but crucial final moment. Post time- skip Luke is older, more mature, and understands the lure of the Dark Side which corrupted his father, so much so that he refuses to fight back even as the rebels are being defeated and throws his lightsaber away. As Vader witnesses his son be tortured by his master, the Kuleshov effect cuts back and forth between Luke's screams of agony and Vader's faceless mask, but the power of his characterisation enables us to know exactly how he is feeling, and in the final reveal of Shaw, redemption is attained. It is a pity that Lucas chose to mar this character (Anakin finds his redemption as the elderly Shaw, not as the moody Hayden Christensen - the force ghost should correspond with this) but the original trilogy stands the test of time. It is a galaxy that has become loved by millions.",

And still brings forth a new beginning, a beginning of cheesiness to Star Wars. Starting with this movie, Star Wars takes a turn for the worse in terms of overall development.The movie starts out with the rescue of Han Solo from the clutches of Jaba the Hutt. Then to the battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, and the Rebel Alliance's mission to destroy an even more powerful Death Star, this time with no way to stop it.Although the visual effects were still really good, the story and pace started to become weak. The integration from the rescue of Han Solo to destroying the Death Star 2 were far from seamless. And the rescue of Han Solo seemed far less effective than the rescue of Spock from \"Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock.\" Felt more like an excuse to bring back Solo.Both Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi reveals something about Luke Skywalker's heritage and family. Though Empire Strikes Back's revelation still ripples through pop culture today, revealing the \"other\" in this movie that Yoda mention in Empire was pretty lame, and felt a little pointless. And that fact of the \"other\" didn't really have a role except in the Star Wars comic book series \"Dark Empire.\" Basically, starting with this movie, Star Wars began to run out of steam. And that loss of steam continued on with the disappointing prequels.However, the movie is not totally faulty. A tad cheesy, bringing forth the lovable Ewoks was a nice touch. It's development was pretty lame, but the final battle between Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, and the Emperor did play a pivotal role in the Star Wars universe.Being reasonably good as a general movie, but still pretty cheesy over all, give Return of the JedI 6.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "I am baffled by the high ratings this film has received. It is actually quite weak, suffering from poor directing, a weak script with stupid (not corny) dialog and improbable situations. Enter the Ewoks, and the whole series ends in a blaze Toys-R-Us glory. The only story line of interest is the one pitting Luke against his father, but unfortunately Mark Hamill is not up to the task. The script calls for him to mourn the loss of Yoda, appeal to a (supposedly) conflicted Vader, fearlessly face the Emporer, be the matured, slightly aloof Jedi to his swashbuckling Solo and Calrisian, but until the very end, when Hamill finally pulls out all the stops, it is simply difficult to accept him as a mature jedi knight. The final fight between Luke, Vader and the Emporer is well-staged and beautifully shot. Unfortunately, one must traverse a lot of goofy material to get there, beginning with Jabba the Hut, who is wonderfully realized but his den of thieves and vagrants comes across more as a children's version of Ali Baba. The standout performance is Dave Prowse/James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, while Carrie Fisher is obviously looking forward to wrapping the series and getting on with her career, as it were. But enough. This film does not warrant deep analysis. A disappointing ending to what could have been one of the most compelling film series in historic. After 20+ years it still hurts.",

            "content": "My Take: As the original STAR WARS series comes to a close, this final chapter has everything fans have hoped for. THE RETURN OF THE JEDI (re-titled as STAR WARS: EPISODE VI-THE RETURN OF THE JEDI during its re-release) is the last (chronologically) of the original STAR WARS trilogy, and it is also a self rating chapter in the series. \"Jedi\" will always be ranked third best in the original trilogy (with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK being the best). It's not as dark and deep as \"Empire\", nor is it quite as original as STAR WARS (Episode IV: A NEW HOPE). Actually, \"Jedi\" owes more on the elements from the original film (including, of course, the Death Star and some of the Jedi duels). But I wouldn't complain, since if this was something else, I wouldn't have liked it. \"Jedi\" has everything I liked about the saga, from the exciting and comic fun of the original, as well as the deepened mythology of the second. Not to mention of course the terrific special effects work which were great, not just because of its innovation, but also the imagination it took to make them.One of the best examples of these wild imaginations in special effects are in the first half of the film which takes place on the crowded palace of the loathsome crime lord Jabba the Hutt. This place is filled with strange-looking beings and bizarre creatures which is almost twice as much than those featured in the Cantina scene in the original STAR WARS. The film opens with those adorable droid duo C3PO (performed by Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 entering this creaky palace bargaining for the freedom of Han Solo (HArrison Ford), who is still frozen in carbonate block. This leads to, not one but, two battles between our hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and two gruesome monsters. One lives in a dungeon beneath Jabba's throne room. The other lives in a sandpit and slowly digests its victims for a thousand years, which is an enjoyable and exciting battle in tradition of other entertaining adventure movies. The entertainment continues on later on a battle in a small planet moon introducing a bunch of cute and lovable creatures called Ewoks (probably added to give the film more cutesy as well as irony, since these little bunch of teddy bear-like beings beat the butts out of Imperial troops), as well as a second attempt at yet another Death Star. But one of the most awaited sequence in the film is the final duel between Luke Skywalker and the evil Darth Vader (Dave Prowse; voiced by James Earl Jones), which we no know is Luke's Father.THE RETURN OF THE JEDI is the second STAR WARS film that creator George Lucas didn't direct, passing it once again to another director. This time, it's director Richard Marquand, who is really not a match for Lucas in the first film, nor is he definitely a match for Lucas' mentor Irvin Kershner who directed the second. But he still does a fine job, especially when it comes to adding a lot of fun on those exciting sequences, a grand tradition in the STAR WARS legacy. The imagination, both on the special-effects and the storyline, is still not left behind.I am ranking \"Jedi\" on par with the first movie. Though not as deep and cleverly achieved as \"Empire\", \"Jedi\" is still exciting, entertaining, imaginative and anything else positive about a fantasy film. It's just a lovable epic romp with its heart on the right place.Rating: ***** out of 5.",

If I was honest in my criticism, I'd give this probably a 3 star rating as it is a little bit weaker than the two before it. Also the narrative is a tad disjointed as the beginning is Luke trying to rescue Han Solo, then you get the final training montage, then the Ewoks and then finally the confrontation. All of this works reasonably well, but it feels like you need to have seen the first two to understand the full scale of what is happening. My point is, it's a great sequel, but not as strong as a stand alone. That said, who cares? This sequel is the most character driven and has a lot of heart. There are two tragic death scenes that are moving and an epic light saber showdown climax that probably features the best action sequences in the series. Again, I was not at all disappointed in 1983, and like the others took my wife to rerelease in the 90s, because, sure I loved The Terminator, Rambo and Bruce Lee, but Star Wars was and always will be the cornerstone of my childhood.**** Out of 4-(Excellent)",

Just before he expires, Yoda tells Luke that he's close to being a full fledged Jedi and that to complete his training he must thwart Darth Vader once and for all and that there's another Skywalker. There's just one problem, which Yoda finally confirms: Vader IS Luke's father, Anakin Skywalker. It is here that the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi comes clean about Luke's dad, that O himself was very impressed with Anakin when he met him and arrogantly believed that he could train Anakin as well as Yoda. Big mistake. Luke doesn't want to fight Vader knowing that he's his father, but Obi-Wan tells him that saving Vader's soul is a lost cause: \"He's more machine now, than man. Twisted and evil.\" Then another bombshell is dropped - Leia is Luke's sister.We later catch up with the Rebel Alliance and their plans to destroy the new Death Star. Han will lead a group of soldiers on Endor into the shield generator complex that keeps the shield protecting the new Death Star working and blow it up while Lando, back in the driver's seat of the Millenium Falcon, leads the attack on the Death Star itself. After some forest hijinx and making an alliance with the local alien race of Ewoks - cute little teddy bear men and women - Luke tells Leia that they're twins and then he lets himself get captured so he can face Vader and the Emperor. Luke appeals to Vader to repent his sins and resists the temptations of the Emperor, but Vader insists that the Dark Side is the right side and the Emperor continues to act all disturbingly feminine towards Luke while the battle rages on outside and on Endor. Luke is eventually forced to fight Vader in order to save him while the Emperor goads him to give into the hate within him. Finally, Vader pisses Luke off by suggesting that Leia may fall prey to the Dark Side and Luke kicks his ass. After teetering on the brink for a moment, Luke throws down his light saber and says that if the Emperor wants him, he'll have to kill him. The Emperor tries to Kentucky fry Luke and Luke calls out to Vader for help. After watching his boy get fried for a few seconds, Vader attacks the Emperor, hefts him up and throws him to his death. Luke tries to save Vader while he's still alive and even unmasks him. Vader repents, tells Luke he's sorry and expires. Luke then escapes the Death Star before Lando and the gang blow it to smithereens. Han was helped in its destruction by the Ewoks.Luke burns Vader's body, joins the celebration over the destruction of the Empire and sees the ghost of his father Anakin Skywalker with the ghosts of Yoda & Obi-Wan. And they all live happily ever after.Yeah it's a little too cute in some spots, but at the end of the day, it's not a bad film. Maybe not the best way to wrap up a trilogy, but certainly not as bad as so many people would make it out to be or as bad as the prequels that were relased in 1999 and 2002 (and projectedly 2005).\nThe film is more about Luke, which makes sense since he's the main character. Mark Hamill does a pretty good job, all in all. Harrison Ford has little to do here as Han Solo. Ford really lit up the screen whenever he was on hand in the first two films, but here he keeps mostly to the background, which is a bit of a shame given the flair we were accustomed to him giving Han. This is partially due to the fact that the film is mostly about Luke, and the fact that Ford was making the transition from smart ass matinee idol to quiet leading man, and probably also he was simply getting tired of playing the same smart ass over and over again. Ford's not bad, but he does feel under used. Carrie Fisher has more to do as Leia, but when you look at her eyes and her smeared eye liner, she looks like she's lost, like she's off on her own, like she almost doesn't know where she is. Known for having abused drugs in the past, this was probably the point where poor Carrie was starting to lose it. Still, Fisher and Ford make the most of their roles and screen time, as does Billy Dee Williams as Lando. James Earl Jones still has the intimidating boom in his voice as Vader, but it's a shame that it wasn't David Prowse we saw when Vader was unmasked. I always thought Ian McDiarmid was a bit feminine as the Emperor, more annoying than scary. Alec Guinness still has that poetic charm as Obi-Wan.Special effects are still a highlight of the film, with plenty of battles and the light saber duel to entertain.",

And after that, I love the Star Wars saga.We now come to the last chapter in the Star Wars (original) trilogy. Luke, now a Jedi Knight, and his band travel to his home planet of Tatooine, to get Han Solo out of the palace of Jabba the Hut. But the Hutt has no intention in freeing the prisoners and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the Rebel fleet; but Luke has a promise to keep, so he heads for Dagobah. But Yoda is dying - the end of his days are upon him. On his death-bed, Yoda tells Luke he needs no training; all he needs to do is face Darth Vadar. But Luke felt torn, he could not face his own father, who was once Jedi Knight Anikan Skywalker. Luke also found out from Yoda before his last breath (and Obi's spirit), that Leia is his long-lost twin sister! The two were separated from birth to protect them from both Vadar/Anikan and the evil Emperor.Meanwhile, the Rebel Alliance had learned that the enemy is building a new Death Star space station - bigger and more powerful than the first one; and indestructible. With a shield generator on the forest moon of Endor. So Luke and Han formed a crack team to go to Endor, and find that generator, take it down so that the alliance could destroy the incomplete Death Star. On Endor, Luke and his companions meet a tribe of Ewoks, primitive yet intelligent indigenous forest creatures of Endor. With the help of C-3PO, they are able to forge an alliance with the tribe. Later, Luke decides that the time has come for him to face Vadar. He confesses to Leia the truth about her and Vadar, and that he has to try to save the man who was once their father. So like I said : That's all I could tell you folks, watch it and see how it ends.Overall, \"Return of the Jedi\" is an awesome finish to the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy.

I, who actually always had not understood why so many people like this film a lot better then The Empire strikes Back finally understood it. I mean I had seen this film about seven or eight times before, but when I saw it again, I realized what a great film this is. I'd immediately have given it a ten out of ten if it wouldn't have been for the beginning of the film, which I think sucks a bit. First of all I do not like that singing performance in the beginning that much, but that is not what bothered me. What really bothered me were the bad, bad, bad effects in the Rancor vs. Luke fighting scene. The bad effects draw all the attention to them than to focus it on the action and that was so bad no 10 can ever be given by me to this film. Apart from that this film is just one enormous accumulation of excitement, fun, action, emotion, surprises and twists which will not let you out of it's grip until the end. All this is held together by the performances of the great cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), Billy Dee Williams (Lando) , Clive Revill (Emperor Palpatine) and the Voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader. As you may have noticed during my other reviews I really like Harrison Ford as Han Solo most but I must say my other personal favorite is Carrie Fisher as the Princess who does not mind to get her hands dirty. This (again) does not mean I do not like the other characters, as a matter of fact I like them all, but these two have the biggest amount of memorable scenes together. My other favorite pair in this trilogy (mostly due to this film) would (of course) be Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.\nNow, to not bore you more with my views on this trilogy I'd like to say something about the whole Saga. It actually is more or less aimed at George Lucas and all the original cast of Star Wars, but they'll never read it anyway so here it goes. With the prequel Trilogy taking it's form as we speak there is an enormous hope going around Star Wars fans everywhere that Lucas will also do the last Trilogy. Lucas himself though said that he won't do it and it has been also said by other participants of this Trilogy that they won't return. Let me give you my view on it. In my opinion, opening weekends and box \u0096 office results have shown there still is an interest in the Star Wars stories and regarding that one is probably safe suggesting that people would go and see the last Trilogy too. I mean, The Return of the Jedi is a good ending of an epic story, but the fact there is more, makes me wonder what more there could be to the story and I must admit, I need to know how it continues. So in my opinion Lucas should have a poll on his Star Wars site on whether or not the public wants to see the last Trilogy as well. If the outcome is yes he should polish up the story and go to all of his original cast (Fisher, Hamill and Ford) and ask them to return for their roles, for I presume the crowd wants to see their old heroes back on the screen. I mean I would understand it if Lucas said he doesn't want to do it, but maybe the fact that the people want to see his stuff without even knowing what it is about, makes him feel so honored that he'll do it anyway. Plus, I mean with the technology of this day, he could shoot all three films back to back (as was done with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy) and he would be done fast, rather than spending more than 6 years on the whole Trilogy. As for the original cast, I could understand them, if they do not want to return, I mean for they all do not need the money, but it would be nice to see them again in the roles that made them famous. I am not going to say now that they owe it to the audience to return as Leia, Luke and Han to the big screen, because the audience watches their films, buys their books and stuff. No, I won't and you know why? Because that is not true they don't owe us anything. They do what they like and we watch it if we like and that's it. We want to be entertained and they provide us with entertainment. I mean it is not like fame has served all of the stars of this Trilogy well (except maybe for Ford) and we have to respect that too. It is their life and not ours and so it is up to them if they want to re \u0096 enter that Star Wars frenzy or not. Cause a frenzy it is. All I do hope, is that Lucas really thinks about making the third Trilogy of the Star Wars saga and I also hope all of the other \u0091original' cast and crew members do the same, because I want to see the ending of an epic story, knowing that all the people I \u0091know' worked on it.\nWatch, be surprised, entertained, sad and jolly.\nMay the force be with you\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085always.\n9 out of 10",

            "content": "Now this is an unpopular opinion, but I think this movie is a little bit better than A New Hope. A New Hope was a very good movie, but something felt missing there. The Empire Strikes Back was a masterpiece, and this one is also very good, but flawed. I think almost everyone agrees that the main problem here are the Ewoks, like I do. They are cute little fellas and everything, but they just don't fit into this movie and makes the story too light- hearted while it's actually pretty serious and it is shown in parts with Luke, Vader and the Emperor, and I think that part is a bit underused. Seriousness is what this movie lacks. Not to be completely dark and serious, but more like the previous movie, and the Ewoks don't help. And it's also laughable how easily can Stormtroopers be killed. I mean, like, Ewoks beat them down in a few seconds. What??? Luckily, those were the only bad sides here. Humor works really good for the most of the time, especially with C-3PO and R2-D2. I love them. The action is well done as always and while there are many goofy and light-hearted parts of the movie, it has some very serious parts which I mentioned above that are really well done. Luke Skywalker has really developed as a character and now he's one of the coolest characters in the franchise. Here we also get to see a more human side of Darth Vader and he has never felt so vulnerable, especially with the arrival of the new big bad:The Emperor. The actor who is playing him (I can't remember the name, I'm really sorry) was so awesome. Just the way he moves, the way he speaks, his face expressions, everything was just great and just enough not to be goofy and that's one of the best performances in the series. Overall, this is a satisfying fast-paced finale of the original trilogy, and while not as good ad it's predecessor, and considered by many people to be the weakest in the original trilogy is still a great movie and one more timeless classic.",

Unfortunately, dialogue is on and off, with truly meaningful moments becoming slightly overshadowed by forced and questionable lines. Character development is still bright, though, in particular for the lead protagonist and antagonist. Their overall trilogy arcs are undoubtedly satisfying. However, the plot is too inconsistent in its deliverance. The comedic moments of the film are simply not well done, even though relief is welcome for a film dealing in such a high stake conflict. This ultimately takes away from the legitimacy of the film's intense storyline, especially within the finale featuring some unconvincing action. However, the presence of three simultaneous third act plot lines is pulled off, particularly because of the well crafted main storyline. The supporting space piece is visually appreciable, too, even though it does feel repetitive of a past sequence in the trilogy, for obvious reasons. As always, the score and sound nicely assists the various tones set up throughout. Overall, this finale is a good film, even with its undeniably disappointing facets.",

He learns he is a part of something rather than being apart from everyone.I know some people hate the ewoks but I always thought they were OK. I remember reading they were supposed to be wookies originally which would have been great but I guess Lucas struggled to get enough 7 foot tall actors.I know Harrison ford said he found Han boring and one dimensional but I always thought his character had the greatest transformation and if you read the Timothy Zahn books it really fleshes this out. Unfortunately most recent iteration does make him seem shallow and is rewriting Star Wars history which is really sad. I would have thought Mr Ford would have had enough clout to demand a better script, or maybe he just didn't care.I have been rewatching these movies to get the taste of the newest effort out of my mouth. They are great movies. Obviously there is no Star Wars without George Lucas, who really loved the characters and had plans for them. Not just using them as a money making machine.",

            "content": "SPOILERS So it all comes down to this. Six years after George Lucas released the first of his epic trilogy, events are concluded in explosive fashion. Well made and slightly more humorous, \"Return of the Jedi\" is not without flaw, but it's original condition was brilliant in construct and an entertaining film throughout.After the shocking conclusion to \"The Empire Strikes Back\", this film continues a short time after. All separated and searching for Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the main cast of the film are united in the palace of Jabba The Hutt. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), trainee Jedi Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and others are all involved in attempts to free their friend. At the same time however, the evil Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) is overseeing the construction of another Death Star. With plans afoot to convert Skywalker to the dark side, the fate of the galaxy is about to be decided.After his break in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", George Lucas returns in part to this film to ruin parts of it. As a co-writer with Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas' return marks the unfortunate return of the dire dialogue happily missing from the last film.\"Return of the Jedi\" also marks the return of Lucas to the major editing room for his remastering of the film. Adding an animated singing alien to a scene in Jabba's palace, Lucas manages to destroy the integrity of the scene with minimal effort. Then at the end, he also changes the music of the final scene to create a conclusion which doesn't flow as well as the original one did. There is never anything wrong with improving the picture quality of a film to make it more colourful and enjoyable, but when someone begins to change the content, they take away from the purity of the work. George Lucas never seemed to understand this and as a result, his remastered version of this brilliant film is a sign of insanity. Lucas should have left well enough alone.Aside from future changes and the occasional mistake in the script, the original version of this film is a pleasure to watch. Entertaining and action packed, the film thrives on expanding a universe which people have loved for over twenty years. \"Return of the Jedi\" stars brilliantly and never looses it's pace with a majestic final half hour and a well structured story throughout. It is just a shame though that Lucas needed to try to change things again. Some people never learn.",

            "content": "Before saying anything else- anyone who felt the prequels or recent Force Awakens films were even remotely watchable, please stop reading. You people are just unable to understand why ROTJ was so terrible (just as I am not able to understand astrophysics). In a nutshell, ROTJ has all the usual bad elements in a sequel and none of the good (aside from improved special effects). How anyone can mention this film in the same breath as the first two is beyond me or anyone who has any objectivity about this trilogy. The two biggest problems were the acting and story/script. The acting seems wooden and emotionless, Ford seems like he doesn't want to be there at all, Luke is monotone and boring, Leia looks and sounds worn out. I felt Lando and the Emperor did a good job (they seemed actually part of the movie). The script for everyone was repetitive, unoriginal, no comic relief or wit, and far less intelligent- and if fans can't see this, then as I said, they are simply unable to perceive/observe these details- not everyone can. Story line- poor. Half the film takes place rescuing Han, and while I enjoyed the segment concept, it was hugely overlong, and irrelevant to the main theme. The story and backdrops were also terribly unoriginal and repetitive. We spend half the movie on Tatooine (like the First film) and then half the movie in a very standard earth-like forest like Yavin (first film). The return of the same death star threat also, while not terrible, worsened the banality as did its demise by blowing it up similarly like the first film- yawn. Chronology was also hugely erroneous- In Empires, Lando & Chewie leave to go to Jabba's to rescue Han. Yet, Luke is somehow a virtual Jedi in a matter of days or weeks. I thought it takes years to become a Jedi- and who would have trained Luke since he returns to Yoda to \"continue the training\" after confronting Vader. This anachronism makes the audience feel like Lucas thinks we are stupid (maybe we are). Now, the biggest flaws of the film are the detail errors (from beginning to end): why did Jabba permit Leia to unfreeze Han when Jabba enjoyed him as a wall decoration? Why did Luke attempt to clumsily attack Jabba with a gun from the holster of a guard? Did he actually think he could single handed defeat all of Jabba's guards? How could Leia strangle Jabba with a chain? He's enormous and she's frail. With all of the forces of the Rebellion, why did they only rely on 4 of them to rescue Han from Jabba- risky, no? Why not send an army or have a larger force waiting outside once Luke and Lando infiltrate? And actually, why didn't Lando unfreeze Han since he was already under cover? Please. Why did they have a door closing panel on the 'inside' of the monster dungeon that Luke threw a rock at? Why would being \"digested for 1000 years\" be scary when you'd be dead in moments once swallowed? Why were the languages spoken at Jabba's so dumb sounding- \"wonga wonga\"? Why does C3PO have so much trouble speaking a common Jabba dialect? For an interpreter of 6 million languages, he sounds like he is stumbling for the words all the time he speaks another language. Why are the creatures at Jabba's so juvenile looking? Absolutely stupid and silly compared to the sinister creatures in Star Wars. Speaking of which, the Ewoks really were silly- perhaps if they were not such a huge part of the movie! So, watching little people wearing teddy bear costumes for over an hour speaking in the least convincing dumb-sounding Ewok language was hard to bear, and listening to C3PO storytelling put me to sleep. Seeing Yoda on death's bed in ROTJ yet seeing him spry and jumping around like a teenager in Empires just shows how bad the errors in the timeline are in this film- and he just happens to die exactly when Luke arrives? Then the story line of Luke actually thinking he could 'turn' Vader just by approaching him and asking is completely delusional. What did Luke think was going to happen? Even a jedi would have a bit of trouble escaping alive from the Emperor and Vader on the Death Star. So why risk it as the last living Jedi??? Not plausible. Then let's fast forward to watching a Super Star destroyer (5 miles long) have a single fighter hit it and make it veer into the Death Star? Really? That's like a seagull hitting an aircraft carrier and sinking it. STUPID. Also, if you look at the scale of the Super Star Destroyer and the surface of the Death Star that it impacts on, the Death Star looks like it's a million times the mass of the Super Star Destroyer- not likely. And since when was it so close to the Death Star??? Wasn't it much, much farther away staying out of the conflict? What is most pointless is the fact that Luke could have avoided going to the Death Star and avoided Vader killing the Emperor and just watch as the Death Star gets ultimately blown up, killing but the Emperor. Redundant. Lastly, just because the Emperor is killed off, what about the thousands of Imperial ships and Destroyers, millions of storm troopers, and I'm sure plenty of high powered corrupt Senate officials and other bureaucrats who would obviously take over control? This movie ironically had literally all the movie making resources at its disposal. That may also ironically be exactly why this movie sucked- Lucas had way too much influence in it and not reigned in by smarter producers and co-writers and directors. Lucas may have succumbed to the hype of his own cult status and started to believe his infallibility and just couldn't imagine ROTJ could possibly end up being anything but amazing. He was wrong.",

There's the explosive final battle against the evil Empire as well as the resolution of the more personal conflict between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. However, it's not quite a tour-de-force: there are some cumbersome info dumps, which slacken the film's pace, and the direction and photography are a little too simple. Worse is the treatment of the supporting characters, since just about everyone besides Luke and Vader get reduced to minor roles.The action scenes are definitely the movie's greatest strength. In the first act our heroes rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, with both a classic Ray Harryhausen monster fight and an all-out brawl on Jabba's sail barge. The speeder bike chase on Endor is a breathtaking highlight, filmed entirely with models and steady-cams; it's better than Episode I's pod race and just about outdoes the first movie's classic trench run. The Battle of Endor itself is an amazing accomplishment, and the space dogfights went unmatched for the next twenty years. Luke and Vader's lightsaber duel is more emotional than technical, but satisfying anyway.The exposition, though, is really a problem. There are two kinds of scenes in Jedi: action set pieces and info dumps. Luke visits Dagobah again so that Yoda can confirm that Vader is, in fact, Luke's Father; Luke then gets the full story from Ben Kenobi's ghost. There's also a pause for Luke to reveal to Leia that they're brother and sister, which only functions to write off the romantic triangle of the previous film. Many of the scenes with the Emperor are talky and static. This all feels like the perfunctory tying-up of loose ends, which could have been handled in a more exciting and dynamic way.The script closely follows the story of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, to the exclusion of Han, Leia, Lando, and the others. George Lucas has said that the entire six-part series is really about the fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker, and Return of the Jedi bears that out. Their conflict is the solid emotional centrepiece of the film, coming close to its mythic, Oedipal roots. The final triumph of both the Rebellion and the Light side of the Force is a very satisfying moment; it's good to see the good guys win big. If only the other characters had more to do.The Star Wars movies have always had great design, effects, and music, and Jedi is no different. The themes are strongest in this one: the cold, mechanical quality of the Empire is emphasised by the skeletal image of the new Death Star, which matches Vader's scarred face and the Emperor himself. The music is suitably sinister. The Rebels, on the other hand, are colourfully democratic: there are many different alien races and different types of starship in their fleet, and the costumes are mainly earthy greens, browns, and reds. The Ewok planet, filmed in the redwood forests of California, is also terrific. For me that's the best part of the movie, and the series as a whole. The ultimate victory over the totalitarian Empire is an act of ordinary people (and Ewoks), rather than superhuman heroes.",

It is a bit lazy for the goal to blow up the death star again. However, the action when it happens it still some of the most entertaining moments put to screen. Same with speeder bike on Endor with John Williams music accompanying it immerses you in this universe. The movie is without the funniest out of the three, and honestly, there's nothing wrong with that. We know the situation at hand and the movie doesn't try to be any more than what it is to still be a fun-hearted adventure. You can tell everybody is having a blast even Harrison Ford.",

            "content": "Even though I have seen all of the movies from the original trilogy about a million and one times... this is the first I have ever commented on them... I wasn't quite sure as to which movie I should provide the critique for (I didn't feel like practically repeating my criticism on all three movies), but seeing as how ROTJ is the concluding film (and possibly my favorite... I am sort of torn between it and Empire...) I figured this is where to start... I'll try not to give any *spoilers* away but be FOREWARNED just incase... so here it goes...Now grant you, TESB does provide a more solid performance as far as conflict and general plot development; however, I believe I am so attracted to ROTJ due to the stunning character developments.Solo (Ford) becomes a much more \"sensitive\" character as a result of his budding relationship with Leia (of course I am saying this through a woman's eyes so I am sure that a lot of guys would disagree with me).  But, his change is reasonable, as he begins to realize that his \"gruff\" and \"selfish\" ways need to be dulled down if he is to win the heart of the woman he loves. My only gripe with the character of Solo in the third installment is that his screen time is almost chopped in half in comparison to the first two. But, once again, this can be understood since the focus on ROTJ must be placed almost completely on Luke and his development as the new order of Jedi.Most of all I am impressed with the character development of Luke (Hamill). His growth from irritating farm boy to a powerful and calm, young man fits in well with Lucas' characteristics of \"the Force.\"  To be able to master such intense composure in such a short time and through heavy hardships truly means you have the qualities of a Jedi.  And even though some may paint Hamill's performance of Luke as rather sterile, I do not.  I find it to be almost inspiring to see such a positive change in times of adversity.Leia (Fischer) also pulls of an incredible change in character over the course of the three movies which resembles traits to that of Luke... she becomes matured, and as a result of this maturity, becomes a more powerful presence.  Perhaps it is a genetic twin thing?  Or perhaps it is caused by Luke and Leia's mutual ties to \"the Force?\"But in any case, I adore the movies and they will remain at the top of my list with the exception of the most recent Star Wars attempt, \"The Phantom Menace.\"  To me, that movie just seemed nothing more than flashy visual and audio FX.  It lacked the unique plot and character design that the original trilogy mastered.  But, that's a whole 'nother story... literally.",

Anyway, Return of the Jedi is definitely up to par with the first two (not counting Ep. 1). Though it may lack in a FEW places, it still is as great of a movie to have the words Star Wars in the title. My favorite parts are all the ones with Emperor Palpatine, the whole beginning involving Jabba the Hutt, and the fight scene at the end. I don't know why everyone hates the ewoks. They are a great touch to the Star Wars series. Besides, you need some charm in the final chapter in the series, just like you need some charm in the first chapter in the series (hint, hint: don't hate Jar Jar). ROTJ has classic moments in it, just like the others. Take the sarlacc for example, or the rancor. Those scenes have just as much in it for a true classic moment that the space slug did, or the sand people. All in all, ROTJ is the best climax to a series I've ever seen, and I'm glad that it had to be from the phenomenal part of culture called Star Wars.",

            "content": "It is understandable, when compared to The Empire Strikes Back, why Return of the Jedi gets some stick. Where the first sequel moved the story in exciting new directions, the closing chapter seemed derivative of the original film. But even if Return of the Jedi didn't deliver in the same way as its predecessor, there is still plenty to love about it.-The rescue of Han Solo at the beginning of the film is an excellent re-introduction of Luke Skywalker, who it demonstrated has mastered his skills. He wields the force casually as he enters Jabba's Palace, and by the time he is chopping down henchmen on the Sail Barge the audience knows that Luke is now a humble and awesome Jedi. The way that he has implemented the whole plan in and of itself adds to the feeling that Luke has come a long way since he rushed into a bad situation of Cloud City.-The introduction of the second Death Star may not have the same impact due to the repetition, but with the incomplete portion the design of it is extra cool. The space station itself isn't what has the impact for the dark side though, that's down to meeting the Emperor in the flesh. From Admiral Motti's fearful, \"the Emperor's coming here?\", the audience know this guy is going to be unpleasant. When he does arrive, on such a huge scale, the movie really kicks into gear with a very real threat established for the Rebellion. -The Speeder Bike chase is still an exhilarating sequence, showcasing Luke and Leia in some great action. It shows that Lucas has always had a knack for knowing how to improve a slow sequence in the film with some action, as he demonstrated again twenty years later when he added the Droid Factory sequence to Attack of the Clones. The various ways that Luke and Leia dispatch the Scout Troopers are great fun. -The final battle in Return of the Jedi ticks all the boxes, and marks the first time that Lucas really got into inter cutting multiple battle sequences together. Aside from cuts back to the command room in A New Hope, the final battle is all based on the Alliance attacking the Death Star. By this film, Lucas was able to fulfill his ambitions and have the exciting thrills of a space battle interspersed with the dark, ominous temptation of Luke by the Emperor. Even though the Ewoks have their detractors, it's hard to argue that the forest battle is well plotted as the audience watches the little fellows go from struggling to know how to combat an AT-ST to blowing the thing to pieces. The emotions may not run as high in the film as they do in its predecessor, but it's so full of awesome characters and action sequences that it still works. As a cohesive whole, Return of the Jedi does not work as well as A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back, however the different elements in it are all so much fun and well executed that it is hard to have anything but affection for the final chapter in the classic trilogy.",

            "content": "I'm not one of those critics of ROTJ who hates the movie, but I do think it's quite obvious that when you watch the three movies together it's clear that the entire storyline that was established so wonderfully in Star Wars, is just coasting to a finish here instead of soaring to a powerful climax.I have always been convinced that what elevates \"Star Wars\" above either of the two sequels is the fact that it was the only one of the three films where Lucas seemed to be equally concerned about story development as he was about FX.  The trend toward FX over story starts to intrude in Empire, but in ROTJ it really sticks out like a sore thumb.  Lucas it seems spent more time concerned about showing a more elaborate cantina scene in Jabba's palace than he was about pacing a coherent and credible storyline.  Luke and Leia brother and sister?  Boy, does that make you go back and look at the original in a somewhat uncomfortable light.  This was something that required more explanation and a bit more depth.  And don't even make me comment on the Ewoks, the single most idiotic concept of the entire Trilogy. The manner in which they so easily beat a trained Imperial Army is enough to make you want to start rooting for the other side!The acting is also not up to snuff this time.  Ford is just coasting along, and Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor demonstrates how overly cartoonish the proceedings are getting.  All one has to do is compare McDiarmid's caricature performance with Peter Cushing's cool, restrained villainy as Moff Tarkin in Star Wars to realize what was missing this time out. *That's* what the Emperor should have been like.Of course, Carrie Fisher in that metal bikini is always enough to compensate for any of the film's shortcomings in the final analysis. :) Jedi in the end works, but it's not an improvement over it's origins.  It's just coasted in because of the past glories that preceded it.",

            "content": "When I was a child I loved Star Wars. They were basically my childhood in a nutshell. This one was always my favorite, but upon re-watching them I realized that this was the odd one out. The plot isn't great. It gets into it almost immediately, so it's basically just supposed to be a big battle. Which is fine, it doesn't feel particularly dragged out because of all the stuff that happens, but it just felt like there wasn't a whole lot of content in the movie. The characters are fine. They were developed in the previous movies, and this one is, like I said, just the big final battle for the most part, so we don't exactly get to know them that much better. We still get some new character development stuff, but not a whole lot changes between them. Which is fine, we've gotten to know them over the past few movies and now it's time to finish off the trilogy. Probably the biggest reason why this movie fails is the way in which it decides to end. It becomes a much more childish movie, and after The Empire Strikes Back's darker tone it really just feels like an awkward transition. The final battle is playful and fun, not serious. It's not meant to be, but it just doesn't follow it's predecessor's newly set tone at all. Overall Return of the Jedi is a good movie, but as an ending to the Star Wars trilogy not as great as it could have been. The tone is reset to make it feel like more of a kid's/older kid's movie, which turns out to be an awkward transition. Content-wise it feels like it lacks as well. In the end I would recommend Return of the Jedi, because if you've gotten this far then you might as well finish it. It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't feel right after The Empire Strikes Back.",

            "content": "This is the sixth and final part of my essay on the themes and motifs of Star Wars.The Star Wars saga ends with Return of the Jedi. While considered one of the weaker entries in the series overall, Episode VI has perhaps the best and most satisfying ending of the six.The motif of nature versus technology occurs most visibly in this episode. The difference is highlighted through colors and image patterns - the Imperial forces are regimented and uniform, wearing black and white, while the rebel strike force and their Ewok allies are associated with more naturalistic earth tones (even the rebel capital ships in the space battle above are rounder and more natural in appearance than the triangular Imperial Star Destroyers). Ultimately the Imperials are defeated, despite their superior power and technology, by the clever and resourceful Ewoks wielding only stones, arrows and log traps. This scene has often been ridiculed as implausible, but it could be seen as an expedited version of the Vietnam War, which in the end had a very similar result and would have been heavy on George Lucas' mind as he wrote it.Aside from this battle, the motifs developed throughout the series climax with the final showdown between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. The number two is an omnipresent force in this dynamic. There are two Sith, the only number of them that there can be. Palpatine wishes Luke to kill Vader and replace him, while Vader wishes his son to join him and overthrow Palpatine. Both know the other's motive and it speaks volumes about the treachery and rigid hierarchy of the Sith, that it can happen this way. Luke initially resists playing into this, but when Vader figures out that there are not one but two potential Jedi remaining (the other being Luke's sister Leia) Luke is angered and defeats Vader, severing his arm.This is as close as Luke comes to the Dark Side, for thereafter he refuses to fight. Enraged, Palpatine attempts to destroy the apprentice he cannot have. But Luke is saved by Vader, who is redeemed by the love of his son and completes his prophesied destiny of destroying the Sith (being Palpatine and himself). Luke removes Vader's mask, revealing a battered human being. Obi-Wan had described Vader as \"more machine now than man; twisted and evil,\" which may have indeed been the case. But there was some good in him, good that triumphed, if only in the very end, as Luke had believed it would.So ends the tragedy of Darth Vader. At the very end of the story, Anakin Skywalker appears to Luke as a ghost, along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. While there is some debate whether his ghost appeared as an old man or as a young one yet unsullied by the Dark Side, there is no denying the power of this ending or this story. As bad as things may often seem for our world, we as human beings always have the power to make things right, if we can find the will to do so.So ends my (over?)analysis of Star Wars. Thank you George Lucas for giving our world a great mythology to live by, one which we still need and without which there would be just a little less magic in our lives.",

Though many people consider this the weakest of the trilogy, its still a fine journey where we get to see our favorite characters one more time.\"Return of the Jedi\" starts off with R2-D2 and C-3PO back in Tatooine where they head for Jabba the Hutt's lair. It's a plan from Luke Skywalker as a diversion in order to get Han Solo out of the carbonate where he is kept in secrecy. The droids are slaves to Jabba while Leia and Lando have disguised themselves as Jabba's henchmen as they pretend to turn in Chewbacca where Leia rescues Solo, but has become a slave to Jabba after being setup (not by Lando). Now Luke, who is a Jedi Knight goes to Jabba's lair where he tries to negotiate with the slimy creature, but falls into a trap where Luke battles a giant creature; like \"Empire\" Luke defeats the monster where Jabba wants the Jedi, Chewy and Solo dead. Luke saves everybody and escapes Tatooine where they head back to rebel base.Before Luke goes back, he sees Yoda where the last great Jedi is ill and tells Luke that he cannot train him anymore as he must go off and defeat Darth Vader and the Emperor. He also tells him that Leia is his sister, where it's weird that she kissed him in \"Empire Strikes Back\" which I thought at the time, they might be a great couple.With a team of rebel scouts, Lando Calrissen has taken the air with Han's Millennium Falcon as a leader where they must destroy the new Death Star; but Luke, Han, Leia, Chewy and the droids along with rebel scouts must destroy the shields inside the generator where troopers await to attack. They get help from furry creatures called Ewoks, who look like teddy bears, but can kick some serious butt. At the same time, many people consider this a weak point since the creatures looked to cute unlike the creatures we had seen in the first two movies where they were deadly and menacing.Along the way, Luke talks to Leia where he wants to tell her the truth but can't. Luke than meets up with Darth Vader where he takes Luke to meet The Emperor who created the man in black; also wants his son to help him destroy the planets. As they meet the Emperor, he wants Luke and Vader to fight each other to the death where one would take the position of the Emperor.While in Endor, Han Solo has feelings for Leia, but assumes that she is after Luke; and at the same time, everybody is captured by the Imperial as they try to get rid of the shields. The Ewoks help the humans and droids defeat the troopers as they bring down the shield generators.In a fight to the finish, Luke defeats his father, but at the same time is being attacked by the Emperor as Vader kills the Emperor, where both the son and the father leave the Death Star before they get blown up. With the shields down, Lando and the rebel pilots destroy the death star once again as this time; there won't be anymore evil to defeat. Luke burns the remains of his father as everybody else is celebrating.I love the Star Wars Trilogy, but I thought that the ending was weak compared to the first two where they were uplifting in drama and action. But with great action sequences and seeing all of the characters together again, Return of the Jedi proves to be a great conclusion to one of the greatest epics of all time.",

The dynamic between Darth Vader and Luke is wonderful although the battle between the two could have been better (Empire offers a better duel and even for the times I think a better one could have been made). The emperor makes his appearance in this film and he's creepy and menacing at the same time (certainly more-so than he was in future films).My take will be a bit different as I saw these films when released so while watching them today is sill amazing, younger viewers will not have that context. Revelations made in this film concerning Luke/Leia/Vader were all new so like Empire, knowing them before seeing the film lowers the impact the film was trying to make. Still, the overall film is well done and give a satisfying conclusion to the first Star Wars Trilogy.While there are many great things about ROTJ, many things have still bothered me over the years. One was the technology was not where Lucas needed to do the film which brings us to the first problem, the Ewoks. While they are cute, it wasn't what Lucas intended but due to technology and cost, he was unable to use Wookies (we eventually saw them in Revenge of the Sith though). Even seeing this a child, the Ewoks seemed silly and I'm sure kids today may feel the same way. Another problem with the film is the addition of a 2nd death star rather than using a different threat all together. While it's not a exact replica of the first death star, it cheapens the film imo. Finally, we have the Han Solo situation which may be controversial. I personally felt that Han Solo being alive in this film cheapened his \"sacrifice\" in the Empire Strikes back. While I love the character, his presence in the film feels as if it wasn't needed which is what the actor felt at the time as well.With minor gripes out of the way, Return of the Jedi is my 2nd favorite of the saga and that is solely due to the dynamic between Luke and Darth Vader. While Star Wars (ep4) will always have a special place in my heart, ep 5 and 6 offer so much more in terms of spectacle and character development in my opinion.",

After the BBQ , our hero returns to the fleet to discover that the rebellion was dumber than he ever suspected.The rebellion has placed all its hopes on a massive coordinated attack on the empires new floating tangerine , but before its slices congeal. Han solo it has been decided will be the mastermind of the key assault owing to his deft ability to be frequently captured by the empire.However things take a bizarre turn as our heroes attempt to lower the shield that protects the giant round \" pardon our dust\" station above the forest moon of Endor. That' s right forest moon . Not moon. Not inhabited moon . There are a lot of trees there and don't you forget that.And teddy bears don't forget the teddy bears.

All the time refereed by an aging prune that bears a striking resemblance to grand neagus zek. The empire responds to the show of force in kind.Han and the teddy bear clan continue their plan to sabotage the shield generator. As usual and right on que Han is again captured by the empire. The space fighting continues above as the rebel fighters attempt to shoe a massive amount of tie fighters away from their fleet by bringing the fight to the fleet itself.After successfully stonewalling it opposition on the FOREST moon of endor , the shield falls. In side our hero has unhanded his mechanical father. He rejects the prunes offer of Rotting in evil solidarity whilst ruling the galaxy. The response is well shocking. Outside wedge and lando enter the death star interior in a sort frogger style light cycle race to the stations power core.Yes finally at last the emperor falls from his throne ( still waiting for that thud). Vader faces his son. All is forgiven. The death star explodes. The teddy bears break out the beer. Darth Vader is slow roasted to a fine finish. Everyone lives happily ever after.

Really impressive given Christensen pulled off the upset at all of age 3.Long drawn out and wholly predictable. I thought the droids were the worst. I was soooo wrong. Admiral Akbar. Really?!?

For the second time in a role, George Lucas returns as the film's screenwriter and producer, but turns the directorial duties over to another film-maker - this time Englishman Richard Marquand (who's most notable film up to that date had been 1978's lackluster THE LEGACY). While he lacks the thunderous cliffhanger charm and the somber literate quality that Lucas and Irvin Kershner respectively brought to the previous installments, Marquand proves to be quite proficient in the director's chair. Although the film doesn't re-imagine (or even revitalize) the genre the way the previous films did, it still proves to be a great space opera with plenty of highly memorable scenes and set pieces.The opening sequences of the film are exhilarating, with Leia's attempted rescue of Han and Luke's battle against an imposing rock-like monster both emerging as perfectly executed scenes of action and suspense. The film also contains the typically impressive array of special effects, including a taunt forest chase scene on airborne spacecrafts that expertly merges stop motion effects, miniature models, and green screen footage into one seamless sequence of adrenaline-pumping action. All of the regular cast members return (in one form or another), and all of the respective actors display an ever-increasing confidence in their characterizations (which is the third such go-around for most of them). The film's storyline also retains some of EMPIRE'S adult-oriented pathos, especially in the Emperor's repeated attempts to draw Luke towards the dark side.Unfortunately, the film also contains many portions that seem to be trying much too hard to play out to the children in the audience, especially the woefully-misplaced cuteness of the cuddly Ewoks and even in Darth Vader's overly sentimental last-minute \"change of heart\" (which, in addition to being too schmaltzy, stretches credibility far too much). I was also disappointed by the off-handed treatment given to the characters that were introduced with great importance in EMPIRE; Yoda and Boba Fett are quickly killed off with an almost casual indifference, and Lando Calrissian is sidelined early and nearly forgotten about until the end of the film. Worse still is the fact the climax of the film basically rehashes the climaxes of the previous films, and with less success. This is easily the biggest problem in the film (and could have easily been fixed with a little more creative writing), but the film recovers and ends with a pleasing coda that brings the trilogy to a satisfying close.Even with it's flaws, RETURN OF THE JEDI remains a great sci-fi adventure that will most surely be enjoyed by fans of the genre. Although I'm convinced that it could have been even better, it's shortcomings are only apparent when compared to the pristine quality of the previous two films and it is a terrific ride when taken on it's own terms. Try to avoid the 2004 though, which adds an obnoxious musical number to the opening sequence, inserts some poorly-done CGI in several other scenes, and unforgivably replaces Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christensen in the finale - a disastrous move that zaps nearly every ounce of poignancy out of the aforementioned coda sequence. I know that Lucas tampered with the other two films as well, but the most obtrusive changes occur here, so track down a copy of 1983 original if at all possible.",

            "content": "Of all the Star Wars films, this one was my favorite for the longest time. Critical viewers tend to admonish this film for showing an army of cutesy furry Ewoks turning the tide of the last battle. But I've always enjoyed this film for its subplot featuring Jabba the Hutt, the cool speeder-bike chase, its epic space battle over Endor (which comes very close to being my favorite space battle of all films, second maybe only to the battle of Coruscant in Episode III), and most importantly, for showing the final confrontation between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. All of the major conflicts are resolved in this film once and for all, and regardless of how unlikely it is for the Ewoks to overcome the Empire, I find the final fight between Luke and Vader to be very invoking, and the final space battle to be very awesome.The story is quite straightforward, offering just a little more insight on the characters and the previous films' loose ends, so as to answer any questions the audience may still have. It suffers just a little drag between the Jabba the Hutt scenes and the Endor scenes, but otherwise, the pacing is quite high. As it is with any major film trilogy, Return of the Jedi offers an excellent finale with excellent closure.The film is competently-made, with decent photography and editing. I still enjoy the actors' performances; Mark Hamill is probably at his most earnest here, while Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, and everybody else reprises their roles well. Writing is not bad. Production value features good sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is good.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)",

            "content": "RETURN OF THE JEDI was my favorite Star Wars film as a child. From an adult perspective, I find it a bit flawed and frustrating in some ways, but that should not take away from the many fantastic elements at work, and the very satisfying high that it ends on.The biggest issue is the light, sometimes throwaway silly tone that is present in parts of the film. There is a little of that in the Jabba's Palace sequence that makes up the front end of the story, but of course it is the Ewoks who are the prime expression. It is my understanding that early drafts of the story called for Wookies to be utilized instead of Ewoks. That would have made logical sense, given Chewbacca a great emotional anchor and made for fantastic storytelling. However, the more cuddly, teddy-bear-like Ewoks were created, and the sight of them taking on Imperial Stormtroopers, while frequently entertaining and humorous and a well-meaning metaphor, is just silly. It takes away from the dramatic tension that was built up in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.Beyond that, ROTJ also just feels kind of uneven overall, as though it is several separate films spliced together. But don't get me wrong, a lot of it is really great. Jabba's Palace is exotic and intriguing, the speeder bike chase through the forests of Endor is classic, and it is nice to see more of how the Rebel Alliance is made up of so many alien races, all pulling together for the common ideal of freedom.There are at least two things about ROTJ that are absolutely fantastic. One is the space battle around the second Death Star in orbit over Endor. As a special effects sequence, this is still mind-blowing 30 years later. There will almost certainly never be another model-based orchestration like this. I shudder to imagine how much work went into creating the dizzying ballet of starfighters and warships spinning through the void of space in a hailstorm of laser bolts. Incredible.The other incredible part is Luke Skywalker's final, climactic confrontation with Darth Vader and the Emperor. As others have noted, it's not as much an action sequence as the Luke-Vader duel in TESB, but rather a psychological crucible. John William's haunting musical score is perfect for the dark, emotionally apocalyptic setting. It is a very powerful character-development setpiece for Luke.Regarding the \"changes\" made by George Lucas for the 1997 Special Edition and the 2004 Special-er Edition, I find them almost universally horrible. The new Jabba's Palace dance sequence is painful to watch, not to mention hideously cheap looking CGI. I will always take costumes, makeup and animatronics over CGI in these sorts of instances. And of course, the ending where Hayden Christensen replaces Sebastian Shaw as Anakin Skywalker (while Alec Guiness is *not* replaced by Ewan McGregor) is just plain puzzling. What was George Lucas thinking?Overall, RETURN OF THE JEDI - the ORIGINAL 1983 THEATRICAL VERSION - is a wonderfully entertaining conclusion to the original STAR WARS trilogy. It's a great film for kids, and while my adult self really wishes that the story had been written more seriously, it is nevertheless a captivating creation and very enjoyable.",

            "content": "Star Wars episode VI is just the icing on the cake, the Empire Strikes Back is a classic and George Lucas just adds to an already wonderful story, by giving us a happy ending that we did not expect. Here is where you get to enjoy the power of the force (i.e. when you are comparing this movie to its original two counter parts; A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back) as Luke Skywalker demonstrates true mastery of it, as he had become a Jedi Knight between the events of Empire Strikes Back and now and later after the death of Yoda he became the only Jedi Knight left in the entire cosmos. Episode VI's ending is one of the things that has made the Star Wars franchise a must watch and a must have.The final battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader was something we all looked forward to, with Luke now a Jedi Knight, that battle was fun as now he and Darth Vader (his father) were evenly matched. The twist ending in the movie's story arc is just something you will come to respect the writers for, as they lead you on a good versus evil mind battle.The CGI in this movie was one that took me much by surprise it was impressive, it looked so well ahead of its time, with the acting portrayal of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) was the best in the series so far this is my favorite imprint of him in my mind, \"Luke Skywalker Son of Anakin Skywalker and the last Jedi Knight.\" After the events of the Empire Strike Back which led to the capture of Han Solo (Harrison Ford), after he was frozen in a block of carbonite; Luke and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with the help of others formulate a plan to free Solo from the hands of the crime lord Jabba.After his freedom and escape from Jabba and his minions, the trio decided to take the fight to the Empire, as plans were in place to build another Death Star. This battle was the going to be the final battle between the resistant forces and the empires, with both having an ace up their sleeves.This battle is parallel though to the Sith Lord's intension to convert Luke over to the Dark Side, as he and Darth Vader waited patiently for him to come so that he too like his father in the Revenge of the Sith will face the test of joining the Dark Side.Return of the Jedi is the last in the first sequel and the last in the chronology, Episode VI is just a part of a must have when you go buying the Star Wars box set, which I believe every movie lover already have.The movie was actually meant to be titled the Revenge of the Jedi, but the name got changed later on. Talks are ongoing that Disney is set to release a new Star Wars, Episode VII (probably in 2015) and if possible a new trilogy, here is something I so look forward to.www.lagsreviews.com",

            "content": "Star Wars: Episode VI-The Return of the Jedi is a fitting ending to the original series of films, it keeps what we like from the first two but also adds in new things along the way. I did feel this isn't anywhere near the par that IV and V reach but still remains an important film in Star Wars and is also, not bad. The film is one I don't expect people to say is there favourite but I also wouldn't criticise someone if they did love this. I felt it to be firmly a sound movie and here below is why so.The story is not that fast but still gets a lot in for it's running time, the introduction of a lot of new features, characters and locations mean this is never a movie where your seeing double of the previous movies. It has good action and although maybe lacks the space fights etc we so often see spread out in other series films, it still manages to give you the right amount of thrills throughout. One more thing is that the story ties everything round nicely and it's fair to say this is one of the better film franchise endings.The cast remain strong and the main characters we like so much are also back with even more diverse roles and personality. I did feel the chemistry can sometimes seem strained maybe but by the end this is one of the only Star Wars originals where Harrison Ford doesn't out show everyone else. As for new characters well there not so much actual people so it can't be said it is acted well in that way but all credit to all the extras involved who play a vast amount of alien races.Richard Marquand comes in to direct on this one and although not ruining the already legendary series, he can't be said to contribute much and I have to feel slightly sorry for him to make a good film, just eclipsed by two amazing films before. Kasdan and Lucas do well with the script and the screenplay is pretty nice here but I did feel the actual playing out of the story is not that well pieced together. I felt this is better choreographed than previous, better duels, gun battles etc make this more fast paced in the action area and one of the better things about this movie.My main critical points are mostly about the film just never being THAT good but yet again I'm comparing it to it's previous two films. It just isn't as richly emotional yet also not as funny as the others, fun yes but lacks the smiles we need from the main cast. I also wasn't too keen on the ending, is it rushed well maybe but in any case it still delivers nicely, just not as nice as I think the proposed ending should be.I think die hard Star Wars fans will like this but I am not sure if they will love it, for the amount of criticism which was levied against Star Wars in the future prequels, this film is never seen as any less to New Hope and Empire when in reality it never reaches the others heights. For anyone not a fan of the series this is still fun and you should enjoy it as it is a fitting ending and really brings the story full circle in a way which is soundly done.Overall I felt it to be Firmly a Good film, not quite being near to very good. Yes with more Star Wars after this film we can safely say this is not the ending anymore but still serves an a finish to a classic three films in the 70's and 80's which to be fair, even if this movie isn't an instant classic, it is still part of an almost flawless original series of films.",

            "content": "In the year 1983, a full six years after the release of the first Star Wars, we reached the end of the beginning. Return of the Jedi was, at the time, the third and final Star Wars movie, but as all fans and non-fans are aware, it's not the third movie in the series any more, and shortly, it won't be the final chapter either. Oh how I pray that the folk at Disney don't mess it up.\nIan McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine and David Prowse as the body of Vader.I recall watching this one a lot as a kid, more so than I watched The Empire Strikes Back, and I'd wager it's because Return of the Jedi, let's face it, is largely the most childish and least edgy of the original movies. Today I of course think it's a no-brainer to prefer Empire and view Jedi as bit of a step down from its predecessors, but what can I say? There are people who like slapstick and Ewoks too.So in this movie, The Galactic Empire is rebuilding their awesome planet-annihilator known as The Death Star - because it worked so well in the first movie - and the man in charge is still Darth Vader (James Earle Jones and David Prowse), who needs no introduction. However, our heroes from the last movie, a.k.a. the rebels, have other matters to attend to.Their smuggler friend Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is kept in the palace of a Tatooine-based slug of a gangster called Jabba The Hutt (Larry Ward), so for the first third or so of the movie we see what's basically a lengthy rescue mission and I'm sure we all remember the beats. Jedi-in-training Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) sends his robot pals C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) to spy on Jabba, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) tries to break Solo out of the carbonite slab he's sealed in but gets herself put in one of Jabba's sexy slave outfits instead, Lando Calrissian (Billie Dee Williams) poses as a guard the whole time, and the admirably fuzzy Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) sorta just shows up and gets captured. It goes on for longer than needed, yet is heaps of fun to watch.Next, Luke splits up from the rest of the group to talk to his dying Jedi trainer, the incredibly old puppet Yoda (Frank Oz), and the ghost of his old mentor Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi (Alec Guinness), all to confirm whether Darth Vader truly is his long-lost father Anakin Skywalker. You all know the right answer. After being told the truth, as well as warned that Vader is only a pawn to the true evil that Luke must soon face, Emperor Palpatine (the great Ian McDiarmid), he returns to the other rebels, at which point the main gang minus Lando, who leads the attack fleet, all travel to the forest moon Endor to take down a shield generator that protects the new Death Star. It is here that we meet the Ewoks, an army of teddy bear warriors led by Warwick Davis who counter Imperial Stormtroopers with pointy sticks and mistake C-3PO for some sort of golden God. The rest is history (and no, I won't be reviewing the Ewoks spin-off films).\nSo basically, when Return of the Jedi isn't about Luke's psychological conflict and his fears of joining his blood on the Dark Side of The Force, it gives us teddy bears fighting off bad guys with spears and a character from the much darker Empire Strikes Back, in this case the vicious bounty hunter Boba Fett, getting killed off by flying his jet pack into a wall, bumping his head, and falling into a hungry anus that lives in the desert. The anus burps when it's finished eating Boba, in case you're still in doubt of where this movie stands on the dignity scale compared to Empire. \"The anus burps\", guys.\nThe enormous Jabba, alongside his servants, his new slave, and a prissy droid.One can easily interpret this movie as foreshadowing to the childishness and silliness that was to come when George Lucas brought Star Wars back in 1999, but thankfully, this movie never gets that bad. It still has the things that have made these films the unsurpassable classics that they are. It still has character development, it still has emotion (the final duel between Luke and Vader gets me to this day), it still has special effects that are more impressive and authentic-looking than anything most modern computers could render, and it still has that immersive tone that will always make us feel like we're there whenever we see these movie again - right there, in the futuristic yet magical world of Star Wars. It has the John Williams music too, but that's one of the few good things that were carried into the prequels.But of course, as good as the original movie is, Lucas had to come along and make alterations to the subsequent home releases. I'm not gonna lie, I like changes such as the inclusion of alternate takes and the extended celebration scene at the end, which in later versions has more triumphant music and shows how other planets in the galaxy react to the fall of the Empire, which is somewhat charming if you can forgive the voice cameo from Jar-Jar Binks in the DVD version. Sigh.Stuff like that is certainly better than having new, CGI aliens sing rap songs straight into the camera at Jabba's palace, editing in the prequel version of Anakin at the end (Hayden Christensen), or that one infamous part in the Blu-ray version where they evidently thought that the pitch perfect complement to an originally subtle scene - in which Palpatine is torturing Luke while Darth Vader, who has a change of heart at the last minute, suddenly turns on his master and saves Luke - would be Vader bleeting out an over-the-top \"NOOO\". In case any hardcore Star Wars fan out there really felt that a fault of the original trilogy was \"too much subtlety\" or just thought Vader's \"NOO\" from Revenge of the Sith wasn't silly or out-of-place enough, you got it. Thanks for everything, Lucas. Leave Disney alone forever.All the same, I honestly don't know what else to say about this trilogy. I have gone through pretty much all of my favourite memories and, presumably, rehashed the criticisms most people have already made before me. I guess I can simply encourage future parents to expose their children to Star Wars, and allow them to grow up with nostalgic memories of the same awesome world the rest of us got to visit. That world in a galaxy far, far away (yet somehow still close enough for Earth-made cigarettes to be distributed there).Also, fun fact: the Ewoks of Endor were originally going to be Wookies, like Chewbacca, and the film was at a time supposed to take place on their planet. I'm pretty sure this idea was scrapped when everyone saw how well the Star Wars Holiday Special turned out. Good call.",

It continues the wonderful adventure of all the great characters, and at least the beginning is as wham-bam as the two other movies. But \"Return of the Jedi\" has something special that rises over the prequels and makes it feel very different - it's not as dark as episode V, but the characters have evolved since the first and second movie: they are more experienced, they are more committed and more determined to win the battle. So determined that even Darth Vader can be turned to the good side.Marvelous, and a great ending (?) to the greatest film saga ever.",

            "content": "It's not easy calling Return of the Jedi your favourite Star Wars film. Were as when someone says The Empire Strikes Back is their favourite they get cheers from the crowd. Call Return of the Jedi your favourite you get boos and hisses followed by a rigorous defense of your opinion. Well, it could be worse; those who call the prequels their favourite usually get stoned or hanged by a lynch mob.I find Return of the Jedi to be the film in the series which satisfies me the most in this swashbuckling space adventure. I like how it combines elements from both A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back from Hope's light-hearted nature and the nostalgic return to Tatooine, to Empire's darker nature with Luke confronting Vader and the Emperor. But when I think Return of the Jedi I think redwood forests. The forest moon of Endor is such a splendour to look at, and once again proves that Planet Earth is the greatest movie set of all.Let's talk about everyone's favourite addition to the Star Wars universe, shall we? I am indeed speaking of the Ewoks. The dismissive statements towards these creatures that the empire was brought down by a bunch of teddy bears I find to be very close-minded. I completely agree with George Lucas that they showcase how it is possible for a primitive race to bring down a technologically advanced superpower such as the empire is inspired by the Viet Cong's offense against the Americans during the Vietnam War. I like this message as it's true that the most advanced technology isn't always the best means; sometimes less is more. I know many say the idea of Ewoks helping bring down the Empire was highly improbable. Well, my answer to that is remember Yoda's lesson in The Empire Strikes Back, \"Judge me by my size do you?\". The cute nature of the Ewoks (along with their whimsy yet epic theme music) provides a counterbalance to the darker scenes in Return of the Jedi. Yet the Ewok's themselves are not without their own darker side. At one point in the film, they have no remorse when they intend to burn out heroes alive and notice how they use the helmets of dead stormtroopers as musical instruments.Likewise, Return of the Jedi has too many puppets? I'm used to hearing people complain about movies which use too much CGI but a movie using too many practical effects - that's a new one. The creature department and their astounding levels of creativity employed for Return of the Jedi hit it out of the park with creations such as the odd-looking yet enamoring fish create that is Admiral Ackbar. It's just a shame people look at this cynically and say they were just trying to sell toys.Return of the Jedi does not disappoint in its reveal of Jabba the Hut. The space gangster whose name is mentioned in the previous two movies with no indication as to whether or not he was a human, an alien or something different altogether (at least in the original theatrical versions). In a masterwork of puppetry, Jabba is a wonderfully, horrendous creature design; an extreme, gluttonous version of Sydney Greenstreet. Return of the Jedi also contains the iconic bikini Leia. More than just a sex symbol (insert Tex Avery wolf here), it also gives way to the powerful image of Leia strangler Jabba, her enslaver with the very chains attached to her body.My favourite action scene in any movie ever is a toss between the final car chase in The Blues Brothers and the escape from Jabba in Return of the Jedi (with the later speeder bike chase not being far behind). Talk about a \"How are they going to get out of that?\" moment; in which they do in a convincing, heart racing like crazy manner. I love how the escape is one big elaborate plan which all our heroes are in on, not to mention the introduction of Luke's green lightsaber in a shot that couldn't look more majestic. Also, I never understood people's love affair with Boba Fett, so his death didn't bother me. To the contrary I find his death to be interesting in how unconventional it is; this tough badass who doesn't go out with a bang, but rather dies in a humiliating fashion. I was more concerned with Lando being on the cusp of death!The second half of Return of the Jedi is one of the most intense, involving and grand cinematic experiences. Cutting between the assault on the imperial cruisers and the second death star, the assault on Endor and the powerful emotions when Luke is confronting Vader and the senile, scenery chewer that is Emperor Palpatine; it perplexes me that people can put down this movie so much. Having a second Death Star sounds like a lazy idea on paper but I fell they get away with it due to the immaculate execution. I love the incomplete appearance of Death Star II and the film's final battle involves ships navigating through the tunnels and into the center of the battle station makes for a dogfight even more exciting than that from A New Hope. Likewise, while it's near impossible to go into these movies for the first time fresh unless you've spent your whole life under a rock, but I didn't have previous knowledge that Luke and Leia are brother and sister; which is one surprise the original Star Wars trilogy had for me.Science fiction cinema had never seen a finer moment between the final confrontation between Luke, Vader and the Emperor. The optimism of Luke Skywalker to find the good in someone as evil as Darth Vader and bring him away from the dark side is inspiring in this powerful arch of redemption as Vader returns to the light side just at the very end of his life; a life he sacrificed in order to save Luke's. The unmasking of Vader is enough to make grown men cry, and seeing the ghost of Anakin Skywalker played Sebastian Shaw (sorry Hayden Christensen) appear to next to the ghosts of Obi-wan and Yoda is awe inspiring. Revenge of the Sith, a Shakespearean tragedy? Pfft, please. This is proper storytelling tragedy. I couldn't ask for a better finale to a better trilogy. Ah, Return of the Jedi, I know people give you flak but to me, you're perfect the way you are - Ewoks and all.",

A three-way battle (space, forest and lightsabers) closes the narrative of the most famous saga in cinema history.This last installment in the original trilogy was always considered the weakest. To many viewers, it felt like two separate films (the Jabba episode and the Endor episode) and though the younger audience appreciated them, the cuddly Ewoks never scored highly with adult fans. In hindsight, Return of the Jedi's sins are quite meager (they only reflect the flaws inherent to the entire saga) while its merits in as a piece of entertainment are considerable. The sleazy crime-lord's den is a triumph of unease and production design (with, at the heart of it, the revolting Jabba), the space battle is unsurpassed in the entire saga (thus ranking as the best ever shot), the speeder-bike takes your breath away, the forest battle-cum Vietnam metaphor is hugely playful and inventive (almost a tribute to Errol Flynn's Robin Hood) and the climactic lightsaber duel packs an emotional punch that rivals anything in the original trilogy.What disappointed many were the less mature elements that quite rudely belied the fact that Star Wars was for the child in you. One can debate whether that even constitutes a flaw, but this is entertainment for all ages that pushes boundaries and goes unsurpassed, 3 decades on. That the new trilogy never stood a chance only serves as further proof to how demanding an audience that ad kept receiving better and better Star Wars films had become. Truth be told, Return of the Jedi, if it trounces all other prequels, fails to measure up to the truly operatic Revenge of the Sith. This is simply because of story density and the fact that George Lucas's visual flair makes a mockery of Richard Marquand's (one could also add that John Williams fantastic score for episode III is the best in the entire saga).Star Wars, the real epic quality Star Wars that begins with episode III, ends here. And a more fitting finale to this saga could not have reasonably been hoped for.",

George is, after all, George -- and George does not like other people messing with his universe.If I have a complaint about RETURN OF THE JEDI it is with Ewoks. I will not get into the things that bug me about those darned little teddy-bears, because most people that watch the film will see the problems for themselves. One can complain, I suppose, but STAR WARS is George Lucas' playground, and that is what he wanted to use. His call.Does this film do an effective job of ending the saga? For the most part, yes. There is a bit of a feeling of \"well, now what?\" that you get as the final scenes are putting themselves up on screen; and for those that have read the Extended Universe novels, there are some pretty darned good ideas for what could (should?) happen next.

It is not to long afterward that Luke comes in and uses his mind tricks on Bib Fortuna( Michael Carter). When Luke tries to bargain with Jabba, he drops Luke into the Rancor pit, there Luke kills the Rancor, and Jabba is outraged. Due to Luke's success He, Han, Chewbacca are scheduled for termination.

            "content": "Coming out three years after the dramatic high that was \"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Return of the Jedi\" had a lot to live up to.  Satisfactorily sorting out the various plot lines left dangling, as well as delivering a rousing conclusion to the series, was a tough test for the series' creators.  In spite of a much weaker script and some less than enthusiastic acting in some quarters, \"Return of the Jedi\" comes out on top featuring its fair share of enjoyable scenes, both fun and dark.It's been six months since Han Solo (Harrison Ford) was frozen in carbonite and shipped off to the palace of Jabba the Hutt, an alien gangster he double-crossed.  The film begins on the desert planet of Tatooine, where Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) hatches a plan to rescue his friend.  Later, the rebels head to Ewok-inhabited Endor to destroy the Empire's new Death Star, where Luke must confront his father Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) while resisting the manipulative temptations of the dreaded Emperor (Ian MacDiarmid)...The script and acting in this one is visibly below par.  Many of the principals are lacking the passion and enthusiasm they displayed before. Carrie Fisher, as Princess Leia, and Harrison Ford are especially disappointing, as is Billy Dee Williams as Lando, his ambiguous character from \"Empire\" now just another do-gooding rebel.  To be fair to them, they are hampered by a script that does not develop their characters and instead gives them alot of banal stilted dialogue.  This combination, however, cripples a number of important scenes (Luke's talk with Leia about his mother).Only Mark Hamill as Luke really gives it a fair go.  He may not be as convincing as a controlled, self-possessed Jedi Knight than he was as a naive young rebel, but he's still on form.  David Prowse and James Earl Jones again create the role of Darth Vader, and oversee well the character's conversion from dark villain to redeemed saviour.  Ian MacDiarmid makes a suitably creepy Emperor, although it is hard to reconcile his almost alien visage here with his more human appearance in the recent prequel films.\nThere are some great action scenes here but the biggest standout, dramatically, is the Death Star lightsaber duel between Vader and Luke, as the latter very nearly succumbs to his psychotic dark side.  The battle on the forest planet of Endor, with the rebels and the teddy bear-like Ewoks, is also good but in a more lighthearted manner.  All actions scenes benefit from excellent special effects and some superb editing.Of the 1997 re-releases, this was the most significantly revised of the three films.  Creator George Lucas added a musical number to the scene in Jabba's palace, and reworked the ending, showing the inhabits of various planets (Tattooine, Bespin and Coruscant) celebrating the demise of the Empire.  The Ewok's celebratory song was also rewritten.  The film benefits greatly from the alterations.In spite of some inherent flaws with script and acting, this is still a worthwhile motion picture and sends the series out on a high.",

As Luke fights desperately to save his friend, the Empire under Lord Darth Vader (voice of James Eral Jones, body David Prowse) and Emperor Palpantine (Ian McDiarmid) are building a super-powerful Death Star to conquer the galaxy. After rescuing Han, Luke and his companions are sent on a mission to destroy the imperial base on the massive moon of Endor which would help lead to victory over the Empire. Instead of following into a circle of good and evil, ROTJ allows itself to develop characters including: Luke, Darth Vader, and Leia. Above all character developments is the struggle between good and evil for Darth Vader, who is stuck between helping his son or destroying him. The special effects are incredible and out do such special effects 'wonders' as Dungeons and Dragons (2000)and Troy (2004). The lightsaber duels are well choreographed and filmed. George Lucas is able to represent the dark side overtaking Luke in his climatic duel with Vader in the Death Star.ROTJ does not disappoint on any level. I, however, do not think that it was as good as A New Hope which was just incredible and fresh when it came out. The magic is not lost as most people thought. The Ewoks were considered annoying little fury guys but I thought they were neat they way they lived in tribes and weren't adapted to the advance galaxy around them. ROTJ will take you on a journey like no other filled with action, love, and drama like none of the other films.

Of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi definitely has the most noticeable problems, but it does end the series in a suitably ambitious and entertaining fashion. In Return of the Jedi, the Galactic Empire is building a second Death Star to finally destroy the Rebel Alliance, and Emperor Palpatine is personally overseeing the project. The Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack onto the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill Palpatine. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker attempts to bring Darth Vader out of the Dark Side of the Force. The action scenes in Episode VI are a bit more inconsistent than in the other movies, but I have to mention the speeder bike chase scenes. It's without a doubt my favorite scene in the series so far because it's so fast-paced, well shot and intense. It was definitely the highlight of the movie. One of the weaker action scenes was a bizarre set piece with the Ewoks. The entire scene was just awkward; I find it hard to believe that a primitive race of small hairy creatures armed with sticks could defeat the Imperial stormtroopers. Return of the Jedi also didn't improve on the cheesy father-son plot from The Empire Strikes Back. Watching Luke pitifully try to convince Darth Vader to step away from the Dark Side was groan-inducing. Nevertheless, the strengths of the Star Wars series are still on full display here. The utter imagination and detail put into the universe is incredible, and the film is just as exciting as its predecessors. Return of the Jedi isn't as competent as the previous films, but it is a satisfying and sporadically rousing conclusion.",

            "content": "Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) where we go full circle with the story of Luke Skywalker facing his destiny as a Jedi Knight and confronting Darth Vader, his father Anakin Skywalker.The beginning of the movie we find R2-D2 and C3PO walking through the desert on the planet Tatooine and soon find themselves literally knocking on Jabba the Hut's door. Soon all the heroes are in the gangster's lair in an attempt to save Han Solo who was frozen in Empire. The rescue mission doesn't look too good, that is until Luke pops up and uses some of his badass Jedi skills, including the force choke scenes. Soon our heroes wrap up the events of the previous film and make their daring escape from Jabba the Hutt.I had a major issue with this part of the film why introduce a character like Boba Fett and then kill him off in such an easy manner? He wasn't utilized in a baddass way, so we have no idea what the bounty hunter is capable of. Another issue was the plan itself - how did Luke get inside?? They could have shown his Jedi powers lifting the doors with the force. Having said that the battle at the sandpit was kickass with Luke almost singlehandedly smashing all of Jabba's cronies, proving his prowess as a Jedi is now almost complete. We even get to see Leia strangle Jabba to death with the chain around her neck - so thug style.Now as a moviegoer I like continuity soooo what happened with Lando and Chewie - didn't they go in to try and find or rescue Han at the conclusion of the previous film? Was it the plan to get captured? Was Luke's plan to get captured? Since when can Luke do Jedi mind tricks? Did Luke go back and train with Yoda for a year?When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit the ageing Yoda one more time, the audience is given origin confirmation to ease the minds of Star Wars geeks. Why? This was done and dusted in Empire. Yoda's screen time could have been used more efficiently which may have been in relation to the Emperor, to the Dark Side, advising Luke more about his cave scene. This part of the movie felt it had to provide answers of Luke's origin which could have been done with the cameo appearance of Obi-Wan-Kenobi. What would have been even better to see one more training sequence between Yoda and Luke.The romance between Leia and Solo feels is underdeveloped where Solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films. Han was one of the central figures to the plot of the previous two films whereas here he is struggling for screen time, trading one liners with the droids. Instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame story where Han is convinced Leia loves Luke. Like comonnnn, as if the conclusion of the previous film along with him literally getting saved by Leia doesn't mean anything?? The whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that Solo was not part of this film's central story after his rescue. If there was more story about his character and dynamic character relationship with Leia - could've been a hit. Also for you moviegoers, the Han pose when the Rebels along with the Ewoks take over the Empire Base - watch out for the Solo shrug \ud83d\ude09The film really is Luke's film, perhaps even more so than the original as his story carries the movie as he moves closer to his final confrontation with Darth Vader. The other Rebel characters certainly work in his shadow. The reveal to Leia about her origins felt underused by the filmmakers. This could have been arranged in a more dynamic way where Leia slowly understands the use of the Force and that she indeed could be the final hope for the Rebels.In this film, Luke Skywalker is a changed man since leaving Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi as he is swathed all in black and accepting to face his destiny. We can tell that Luke's discovery of his origins have left him torn, however we do see a different man, an enlightened warrior unlike the impatient student in the previous film. While he might aim to always assist his Rebel friends, he yearns for another chance to confront the evil Darth Vader again.Ewoks, the creatures on the forest moon of Endor - I really liked their part of the Rebel...no....the Ewok assault. Didn't mind the scene with the Ewok's believing C3PO was some kind of divine deity. The Ewok Assault in itself was interesting with the Imperial Troop's advanced weaponry verses the Ewoks' simple, natural weapons - this provides a nice contrast. My only complaint would be the scenes for these furry creatures was a tad too long.Another downplay is the use of Lando - a charismatic character in Empire, yet we only see a few heroic glimpses in this movie. The character felt very underused and didn't resemble the charming guy we saw in the previous film. Lando could have been given better lines rather than the recycled ones we saw in Empire and what happened to his aid Lobot from Cloud City?? Comonnnn guys like use your characters better!!Now the Emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, where he feeds off the anger of Luke and his devotion to his father. This ultimately brings the final climactic duel before the evil Emperor. I love when Vader pulls Luke to the fight by bringing up the possibility on turning Leia to the Dark Side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle., where Vader succumbs to defeat at the mercy of his son's blade. Ian McDiarmid does an excellent job as the Emperor as he goes back and forth with his replies to Luke and his evil laugh. And using Force lightning - epicccc.Overall, the screenplay is quite messy and doesn't flow on from the rest of the saga. It feels like a Saturday cartoon where each hero has their side story but in reality, the story belongs to Luke. The film is not nearly as good as the first two and is a slightly disappointing conclusion to a series that was doing so well. The story and not fully developing the other main characters are the major factor in its downfall - 7.2/10.",

            "content": "I think most Star Wars fans agree that \"Return Of The Jedi\" could have been a better film. I think the marketing forces involved here had to broaden up the appeal of the film...to kids! Lucas tends to forget that, those of us who were 10 or 12 years old when we first saw the original Star Wars, were 16-18 years old by the time of Jedi. And I'm talking about the die hard fans; those of us that only like Star Wars films more as time passes by. For those fans, we would have liked a bit more depth of characters, a better dialoge. In this movie, Harrison Ford's part felt sort of cut down as was Carrie Fisher's. The Ewoks were ok, but many fans felt they were both: comic relief and a marketing ploy for future toys. Although I've read many comments complaining how Luke's character was never explored fully emotionally, many people tend to forget that Darth Vader also went through some second thoughts of his own, and those feelings could have been explored a bit more towards the end. The final confrontation was good and the complaints I have are mostly with the changing of actors. This would have been David Prowse' shining hour (He played the physical Vader; His voice was James Earl Jones'). Why this happened will always be open to debate. The effects, as always, pushed up the ante and laid the groundwork for contemporary effects. That said, \"Return\" is no let down by any means and should be viewed as a decent ending to a fabulous saga.",

            "review_title": "Most beautifully moving moments of the saga cumulate to make ROTJ still the best SW film to date",
            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD: - if you have not seen this one yet, best to wait until after you've seen the film.This review is mostly intended to offer some fresh commentary for those who have already seen the film. Regardless of whether you've seen it 0 or 50 times, I hope this review can add to your appreciation of the film.\n--------------------\nThe most beautiful moments of the saga are to be found in Return of the Jedi. The power of these good moments more than make up for the film's flaws.Return of the Jedi is a film that has really benefits powerfully from all the back story of the prequels. Despite all the happy and silly moments of the lovable characters throughout the previous films, the Star Wars saga is set against a pretty dark backdrop. In every film there is always this threat of impending darkness and a society and culture that is falling apart. Or we are in the depths of a very dark evil tyranny, where it is a thought crime to suggest that what the Republic has slowly morphed into has become very wrong.In ROTJ however, we finally come out of that darkness and we know the good guys will win. There is a celebratory vibe to the whole film, somewhat of a homage to everything that came before it. We know that everything is about to get resolved, we're going to come out of that darkness.We firstly have what for me is the best moment of the Original Trilogy, at least, for sheer exhilaration: - We find out that Artoo is holding on to Luke's brand new lightsaber (we were thinking does \"Luke even have a lightsaber anymore? Didn't he lose it in the previous film\"), which Artoo fires high into the sky, for Luke to use The Force to pluck from the air. Yes, Luke now has own lightsaber which he was powerful enough to construct himself. It is green, not blue; Luke is his own man now, not in the shadow of his father. Luke instantly activates it and goes on to make easy work of about a dozen different enemies. After years and years of darkness, the Jedi have returned! And like Qui-Gon, Ob-Wan, and Anakin before Luke, the bad guys are powerless to do anything against a Jedi.What follows soon after for me is the most powerful and beautiful moment in the whole saga, thanks to John Williams and one of his very best pieces \"The Death Of Yoda\". Luke returns to be with his mentor, wanting to continue to grow as a Jedi. But it seems it might be too late, for Yoda's time has come. Luke is there for his great friend and mentor when Yoda passes away.At the moment of Yoda's passing, the strings of Williams' score swell in such a beautifully harrowing way, as if to hold back tears.As those strings swell, all of these happy and powerful moments of the past 5 movies flash through our minds. Yoda has been with us through it all, all those happy moments and happy times with the characters throughout the saga. The last of all that goodness and joy passes away with him. Luke is left alone, the last hope of what represents that good of the past, and he is left with a difficult task indeed. Those moments where it is just Luke and Artoo alone (before Obi-Wan appears) are so beautiful.On recent viewings these days, that moment when Yoda dies, I always choke up and shed a few tears.Later on we have that quiet private moment between Luke and Leia. Once again this scene is stolen by John Williams' beautiful score \"Luke and Leia\". During this scene, all the puzzle pieces of what has conspired over the past few decades are falling into place for Leia and Luke. This maniacal tyrannt Palpatine has been relentlessly tormenting the Skywalker family for decades, singling them out to subject them to such terrible evil. What have they done to deserve that?Yet another powerful harrowing moment is the finale, where Palpatine has decided he will kill Anakin's son in the most horrific way possible. Hamil's acting range is on display here, as he plys his trade to portray the extreme agony that Luke is in. Iit is difficult for us to watch.Meanwhile Anakin watches on as his son is being tortured to an extremely painful death - still relentlessly loyal after all this time to his friend Palpatine.Loyalty to this madman only led to the death of Anakkin's beloved wife. Now is Anakin just going to stand by while Palpatine murders his child?Then, something happens that the Emperor never predicted.One more lovely moment. At the end of the film, even though the future may be unknown, we are reminded that Luke is not alone as he moves forward into this new future. His mentors, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and now Luke's own father, will always there to guide him. Despite everything's that's going on, Luke's personal growth will always be what is most important for him.--------------For me this is really Hamil's film, with his wonderful portrayal of the boy who has now become a man. Luke is an introvert, intuitive, highly emotionally intelligent, deeply introspective and self-aware, deeply considerate of his friends, and ruthless towards his enemies. When the gang all head off to hang out with the Rebels, Luke goes off by himself, to work on himself as a man with Yoda and Obi-Wan. Luke really has his head screwed on straight. I am hard pressed to think of another hero on film who embodies this archetype so well as Luke and Hamil do in ROTJ.One area where the film is flawed of course is that the final battle between Luke, Vader and the Emperor is pretty rushed, considering so much time and effort throughout the saga went into it's context. Luke's training started late and his training was kind of rushed through. He's probably the one chance Obi-Wan and Yoda have got. Yet Luke is now expected to be powerful enough to defeat both his own father and Palpatine, all alone. More time could have been given to this battle given its weight - and less time to the Ewoks.Thank you very much for taking the time to read.",

            "content": "Personally, I feel that there is not much difference from the previous two. The music and sound effects are good, the plot is simple, and the relationship between the characters is not complicated. The one that impressed me most was the caged beasts on Tatooine and the big mouth of the execution ground. His first appearance was quite shocking. There is also the indigenous people on Endo Star, the panda's body shape, brown fur, so cute. Indigenous traps and jungle terrain also made the imperial soldiers lose more reasonable. And Leia, the dress when she was enslaved by Jabba, feels a little bit of fun, but she is really sexy.Luke was originally looking for Vinda for the purpose of transforming Vinda to the righteous side, but then Vinda said \"to me, it's too late\", the phrase said so well! He was used by the emperor and did a lot of bad things. Even if he now wants to turn to the righteous side, can he write off what he did before? There is still a little kindness in him, but he also knows that what he has done is unforgivable, so he will say \"too late for me!\"Satisfied with Vinda's ending. Luke refused to submit to his negative emotions, so the emperor decided to kill Luke. Vader watched Luke's painful moaning when he couldn't fight back. After struggling with his heart, he finally killed the emperor for Luke, but he was also affected by the attack of the emperor, and then died! Sacrifice himself to save Luke and kill the emperor again. After working for the terrible dictatorship of the empire for so many years, he did the right thing before he died, and then ended his tragic life ~ this is the best for Vida 'S destination!But I think this plot is not entirely reasonable. Luke had no need to drop his lightsaber. After he subdued Vida, he would just kill the evil emperor, and then decide Vida's fate. It's stupid to just drop the weapon and slap it. Luke can fight with the emperor. In the end, because Luke lost his strength to the emperor, when he was about to die, Vinda struggled with his heart and decided to stop the emperor from killing Luke.Then, a little bit of expectations, is to make a remake of the trilogy! ! The plot, human settings, set, visual effects, sound effects, actions, improvements in all aspects, re-polished this old masterpiece! It can regain the attention of the old fans and attract new people into the pit. At the same time, it also made up for the regrets left by the technical limitations at that time!Looking forward to this day!",

While this is happening, \"The Emperor\" tell \"Darth Vader\" to capture \"Luke\" so he can be turned to the dark side.The original \"Star wars\" trilogy is easily the best one. The first two movies are near enough perfect. While I still think this film is fantastic, it is flawed.The positivesThe plot is ok. The first act is thrilling and full of tension. While the second act stalls, the third is when the films at its best. Seeing \"Luke\" becoming a fully fledged Jedi was satisfying. \"Darth Vader\" has his redemption and the final scene between him and his son is done perfectly. \"The emperor\" is also fantastic. He's menacing and sinister and you want the heroes to defeat him. The effects for the most part are brilliant. Especially in the final space battle. I think the final space battle is the best out of the whole \"Skywalker saga\". All the action is great. The battle of \"Ensor\" has plenty of stakes and tension. The final lightsaber fight is one of the most heart pounding scenes in \"Star wars\". The chemistry between \"Harrison Ford\" and \"Carrie Fisher\" is great and it makes their romance more realistic.The negativesThe second act is the big problem. Not only is it uneventful but some scenes are completely useless. The \"Ewoks\" are cute but what do they do apart from help in the final battle? The plot line of \"C-3PO\" being a god to the \"Ewoks\" lead to nothing. Most of the second act is filler. Some of the effects look terrible. The speeder bike chase looks really cheap and laughable nowadays. Same when the heroes are on the sail barge at the start of the film. Finally, I don't really like \"Han Solo\" in this film. He doesn't feel like the character from the first two films apart from two funny lines. He wasn't unlikeable it just felt weird and needlessly different.ConclusionDespite its flaws, I really like \"Return of the Jedi\". It's great characters, mostly good plot, thrilling action scenes, realistic romance, good comedic moments and a final scene that is very emotional make the film amazing. But a slow second act, poor special effects and a character that felt different makes the film the worst out of the original trilogy.I'm going to give \"Star wars- episode VI: Return of the Jedi\" a:8/10.",

            "content": "Following two really great and imaginative films, Return of the Jedi seems a bit like a letdown. Its not that its bad, I just feel slightly annoyed when I watch it. The story is understandably under pressure to live up to Episodes VI and V, but it doesn't really stand as tall. There are some good things though, so let's take a look.The conclusion of the trilogy entails the threat of a new (yet somehow half finished \"OPERATIONAL\") Death Star. This time the Emperor himself (played fiendishly awesome by Ian McDiarmid) has come to lure Luke Skywalker into joining the Dark Side, but Luke's only concern is to free his father Anakin Skywalker from the darkness of Darth Vader. Meanwhile, after freeing Han from Jabba the Hutt, which takes an inordinately long time I may add, the our heroes go to the teddy bear infested toy store... I mean Ewok run moon of Endor to destroy the Death Star's shied so Lando Calrissian can destroy the station's jumper-upper thingy.There are, unfortunately, very weak elements to this story even though it should really have been more epic and emotional. The stuff on Tatooine with Jabba the Hutt goes on for far longer than it should, but Jabba is a rather interesting fellow, so at least that carries us through it. The dialog and characterizations are really bad in this one, and I mean really annoyingly bad. Luke barely smiles once in this movie, and for the most part, he looks and sounds depressed. His platitudes aren't that great either when he talks to his father. Leia and Han are equally as boring. There is just no more spark between any of them anymore, and they seem like they're either playing role models to a fault, or they are caricatures of themselves. The element that really does bug me is the reveal of the fact that Luke and Leia are twins. Add the fact that they had kissed each other romantically and formed a sort of love triangle in the previous two films...EEWWWW!!!!! It wasn't necessary at all, so why it was done is completely beyond me. When I talk about the dialog, it comes off as stilted and muted. Words aren't emphasized, and when they are, people use them as catchphrase, i.e. \"It's A Trap!\" Family Guy best summed up the Emperor's dialog by repeating the words \"Dark Side, Good, Complete, my Young Apprentice or Operational.\" The rest is really default word placement, i.e. something, something, something, Dark Side. No one talks normally in this movie, and it truly annoys me. Now onto the good things. The effects are truly spectacular, some of the best in the series, namely found in the Death Star dogfight. Here it looks like effort was really put into the movie to make it stand out. Bravo. The emotional journey of Darth Vader is actually handled very well, and the moment when he removes the mask that keeps him alive to really look upon his son is very sad but we are reminded that he has redeemed himself in the process, bringing balance to the force. So I do have mixed feelings about Return of the Jedi. It's not bad, but its not that great either. Now we move onto the controversial Prequel Trilogy. I will try to handle these films as fairly and as best as I can.",

What I was really left with at the end was the feeling that I really hated the current versions of all three, but with Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back I at least had the consolation that they ended well mainly because they left the endings as they originally were. At the end of Star Wars, Luke and Han get their medals like they always did and the music and everything is the same. Its literally music to your ears, you feel good watching it. Likewise with Empire, Luke and Leia are still on the medical frigate watching the Falcon fly off as the Rebel fleet slowly limps along, the wonderful closing melody ending the film on a soft note of hope. I just love that ending scene in Empire, its one of my favorite movie closes of all time.The original ending of ROTJ was a pretty solid one. Luke burns Vader's body, then joins all his friends with the Ewoks for a celebration that also had the feeling of a cast and crew wrapping up party after 6 years of hard work making the most amazing set of movies ever produced. The Ewok music was nice and blended perfectly into the end theme, striking exactly the right emotional note that left you feeling good.Now that has all been screwed up beyond belief. They've added a whole new 90s song and dance number in there which features cutaways to CG shots of locations that appear nowhere in the trilogy. Its stupid and distracting and just sucks all the emotion out of the end sequence.Then to top it off they go and add Hayden Christiansen's force ghost to the final shot just to make you mad. That is the last thing you see as the movie ends. Hayden Christiansen. The guy who goes on about sand in Attack of the Clones. He wraps up the original trilogy now.So unlike the first two, where you can almost tune out the stupid add-ons and forget about them by the end, ROTJ doesn't allow you to do that. It leaves you with them front and centre in your mind. It just makes the movie absolutely unwatchable.Oh and also they added a lengthy 1990s song and dance number to the Jabba's palace scene, which is another thing that separates this movie from the others. Star Wars is the only other one with a notable musical number in the canteena and to their credit they decided to leave that one mostly alone.I really hope Disney will consider releasing the original versions at some point, Return of the Jedi in particular deserves better than what the currently available version of itself is presenting to the public.

            "content": "Note: this review is based off of the 2019 version of the movie available on Disney+. I've noted this in my other reviews of the original trilogy movies, but there have been many different versions of \"Return of the Jedi\" that have been released through the years, and I believe that it's important to denote which version that I watched. I think that the original \"Star Wars\" has fared the worst through these re-edits, particularly the Mos Eisley scenes. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is left pretty much unscathed, with only a few changes made for continuity's sake. \"Return of the Jedi\" really only contains one change that I can't stand: the over-the-top inclusion of a CGI creature band in Jabba's palace. This fifteen second addition is just so out of place and weird. It doesn't really fit in at all with the rest of the scenes from Jabba's palace. I don't really mind the inclusion of planets introduced in the prequel movies to the ending. Some purists will disagree, but I think that it adds a lot of depth and scale to the universe of \"Star Wars.\" I miss the Ewok celebration music, though.Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) are all on a mission to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from the clutches of the vile gangster, Jabba the Hutt. After the encounter at Jabba's palace, the crew join forces once more to attack a brand new Death Star that the Empire is constructing. Meanwhile, Luke returns to Dagobah to receive some final instruction from Master Yoda (Frank Oz). It is here where the revelation of the previous movie is confirmed, and Luke realizes that he needs to confront Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) in a final showdown. Han and the rest of the group land on the forest moon of Endor in order to shut down the shield generator that protects the vulnerable Death Star, which is still under construction. Lando pilots the Millennium Falcon and leads the Rebel Alliance in a space battle to take down the second Death Star.\"Return of the Jedi\" lacks the charm and sense of adventure of the first movie, and it lacks the emotional depth and character development of the second. What it does give us is a satisfying, albeit safe and inoffensive, finale to the trilogy. Everything is wrapped up very nice and clean, and all of the characters get their own moments to shine. It's not any worse because of this; \"Star Wars\" as a whole is little more than fairy tales set in a unique space fantasy universe. I don't even really mind the Ewoks either. I think a lot of fans take these movies way too seriously, like they're supposed to be some form of high art. Take a chill pill -- you're watching a sequel to a movie that had a tiny green midget who lifted a spaceship with his mind. Suspend your disbelief.My biggest problem with this movie is really the middle third. The beginning and the end are both classic \"Star Wars.\" The Jabba's palace scenes were some of my absolute favorite moments of any movie in the series growing up, and who doesn't love that ending? It's really just the middle, where we need to set up everything for the final battle, that the plot and the pacing slow down a lot and it gets really boring and dull. There's this strange little bit where the Ewoks think that C-3PO is some sort of god, and they are preparing to sacrifice the other characters to him, but this never really plays into the plot at all after the rest of the group is freed.Overall it's a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. It's probably the worst of the bunch if you were to look at it through critical eyes. Some people don't like Harrison Ford's performance in this movie, but there are far more wooden and lifeless performances in this franchise. He does a fine job, but I will agree that he definitely lacks the charisma of the previous films. I think part of why people hate on this movie so much is the fact that it's really hard to match the highs of the previous two. Lightning struck twice with \"Star Wars.\" It comes so close again in this one as well. It's not a bad movie by any means, I just think that it was going to be difficult for them to wrap up the trilogy in a definitive and satisfying way no matter which way they went about it (although this didn't stop Disney from producing more movies that expanded the story further).Watch the entire \"Star Wars\" trilogy. None of them are really worth bothering with after \"Return of the Jedi.\" The ending is conclusive. There didn't need to be a set of prequels either, which pointlessly explained background information that we already knew through expository dialogue in the first three movies. Just keep in mind that these are silly action-adventure movies set in a space fantasy universe. Don't take them too seriously and just have fun.",

Sorry, but I really don't care for furry little rates in a Star Wars series, with the exception of Chewbacca. They just made the movie short on action. We had to watch them worship C-3PO and watch them throw rocks at storm troopers. The rest of the movie was cool. The chase on the speeders in the forest. The sand-pit with Jabba. The final battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. The destruction of the new Death Star. Those parts were cool. Forget everything else. Buy the Special Edition and look at the added stuff. It's worth it. Not bad for a third movie in a trilogy. Most of them suck. Return of the Jedi: B+",

Moreover, it was known that this is the final part of the trilogy.The film is not inferior in its entertainment to the previous two. The plot smoothly brings the audience to the finale of the history of the Rebel Alliance's struggle with the Empire, smoothly ending the stories of all the characters.The Hatch has changed very noticeably. Mark Hammill perfectly conveys the person that the young Jedi has become. He is trained, knows the value of life. This is no longer the youngster we meet in the \"New Hope\". His friends Leia Organa and Han Solo are also becoming wiser. Everyone has missions they want to complete. Darth Vader evolves, finally deciding what to do in the final. The acting of all the actors is good. They set the tone for the film, making the adventure such that you can't take your eyes off.There are also funny characters in the film - Ewoks. Such bears, who are \"a small but proud people.\" And they fit perfectly into this story. Of course, it's amazing to see how they confront the soldiers of the Empire armed with modern weapons, but the main thing here is to convey the idea that you need to fight for your land even with your bare hands.The love triangle somehow predictably unwinds when you learn about the details. There was no special intrigue for me personally. But that doesn't make the movie any worse.The final scenes between Palpatine, Vader and Luke are important. You worry until the last moment, afraid to tear yourself away from the screen. Strong scenes.Special effects and music are back on top. Everything fits harmoniously into the current story, which, no matter how much I would like, is coming to an end anyway.The film, in my opinion, carries an important message to society. Everyone can be a hero, fight for a just cause, perform many feats. It seems that this is just an adventure movie, but people always see deeper, being inspired by such pictures.9 out of 10.",

I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. It's very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.I don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope. They all do so well. They are believable characters. Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!). Harrison Ford - need I say more?The music is once again brilliant. It's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts \"NOOO!\" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius! What an amazing man!Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I.

            "content": "This film probably had more expectation than Empire did leading off from Star Wars, because sequels were never very good. So when Empire was an even bigger hit than the original film, Return of the Jedi had a lot riding on it to bring a thrilling ending to the trilogy. Did it deliver, in my personal opinion yes and no. Richard Marquand was a know body before he got himself involved with the film, due to George Lucas quitting the writers and directors guilds of America. This meant that Lucas's potential first choice Steven Spielberg couldn't work on the film, so Marquand jumped straight in and to be fair he did a pretty amazing job. He somehow still adds to the already amazing achievements of the other two films, whether it be fantastic battles or more intimate moments between characters,this film for the majority captures to true essence of Star Wars. If you don't agree, fair enough but he did give us one of the best space battles and lightsaber battles. The performances are once again fantastic from the three main leads in the film Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. The three of them have such a good relationship and chemistry on screen that is truly stunning and really enjoyable to watch. From Ford's banter with Hamill to Fisher and Hamill's more intimate moments revealing there true connection. Hamill brings a an even more mature turn to the character now that he is a Jedi and the only lasting one alive, he shows that responsibility. Also edging his way towards the mentor type of character that Obi Wan-Kenobi was in the first film. Ford, brilliant with his charm and wit.He can either uplift the mood with his brilliant one liners or bring a lot more depth and emotion that the character brilliantly but rarely shows. Last but certainly not least out of the three Carrie Fisher, truly brilliant in every way. From that rather revelling metal bikini to the badass that she is killing Jabba the hutt, Fisher shows a broad range of emotions and types of person the character can be. This is a performance that young actresses should look up to emulating, not just this film put all three of them, insane! The final performance of mention should be of the main character across the whole saga, Darth Vader. At the beginning shows the more of the Vader we now, fear and love at the same time. Ruthless and the height of evil is a true wonder on the big screen, he is the definitive bad guy in cinema. However as the film goes on you can sense the conflict that is going on within the character, even though he denies it to Luke. The truth about the character starts to really shine through that actually he is the victim in this whole story, a fantastic portrayal of the character. Finally a fantastic ending to one of cinemas greatest, out of this world.Another positive of the film is not surprisingly the special effects in the film, which once again are brilliant. More specifically the way they portray a certain character, Yoda and his death. The way that the puppet is controlled and portrayed on screen makes him seems as if he were a human character. This especially hits home hard when the character dies and when he is telling Luke that he'll be the last of the Jedi, truly emotion and heart breaking, amazing from a puppet well done Frank Oz. The space battle above Endor is one of the best battles brought to film, heart pounding and exciting from star to finish. It introduces us to see new pilots whilst still showing some familiar faces. What is more incredible is how those effects were created, not like they are today and still the effects all still hold up today. The other amazing effect in the film is the speeder bike chase on Endor, which is even more incredible how that was achieved. The fact that a couple of cameramen walked through a forest in California for miles then only to speed to film up to show the speed of the bikes. The fact that a real life place was used only makes the tension and the stakes of the character life higher, because the location is plausible and real to the audience. Now the negatives and yes there are some that probably put people off this film. Firstly the Ewoks....................*sigh*.....................why why why. They are up there with the infamous gungan from the prequels, they are utterly horrible in every way. If they can beat the Empire how on earth did the Empire get anywhere with their domination of the galaxy. It is even more sad to know that the original idea was to have them battle on Kashyyyk and have a battle between the wookies. That would be much more plausible and you could understand them beating the Empire, why on earth that idea was scrapped. A more personal negative and probably not a lot of people have is C3p0, someone just kill him already I'm fed up with is character, i hate him, I hope they kill him off in episode 7..............Oh wait..........*sigh*.Finally this film is really good and has some of the best moments in Star Wars history and is a fitting ending to the story of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader. The directing , performances and effects are all what Star Wars was and is built on and is shown brilliantly in this film, 85% out of 100. Unfortunately the negatives of this film let it down and are encapsulated by the dancing around a fire at the end . However a fitting ending to this trilogy!",

            "content": "Everything has been said on IMDb and everywhere else about Return of the Jedi once, twice, a million times, okay maybe not a million times, but I want to bring up something that's only been maybe brought up, say, a few hundred times. Where Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi lead is to a great metaphor on life. My grandfather promised my Uncle, when my Uncle was 15 years old, that he could take the car out to a school dance if my Uncle cleaned the car, cleaned it really good and so my Uncle worked on the car all day, cleaned it perfectly as I'm told from my sources. My grandfather decided it didn't look good enough and told my Uncle he couldn't go,(unfortunately this way of being is my Grandfather's M.O.), so my Uncle took the car anyway and went to the school dance, when he got back, my grandfather kicked him out of the house, and my Uncle has lived on his own since he was 15 years of age. That's who my Grandfather is, in so many ways or words my grandfather is the Emperor, and my Uncle as a metaphor is Luke, and all of us make a choice in life on whether we become Vader or not. You can imagine the hate my Uncle had for my Grandfather, and he doesn't talk to my grandfather to this day, which I don't blame him, I wouldn't either, but my Uncle let that hate go, and even though his life hasn't been perfect, he's lived his life, a good life, and he's been married for almost 50 years now, and I'm proud of him. It wasn't easy for my Uncle though, he could have easily chosen the dark path, a path of drugs, murder, prison, just a path of hatred towards everyone and resentment towards my grandfather for his whole life(believe me, my Uncle has had resentment towards my grandfather over the years, but he let it go eventually, and I don't blame him for having that resentment either).The same goes for Luke, he makes a choice, and it's all about choice, Happiness is a choice, everything is a choice no matter where you been. Some things in life are more messed up than others, and in the end, it's how you deal with them. It's okay to be human and feel anger and sadness, and whatever, but it's how you recover that defines you. I once heard someone say that 'It isn't the easy times in life that define one's manhood, it's the tough times that do.' Luke almost kills his father and becomes evil, going past the point of no return which leads to a bad heart, a victim mentality, and never being able to finally forgive and move on and live his life. Luke is angry, but he ends up doing the right thing, and he forgives his father in the end. Perhaps it might not have been so easy for Luke to forgive Vader if Vader, Luke's father, would have lived, but that's the 'what if' and the 'who knows' which one can't or should probably not dwell on too often. The 'what ifs' and the 'who knows' are out of our control anyway. Luke didn't go to the dark side as he could have easily gone to, but Luke is a good-strong person, he was tested, just like we're all tested in life(I say \"tested\" in the meaning of we're all going to go through the ebb and flows of life sometimes, again some greater than others), just like my Uncle, and that metaphor, on top of so many other great things the Star Wars Trilogy offers, is priceless. Again, as so many have said, thank you George Lucas.",

I know that Yoda said in ESB, \"size matters not\" but here its not just the size, its the weapons they possess. The idea of stormtroopers getting whopped by Ewoks is just totally unbelievable. It doesn't make much sense. Away from the Ewoks, this film was brilliantly paced from start to end, although I wouldn't have minded less Tatooine scenes, especially the dancing scenes. The film starts off brilliantly and kept me interested. After Han was rescued and Jabba was killed, they finally get off Tatooine and off to Yavin IV, where they receive intelligence reports that the Second Death Star is nearing completion. The Rebels must destroy this battle station before the entire Rebellion is overwhelmed whilst Luke goes back to Dagobah to complete his training. Sadly, Yoda's time is ending and he dies at old age, leaving Luke half-trained. Obi- wan's ghost then explains to Luke who the \"another hope\" really was. Luke realizes that his sister is none other than Princess Leia and eventually heads back to Yavin. Then we head off to Endor to destroy the shield generators protecting the Death Star battle station. At Endor, most scenes were very exciting had it NOT being for those teddy bears. One of the best scenes from this movie is the speeder chase. Just before Luke leaves to confront Darth Vader, he states that Vader is his dad and that he has a sister. Leia realizes too that Luke is her brother. Luke eventually states that he must confront his father and bring him back to the light side. Then we prepare for two great countdowns. Lando Calrissian and his group attempt to destroy the Death Star whilst Luke confronts his father. The movie ended extremely well, had it not being for two things in the Blu- ray cut. One is that Darth Vader's NOOOO when he's throwing the Emperor into the shaft was just cheesy and another was if only Sean Sebastan had appeared in the Blu-ray version instead of Hayden Christensen. I mean, how would Luke know that Hayden is actually Anakin Skywalker. Luke never saw Anakin like that. It should've been the same guy who played him in the un-cut version. That's how Luke remembered his father.Anyways, the acting and the special effects in this film were excellent. By 1980, Return of the Jedi's special effects were way ahead of its time.

Bear in mind that the previous two movies in the trilogy are both considered to be the best in all of Star Wars. To top them would be quite a feat, and this movie does not quite manage do it.The subplot focusing on Luke and Vader is the most interesting aspect of the film. Vader return to the light and the inner conflict that he has both are executed beautifully. Luke's stubborn belief in his father and his struggle against the dark side are also done really well by Mark Hamill, who's performance in this film is the best in the OT. Also, Emperor Palpatine is just a perfect villain and is really fun to watch.However, the rest of the film is not so interesting. Jabba the Hutt's subplot takes up too much space and could have been cut down. The movie takes a complete halt once the gang get trapped by Ewoks. the Ewoks really drag the pacing down of this film. I think the movie would have been a lot more enjoyable if they had just made it a bit shorter.The third act is fun when it focuses on Luke and Vader. However, the other two subplots are not as interesting. The Ewoks defeating the stormtroopers through primitive weapons does not give the sense of an epic battle that a film like this should have. The rebellion fighters trying to destroy the death star feels very similar to the third act of A New Hope, except without the emotional resonance. When two thirds of your third act are quite dull, it somewhat lessens the impact of the film. That being said, I really do enjoy the celebration at the end of the film, with Vader's burning body and everyone embracing each other.",

            "review_title": "Weakest of the original trilogy: still enthralling",
            "content": "Return of the Jedi has a number of difficult responsibilities. It has to wrap up what was, at the time, the most impressive trilogy of films in the history of cinema. It had to follow Empire Strikes Back. All loose ends had to be tied, and be a cathartic conclusion. What's impressive is that it handles such mammoth tasks admirably, and is for the most part let down only by odd choices and vast ambition.Picking up following the uniquely dark ending of Empire, Return of the Jedi is split into two parts: first, the quest to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt; the second to stop the Galatic Empire plot to build a second Death Star. The latter part simultaneously shows the rebels fighting to destroy the death star and Luke's confrontation with the dark side of the force.One can immediately say that Return of the Jedi is an ambitious conclusion. The sheer amount of minor characters across the film develop a much larger world. Even minor additions such as the extra red cloaked guards that accompany the Emperor add depth and world building. Scenes are larger and bolder. The many areas, ships and buildings of Jabba's 'base' show a sense of scale more clearly than the tricks of size that Empire (and to a lesser extent, New Hope) used. Consequently however, the use of effects has to be increased, and in a way that hasn't stood the test of time as well as the earlier two films. 'Green screen' type scenes are somewhat more noticeable, though they in no way detract from the experience.What certainly does work is the cathartic finale. While making the film the lightest of the trilogy was disjointing after the darker-style Empire, it certainly allowed the conclusion it has. Jubilation doesn't feel out of place. As an aside on 'out of place', one can single out the Ewoks, who -just about- work because of this. And so the general arc, beginning in Episode IV, is satisfying and more impressively works, where so many successful trilogies fall at the later hurdles (Matrix being the most glaring, but also The Godfather, Pirates of the Caribbean).It's instead the choices that are made elsewhere that are at fault. The most glaring is the 'recycled' death-star idea; the twists in that story don't take away from a lazy feeling. But its more the quasi-retconning (if not factually, emotionally so) that seems odd. The 'sister' revelation seems (and considering the changes from the original drafts, is) out of place. Luke's sudden mastery of the force and his Jedi powers are unexplained, if necessary. The decision to sideline Vader, and make the Emperor the main antagonist, is questionable (though brave) considering how strong Vader's presence has been throughout the earlier two films. The Emperor exudes evil, but without the backstory of Vader appears merely two-dimensional. That's not to fault Ian McDiarmid, who commands the screen.The most problematic part is the decision to have Lando being the only known character to fight in the dogfight against the Death Star. Already the most minor of the primary characters, it lacks the emotional weight of the original Death Star run. This, and the incongruity between the lighthearted Endor section and the darker Jedi element, mean the final climax is a bumpy ride of frustrating editing.The film is rightly regarded as the 'weakest' of a successful trilogy, but what exactly does that mean? It's not as much of a criticism as it seems- this is no Godfather Part III. It simply doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessors. Which was not an easy task in the first place. It may not end on the peak, but it ends on a high note.",

            "content": "RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983) features the same old cast as the first two STAR WARS episodes in a rehash of previous themes. Now with a cast this talented and material this strong, rehashing is not necessarily bad. This time the Galactic Empire's forces lead by Lord Darth Vader (David Prowse acting with James Earl Jones's voice) has again build a Death Star and is still out to destroy the Rebel Alliance. This Death Star is, of course, even more powerful than the previous one and has the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) personally supervising its construction.You may remember from the last episode that Han Solo (Harrison Ford) owed Jabba the Hutt (Mike Edmonds) money so Jabba in a fit of rage had him frozen and sent to Jabba's planet. The film starts with the rescue of Han from Jabba by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). The rest of the movie is ostensibly about the destruction of the Death Star by the rebels, but actually the film is about the inherit conflict in the duality of man and the thin line between good and evil. Will Darth Vader turn Luke to the dark side or will Luke turn Darth Vader to the good? Each is confident, and until the end it is not clear whose power will prove stronger.The character creations in all the STAR WARS series are delightfully imaginative. Jabba and his minions are testaments to the grotesque and the obese. After being grossed out by Jabba's huge rolls of jelly like fat, I suspect a large number of people must have run out of the theater to hit the pay phones to call 1-800-OutFat or some such number. A better advertisement for fat clinics I have not seen. By the way, I thought one of Jabba's entourage was at least a kissing cousin to the gargoyles that populate the movie GREMLINS.Yoda (Frank Oz) appears again in the show to complete Luke's training as aJedi. Luke thinks he is already one, but Yoda admonishes him, \"Not yet. One thing remains. One things remains, Vader. You must confront Vader, and then a Jedi you will be.\" I love the flowery language the writers (Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas) give Yoda. Yoda poetically warns Luke, \"Anger, fear, depression. The dark side are they.\" Luke's training also needs help from his old mentor Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness). He appears in a vision telling Luke, \"You will find that many of the truths we cling to depend upon your point of view.\" This is a show of secrets revealed, but you will not find them out here. See the movie.The sets (Norman Reynolds) and visual effects (Richard Edlund, Dennis Muren, and Ken Ralston) are even more elaborate than in the first two episodes. My favorite is the little hover-bikes on which they go screaming through the California redwood trees. That they could control the bikes while traveling at the high speed they are going makes no sense, but hey, this is science fiction afterall. The special effects continue to be a great blend of the old and the new: bows and arrows vs. blasters (laser guns) and hang gliders vs. large mechanical dinosaurs outfitted with laser cannons.RETURN OF THE JEDI introduces sweet furry new creatures called Ewoks. They were a hit at the time, but I am surprised there wasn't at even a bigger marketing tie in with them. Looked like great toys for the age 2-9 set to me.The acting in the movie was good. My favorite was James Earl Jones. His voice must be the richest and most powerful of any actor living today. Hamill, whom I found to be a big disappointment in the last episode, has more energy and does his part less on autopilot in this one. His performance here still pales in significance to his work in STAR WARS, which is the only film he has ever been great in.Although the show was excellent, there were several letdowns for me. First and foremost, I missed the incredible humor from the first two. There are laughs in RETURN OF THE JEDI, but overall the writers and the director (Richard Marquand) approach the show too reverentially. Second, I missed the romantic angle. There was some aspects of it in this episode, but not much.",

            "content": "Many millions of people love Star Wars, and I am not going to hide the fact, that I am part of that trend. In my opinion, Star Wars (Episodes 4-6) make the greatest movie trilogy of all time. In Episode 6, Return of the Jedi, we see the gripping conclusion to the ultimate movie joyride. So strap yourself in for the ride of your life!After rescuing Han Solo and Princess Leia from certain doom at the hands of crime lord Jabba the Hut, Luke Skywalker revisits Yoda, Jedi Master. For only by completing his Jedi training can he become a true Jedi Knight and defeat Darth Vader and the dark side of the force. Creatures from all over the galaxy rally in attempt to defy the Galactic Empire in rebuilding an even more deadly Death Star.ROTJ is not the best Star Wars film of the trilogy, but it is not a bad film. It tidies up all the loose ends that have been started by the previous two films and continues on the emotion that Empire Strikes Back had. The Screenplay for ROTJ was done by Executive Producer George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan. I love the new characters that were included in this story, as they are fun to watch. I also enjoyed the funny little bits that were added into this Star Wars story, like having a musical section at the start of the film.I was amazed to see that all of the Star Wars trilogy movies have been directed by three different people. But with George Luca's in charge of the Star Wars franchise, any good director could do the film and it would come out ok. In the director's chair for ROTJ, was Richard Marquand, who did an amiable job. He continues on the space fantasy which is concluded in ROTJ.\nI have spoken about my feelings towards all the usual characters in the Star Wars trilogy. People like Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the robot droids R2D2 (Kenny Baker) and C3PO (Anthony Daniels). They have all had a great impact on the series, and do what is needed to be done to make ROTJ an enjoyable film.In ROTJ we get to see some brand new characters. For the first time we get the chance to see the Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) who in the flesh, is a gruesome looking person. You can see why Darth Vader is so driven to serve the dark side of the force, as the Emperor is totally focused on making his side the strongest in the galaxy.But the best inclusion in this film has to be the fun little creatures called Ewoks, who are never referred to by name in the film. These Ewoks look like a cuddly teddy bear, but are very strong and aggressive little creatures. The funniest part with Ewoks has to be when these creatures mistakenly think C-3PO is some sort of god to them. There was also another interesting character from the rebellion, who was a major space commander. Insect look-a-like Admiral Piett (Kenneth Colley) is a man who is supposed to be taken seriously, but by looking at this person, you could be forgiven for starting to laugh at him as well.\nRTOJ has some very enthralling moments in it. The start of RTOJ shows us with Luke at his home planet, where he is out to rescue the ill-fated Han Solo. Here we meet back up with Jabba the Hut, a slimy creepy blob, who is very happy to see Han Solo in the position he is. But the demise of Jabba and his crew is great, as Luke shows himself to be a real Jedi. In fact in this sequence we see two other gruesome creatures, one, a scary monster, who Luke defeats and the other is a creature in a pit that lies in the waiting for his next feed.Other enjoyable sequences are the parts with the Ewoks, as they make the film seem much less serious, a good thing in my view. In this part of the film, we see Luke and his friends trying to destroy a power station for the new death star on the Ewoks planet. Here high speed hover scooters are driven, and although all these scooters seem fake, they only add to the fantasy. Finally the final confrontation between Vader and Skywalker is great, as more sword fighting just gets me more excited. Then for us as the audience to see Darth Vader's head was a true highlight of the film. It is interesting to note: Darth Vader is the first character in movie history to be played by three actors (body by David Prowse, voice by James Earl Jones, face by Sebastian Shaw)So who are my favourite Star Wars characters? Well I like almost all of them, but my most compelling characters have to be Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader,    Obi-wan Kenobi, Yoda and the two droids, R-2D2 and C-3PO. All these character creations are some of the best I have seen in a movie.\nEvery once in a while I have a great experience at a movie. That very experience was captured on me in the whole Star Wars trilogy (episodes 4-6), because people like myself can love these sorts of movies and get lost in them, so much so that we feel like we are part of the fantasy we are seeing played out on the screen. When a movie (or movies) can do this, I feel that they are something very special. Seeing all of the various characters from all of the Star Wars movies (episodes 4-6), has been a great pleasure and privilege for a film freak such as myself. So thank you George Lucas and may the movie forces be with you forever!CMRS gives 'Return of the Jedi: 5 (Brilliant Film)",

The way Yoda evades the questions that Luke asks him was well written. The Ewoks were a mistake though. Furballs are Spielberg's department... But the battle in space above Endor was superb and Anakin fulfilling the Chosen One's destiny and completing the legacy of being the one to destroy the Sith was perfectly in line with the story started in the prequels. Was a little taken aback by the 'Skywalker family connection' but the prequels have tied this all up. The celebrations at the end were superb. Listen closely for a Gungan shouting 'Wesa Free!', a brilliant tie to the prequels. The extended Rebel celebrations were brilliant too, and we get to see Luke and Wedge, Lucas's token survivor through the entire trilogy, shaking hands and then embracing, completing the circle from episode IV. In all honesty though, the trilogy went out on a brilliant note and the legacy started had been fulfilled, and Anakin's story came to an end who was what the story was really all about",

            "content": "Even though The Empire Strikes Back was the better constructed film, THIS is the one I love the most. Why? Well, let's just get the nitpicks out of the way.Ewoks. They are cute... and somehow serve a purpose, but my GOD how I wish they were Wookies or something. That said, I didn't find them INSULTING and though it lacked a bit of maturity, there is still a strong message of science vs nature, wood trampling steel.Bike chase. Though pointless, still really cool and maybe that's the best word to describe this movie, \"cool.\" I would have liked it so the last words were Luke saying \"May the force be with you.\" in the final scene but I think that's an idea that came too late (though I wouldn't mind Hamill or a Hamill sound alike adding in that last line).And... Actually, that's it in terms of nitpicks.It might not be as strong as a film overall compared to Empire, but it has the most powerful moments. Leia and Han reuniting and professing their love (in a very unique way I might add), the whole Jabba scene somehow never overstayed its welcome despite being too long, it was still well paced, designed and acted... And of course, Leia's slave outfit, enough said.Luke finally understanding his family was a real thought provoker and believing that his father might still have good in him is beyond inspiring. Then there were the show stealing supporting characters, like Jabba the Hutt, Mon Mothma, Wedge Antilles, pretty much all of the Imperial Officers and of course, Admiral Ackbar! The face that launched 1,000 memes. The late Erik Baursfeld gave a magnificent performance as this galactic fish, you somehow felt he had a history, that he knew what he was doing and that nothing would shake him (except for one moment which ANYONE can understand) and his rich, gravelly voice was just perfect for him! Then, there was the Emperor... Oh GOD! He looked like something out of a horror movie! That deep, crackling voice and his presence is just HELLISH! Yes there were times when he was a bit \"goofy\" but it worked in a way that just makes you uncomfortable. just when he first meets Luke and says \"You no longer need those\"-it is just UNSETTLING! Ian McDiarmid played the role perfectly.On that note, Return of the Jedi perhaps has the best acting in all of the Star Wars films. THIS is the one where Hamill deserved an Oscar nod at the very least, just the final moments alone where we explored Luke's rage, then his conviction, it's just a marvel to watch. James Earl Jones' voice performance made Vader very three dimensional here, this is the movie where we started to understand Vader more and perhaps even feel sorry for him as well as completely fear him, it leaves you vexed in the right way. Frank Oz as Yoda... What more do I need to say? he was splendid, thought provoking and heart breaking.Ford and Fisher were splendid as always. Williams especially showed more depth as Lando Calrissian in this film, showing his sense of honor and faith in his friends despite going through the worst of it.Which brings me to the last part: The action. All the fighting that happened with Jabba was practically perfect, though I do wish Luke used the force more often in the rancor fight but that's more than made up with one big thing: The battle of Endor! It is easily still the greatest battle in all of Star Wars and perhaps in the running for the best in all of Sci Fi. The space battle was constantly thrilling, you felt like you were there. The battle on the ground was equally as exhilarating, even scary at times (even with the Ewoks) and easily the best looking saber fight in the original trilogy. Though the drama lasted longer in Empire, this is the where it looks like they are trying to strike each other rather than simply tap swords. The other reason why this action is so amazing, besides the amazing visuals and choreography is that the emotions all match perfectly! You can feel Lando's frustration during the battle, you can feel Han's desperation mixing with his confidence in his abilities, you can see Leia's courage and pain, then of course... Luke's inner struggle. Even the side characters and extras, all of it is on par with the leads! That's what makes Return of the Jedi so great: The problems aren't that big of an issue because everything else is so good, even perfect in some spots. The ending is very fitting, especially the 1997 edition extension (not the DVD version, that was an insult to Sebastian Shaw).Obviously this gets 10 stars from me. It is my favorite Star Wars movie for a good reason.",

            "review_title": "The most underrated of the Classic Trilogy",
            "content": "Why is this installment so underrated now?  When it first came out, a lot of fans (including Lucas' pal Spielberg himself) thought that it was actually the best of the trilogy and was just more satisfying than TESB.  It certainly did NOT disappoint fans, and even made a serious run at toppling E.T. as the all-time #1 box office champion at the time. \nBut today folks usually harp that ANH was a more \"innocent\" film while TESB had \"the greatest dramatic power.\"  Well, if ROTJ was full of cheesy humor and weird creatures and seemed to be intended first and foremost as an entertainment for kids (inspiring lots of merchandise), then so was ANH, certainly.  And there is nothing wrong in ROTJ providing this saga with the ultimate in happy endings, as everyone knew before ROTJ came out that it would be much like ANH in tone and dramatic mood - something mostly welcomed by fans after experiencing all the gloom and tragedy which this galactic fairy tale unveiled in TESB.Anyhow, all the epic drama of TESB would be rendered totally meaningless if not for ROTJ providing us with the necessary closure, as we learn that (SPOILERS) Vader WAS in fact Luke's father as he had claimed; that the \"other\" was no other than Leia, who was actually Luke's sister; that her romance with Han therefore comes to a happy ending with his rescue and our realization that they were simply destined to be together; and that the Empire and the Dark Side would be destroyed not by Luke killing his own father but by Vader's own redemption.And as for raw drama, the Luke-Vader-Palpatine confrontation and climax matches anything from the entire saga. The escape from Jabba's lair, the speed chase through the woods, the Forest Battle and the epic space battle (culminating in Lando and the Falcon's thrilling escape from the exploding Death Star) also rank among the most exhilarating action sequences in the entire trilogy.And about those Ewoks: they were actually quite popular first time around, as they appeared in spin-off TV movies and an animated series.  Fans should not obsess over them, as this movie is not actually centered on them contrary to what so many critics say.   Point is, if ANH and TESB are listed among the fans' top 20 favorite movies, there is no reason why ROTJ shouldn't be there too.  Its triumphant and exciting conclusion serves to complete the three-act epic and make it a truly matchless movie experience to be relished for all time.",

The fact that Luke and Leia are brother and sister is nice,but not very important or exciting.It was probably done to give the girl to Solo without causing problems.Because it wasn't special it wasn't told special(like in episode V when Vader tells Luke that he is his father).However,the ending and the fate of Darth Vader is very well worked out and deserves to be recognized as important as him telling Luke that he is his father.Overall,when watching the old Star Wars movies this episode is the lesser of the 3.It still is a brilliant movie which also tells a lot about the other 2. 10/10",

            "content": "Newcomers and Fans alike often misjudge or overlook Return of the Jedi as being the weaker film of the original trilogy. And usually for very trivial reasons. However, I have reason to believe that this film has become criminally underrated. By far the biggest and most major improvement that keeps Jedi separate from A New Hope and Empire is the rapid character development of Luke Skywalker. It cannot be denied that his skill with the force has doubled, if not tripled since the last film. For lack of a better term, he is a bad-ass in every sense. The fight on the Sail Barge in the first act is intense right until the end. Luke continues to grow and test his power as the film goes on. But that's just his development for his physical abilities. Internally, Luke has become far more mature and wiser than he was in the previous two films. He makes smarter decisions, doesn't act so rash and is considerably less \"whiny\" than he was thought to be in episode's IV and V. The visual effects have improved vastly since the last film. It was only a three year difference, but you can really see it. There are more stunts, more spectacles and more work put into the light saber effects. It's overall, a step ahead from it's predecessors. Not a very large step, but a step towards improvement nonetheless.Han Solo and Leia's relationship comes full circle. And it's a beautiful thing. The writers managed to execute a romantic sub-plot without it being campy or unnecessary. It's really satisfying to see them being reunited, after all of the childish feuding they went through in the first two movies. It's a nice touch to the last chapter of the trilogy.The trio of confrontation between The Emperor, Vader and Luke is extremely climatic. Everything comes together in this last act. The light saber duel between Luke and Vader is the most passionate of the trilogy. It is far more psychological than previous light saber duels, making it one of the most dramatic and symbolically powerful. The ending celebration on Endor is light hearted and leaves you with a feeling joy. It's the perfect ending to a near perfect trilogy.Although Return of the Jedi is not a perfect movie and it lacks the same excitement that The Empire Strikes Back contained so well; Jedi is my favourite because it's a more quiet and subtle Star Wars film. At times it plays more like a Shakespearean drama than it does an sci-fi film. But I don't believe that's a bad thing. If anything it helps to further enhance Jedi's flavour and further solidify it's unique place in the franchise. Jedi is a terrific ending to an awesome Trilogy. I pity those who fail to see it's under-stated brilliance.",

The movie accomplishes each of those tasks fine, and though unfair, when comparing \"Jedi\" versus the other two films, it's the weakest. That's not to say it's a poor film, to the contrary it is still most entertaining, but the slow pace to the beginning of the movie takes away from the high energy that \"Empire Strikes Back\" ends on. If you'll recall, at the end of \"Empire,\" our heroes Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando, and the droids are searching for Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who is being held by the gangster Jabba the Hutt. That's the warm up to the movie, the story line continuing Luke and Darth Vader is much more interesting and leads to the ultimate end of the movie and saga. One of my favorite scenes in all of movies comes at the end of \"Jedi,\" the final battle between Luke and Darth Vader, long-shots, big music, sends chills up my spine. The movie was intended to be directed by George Lucas' friend Steven Spielberg, but a union technicality nixed that idea, and little known Welsh-born director Richard Marquand does the job. We also get to see the sinister Emporer, played by Ian McDiarmid under layers and layers of makeup, he adds another piece to the force puzzle. Then there are the ewoks, those cute little made-for-merchandising furry creatures that occupy the middle of the movie. They're cute, but after the dark, adult themes of \"Empire,\" the ewoks evokes a kiddy charm that takes away from the maturity level of the Star Wars movies.

            "content": "This is the weakest of the original trilogy. Watching it, one gets the feeling that Lucas is mixing recycled material with some things dumped from the original because he had too much material for one film. Now it's not quite enough for three.The Wook... pardon me, Ewoks have shrunk in size for this one. Cuter=more merchandise. We do get to see the forest world of Chewbacca eventually in the prequels. How the Ewoks survive in the wild if they can't even wield a slingshot is beyond me. And while one can have some limited success with arrows and stones against armored troops with laser guns, the battle on Endor is simply comical in the way the stormtroopers practically slaughter themselves in horror at the little bears. The Death Star gets blown up again. It feels like it was the planned original climax, but with more of the story worked out in the second and third film, what to but to just do it again? The set piece in the Canti... pardon me, Jabba's fortress, has the band playing it up again. The Emperor commits the classic 'James Bond villainous mastermind' mistake: let the good guys into your inner sanctum (such as the field generator on Endor) while chatting them up, thus giving them plenty of opportunity to blow your hideaway to pieces. Dr. No couldn't have done it any better. It's OK: the original Star Wars was more comedic (and thus actually better) than the prequels, just like the James Bond films. It is a Space Opera, not a Space Odyssey!I have to give John Williams credit for the music. The re-orchestration of older material is great, and one tune in particular, the Ewoks' Parade, is a nice piece of neoclassical composition that holds its own even on public radio programs. It made the little critters almost sufferable! As an extensive listener to the classic repertoire, I would say Williams did not rip the old-timers like Dvorak off any more than they did each other (Such as Dvorak ripping of the Leitmotif from the Scherzo of Beethoven's 9th). His score has to be one of the best film scores of the 20th century, and I say that despite plenty of stiff competition from Jarre Sr., Herrmann, or sf experts like Goldsmith. I would say in recent memory, only Howard Shore has matched such a variety of good melodies and deft orchestration for the LOTR films.A parting shot regarding the re-mastering almost 20 years later: as always, Lucas could not resist overdoing it when sprucing up 'Return' for re-release. Consider the following little example: in the original, there is an outside shot of the twin suns of Tattooine setting over Jabba's fortress. The shot is quiet, suggesting that everyone is slumbering away, which is exactly what Leia is supposed to think while thawing Han. In the remake, Lucas had to put some desert frog in the foreground of this formerly serene shot, snarfing up a bug and burping loudly. It's as though he has forgotten why he put that scene there in the first place. Oh, George.",

None of the prequels can compare to this gem, arguably the weakest of the original Star Wars movies. The plot's okay: the heroes rescue Han Solo from the evil Jabba the Hutt, then go on to destroy the Death Star's deflector shield on the wooded planet of Endor, simultaneous with an attack on the Imperial ships orbiting the planet. Luke Skywalker must confront his father, attempting to bring him back to the Light Side while also dealing with the Evil Emperor, who covets young Skywalker's power and wants to train him to be a Sith Lord, like his father. All in all, the movie ties up loose ends nicely, although any viewers may think the heroes have incredible advantages that couldn't possibly work. Lighten up, it's a science fiction fantasy adventure! Good wins, case closed.I enjoyed the sets, filming locations, and characters much more than the story. One of my favorite scenes is when the heroes are in Jabba the Hutt's castle, surrounded by an odd assortment of life forms and monsters. Jabba himself has become an indelible science fiction icon, though not as much as Darth Vader. I personally loved the PUPPETS and stop motion effects MUCH, MUCH more than the computer generated imagery in the prequels. The monster Luke has to face in Jabba's pit is beautifully ugly, and is a stop motion masterpiece worthy of Ray Harryhausen's accolades (this creature---or something very similar to it---would be reincarnated as a threat to Beldar in \"Coneheads\"). I also liked the much hated Ewoks. Yes, they're cuddly teddy bears, yuk! But I liked George Lucas's attempts to bring primitive hunter-gatherer cultures into the sci-fi mix and include them as heroes. The sets were fantastic, like Jabba's creepy castle and the Ewok village high in the trees. Lucas chose lovely settings for this movie, from the sand dunes east of California's Imperial Valley and Anza Borrego Desert, to the redwood forests of northern California. It's a way of translating our real world into that of fantasy.Oh yes, the guys will watch for Princess Leia in that metal bikini while she's a captive of Jabba. Today, I'll bet Carrie Fisher is more remembered as Leia wearing that then for the spiral buns and white robe of the original film.",

I disagree with this. Ewoks are funny. We already had funny characters in the saga, even in the Original trilogy: C-3P0 and R2-D2. A good thing of Star Wars is that sometimes you laugh too, and in my opinion that's right, good.SPOILERAnother thing they hate is when darth vader has his mask taken off, because that loses his dramaticity and his mightiness of being Darth Vader. I really don't understand that: It's a point that could touch you, when Luke's father shows how he does look like. It also shows that Vader isn't that terrific, evil being. He's got a complicated story. It makes Vader the most complex character of the saga. So I think that is the main point of the saga.

The first comes about 2:02 into the movie, after the fireworks on the forest moon, when you see the crowds gathering at Coruscant to rejoice that the Emperor is dead and the evil Empire is dissolved.

I knew of no previous films he had directed, or any films that he had been involved in. First warning sign.Secondly, to me, it just doesn't finish the trio of movies off very well. We all would expect a finale to be grand and epic, action-packed,final battle of good v evil, and Return of the Jedi just does not deliver for me. No to my liking anyway. Sure, it's got plenty of action, but by the end I don't really get a feeling of completeness, of resolution.The third little niggle; since when can Stormtroopers be knocked out with rocks and killed with wooden arrows? The armour they wear should be far more developed than that, and in my view of the Star Wars universe, it's just not realistic.And since when does a Stormtrooper run after someone who tapped them on the back? they'd simply pull out their blaster and shoot them. Again, unrealistic. And what purpose do the Ewoks serve, apart from standing there, looking 'cute'? Also, in one or two places, the quality of the acting could have been improved. I'm not trying to sound cynical, I'm just giving you my opinion. Trust me, if George Lucas would have directed this, it could have been a lot better.",

Still this is Star Wars after all so there is more plus points than minuses, the plus points include a great space battle and an amazing speedbike chase.

The Emperor was always a fave character of mine and after seeing Phantom Menace, I enjoy his role in this better. Han, Leia, Chewbacca and the droids go to the planet Endor which is a huge forest with small furry primitives. The Vader/Luke/Emperor scenes are awesome.

It is a very important chapter in the story, we meet the Emperor for the first time and we see Luke trying to bring Vader back to the good side, and the struggle within.Unfortunately we also meet one of the things I hate the most about Star Wars: the Ewoks. I hate them. I hate them so much. The Ewoks represent the first time George Lucas did something not for the sake of plot, but to sell toys and stupid cartoons that kids would watch because kids would love the cuddly little bears. OK, when the Emperor says something like \"There is a legion of my best troops on Endor\" and they just get taken down by little bears with pointy sticks and rocks, that just doesn't make any sense now does it? They are taking down trained soldiers with the greatest military technology in the galaxy (including AT-STs)?!? are you kidding me? However, some of my favorite scenes in the entire saga are in Jedi, such as the Sarlacc Pit sequence and the final confrontation between Vader and Luke. Jedi is, unfortunately, a flawed film. Even without the Ewoks this movie has some mistakes. Just to mention them quickly, the dark tone of Empire is gone. Instead, it is replaced with light hearted tone for children. The idea of a second Death Star is retarded and the movie uses a lot of blue screen that was not used in the previous films and the effects in those scenes simply do not hold up anymore. As much as I love the look of Jabba and his palace, the entire sequence with Jabba lasts like 40 minutes and really has nothing to do with the real story. You know, the Star Wars. Some great iconic things happen because of Jabba but it kind of makes the movie stall. Han Solo should have died in Empire. He was just the damsel in distress in Jedi and has nothing to do in the movie. The whole scene where they are are being held captive by the Ewoks and C3PO tells the story of the last films makes the movie stall. Leia changes her outfit like 7 times in the movie so it could appeal to younger girls and sell toys. Yoda's death feels abrupt and Obi Wan's ghost sitting down to tell Luke a story is so stupid. The movie is filled with expository dialogue and a prime example is in the opening of the movie when C3PO says \"Oh look it's Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.\" So stupid. Oh yeah and Boba Fett's death is so stupid.Jedi is a movie that is heavily flawed but still has some great moments and I simply cannot disregard it because of that.",

In the final movie of the trilogy we see George Lucas introduce an abundance of new characters throughout the film, such as the monster underneath Jabba the Hutt's lair, the kraken type sand monster, and the Ewoks.\nIn this final film of the trilogy we see the final battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth vader. This battle was inevitable and everybody who had seen the two previous movies would know that this scene was coming. The way that Lucas decided to do this was wonderful and at the end of all of it he reveals the true face of Darth Vader and proves Luke's point earlier in the movie that his father still had good left in him. Throughout the entire film I was just thinking about what could happen next and it kept me locked in the whole time. Lucas found a perfect way to execute the plot of the film and by doing this it made the film that much better for the die hard Star Wars fans. The way that every scene was well thought out and led up to the ending of the film was perfection.\nA key scene leading up to the end of the movie was when Luke went to go visit Yoda before he passed on. In this scene Luke gets closure about who his father is and who his sister is. This is one of the scenes from the film that ties loose ends from the previous two movies.\nOne negative thing I found within the film was that Yoda and Obi Wan Kinobi didn't have bigger roles. I was disappointed by this because of their roles in the previous two movies. In the eyes of die hard Star Wars fan this was seen as a little bit disrespectful and I was very disappointed by this.\nThe plot of the film leads up perfectly to the defeat of the emperor. It starts with Luke rescuing Princess Leia and Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt and then they go on too the planet where the death star power station where they meet the Ewok's and are nearly roasted to death by them. After this it's an uphill battle against the emperor and the dark side which is very entertaining and the battle scenes are very well played out, such as the battle between Luke and Vader. This scene was beautifully done and the different stages of the battle are amazing. The way that Lucas keeps the battle going and the dialogue throughout is special. It was the perfect way to end the ongoing battle between Vader and Luke. In the previous movie we see Luke have his arm chopped off by his father and he Doesn't end up getting killed by Vader. He had an opportunity to end it all their but since his father still had good in him he didn't. This is where Luke finds out that his father still has good in him and that's why he tries to pursue this relationship with his father because he knows with Vader on his side he will be able to defeat the emperor.\nThe scenery of the different planets throughout the movie is Beautiful and so well thought out by Lucas. It was as if he had visions of where the scene should be held and they were perfect. Another part of the movie that was executed very well was the music. Without music this movie would be terrible. The effect that music adds is incredible. Every fight seen when something is getting intense or it looks like the battle scene is going a different way the music help portray this.\nIn conclusion the movie Star Wars: Return of the Jedi was very well executed and was a perfect ending to one of the best trilogies known to humans. The plot sums up the ending perfectly while still maintaining the interesting battles and and cameos to characters throughout the movie.",

The movie is not bad, but it gets really good, with the 132 minute running time, the introduction of new characters, characters and everything else. The space fights and the lightsaber fights and the end of this film had a really good climax. My favorite scene in RETURN OF THE JEDI is the final fight between Luke and Vader.The acting is once again top-notch and this was a good conclusion, but I am glad Disney and Lucasfilm are now doing the sequel trilogy (Episodes VII - IX) and I really think that this was a great idea, because a lot of fans wanting these three since REVENGE OF THE SITH, came out in 2005.The music and visuals are once again good and the Special Edition made a few changes, but I still like both versions of this movie and the space sequences and the lightsaber duels could not have been worked out any better.So, overall, I love RETURN OF THE JEDI. I know this is the weakest of the original trilogy of films, but to me, it concluded the franchise and the original trilogy of films brilliantly and fantastically. There are major flaws, but I can still see why this is the best and worst of the trilogy. 10 out of 10.",

You would think that a kindergartener would get scared of all these aliens.  I wasn't!  The only thing that I was a little scared of was the Emporer (he certainly looks scary, doesn't he?). Another scary sight was seeing Darth Vader's face after Luke takes off his mask. We discover that Darth Vader's head looks like an egg. Well, over a decade has passed and this has really gotten to be a classic film that I enjoy watching.  This is sure to delight people for many generations to come.",

            "content": "A New Hope blew audiences away with original special effects and story telling.  The Empire Strikes Back blew audiences away again for doing the same thing at a superior level.  Return of the Jedi has come around to tie up all the loose ends the first two movies made.  The story, although similar to A New Hope, is not recycled.  The special effects are even better than Empire and they are the peak of that time.  The acting has stayed at the same level as Empire, which both are better than A New Hope.The acting in Return of the Jedi is about the same as Empire.  There aren't any real new changes except that Han Solo's character gets a bit softer as he realizes he does not need his gruff exterior among friends that love him. We also finally find out which side Lando is on.  However, the best addition and the best actor in Return of the Jedi is Ian McDiarmid, who plays the Emperor (aka Senator Palpatine, Darth Sidious).The story, while some say it is recycled from A New Hope (which it definitely is not), ties up loose ends.  The second Death Star is merely a backdrop for the main story of Vader and Luke.  In any case, the Death Star was already being built after the first one was destroyed, as a plan of the Emperors to destroy the Rebellion.  We get to see Luke, Chewie, Lando, and Leia go after Han Solo to rescue him.  Jabba the Hutt is wiped from the Universe, and they meet...the Ewoks....  I think the best plot in Jedi is the one with Luke, Vader, and the Emperor.  Luke tries to turn his father from the Dark Side and resist temptation from the Emperor.  It is the heart of the movie.Now, the Ewoks.  Like Jar-Jar, they have a hate cult.  Why?  I have never understood how people can have such a childish hate over fictional creatures.  They serve the purpose of the story.  The main reason is that the Ewoks overcoming the Empire's vast technology stretched believability. Maybe so, but hey, this is a sci-fi fantasy.  It was more fun to watch the Ewoks beat the crap out of the Stormtroopers.  Also, the Ewoks overcoming the Stormtroopers is more metaphorical.  Lucas always has a part in the Star Wars movies where technology fails, and it is up to the human (or alien) spirit to finish the job, not the technology (i.e., Luke when he destroyed the Death Star without a computer...).The ending of Jedi is the most rewarding of the trilogy, with a powerful and slam-bang ending to the best movie saga of all time.  Darth Vader becomes Anakin again, coming to his son's aid and destroying the Emperor, sacrificing his own life in the process.  There is just something rewarding seeing Anakin glimmer in the Force next to Yoda and Obi-Wan.  In all this is a good movie.  It is not the best Star Wars movie, but it is still Star Wars.  It still adds to the mythology, and therefore is a classic, Ewoks or no Ewoks.  However, I think the Jedi soundtrack is the best of the saga, so check it out.  See the whole trilogy! ***** stars (out of *****)",

            "review_title": "An Epic Conclusion To An Iconic Trilogy",
            "content": "\"Return of the Jedi\" is often regarded as the worst film of the original trilogy. I've never quite understood why the film gained its reputation as the relative \"black sheep\" of the original trilogy, as it's leaps and bounds better than \"A New Hope\" from a filmmaking standpoint. Maybe part of my love for \"Jedi\" is that I'm a sucker for trilogy conclusions, but even pushing that aside, this is not even CLOSE to a bad film in my eyes.The one legitimate criticism that I can understand for \"Jedi\" is that as good as it is, it could have been much better. It's a film oozing with potential, and I'd be lying if I said it didn't waste at least some of it. Killing \"Empire\" fan favorite Boba Fett practically immediately after his first appearance in \"Jedi\" along with giving him such an anticlimactic, lame and downright disrespectful demise is incredibly disappointing. We're told that Han's freezing in carbonite is dangerous enough to kill him, but when he's finally thawed out, he's at the worst slightly delirious. Wouldn't it be more dramatic and suspenseful to have him in wounded or even critical condition? And while I don't actually mind the Ewoks (I recognize they only exist to sell toys but...They're just so damn cute, I can't be mad at them!), the subplot with Han and Leia on Endor is somewhat distracting from the main redemption story of Darth Vader, and provides for some fairly jarring tonal shifts.However, apart from wasted potential and slightly off tone, \"Return of the Jedi\" is still a really good film. For starters, it's easily the best acted of the original trilogy. Mark Hamill brings an emotional depth and inner conflict to Luke only seen in small doses in \"Empire\" and \"Return\", with a script that really allows him to shine in the more emotional scenes with his father, Darth Vader. All in all, its a very passionate and intense performance and shows Hamill's growth as an actor over the course of the trilogy.Ian McDiarmid is positively perfect as the sinister and demented Emperor Palpatine. Like some of the best villains, McDiarmid is not only terrifying in his portrayal as the twisted intergalactic tyrant, he also has surprisingly good comedic timing when the film requires it of him. McDiramid is just having a blast playing this character as pure evil incarnate, nailing the infamous villain's insanity, vileness, charm and seductive nature. He's proof that sometimes bad can be oh so good. Palpatine as a character is a near perfect villain, by the way. His desire to defile and corrupt all that is good runs so deep, he's actually willing to DIE for the sake of evil. This makes for an excellent contrast of character for Luke, a character willing to die for the redemption and salvation of the fallen.James Earl Jones once again does phenomenal work as Darth Vader, getting to show Vader's human and loving side much more here than he did in \"Empire.\" That said, he never loses the subtlety that made his performance in that movie so impressive, and does an excellent job masking his broken heart and painful regret with the a seemingly ruthless and inhuman facade; directed not only at Luke, but at himself. The scene where he regretfully laments to his son Luke that it is \"too late\" for im is, in my opinion, the best acted scene from any actor in the entire original trilogy.The characters arcs here are concluded extremely well. It's extremely satisfying seeing Luke finally grown into a mature, fearless hero willing to suffer the ultimate sacrifice for his convictions and loved ones. The film also does an excellent job playing with the possibility of Luke's passion, much like his father, becoming his one-way trip to the Dark Side. Vader's character development is done perfectly as we see his inner conflict and desire for redemption grow stronger and stronger over the course of the movie. His self sacrifice in the film's climax to save his son is both immensely satisfying and painfully tragic. The Star Wars Original Trilogy has always had a consistent theme of hope and self sacrifice, so it is fitting for it to end in both themes' ultimate gesture. It is head and shoulders the most emotional scene of \"Episodes IV-VI\".The action scenes are among the most exciting of the trilogy. Suitably grand and laden with excellent special effects, the scale and weight of the action sequences and battles in this movie is as big as it gets for the original trilogy. They are all quite suspenseful and filled with tension as we desperately hope for our heroes to make it out alive. More than anything, this FEELS like the final installment of a trilogy.\"Return of the Jedi\" may not be the best \"Star Wars\" film. It may not be the best original trilogy film. It may have wasted some very large potential. But, regardless of its flaws, it is still an excellent, emotional, and above all satisfying movie that has aged like a fine wine over time.",

The special effects are superb and there are some great action sequences. The film is also at the end, genuinely moving. It's not a flawless film though, the Ewoks (spear carrying teddy bears) have always been criticised as a blatant merchandising gimmick, but they're not that bad, and I thought they were great when I was five. Also the acting is pretty poor in places, but that's par for the course with these films.I've lost count of how many times I have seen this films, but I still find it as exciting and fun today as I ever did, and that's the hallmark of a lasting film.

They didn't know how to fit Yoda into the storyline, so they kill him (He seemed perfectly healthy to me and all of a sudden, he's dead). They didn't know what new evil could the Empire come up with, so they throw us a recycled, uncomplete, Dead Star to blow up again. And finally, the hated teddy bear like Ewoks whose only purpose in the movie is to sell more toys. Darth Vader's redemption was too nice, too easy, too fast. Fortunately some very exciting action sequences (like the \"bike\" chase scene) save the film from being a cutefest.16 years later, George Lucas releases his god-awful Episode 1 The Phantom Menace which resembles more the shallowness of this film than the good points.Jedi is still a great movie, but unlike the previous two, can't stand on its own.",

The story line picks up from where The Empire Strikes Back left off at, but this movie has several events happen in order to fully conclude the classic trilogy. Think of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, so many events happen in that movie in order to conclude that trilogy, that is similar here, only this movie doesn't have as many endings.In this movie, Han Solo and Princess Leia are imprisoned by Jabba the Hut, and Luke needs to complete his training. That is the basic premise, but for those of you who somehow have avoided this movie for years, I won't spoil anything for you. There is plenty of action scenes, including a famous scene with hovering speeder bikes. Despite the greatness of this movie, the original Star Wars movie still remains the best one.In some ways, Star Wars took the same path that The Matrix took. If you look at The Matrix, the original was a ground breaking film and the sequels were nothing special. The original Star Wars trilogy was an awesome, groundbreaking trilogy, but the new sequels aren't anything special.Return of the Jedi has all of the great characters from the original movies.

I mean, that's what life is, a series of down endings. All \"Jedi\" had was a bunch of Muppets.\" Very many Star Wars fans agree heartily with Dante Hicks from \"Clerks\" on this one. They argue that primitive woodland creatures couldn't possibly defeat Empire Stromtroopers, and that Lucas added them just for the kids. Like he did with Jar Jar Binks sixteen years later.While I agree 100% about the moronic Jar Jar, I don't mind the Ewoks. I think most of the men who view \"Star Wars\" as more of a lifestyle than a movie can't stand the Ewoks primarily cause it remind them that this big part of their life is somewhat aimed at older children and pre-teens. It makes them feel somewhat embarrassed, geeky and childlike for loving \"Star Wars\" Of course, \"Star Wars\" isn't just a movie for children and teens, but it certainly isn't \"Rated R\" either. I first watched Lucas' masterpiece trilogy as a child, and found the Ewoks to be a welcome comic relief. In fact, I like \"Jedi\" as much as \"Empire\" and even more than the original movie. Every part of the last chapter for me is highly entertaining.Still, while I love it as much as the two other originals, I find the rating here on IMDb very appropriate. While Episode IV and V have universal acclaim among the fans, this last one has not for the reasons listed above.

            "content": "It is never easy being openly critical of a Star Wars movie. So many people first saw them when they were very young which creates a do no wrong attitude. But after all of the comments putting down Phantom Menace, I felt the need to be straight about the weakest of the Star Wars movies, Return of the Jedi.The beginning of Jedi involving the rescue of Han Solo is pretty good. This is a direct continuation of the Empire Strikes Back and fits well with the other two original movies. After this Jedi falls apart. Why?1. The second half of Jedi is a straight rehash of the last half of A New Hope, in which the good guys need to blow up the evil Death Star. This direct repeat takes away from the suspense of the movie. \n2. The acting is very uneven; Han Solo may be the favorite character for many in A New Hope and Harrison Ford is probably the most talented actor with a major role in ROTJ but he often seems out of place playing this new kinder, gentler guy. When Solo finds out Leia's true relationship with Luke, Ford's acting is so bad that I laugh every time I see it. The acting between Fisher and Hamill at the end is also very weak.  3. The Ewoks are a joke; In A New Hope in scene after scene one thing that is established clearly is that the Storm Troopers are a lethal military force. The idea that 4 foot tall creatures with stone tipped spears and arrows could defeat 20 fully armored, blaster carrying Storm Troopers much less a legion of them is so incredible that it ruins the believability of the middle to the ending of the film.4. The light saber battle has a big problem; There is no way that Luke Skywalker could defeat Darth Vader the way it occurs in Jedi. Mark Hamill's slow and monotonous sword strokes are supposed to force Vader to his knees. There is no physical reason for Vader to do this. Some people try to argue that it was Luke's use of the Force that defeats Vader. But they forget that Vader's connection with the Force is so strong that he is able to defeat the power of the Emperor. Fortunately, Lucas tried to improve this film. An excellent example is how he changed the original silly ending of ROTJ with its lame music and Mark Hamill's corny smile. Lukas' redone final two minutes are powerful and have the right mood. But Lucas' real fixing of Return of the Jedi is Phantom Menace. Phantom's plot is in some ways similar to Jedi, (for instance, both films start out with a negotiation meeting) But there are variety and style changes in Phantom. The villains of Phantom Menace are always mysterious and the motives of the enemy are clouded in politics and manipulation. There are moments of deep sadness in Phantom that is not undercut by life after death plot twists. Qui-Gon Jinn and Anakin's mother are tragic characters which have no direct counterpart in the original movies. The acting in Phantom while not great, unlike Jedi, is always good. This is due to Lucas' use of established actors; Neeson, McGregor and Portman. The fact is Hamill and Fisher never were successful outside of Star Wars films. Also the young Harrison Ford in Star Wars while good, had not yet polished his acting skills. Unlike the Ewoks, the Gungans in Phantom, in spite of having cartoon elements, are very believable as fighters and as characters. First this is due to the computer animation which is very realistic. But also the Gungan technology while called primitive, their energy weapons, shields and underwater city show a group that can hold their own in Star Wars.\nThe sword fighting in Phantom Menace is the best I have seen in any film including Rob Roy. Every second of the light saber duels in Phantom feels like a real struggle especially when compared to the battle between Luke and Vader in Jedi.Jedi has its good points. While Phantom is a much more polished movie, it does not have the thundering climaxes of Jedi. Phantom has intrigue and sadness but it lacks the intense father and son struggle in Jedi.\nReturn of the Jedi has spectacular special effects. It appeals to younger children and it also tries to show a hero's story of final triumph in a fantasy, science fiction world. The beginning of the movie blends these elements well. The second half falls down due to poor acting, unbelievable characters and a routine plot.",

The Empire Strikes Back was more of the same with more aliens until we arrive at Return Of The Jedi. By this installment, the story takes a backseat to the action & humor. In fact, the whole movie is played for laughs. The problem is the laughs involve the interaction of increasingly ridiculous aliens with increasingly ridiculous military machines. (Didn't they learn their lesson in the first movie to NOT build military transport vehicles with long legs? No, because they're back again, this time with a model sporting silly rabbit legs.) The special effects are shockingly cheesy involving a lot of blue screen, bad stop action animation on par with the Godzilla of the 30's, and Muppets. The story has dissolved into a soap opera with Vader turning out to be Luke's father & Luke actually believing that Darth Vader has some empathy in him, when Vader is supposed to be the epitome of evil, and the discovery of long lost family ties that are never explained. (Let's just say it's a good thing Luke never lay'd Leia in the first 2 flicks.) Just when you think the rebellion is finished (what with only Luke & the Princess remaining), all of the sudden, at the end, they have a huge fleet of fighters again. Where did they get the recruits? Where did they get the financing? Who the hell is in charge?? And always, there are those stupid white-armored troops running around shooting everything who are so inept, they only manage to wing Princess Leia by the 3rd movie. Their amour couldn't stop a spit ball. By the end of the movie, you'll be wishing the new Death Star will hurry up & blow up OR the Empire will finally beat down the rebellion once & for all & make Leia Darth Vader's sex slave or something. And c'mon: a showdown with the supreme bad guy who can kill a person with psychic energy shooting out of his fingers? That's so B-movie clich\u00e9d. The dude's psychic energy turned out not to be very strong when he is killed just be being thrown down an elevator shaft by Mr. Vader himself. A real eye-rolling moment.At least it's better than the 4th, er, that is, 1st episode (whatever) which is sleep inducing.",

It is technically superior to both A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, and features a full circle in the characterizations of Luke, Han and Leia, and most especially Darth Vader.

All together concludes with a golden key to the magnificent trilogy.....but unfortunately the movie nearly surpasses its magnificent predecessor.\"Return\" begins months after the events of the previous film with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) imprisoned in the palace of his great rival Jabba the Hutt. Luke (Mark Hamill) begins a rescue plan sending the droids R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C - 3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) as bait while Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando (Billy Dee Williams) come infiltrated, Lando as soldier and Leia as bounty hunter. Soon after the great rescue, the group joins with the rebels and begins to know that the Empire is rebuilding the battleship \"Death Star\" under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) and begin to dominate the galaxy. The rebels now begin a massive plan to destroy the \"Death Star\" and finally put an end to the war. But Luke, with the instruction of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), knows that Vader is not the monster that appears to be and begins to try to bring him to the good side of the \"force\". Such a task will be difficult with the cruel Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) controlling the mind of Vader with the dark side of the force strong in his side.The film never gets to be awful or terrible, as I said before, Lucas and his coworkers end the trilogy perfectly but the film suffers from a serious problem. Since the beginning of the film to the last moment with Yoda (unfortunately) the film flowed superbly, well written and directed by keeping the humor and well action packed. BUT, suddenly the plot jumped to the Rebel base nor explains how Han is feeling after his rescue and now we see very quickly the plan of attack against the Empire. And soon after, we see our beloved crew in the immense forest of Endor entering into a tense action sequence, the action is not a bad thing at all but the rush that the script took over there has a huge problem of narrative that in the end really hurt the film, but everything is reward with a thrilling and exciting final act.Even with a certain problem in the script at the 2nd act, \"Return of the Jedi\" is a worthy conclusion to one of the best trilogies ever made, thanks to Lucas that since the beginning redefined the genre of sci - fi forever giving her unforgettable characters with an incredible evolution; thanks to stunning visuals effects giving stunning and unforgettable scenarios;, thanks to John Williams with his unforgettable and powerful soundtrack. The trilogy that not only gave us absolute entertainment and genuinely tense moments, but also taught us that we can always reach our dreams just fighting, we all despite the problems and sins can redeem us and that if we all get together despite our different races can destroy all the forces of evil. \"Return of the Jedi\" doesn't surpasses its predecessors, but is a thrilling and epic conclusion to the trilogy that changed cinema forever.9/10",

I think it works because the ewoks look so cute and don't look like a threat but they are underestimated because they are resourceful with what they have and the fact they are little fighters who will defend their home even if they don't have the resources the empire have.I do think it is a bit creepy to find out that Leia and Luke are brother and sister especially after them kissing in The Empire strikes back.What I have problems with is the ending where Vader is supposed to turn Luke over to the emperor but kills the emperor instead after he sees his son being tortured. It is hard to belief that this man who chopped his son's hand off would finally do something good and save his son.It is compelling when Luke takes Vader's helmet off because for the first two films he hid himself behind this mask and imposing presence and then to see him as a weak and feeble person is shocking.The film ends on a high note, good has won and Luke has managed to save his father's soul before he died.

It begins with C3PO and R2D2 visiting Jabba the Hutt. They find Captain Solo (Harrison Ford) still in carbonite. Chewabacca (Peter Mayhew) is captured, along with Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who was incognito as a renegade bounty hunter. It is up to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to save the day. As a real Jedi, he is able to confound Jabba's men, destroy his barge, and rescue Leia, Han, Lando, and Chewie. The remaining two-thirds of the film deal with the final rebel assault against a new Death Star. Emperor Palpatine himself oversees the project with Darth Vader. As Luke and Han launch an attack to take out the defense shield from the moon of Endor, they meet some strange friends, the Ewoks. This leads to rollicking fun, great space battles, action sequences, awesome special effects, and Luke's temptation to join the dark side. I did have a few gripes with this movie. I know Lucas originally wanted to have the Ewok battle originally done with Wookies. I wished he would have stuck to that because the idea of stone-throwing teddy bears warring against storm troopers strained credibility. The only other strike was not introducing us to Emperor Palpatine sooner. He is only mentioned in the first Star Wars movie, and we do get a holographic image of him in the Empire Strikes Back ... but as the true master of evil he should have been brought in earlier. Nevertheless, Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie overthrow the Empire once and for all, restoring balance to the force and allowing good to triumph over evil. If only more movies could do that better.",

The new Death Star is kind of disappointing. I wish they used their obviously incredible imaginations to come up with a better home base. Some of the coolest bad guys are defeated in stupid ways. Don't even get me started on how Boba Fett gets beaten. And while the Ewoks are cute and cuddly, i would have preferred Wookies or some kind of big warriors for the final battle. These are really minor complaints be cause the action is awesome and the Emperor and Han Solo are great. But of course Vader rules them all.

            "review_title": "My Favorite Film of All Time",
            "content": "This is my favorite movie of all time! Return of the Jedi is a perfect film. It starts off on Tatooine where we finally get to see see Luke as a Jedi Knight. We get an incredible action scene at Jabba's Palace. Luke defeats a Rancor and then destroys the entire barge (We wanted to see Luke wreck havoc for a long time and finally got it).We then get to see Yoda one last time in a great emotional scene where Yoda confirms that Luke is indeed Vader's father and passes away. We then realize that we must go to Endor to shut the shield generator down to destroy Death Star II. When we get to Endor we get one of the best scenes in the entire movie. We get a very suspenseful speeder bike chase. The visual effects and sound in these scenes are truly some of the best in the entire trilogy. We then meet the most controversial part about the original trilogy and that is the ewoks. I personally love the ewoks, it is about the over lapping story of David vs. Goliath. Don't let anybody fool you, these things are pure evil. During the film you will see them trying to eat our main hero's, kill stormtroopers, beat on the decapitated stormtroopers heads as drums at the end of the film.But the reason this film sets it apart from the other films is the ending, we get the best ending of any film ever. It cuts from Lando and Nien Nunb flying the falcon with the rebellion trying to destroy the second death star, which is still no doubt the best space battle ever put to cinema to Han, Chewbacca, and Leia on Endor fighting with the ewoks to get the shield generator down, to the ultimate climax of the series when we see Luke confronting Vader and the Emperor. The dialog between the Luke and The Emperor in these scenes are top notch and the best in the trilogy. This then turns into a great duel between Luke and Vader! Luke besting Vader this time around now that he is a Jedi Knight. Luke cuts Vader's arm off and realizes that if he lets his emotions get the best of him and kills his father, he will be no better than Vader and become just like him. The Emperor then aging Luke on to kill Vader, Luke turns around throws his lightsaber and says \"You failed your highness, I am a jedi like my father before me!\" This is my favorite line because Luke has overcome the dark side and beaten the Emperor. The Emperor after failing to convert Luke to the dark side try's to kill him by electrocuting him. Vader is watching the Emperor do this to his own son and you see Luke crying out to his father to save him, you see the conflict in Vader as he looks back and forth from Luke to Vader he then redeems himself and saves Luke by picking up the Emperor and throwing him over the rail to his death. In this process Vader was electrocuted by the Emperor and we see that he is about to die. We then see Luke carry Vader's body to his ship to try and escape the death star II before it explodes. Vader tells Luke the he wants to see him without the mask. Vader then tell's Luke that he was right. We then see Luke have a pyro burial for his father and he is the only one in attendance, that was always extremely powerful for me. Luke then goes and celebrates with Han, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando, Wedge, R2D2, and C- 3PO on their impossible victory over the Empire.This is truly the best ending anyone could have asked for and the best redemption story ever put to the big screen while finishing the greatest trilogy of all time! In Return of the Jedi I always would like to point out that the music from John Williams is incredible just like it is in his other films, but also the acting from the cast is the strongest in this film. Please definitely give this a watch and thank you so much Richard Marquand for creating my favorite film of all time!",

            "content": "As a child, this was always my favorite within the original trilogy of films. I suspect it was because of how often the lightsaber is used throughout the course of \"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\". I specifically remember always being horrified by what Darth Vader looked like underneath his helmet. Spoiler alert: we finally see him unmasked, after all of the teasing George Lucas gave us in \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\".Han Solo is still frozen in carbonite at the beginning of this film, and there is a rescue action sequence for the first twenty minutes of the film (which is very, very exciting). Luke Skywalker has now become a Jedi Knight, and he is coming to save Han, his now longtime friend. Meanwhile, the Empire has almost finished building the second Death Star. The gang of heroic rebels must defeat the Empire in this finale to the \"Star Wars\" film saga.Like the latter two films, the performances are excellent in this movie. Luke has changed so much since the beginning of the trilogy that he is almost unrecognizable now. At the same time, I find Luke a much more compelling character in this film, because we see even more layers of him. There isn't much more to say when it comes to the acting, for all of the actors shine through in many, many ways. Even Lando (played by Billy Dee Williams) is fantastic in this movie.The special effects are--as always--phenomenal. I feel like the whole green lightsaber debate amongst fans is silly, but I must add my own two cents: I find the green (or somewhat lime) lightsaber color very extravagant and gorgeous. It is by far my favorite lightsaber design--hilt and blade together--in the entire six-film saga. Space battles and flying teddy bears look a little silly, most of the time, but they are still able to be overlooked for the very fantastic writing and dialogue.I'd say that this film remains my favorite for the fact that the message to it is outstanding. We all struggle with the dark side of mankind. This film gives an excellent portrayal of such an ideology.The writing of \"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\" is enthralling, to say the least. I have to somewhat dislike the Endor scenes, but it was a nice change of scenery from the first two films. We have never had a jungle sequence, and I feel there was nowhere else to go. I also believe that many people would not hate this film (or sequence) if the Ewoks weren't a part of the film. I can relate. However, the dialogue is great in the film--and the events are just as great. I must say that the final duel between Luke and Vader gives me constant chills due to the acting, swordplay, and soundtrack.On another note that I always seem to forget in my \"Star Wars\" film reviews, the soundtrack is beautiful, especially within this film.When it comes to the set designs, I must compliment whoever built them. They did a fine job creating all kinds of realistic places. In all honesty, I feel like this film does a better job than any of the others when it comes to making the viewer feel like they are in a completely new world. It's very entrancing.Overall, I can't NOT give \"Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi\" a full ten-out-of-ten stars. The film has been my life since I was an infant, and I see how glorious it is, even in my adult years. This is brilliant cinema.Merry Christmas, and God bless!",

Although it is highly entertaining and wildly inventive, due to the abrupt ending of The Empire Strikes Back, this movie suffers.The rescue mission at the beginning of Episode 6 is grossly entertaining. We get to see Jabba the Hutt, the gangster of Tattooie and his loyal band of goons. And we get a gladiator-esque battle between Luke and a Rankor. Plus we get a scene over a giant sand monster and a grand rescue, and the thing most remembered, Princess Leia in a bikini (a very nice one I might add).But this whole scene feels like run-off from the uncompleted Empire Strikes Back. And this whole rescue event stunts the development of the actual story in Return of the Jedi. After the rescue mission the 2nd attack of the Rebel Alliance on the new Death Star just seems like something they threw together, like the Rebels just woke up and were like: \"Gee Bob, what are you going to do today?\" \"Well Jim, I was going to mow the lawn and take the kids to the zoo, why do you ask?\" \"Well I was just wondering, I really felt like getting the gang together and destroying the new Death Star, before they blow us up.\" \"Oh, that sounds cool, let's call them up and see what we can do!\"Of course the worst thing that suffers is the conflict between Vader and Luke. Darth Vader's redemtion and demise were so rushed it was just pulled out of the blue.Despite what anybody says, I like the Ewoks. I know that Lucas originally planned them all to be primitave Wookies, but that would have been boring, because a army of Wookies would have no problem taking down Stormtroopers. Plus he would have had to explain how Chewbacca got so smart and trained.Everything else in the movie is great, the third time around all of the actors were most comfortable and in character. The plot opened up many secrets, and even made references to the current prequels making it more fun to watch after seeing Episodes 1 & 2.Anyway I can say that this is a slightly rushed, but highly fun and worthy conclusion to the Star Wars saga, and a must see movie for anyone who hasn't seen it.",

Will Luke Skywalker face Darth Vader a second time?Who is the mysterious Emperor? And what will be the final outcome between the Rebellion and the Imperial Forces? When i saw the film at the Odeon Cinema in the summer of 1983 as a boy i thought it was a brilliant ending for the Star Wars Trilogy, now that i'm older and wiser i can see that 'Episode Six' is full of half-baked acting, a kind of 'Let's get this movie over with i'm fed up' attitude from Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, moments that are mean't to be moving (like Yoda's death Scene) drag on forever and many more problems.One of the flaws is the lack of threat from Darth Vader, so imposing and powerful in The Empire Strikes Back, here he is reduced in screen time and only really comes alive again during the three way confrontation on the Death Star with Luke and the Emperor, which in my own opinion is the best part in the entire film.Also the Death Star space battle with the rebel fighters is brilliant as well, but i will be damned if i like those stupid Ewoks, which were invented to find an audience that loved the Muppet Show.George Lucas should have stuck to his original concept of Chewbacca's race: the Wookies. Instead he has silly little furry care bears. Think about it! legions of Stormtroopers versus marauding Wookies and laser blasting Rebels on Endor? Talk about lost potential!Return of the Jedi also has a terrible bad acting exchange of dialogue moment between Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams.It occurs just before Solo leaves for Endor he says 'Look i want you to take her' meaning the Millennium Falcon, Lando replies 'Don't worry Buddy, she won't get a scratch!' Ford turns away trying to express uncertainty at William's promise and almost stammers 'I gotcha promise now? Not a scratch right?' William's moos like a cow by exclaiming 'WOOUULD YOUUU GET GOOINNG YA PIRATE?'It looks like they used a rehearsed take on the actors rather than try to make it more convincing.That is evidence that there was a lack of conviction on this film, unlike The Empire Strikes Back where you see great performances as well as bang for your buck.But still, Return of the Jedi is a satisfying conclusion if not on a par with a New Hope and Empire to the trilogy.It is ten billion times better than the Phantom Menace.",

            "content": "\"Return of the Jedi'' completes the epic \"Star Wars'' cycle with the final destruction of the Empire and the inevitable face-off between Luke Skywalker and the evil Darth Vader, now revealed, as we surmised, to be his father. The film has a tone of its own. If \"Star Wars'' was a brash space opera and \"The Empire Strikes Back'' was a visual feast, \"Return of the Jedi'' is a riot of character intervention.If I had to choose, I would say this is the least of the Star Wars films. It lacks the startling originality of the first two. It's more concerned with loose ends and final resolutions. It was the correct decision for George Lucas to end with a trilogy and then move to another point in time for the continuation of the saga. To return to these characters a fourth time would destroy the mythic structure of the story and turn it simply into a series.At the end of it all, after the three movies, we've taken an epic fantasy journey. Lucas has in common with all great storytellers the ability to create a complete world. These films may spring from space opera, science-fiction and Saturday serials, but they are done so superbly that they transcend all genres and become a reverberating place in our imaginations.At the end, what are we left with? Marvelous sights: The two Death Stars, the lumbering war machines on the snow planet, space warfare, the desert monster, buccaneering action. Marvelous sounds: the voices of Darth Vader, Jabba and the chirpy little R2-D2. And an idea-- the Force--that in encompassing everything may, perhaps, encompass nothing, and conceal another level above, or beneath. \"Return of the Jedi\" is fun, magnificent fun. The movie is a complete entertainment, a feast for the eyes and a delight for the fancy. It's a little amazing how Lucas and his associates keep topping themselves.",

The scene where the biker scout gets tapped on the back as a distraction was really stupid. But that doesn't ruin the great experience this film is. This movie has as much action as the previous Star Wars films combined. It has everything: a space armada battle (lacking in Empire), a spectacular lightsaber duel, blaster battles, out-of-this-world creatures, humour and pace. There is also no lack of drama with the developed friendship between the main characters and Luke finally discovering his destiny. The ending could not have been better and was very satisfying.A lot of people tend to forget what sets Star Wars so much apart from  every other movie: design. There's so much design, of spaceships, vehicles, backdrops, numerous aliens, characters and outfits..and it's all brilliant, it's art! It's what makes the Star Wars universe so unique and such a wonderful place for people to spend some time in. But people, including the \"intellectual\" film critics, are blind to this and all they can do is complain. How onedimensional. 10 out of 10",

A little lacklustre in comparison to the others with the ewoks and C3P0 taking up a lot of valuable time when we could've been seeing more battles with the Rebels against the Empire and even when the final battle begins nothing of interest really happens making this film sort of lacklustre in my opinion. Though the climax is legendary and the trilogy ends on a victorious scale the film did have it's flaws and was a little less enjoyable then even \"Revenge of the Sith\"Rating C+",

Some are better than others, some are disadvantages. Alien creatures got much more screen time here, and with the way this franchise handles them, it isn't a very good thing. On the one hand, the big scene near the beginning uses all those different puppets well, big or small, funny or ugly, there is even a huge monster here. And since they are all in this one place that belongs to an evil crime lord, it makes sense they would look somewhat unpleasant. This is a bad place, and the heroes are nicely contrasted to how hostile and even scary it may be. Alien creatures are not the strongest aspect of \"Star Wars\", they can even be viewed as a problem. But \"Return of the Jedi\", in this one particular scene, manages to benefit from it. But then, on the other hand, there are those little furry teddy bears on the forest planet. Not only do they look cartoonish and childish, they also serve a very implausible purpose in the plot. Many hate the \"gungans\" from \"The Phantom Menace\", of course, and yes, they were cartoonish as well, but they were made using advanced visual technology, and they were an intelligent civilization with enough tools and weapons to be a serious force. Also, there are those silly walkers here again, only smaller, and the design is way different this time, a more mobile one, thankfully.The visuals deserve a little criticism in general. Of course, green forest is more beautiful than a desert, or an icy desert, or a dark swamp, but the forest action scenes, apparently, rely heavily on rear projection, and that does not look as good as one would hope.All that said, the movie does not fail. There is a lot of outer space here, and it looks amazing. The final battle is easily the best in the original trilogy. And that is a big advantage for this movie. But what truly drives it is the story it tells. Some would point out the similarities to \"Episode IV\", while they are not there to copy something. They are there to build on that which came before. That goes for the plot in general. It uses the material built and developed across the three movies, it is a satisfying conclusion. Leia, Han and Luke have made quite a significant journey. They all are different persons by the end of this story. Not to mention how the movie treats the villains, the strongest villains in the whole saga.\"Return of the Jedi\" may have a handful of things to criticize for good reason, but none ruin either the visuals or the tale. Speaking of the tale, what should be mentioned is the pacing of the story here. It does not rely heavily on shooting, fighting or blowing things up, and has plenty of room to breathe and shine.",

This is largely because it makes greater use of exciting and suspenseful action sequences, and has less of the verbosity that bogged down The Empire Strikes Back.  Luke Skywalker is now a fully trained Jedi Knight and, in a stretching of credibility, has transformed from a petulant youth into a master of Zen-like tranquility.  However, he is soon thrust back into the action when he is called on to rescue his friends from the clutches of the infamous mercenary, Jabba the Hutt.  Luke manages to outwit and kill Jabba's resident monster, but is not in time to save Carrie Fisher from being forced to don revealing underwear and chains.  Yes, really.  After narrowly avoiding death-by-Sarlacc (in whose belly one would \"find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years\") the group of friends race off to engage in warfare with their ultimate enemy - the Emperor - and his deputy Darth Vader.      In the event though, Luke's most difficult battle is with himself, because as Vader tells him, ad infinitum, it is impossible to resist the power of the Dark Side.  Meanwhile Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, C3PO, R2D2 and assorted others are attempting to destroy the impressive and aptly named Death Star before the Imperial forces crush the Rebel Alliance.  In the end, the viewer will be caught up in the euphoria of the enthusiastic celebration party thrown by the rebels and the cute 'n' fuzzy ewoks, but they may also find themselves with a sneaking suspicion of relief that the epic saga is finally finished.",

            "content": "This final entry in George Lucas's STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.The first third of the movie, where Luke and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, is a classic. Jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabba's court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster. It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where Luke discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks. Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that I've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. I don't totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. However, their leader, Wicket (played by Warrick Davis) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.By the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops, Lando and the Rebel Forces launching an attack against the Empire's all-new half-completed Death Star, and Luke's final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor. The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. Mark Hamill flexes his acting chops once again as Luke Skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured Jedi Knight makes for an unforgettable performance. Also, as iconic as James Earl Jones' voice as Darth Vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like Emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by Ian McDiarmid. The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. Of course, given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. The acting is classic STAR WARS fare; Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all mature and deepen into their roles, and Anthony Daniels provides more hilarious moments as C-3PO. Frank Oz's Yoda only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it. And yes, there's also John Williams' music.All told, while RETURN OF THE JEDI falters a little bit in the middle, the first and third acts deliver in style, making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.In 1997, George Lucas re-released the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored (and revamped) \"Special Editions\", which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements. Of the three, RETURN OF THE JEDI appears to have caused the most commotion with STAR WARS fans. Perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you're not so easily offended) \"Jedi Rocks\" musical number in Jabba's Palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film. However, I DID like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. This DVD version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on Naboo, where we hear what sounds like Jar Jar Binks screaming, \"Wesa free!\"), and, in what is probably the most controversial change, Hayden Christensen as the specter of Anakin Skywalker in the closing scenes. Probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. However, if you're watching the STAR WARS saga chronologically (and contemplating about it), chances are you may react a little differently. Nonetheless, it is an issue that fans have raised, so it's probably best to be warned beforehand.As nice as it would be to have Lucas release the original versions of these three classic films, he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the \"definitive\" editions of his classic trilogy, and, when viewing the STAR WARS movies altogether as one complete saga (as Lucas intended), it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. The original films will always be engraved in our memories, but these new incarnations are just as much fun, if one can give them a chance.",

            "review_title": "Very entertaining but flawed finale.",
            "content": "Firstly, this is a very entertaining film. However, it doesn't reach the heights of the previous two films as story decisions seem to have been influenced by merchandising opportunities and performances by some of the cast are not convincing. The films first 40 minutes is absolutely thrilling, clearly setting up the situations of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, as well as the final confrontation between the Rebel Alliance and the forces of the Empire, led by Ian McDiarmid in a terrific performance as Emperor Palpatine. It is the trio of Palpatine, Vader (physically played by David Prowse, stuntman Bob Anderson and veteran actor Sebastian Shaw, and voiced superbly by James Earl Jones) and Luke Skywalker (well played by Mark Hamill) that hold the rest of the film together and this 3 way confrontation gives this film is heart and dramatic punch. The director this time around is Richard Marquand, whose previous experience was a couple of low budget, dramatic British films focusing in performances of the actors rather than big set pieces. Most of the action sequences were either visual effects sequences done by Lucas's ILM company or shot by the second unit directors David Tomblin and George Lucas himself. However Marquand seemed to understand what the real dramatic meat of the story was, and arc of the Emperor, Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader where most of his energy seems to have gone into, and in this regard it was well worth it. These scenes play out with the drama and tension they need to, and make for a thrilling and emotional climax to the trilogy. It is also fascinating to watch the sub-relationships in this trio, the Vader vs Palpatine, Vader vs Skywalker and Palpatine vs Skywalker, which build particularly on events set up in the previous film. Hamill turns in a solid performance, and is best in the scenes with Vader, Palpatine and his brief re-unifications with Yoda and Obi Wan Kenobi, again played with grace and gravitas by Frank Oz and Alec Guinness respectively.However, the other characters were given less development. Carrie Fisher was used more as eye candy in the first third of the film, and her character is far more passive and less interesting this time round. In the previous film, the romantic m\u00e9nage a trois that is hinted at in Episode V is not explored to the fullness that it could have been. Finding out that Luke is Leia's brother doesn't come off as with the impact it should. Harrison Ford's character is similarly just along for the ride, and both him and Fisher seem less interested this time around, and their performances are either bland or too broad. Plans to kill some of these characters off, particularly Han Solo, would have been a bolder and more dramatic choice and would have built on some of the drama that we saw in Episode V and would see in spades some 22 years later in Episode III. In fact the characters of Han Solo, Princess Leia, R2D2, C3P0 and even Luke Skywalker all suffer because of the decision to have them entangle with a bunch of silly saccharine teddy bears called Ewoks. It seems a decision was made to aim the film at a new, much younger audience, which would buy lots of toys, rather than acknowledging the previous audience, which would have been growing up watching these films. After all, it makes a mockery of stormtroopers with loads of high tech sci-fi technology being bettered by Teddy Bears with rocks and stones! However, the space battle sequences, which is where Billy Dee Williams Lando character ends up (though no proper explanation is given how this outsider who struck a deal with the Empire would be let in so easily by the Rebel Alliance) works well as one of the secondary plots. ILMs work was again outstanding. Not surprisingly Richard Edlund collected his 4th Academy Award for visual effects (having been previously honoured for his work on the previous 2 Star Wars Films and Raiders of the Lost Ark), Dennis Muren collected his 3rd Academy Award, having previously won for Empire Strikes Back and ET. He would go on to win further Academy recognition with the films Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doon, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2, and the outstanding digital work on Jurassic Park. Ken Ralston one his first Academy Award on this film, and would go on receive more for his work on Cocoon, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Death Becomes Her and Forrest Gump. Veteran Stop-Motion Artist Phil Tippett won his first Academy Award on this film, would also win a second for his work on Jurassic Park. The shortcomings highlighted previously are also masked by other outstanding technical contributions. Alan Hume's photography is stylish, particularly the scenes on Dagobah and in the Emperor's residence on the Death Star. The editing team of Sean Barton, Dwayne Dunham, Marcia Lucas and George Lucas did a terrific job of creating a wonderfully paced film, that moves so quickly the flaws whizz by and its only when you think about this film afterwards do you realise that there were some serious issues. Norman Reynolds set design is yet again superb. John Williams who possibly is the artist who most understands these films, producing a wonderfully emotional and exciting score. Unfortunately the later digital enhancements went too far in Episode VI. While for the most part they are fine, the decision to replace Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christensen, was in my view a major error and for me spoils the ending. After all, how could Luke Skywalker relate to this apparition? It would have been better to leave the original actor in, of if a change was warranted, why not an older Mark Hamill or even a morph of Hayden Christensen and Hamil? Overall an entertaining but flawed finale.",

Producer Gary Kurtz left the series when George Lucas decided to wrap up the story in six films, originally three. Franky I don't think Jedi could be any better. Out story starts where five left off, they have to rescue Han from the slimy Jabba. A well-handled if slightly silly Jabba's Palace does feature princess Leia at her sexiest, in fact its about as sexy as Star Wars gets. Once Han is saved its off to the plot, Luke has accepted that Darth is his father once a dying Yoda confirms it. Hamill (Luke) is so good in these scenes that it still amazes me, Yoda's death is just so sad! And Yoda tells him there is another Skywalker, he's not alone! Luke uses the force to divine that Leia is his sister. Still how to tell her, and obviously reveal to her that Vader is her father too, is delicate to do. Luke, Han and the rest of the rebels hook up on Endor to take out the Emperor once and for all. He is building a new Death star and the galaxy will not be safe till this dark lord of the Sith is dead. But to do that Luke must kill Vader. It's something he cannot do. On Endor we are introduce to fuzzy, cuddly Ewoks, lovable teddy bears who make up in courage what they lack in size. I loved the Ewoks, Wickett was just great! It sup to Han and Laie, no rather deeply in love, to clear the way for the assault on the Death Star. In the lovely tree top village of the Ewoks Luke tells Leia the truth, Darth is their father, she his sister and he must try to bring Vader back to the good side of the Force. This is the great theme of Star WArs and most fantasy, Good redeems its own, evil turns upon itself.Aboard the Death STar, Luke tries to find the good left in his Father, even Obi-Wan thinks its too late. \"He's more machine than man now, twisted and evil\" But Luke knows he was Annakin Skywalker, a great Jedi and only the evil of the Emperor Palpatine has turned him cold. The final battle between Luke and Darth is epic and emotional and only Luke's refusal to give in to the dark side, so well personified by Ian MacDiarmid as Palpatine, his eyes glow red!, gives Darth the strength to save his son and kill the Sith. Wowza! Of course Han has succeeded too and the Death STar is about to blow, Luke is trying to save his battered and dying Father when in one of the most tearful scenes ever for me, DArth says, \"Its too late for me, my son. Luke, help me take this mask off.\" Luke-\"but you'll die\" \"Nothing can stop that now, just for once, let me look on you with my own eyes.\" \"Luke, tell your sister you were right, you were right about me.\" \"I'll not leave you here I've got to save you!\" \"You already have my son\" If you don't cry your'e legally dead. Luke gets Annakin's body off and then in a the old Jedi way, for Luke is a Jedi now, like his father before him, he cremates Darth as the galaxy celebrates the death of the Emperor. John Williams original score for this film was great, the celebratory final scene is a fitting cap to the six films and I loved seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and Annakin reunited in the Force, Luke sees them and winks, its like a wink to the audience too, we did it! Good triumphed and evil is gone. Jedi is a great flick with characters we've all come to love. Well worth watching again and again.",

            "content": "Trying to live up to two of the greatest films ever put to screen is an impossible feat. Trying to conclude the trilogy and live up to everyone's expectations is impossible as well. I think the real reason people view this film as bad is because of just how perfect the previous two were and this couldn't live up to them. By no means is this a bad film, hell it's spectacular, but when compared to the original and The Empire Strikes Back, Richard Marquand's ending film, to a phenomenal trilogy, is perhaps the most fun and most interesting film of the entire franchise.Starting off in possibly one of the greatest places in the entire series, the introduction of our characters in Jabba's palace is pure Star Wars; with it's techno music, cool catchers, and intense interactions. I really actually love the first half hour of this film, it had everything I wanted, like the return of all these characters and their story, the brilliant action, and the awesome Jabba. Everything after the first few minutes is an up and down roller coaster from epic scenes to less than disappointing moments.The real power of Return of the Jedi comes from the characters. Mark Hamill brings a more darker root to Luke and he plays him perfectly. I really love just seeing him on screen and doing Jedi things, really brings out the inner nerd in me. Carrie Fisher brings in another great performance as Princess Leia, in perhaps her most emotional and compelling performance yet. Harrison Ford I feel just always gets better; in the original he's so cocky, in Empire Strikes Back he's just cool and amazing, and here he continues this and becomes the best thing that the series has ever brought us. His chemistry with, not only Leia, but Luke as well really feels real and brings them together once more and it's just fantastic to see.The arc between Luke and Darth Vader really brings the film down from it's campy vibe and shows real emotion and a more \"darker\" approach to them. It really feels like two films leading up to it and the lay off is so worth it. The confrontation between Luke, Vader, and The Emperor are some of the best scenes throughout the trilogy and I just love seeing it in screen. The really impact the film, and the galaxy for that matter, in a great way and truly shows the saga coming to an \"end.\" It's really raw and shows the true emotion that they bring. I always see people hate on the Emoks and I just don't get it. Sure some of the things they do are kinda dumb but overall they don't really affect the film as a whole to me, and they are somewhat likable sometimes.The film really feels grand. It's not as deep as The Empire Strikes Back, but it just feels fantastic. The epic set pieces bring the film up a level and the action doesn't let up. There isn't really a dull moment in the film and that's special when viewing these films. From the space battles to the Endor ground fight, it's build up and it unfolds perfectly. Every moment I keep falling in love with. The Endor battle especially is really fun to watch, because despite some weird choices Marquand really understood how to use special effects to his advantage and allowed the film to have a real feel to it. The speeder bike scenes always bring a smile to my face, and the Ewoks throwing rocks makes me laugh, so you can say the action is plenty enjoyable.There really wasn't anyway that this could've lived up to the previous two films, but Return of the Jedi is still an enriching and emotional film with great set pieces and fantastic action. The combination of many layers of filmmaking and the ability to conclude a fantastic trilogy, really make Richard Marquand and underrated director. This is my least favorite of the original trilogy, there's no denying that, and while the film showcased some great scenes, Jabba's Palace, final saber fight, and the Han/Leia moments, Richard Marquands epic and truly mesmerizing fun conclusion to a spectacular trilogy, Return of the Jedi gets a lot of flak, and while it's somewhat child-like, the film oozes with beauty and action.",

The ending cranks up the action a bit, but it's all so poorly choreographed (more obvious on repeated viewings). Oh and the acting... and the dialogue. Pure cheese... and not in a good way.

Jabba himself is a delightful creation. Fortunately Yoda, who I found annoying in Empire, only has minimum involvement. There are humorous moments, romance & valour. The Ewoks have the right blend of cuteness & savagery. You can also watch them in \"Caravan of Courage\" & \"Battle for Endor\". The cartoon is good too. Most of the aliens are fun to view, although I was less than impressed with those accompanying Lando.

            "review_title": "The soul of Star Wars",
            "content": "More than any other film in the entire 9 episode 'main series', Return of the Jedi captures, in my opinion, the soul of the story. That soul is the innate need of all peoples to resist tyranny in order to reclaim a free society.The Story of Star Wars largely focuses on Anakin Skywalker and his family, the superheros who are the jedi, and the battle of good and evil. However, if you didn't see ROTJ, then you might miss that this is a battle that has consequences for everyone. We see a microcosm of that via Luke in ANH when he sees his aunt and uncle murdered, and likewise we see in both ANH and ESB that this fight is not just for the jedi, but also for the common people of the galaxy. They are as oppressed as anyone, and it is they who stand to lose the most, just like the jedi, if the empire is retained.Something the entire trilogy does a good job of, and much better than either the prequels or the sequels, is showing that struggle of the common people. As I say, this is the soul of Star Wars, and ROTJ does the best job of it in its final act. In this final act, we see a long cast of memorable characters, some of whom are even named, and many of whom even have dialogue, and who are visually distinctive from each other. One of them (Wedge) is even a character we previously saw in both ANH and ESB, so there is even continuity here.There are also the Ewoks- the characters everyone loves to hate. But, I argue that they are also representing that soul of struggle against oppression. They are the indigenous peoples, who the empire would normally crush with nary a second thought. Here, like Native Americans, they resist a technologically superior enemy with ingenuity and bravery, putting themselves on the line for a greater purpose.ROTJ does something here that almost no other films do, in its final act. It separates the major characters into three simultaneous storylines, and manages to make each of them logical and easy to follow. The space battle alone is brilliantly shot, planned, and edited, to the point that although you cannot always tell exactly what is happening, you can piece together the broad strokes. The only reason it is successful is that the film pays just enough attention to the characters to be able to recognize their actions. If you watch closely, you can even tell the individual Ewoks' identities from the earlier scenes in the village. These are clearly-identifiable individuals whose actions you can trace through the story (minus Wicket hitting himself with the rock, which should have been cut).The biggest failure of the prequel trilogy is that they made most of these background soldier characters uniform. This had to be done (to an extent) given that those soldiers were clones, and that uniformity is part of the story, but this is also why those battle scenes are not nearly as compelling as in ROTJ. Do we really care who lives or dies in the prequel battles? Does it matter? Not really. Here, every individual has a clear unique identity, and purpose.By contrast, the sequels attempt to have background soldier individuals with characters like Poe, Rose, and a few others, but it fails to give them anything very compelling to do. It actually gives some of them far too much agency (see Poe challenging his superiors' orders). In contrast to Rose/Poe, Wedge is the perfect background character because all we need to know is that he's a good, reliable pilot, which we've seen in both ANH and ESB, so to see him as the leader here after Luke has left Rogue Squadron makes sense. That's all we need to know to understand who he is, why he is Red leader, and why it is significant that he goes into the Death Star and survives, essentially paying the penance for his 'abandonment' of Luke in ANH. Similarly, I'd argue that Lando is still a background character here, closer to what Poe and Rose are in the narrative, but still on a firmer base- he's established to be a good pilot and has enough experience as a leader to make sense here.Anyhow, this has gone on long enough by this point. My last thought is- would Star Wars have entered such a broader consciousness across media had ROTJ not been shot this way? Would we have legions of books, computer games (and EXCELLENT ones like TIE Fighter), etc. Without it? I doubt it. My friends and I all wanted to be fighter pilots as kids, and ROTJ was a big reason why.",

However, Return of the Jedi isn't my favorite of the three.  While the movie has some undeniably memorable moments (the final lightsaber battle, the Death Star raid), as a whole it fell short of its predecessors. The anticipated romance between Han and Leia practically fizzles out, Mark Hamill's limited range as an actor is more evident here than in the rest of the trilogy, and the Ewoks were just too Care Bear-like for the end of a mountainous saga. (George Lucas's fascination with the short fuzzballs makes me wonder, does he think EVERYONE adores them??  The Ewoks have at least two movies of their own, and they're awful!)But ROJ is still a marvelous film, as are all the SW adventures.  Princess Leia is lovely here (I'm a girl, so I'm not basing my opinion on that copper bikini scene, okay), and Luke finally got a decent haircut.

In terms of plot, originality and creativity, Jedi distinctly lacks in comparison with its predecessors and is more direct on resolving old questions and stories rather than taking any new paths.  The most inventive and diverting sequence in the film is its first half-hour in which our heroes attempt to save Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from Jabba the Hut, after which things regress into a notably routine formula.  However, in terms of thrills, tension and excitement Jedi still has considerably much to offer.  One of its merits is its handling of the relationship between the hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his villainous father, Darth Vader (David Prowse), which is captured perfectly in several scenes leading up to their penultimate duel.  A touching farewell from Yoda, a memorable forest shoot-out between the Ewoks and the Stormtroopers and a rousing, high-spirited finale, also help to make Jedi a respectable and effective climax to a stunning series.",

At the end she was supposed to become Queen of her people. Anyway, that didn't happen and the story was far too light after the darkness of The Empire Strikes Back, with only the climax between Luke, Vader and The Emperor having any significant power. But the main problems with ROTJ are:1. Luke isn't as powerful and authoritative as he should be. He should be like Obi-Wan was in the original. He was a rookie in the original, strong but naive in the second, now he should be the mighty Jedi Knight the others suspected. But he isn't powerful enough. We should get the feeling that Luke really is someone of immense power.2. Luke, who is supposed to be the main hero, doesn't actually do anything. Vader defeats the Emperor, the Ewoks and Han & Co defeat the storm troopers and the rebellion pilots destroy the death star. Luke just refuses to join the Dark Side.3. The Jabba the Hutt scene at the beginning is actually the climax from Empire, so it should be there.4. It begins with a big battle, has several fights in the middle and then ends with a HUGE battle. Okay, this is Star Wars, but we need more character development.But still, it's a cool film with a cool name, and the music when Luke fights Vader is excellent.

It was also a little slower when Luke whiteness Yoda's death, but the movie does get quite entertaining after Yoda dies.The movie gets rather entertaining, first with the rebels' planning to take down the new Death Star before it becomes completed. The group's discovery of the inner planet's Ewoks group, the concept was a little strange, but not bad. There is another entertaining scene when the Ewoks become help for the rebels in taking down the evil empire on the planet.The original trilogy has a rather nice ending in the fight between dying Darth Vader and the Emperor, along with Luke's realizing he has the same electric hand as he just cut from Vader, then using Vader's remaining positive force to saving Luke from the Emperor. After this, with the rebel's party to their great success, and Luke's personal burn of Darth Vader for a goodbye to his original father.They did make another mistake in this movie's Special Edition with the Death Star's explosion; it had made a lot more sense without the stupid ring going around the explosion of the Death Star, along with other added CGI effects like the scenes on other planets.",

Actually, the Ewoks are the main reason why this film is the least popular of the series, they are just way too cute for me, but I could handle them more than the Gungans from Episode I. The plot: The Empire is in the middle of constructing a new and more powerful Death Star while Luke, Leia and the gang rescue Han Solo from Jabba The Hutt. Darth Vader is still looking to turn Luke over to the dark side of the Force with the help of Emperor Palpatine. Although perhaps the weakest of the series, this film definitely has the best action sequences, I loved the bike chase and the whole Battle of Endor. The acting was great, especially from Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, you can tell they are comfortable with their roles in this one. This is a great sequel and I would recommend it to anyone who has watched The Empire Strikes Back to complete the most important parts of the storyline.",

Better than Episode 4, but not even close to Episode 5, Marquand's first and last excursion into the Star Wars universe explains much, entertains much, and ends the Star Wars Saga spectacularly and dramatically. The presence of the Ewoks never bothered me. I was fond of them from the start, and even more so when I laid eyes on Jar Jar. McDiarmid gives a wonderful performance as the Emperor, the special effects are better than the first two, and the story is told in a grandeur that is apparent in all the Star Wars films. Williams' score outdoes the originals' by a longshot, the \"Luke and Leia\" theme is beautiful. The emotional impact is increased in this one because we need to settle things after the unsettling events of Episode 5. Luke confronts Vader, love blossoms between Leia and Han (now rescued), and Luke becomes a Jedi. The Saga may end with this one, but that sure is a beautiful way to die.  10/10",

While this is true, hardly anything matches the quality of those films. Jedi comes far closer than most, only failing through an over-simplified plot, some lacklustre acting from Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford (dumbing Han Solo down to a cartoon character, for some reason) and a slow midsection. Oh, and those bloody Ewoks. The teddy bear people are okay for five minutes or so, but far too much time is spent on them when there's much more interesting things going on.Luckily, we get to see much more of the cacklingly evil Emperor and Darth Vader, and Luke becomes a kick-ass Jedi to be reckoned with. The sets, costumes and special effects are superb, as always, and the score is stunning, especially during the Luke versus Vader clash at the climax.ROTJ may not be as good as the previous two Star Wars episodes, but it does have the most action of any of the films. More action than most films, as a matter of fact, and it's fantastic stuff. There's a big battle at the start, several fights and the classic deadly speedbike chase in the middle, and the mother of all battles at the climax - as there should be, this is the finale of the entire six-part Star Wars saga. The Millenium Falcon's attempt to blow up the Death Star is thrilling, as is the final lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader.With lightsabres clashing, laser beams everywhere, spaceships whizzing all over the screen and planets exploding, this is a fittingly spectacular end to a superb series.

            "content": "Star Wars is a legend. Why? I started watching the series by asking myself this, but I wanted to watch it in the order of its release, not in chronological order. Because I want to watch movies the way the followers watch them. I wanted to experience the same things as those who followed the series. That's why I started. I wasn't impressed at all in the first movie, nor in the second movie. I mean, they were beautiful, of course, but it wasn't like that legendary Star Wars I was told about. It was very simple, the messages wanted to be given were shouted. Good men bad men, everything was clear. It even felt childish after a while. But this movie changed my perspective on the series.First of all, I don't understand much about effects, but since I know that the movie is very old, it may not be my right to say something. However, there was no effect that seems too old. Maybe just explosions. But for a movie made 30 years ago, I think the space scenes and aliens are pretty cool. Of course, it wouldn't be right to compare it with today, but even if we compare it with today, nothing offended my eye, except for some funny space suits (they look funny because the space suits used in today's movies). I think there is a very creative image in the movie. I really liked the music. I saved them on Spot. Right away, I'll listen to it later. This series has very simple but thematic and pleasant-sounding music. Since it already has very little music, I have no trouble understanding which music belongs to which scene.The acting in the movie is the point that upsets me, as in all old movies. It seems to me that this was how people actually talked in the 80s and 90s, and they were imitating them. However, it is clear that acting back then was not as professional as it is today. Or they are afraid of exaggerating and going crazy. I do not know. For example, Luke's character seems very dull to me for some reason. But actually, not as a character, but as an actor. It seems as if the character was more active, but the acting was like that. But this point that I'm talking about is definitely a minor case that stands out. So if we have to say something bad about this movie, we have to go into the details and get hung up on trivial things like that. Also, congratulations to the actor who played C-3PO. His movements look so robotic and natural.The 3rd movie of the series (whatever anyone says, this movie is the 3rd movie) impressed me the most was the ending. I mentioned at the beginning of my review, \"Was this the star wars that people are constantly praising?\" This movie answered \"yes\" to my question. After watching the first half of the movie, I was thinking that this movie is going to be a sitcom. Something bad happens to them and they escape. But it was like I didn't want to watch these friends get caught and save each other while there was a huge rebel and empire war going on. In the end, it had to happen. I watched 3 movies for this finale, but if you say was it worth it, I can say yes. I took a screenshot of the last scene and made it my background because I was so impressed. Also, I was so upset that I knew about the Star Wars spoilers that everyone knows. I thought that was what the movie had been hiding for so long, but it wasn't. I think it's worth watching just for the ending.I just finished the first Star Wars trilogy. It's time for the next trilogy. The last movie has raised my expectations a lot, I hope you don't talk about empty things and you continue to progress at this pace Star Wars.",

However, everything else is simply perfect, especially the first appearence of Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine. His landing on the Death Star is probably my favorite Star Wars moment of all time.

As much as I can't stand those awful Ewoks, the worst part about this Star Wars is a script that sucks the life out of the main characters..especially Han Solo (you get the sense that being in carbon freeze for who-knows-how- long softened his brain). Luke's no fun anymore either. Hamill tries too hard to sound like Alec Guinness as Obi Wan did in the first one, and it doesn't work. Then there's the emperor, who is not just evil, but obviously a narcissistic a-hole who loves to hear himself talk. In several scenes he says pretty much the same annoying stuff (telling Luke that Luke now serves him, blah blah). I think the audience got the point the first time he said it. There are basically two parts to this one. The first is Han Solo's rescue from Jabba the Hut, which is great once it gets going. The problem is that it seems to take forever and a day to get going. Then there's the attack on the new Death Star, with three different scenarios: the actual attack with the fighters, the raid on the forest moon to get the shield down, and Luke's confrontation with Vader and the emperor. The scenes with the fighters attacking the Death Star were certainly involved. George Lucas threw everything but the kitchen sink in effects-wise, to the point where I felt bombarded by it all. It was too much. Then you have the Endor scene, which had those stupid Ewoks (what the hell was Lucas thinking?), but also had a really cool \"motorcycle speeder\" chase scene. And then you have the confrontation with Luke and the head bad guys. Luke probably wasn't very happy to find out that the emperor could do more than fight with a sword..he can also shoot what amounts to lightning bolts from his fingers. But does Yoda warn Luke about this? Noooooo, Yoda simply says the cryptic, \"do not underestimate the powers of the emperor.\" Lucas (and Richard Marquand, who directed) were obviously going for full-on drama in the Vader/Skywalker/Emperor confrontation, where Vader is as conflicted as Luke, if not more so. It doesn't work well. The sword fighting is fun, but the emperor's pontificating just gets tedious. And Vader is nowhere near as much fun as a good guy.For all its faults, Jedi still manages to be an entertaining movie..better than any of the \"prequels\" which would follow years later.",

The Emperor was great, better than the guy on TESB hologram. I think Vader was toned down for this film, since his master was there, he couldn't be the BAD guy he was in Empire. I think that everyone fit in their roles quite well. Hammil actually did a satisfactory job in this film (compare it to ANH and you will notice the difference). Boba Fett becoming lunch wasn't a great move, I think he should have left Jabba's after Chewie was captured. It would have been cool to see him go after Luke on Endor or something like that. I think that this film wasn't all it could have been, Lucas showed himself slowing down and out to make it more family oriented than the previous two.

One of the most dangerous men in the galaxy gets bested in a dual, has his hand cut off by a part time Jedi (two training sessions with yoda? Wow!) and dies after taking Sith lightning for half the time the said part time Jedi did. Although, he is \u0091More machine than man' so the lightning probably would have blown a fuse or two, so I can forgive him for that.\nSeriously though, I think ROTJ will stand the test of time. Yes the cloying Ewoks are insanely irritating (it is quite funny when they get blown up. Beechawawa!) but the battle of Endor is good and the speeder bikes are cool. The whole Jabbas palace bit is very good. Everyone tricks their way in and gets caught out and the sarlaac pit monster sequence is great.

Also certain plot points are quite silly and pointless particularly the Ewoks which seem to be added as a selling point for children. On the other hand there are great moments in The Return Of The Jedi. Some of which include the space action sequences, and also the powerful character foil between Darth Vader and Luke. The climatic moment in the movie builds to be very intense, although it is resolved way too easily. Character decisions and epiphanies happen so abruptly, that it does not feel realistic.

            "content": "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi is a fantastic ending to a terrific opening trilogy. At the time that it was first released, that was all we thought that we were getting, no major book projects were in store for one of the highest grossing if not the highest grossing sci-fi movie franchises of all-time and while a couple cartoon spin-offs did make their way to Saturday morning cartoons that was going to be it for Star Wars fans. And what a way to go out, with a satisfying film that answered some of the most complex questions that the trilogy had brought up. First the question that was raised at the end of The Empire Strikes Back. While fighting Luke in Cloud City at the end of the second original film, Vader famously tells Luke that he is his father and in Return of the Jedi, after conferring with both Yoda and ghost Obi-Wan Kenobi we learn this line to be true. Of course when the prequels were added starting with 1999's The Phantom Menace, this became common knowledge but at the time back in the early 1980's this was ground breaking information and is still apart of the American lexicon today! Secondly we learn that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) are actually brother and sister in the Star Wars universe!! Again leaning on that conversation with ghost Obi-Wan early in Return of the the Jedi, the now deceased Jedi Master spills the beans to Luke about his and Leia's true relationship and how they were split apart to protect them from the Emperor and Vader. Again, groundbreaking information at the time that strengthened the family aspect of the Star Wars films. Once again if you took this simply based on the prequels point of view, this would be common knowledge but was a shocker to the common movie goer back in 1983. Luke's green lightsaber was also something of a surprise as well back then too, so much so that some movie posters and hype magazines painted it blue originally to keep it a surprise to audiences. Another fun fact is the director of the film. Richard Marquand, friend of Star Wars creator George Lucas, admirably directed the film but Steven Spielberg was actually the first choice to do so. It turns out he could not because he was a member of the Director's Guild & Twentieth Century Fox - the company that financed the first three Star Wars films including Return of the Jedi - wasn't willing to pay the fees to have Spielberg direct the film at the time. The action in Return of the Jedi is great & with the addition of a couple lines for the digital copy (this is the one that I reviewed) you really see how two Jedi returned for this film!! In the end scene where Luke is brought to the Emperor, in the very final scene of that part where the Emperor is electrocuting Luke and VADER saves Luke by shouting \"No, no!!!!\" Then dumping the Emperor over a bottomless railing you see TWO Jedi emerge (well I guess one Jedi re-emerge in Anakin/Vader) to save the day and bring the lightsaber dueling part to a very satisfying conclusion!! There's lots of fun with the Ewoks, and great humor how the fury little bears worship C-3PO, who in every other story gets kicked around and is the butt of everybody's joke but is treated like a God in parts of this one. There's even a great coming together and celebration at the end of the film when the Evil Galactic Empire is finally defeated. It's a movie for the ages that has stood the test of time. 8 out of 10 stars!!",

George said he wanted an emotional ending between Luke and his father and with the Emperor in the mix that is exactly what we got.The beginning of the film and another reviewer said serves mainly to reunite the main characters and tie up any loose ands regarding Jabba the Hutt and Han's 'previous' life. The tension really starts building up in the 2nd half of return of the Jedi and its completely unmissable! The effects are still stunning and hold up today. The simultaneous three way battle at the end (Luke/Lando/Han and Leia) is brilliantly done. The cutting between scenes is very appropriately done to alleviate and create tension at the right times making the ending that much more dramatic. Now as for the ewoks..some people don't seem to understand they are for comic relief...the battle between Luke/Vader/Emperor is so tense our poor little nerves can't take it and we NEED the comic relief provided by some of the scenes in that battle. And the fact that primitive simplistic ewoks defeat the technological over complicated Empire is very appropriate: reason overcomes technology...a statement on 20th century life.Back to the lightsabre battle. The action isn't as fast or breath taking even as in the Empire Strikes back. But that is good because it doesn't take focus away from the emotional centre of the story. That scene in the Death Srat is more, talking, goading and tension, rather than action which is appropriate. The Emperor's death is poetic justice at its most subliminal. How can anyone not grin as he falls down the shaft...well either grin or just reel back in shock that Ani has FINALLY done it...fulfilled the prophecy. This is why the links with the prequel trilogy are important. When Vader dies and we see him burning on the funeral pyre it is sombre yet surprisingly not too sad. This is because it fits; he is at peace and has come to his natural end. It was similar with Padme's death in Return of the Sith; she had had enough of life, she died at peace knowing she had brought new life into the galaxy and that there was good left in Anakin; for this reason her death was more sombre than sad per se. It is fitting that the deaths of Anakin and Padme are thus juxtaposed and linked.The ending...what is it but happy...the happiest and most uplifting of all the Star Wars films. It is really a complete and finished ending to a magnificent saga of films. I get choked up every time I see it. Reliving the many previous hours of emotions and what the Star Wars galaxy and I have gone through to get to that point.Absolutely brilliant sum it up?

That last scene of Luke seeing the Jedi ghosts of Anakin, Obi Wan and Yoda being happy that finally the galaxy is saved from the forces of evil leaves you with a big smile.",

            "content": "This is it, the best of the series, and the original conclusion to the saga. It took everything great about the previous movies and brought it to unbelievable heights. I could go on for hours about what makes this movie so good, but I'll try to keep it short.Of course, there are those that have their complaints about the movie, some even saying that it's the worst of the original trilogy, and I'm left wondering if we even saw the same movie. Some people complain about the whole beginning with Jabba, and how it almost made it feel like two different movies, or that the first part was more of a prologue. That's a fair point, and I can sort of see that, but I didn't mind it, and actually found it very entertaining. It was a nice change of pace from what we've seen of Star Wars. And I loved the creativity and the creatures and stuff we saw. In fact, when I was much younger, this was my favorite portion of the movie because of all that. Not anymore, obviously, but I still find it highly enjoyable. And it also served to show us how strong Luke became as a Jedi since Empire.A lot of other people complain about the fact that the rebels needed to destroy another Death Star, calling it a rip-off of A New Hope, but that didn't bother me either. I don't remember people complaining about similar premises in other movies. For example, no one said anything when another Terminator had to be stopped in T-2. No one said anything about James Bond needing to stop another terrorist organization. No one said anything about another big car race in the numerous Fast and the Furious movies. Etc, etc. So this complaint is just a stupid nit-pick to me. Especially since the stakes have been raised a lot higher and the climax was much greater.And then there's the Ewoks. This was also another complaint that a lot of people had where they whined about how a bunch of primitive teddy bears took down the empire. I never had a problem with this, and it seems that people keep forgetting that they didn't take down the empire, this was just a very small portion of the empire's army, and there was also rebels fighting along side them. And despite the Ewoks primitive way of life, they had home-field advantage and superior numbers. It's just like how an army of ants can take down a much larger, much deadlier enemy like a tarantula or a scorpion with their overwhelming numbers. The whole thing also delved into the technology versus nature trope, but this was before that theme was used to death over the years. Overall, I didn't really have any issues with the movie and consider it a masterpiece. If I did have one real complaint though, it was suddenly revealing that Leia was Luke's sister. That really came out of nowhere, and it made a few other scenes between them from the previous movies a little... weird.But lets talk about the best portion of the movie. The big climax. I've always been a fan of a big, epic climax, and here we get not one, not two, but three of them. The space battle to destroy the Death Star, the ground battle on Endor to destroy the shield generator, and the light saber battle with Luke and Vader. That's a three way battle taking place at the same time, each one unique and epic. Actually, we even get more than that, as there's also the internal battles going on with Vader and Anakin, and the struggle between Luke and his temptation to the Dark Side. Seriously, what more could you ask for? And it all comes to a head at the same time with Han and Leia destroying the shield generator, Lando blowing up the Death Star's main reactor and then racing for the exit, and Anakin coming back to the Light and killing the emperor. Speaking of which, you know I've got to talk about this scene. One of the greatest scenes in movie history in my opinion. Luke accepting what he knows will be his death and completely rejecting the Dark Side, the emperor unleashing a power we've never seen before, and then Anakin's redemption when he casts off his identity as Darth Vader and comes back to the Light. Oh, I could watch this scene a 1,000 times and never get tired of it. Actually, I probably have.This movie really has everything. It takes all the great stuff from the previous films, rises it to new levels and new heights, and delivers us an epic and awesome movie that leads to a climatic finale that few movies can even come close to before bringing the saga to a satisfying conclusion. From my first time seeing it until now, Return of the Jedi always has been, and always will be, the greatest Star Wars movie ever made, and one of the best movies in history of film, no matter what anyone else says. I don't know what else to say but thank you George Lucas for not just this near-perfect movie, but for this series as a whole.",

Not to mention, his own lightsaber. We finally got to see Jabba the Hutt, the infamous gangster who wanted our hero Han Solo so badly. Despite being a disgusting creature. And of coarse, good finally overcame evil when Darth Vader gave his life to save his son and realized how wrong he was. The ewoks were cute. The movie managed to sell big sets like Jabba's throne set, the ewok village, and of coarse, Jabba's sail barge.

The emperor with Luke is one of the best things about the movie as one feels the pull in both Luke and Vader. The action is some of the best in the trilogy AT TIMES. The Endor sequence is exciting when focused on our leads and their fantastic chemistry which carries much of the film as well. However, the movie does feel to similar to the movie that came out six years before it in the original in terms of overall plot structure. Also, the troopers losing a battle to teddy bear ewoks is possibly the most unbelievable thing in the saga. Despite these flaws the action is great mostly, and certain sequences such as the throne room and the tunnel chase with the Falcon are too classic to pass up. Also the conclusion to the story is very satisfying and will still leave you smiling.",

We also see the deaths of Yoda and Darth Vader, two of the key characters in the entire Star Wars saga. Truly sad, but it perfectly fits the meaning of the film.

            "content": "I was but a babe in arms when George Lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world Saga chronicling the adventures of young Luke Skywalker and the notorious Darth Vadar but even today 20 years on I can appreciate the genius that is Lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with. In A New Hope Lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky Princess Leia, the Rougish Han Solo and the spirited Luke Skywalker as well as that best loved of villains, the sinister Darth Vadar. In The Empire Strikes Back he went all out to show us Special Effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen. He made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat. Return of the Jedi is a fitting end to a Saga that will stand the test of time.When The Empire Srtikes Back ended with encasing of the lovable Rouge Han Solo in Carbonite to be delivered to Jabba the Hut and young Luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his Father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse. Vadar it seemed had won the day. How we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow? In Lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from Han's daring rescue from Jabba's palace to the the final climactic battle on the Death Star between Luke and Vadar as Luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a Jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his Father's soul.Old friends like the smooth talking Lando Calrissian and the ever lovable Chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the Emperor himself ( played by the brilliant Ian McDiarmiud.How he missed out on an Oscar is a mystery.) desperate to turn Luke to the Dark Side even if it means betraying his apprentice Darth Vadar.All in black with his red eyes,ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed Master of the events that unfold. His new and improved Death Star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the Empire's reign for good. Lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted. We watch in excitement as Han and Leia attempt to bring down the shield around the Death Star from the forest Moon of Endor with the help of some adorable Ewoks ( who I really do not believe take from the movie at all. In fact I feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the Death Star) and hindered by legions of Stormtroopers and Imperial Officers. We cheer on Lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty Imperial Fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the Deatn Star to destroy it once and for all. And we watch with bated breath as Vadar and the Emperor attempt to turn Luke to the Dark Side while he in turn tries to turn his Father back.But for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside Darth Vadar. For ROTJ is a battle of emotions and feelings. Vadar is caught between his loyalty to the Emporer and the Empire and his Fatherly inclinations to Luke. Never did I think that a mask could show emotion but some-how one can't but see the confusion and pain on Vadar's face during the final scenes as the Emporer turns on Luke. There is more depth and emotion to Vadar than I believed a villain, especially one more machine then man could have and that I think is what makes him so accessible. He is conflicted. The Apprentice as much as the Master. The Victim as much as the Villain. Without ruining the end too much Vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy.So in conclusion what can I say. George Lucas is the master of the Saga. Star Wars is the most compelling and engaging Sagas I've seen in a long time and I have yet to see another Saga rival it. Return of the Jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending Lucas masterpiece deserves. It's action, suspense, romance, tragedy, redemption, joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters, wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that Lucas can be proud of.",

I'm totally okay with that, although I can't say that \"Episode VI\" is as good as its predecessors, which is fine considering how good the previous films are. \"Return of the Jedi\" is one hell of an entertaining experience, but I think it lost some of the genius in the writing to deliver a politically correct ending to an overall family friendly saga. Awkwardly enough in this movie there are some of my favorite scenes in the trilogy (the revelation of how Luke and Leia are connected; the showdown with Jabba's crew; the epic fight between Luke, Vader and the Emperor) and some of the worst (the introduction to Jabba's palace; the Ewoks), and still every scene feels like it needs to be there and (just like its two predecessors) like it is essential sci-fi adventure film. For all the cheesiness and plot-holes that can be there, \"Star Wars\" is one of those cinematic miracles that you love no matter what rationality induces you to think, because art works exactly that way, more on an emotional level that on a cerebral one. So, I can't rate \"Return of the Jedi\" as high as the other two films, but with the note that I love it just as well.Despite its flaws, \"Episode VI\" gets you just as well. 8/10",

Throughout my teens I was never in any rush to go see any of them either (I do remember seeing Return of the Jedi when I was about 7 or 8). Then, when they decided to make the rest of the movies, everyone was drooling and losing their minds over it. I just never felt the urge to go see any. So, anyway, a few weekends ago, I borrowed all six from my friend and watched them over a period of a week, or so. Now that I'm finished, I must say that I am a little bit disappointed. Maybe I missed the boat (or train, or bus, or wagon or whatever means of transport that Star Wars buffs take), but I just wasn't as engrossed in the characters as I hoped I would.I do realize that this movie has a cult following, and I will no doubt be bashed by a lot of the \"weaker minds\" here at IMDb; but, my original point still stands: I think the Star Wars series is good, but a bit overrated.I loved the last (or first) three movies that were put out. No, not because of superior special effects, but, I think the story was easier to digest and the acting was far superior (some scenes in the earlier movies were actually quite comical in their clumsiness). I think maybe the characters in the early movies threw me off the series (Luke's character wasn't really lovable as the hero).Overall, the idea of two trilogies was genius and both sets of movies could stand on their own. The overarching story-line is quite good as well but maybe a single trilogy could have sufficed. What thinks you?",

The lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader is my favorite in all the \"Star Wars\" films by far. Ian McDiarmid's performance as Emperor Palpatine is a major highlight of the franchise, and one of the most memorable pieces of acting in any science-fiction movie.The action sequences are spectacular and the special effects are so good you don't even notice that they're just special effects. But I will criticize the Ewok costumes, which are obviously fake and seem out of place in an otherwise sophisticated movie. While the beginning and end of \"Jedi\" are terrific, the movie suffers from a slow and tonally uneven second act. I also don't like that the filmmakers decided to bring back the Death Star - the final battle makes for a great action sequence, but couldn't they have done something more original? Regardless, while it's not as good as the first two \"Return of the Jedi\" is an entertaining and moving conclusion to the original trilogy. 8/10.",

            "content": "When it comes to Star Wars, the original trilogy reigns supreme. That being said, \"Return of the Jedi\" can be seen as an anticlimactic ending to the George Lucas' initial saga. In many ways it still satisfies, but standing next to \"A New Hope\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" it also disappoints on a few fronts.First off, the movie's first chapter takes all too long. For the epic conclusion to the story of the Galactic Empire, the movie starts with nearly forty minutes of C-3PO, R2-D2, Luke, Leia, Lando, and Chewbacca rescuing Han from Jabba the Hut on Tatooine. The sequence is fun, with diverse new aliens all around, but it is utterly belabored.The characters march into Jabba's Palace one by one and purposefully get themselves captured just to escape at the last second. One wonders if an easier, more practical way of saving Han exists. Given that he is an ally of the Rebellion, and Jabba is no more than a desert-planet thug, you'd think a larger crew could just blow their way in-and-out of the Palace rather effortlessly.Anyway, this prolonged heist to rescue a single character - even if that character is Han Solo - feels far too small to kick off the trilogy's finale. It also writes off the underused Boba Fett in the lousiest way possible.Next, Luke heads back to Dagobah to reconnect with Yoda. Here we can rejoice at the return of Frank Oz's iconic puppet. In the brief but powerful sequence, the wise master confirms \"Empire's\" cliffhanging news that Darth Vader is indeed Luke's father. At the same time, he also tells Luke that he must confront Vader, lest the Force remain imbalanced. It raises the stakes for Luke, as he now feels an even deeper connection with the villain, but also knows that the fate of the Jedi rest in his ability to overcome him.However, during the same sequence, the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi (reprised briefly by Alec Guinness) reveals another piece of the Skywalker family tree that is a bit more... well, uncomfortable. Unless you've been living under a rock for the past thirty-seven years, you probably know what I'm talking about, but I will nevertheless abstain from spoiling for those privileged enough to be watching Star Wars for the first time.Then, there is the matter of the second Death Star and the Ewoks, the former of which feels lazy and the latter renders the film's third act childish. The second Death Star - literally a larger, unfinished version of the first one - just mimics \"A New Hope's\" ultimate threat in place of something more original. Meanwhile, the Ewoks are fluffy teddy bear creatures that save the rebels in their final battle on a woodland moon of the planet Endor. Such primitive creatures holding their ground against the Empire might be inspiring if they weren't so cuddly looking. As it is, the Ewoks render the trilogy's final battle quasi-farcical.The only part of \"Return of the Jedi\" that really feels like a worthy conclusion to what \"A New Hope\" and \"Empire\" set up is the throne room sequence, where Vader brings Luke face-to-face with the tyrannical Empire. Ian McDiarmid's performance as the arch-villain is superb, as his wickedness makes even Vader seem decent. Then, the final light-saber duel between Luke and Vader is epic, filled with all the emotion we'd expect from a father and son battling for their family's fate in the galaxy.Overall, \"Return of the Jedi\" accomplishes in completing the hero's journey. Standing next to its predecessors, though, it cannot help but come off as imperfect. Flawed pacing, an embarrassing family revelation, and those goshdarn Ewoks make it rank rather low in my personal list of Star Wars movies, and definitely at the bottom of the original trilogy.Still, it at least offers sufficient closure for the story of Luke, Leia, Han, and Vader. That alone is no small feat, and I commend George Lucas (along with director Richard Marquand and screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan) for never compromising these great character's dignities through the end.",

Now most people thought that this movie was a disappointment because of them, but I think there not that much of a burden, it's just a not so great idea from writer George Lucas.One thing that is an interesting fact is that Mark Hamil, the guy who played Luke Skywalker, did all of his stunts in this movie, unlike most movie stars. And speaking of acting, one other interesting thing is that the droid R2-D2, a small robot like creature who's about 3'8 inches, is actually played by an actor! I always thought that R2-D2 was done by mechanics or something and was controlled by a remote control, like those racing cars that you see being advertised on T.V.With the exception of the Ewoks, I truly believe that this movie is the greatest and it truly is a must own for any avid Sci-fi fan.

After an intense escape, which see's both Jabba and bounty hunter Boba Fett killed (in an embarrassing manner) Luke goes back to see Yoda and the others go to meet with the Rebellion.Yoda unfortunately passes away but confirms that Darth Vader is indeed his father and states his training is complete. Shortly after, he's visited by the ghost of Obi-Wan who reveals that Leia is his sister, ruining many fan fantasies is the process.During this time the Empire is constructing a second Death Star and the Emperor and Darth Vader arrive to see its progress. Vader's conflicted feelings are very apparent in this film, as his son is heavy on his mind. Meanwhile, the Rebellion plan an attack on the Death Star. Han, Luke, Leia and Chewbacca attempt to take down the shield generator for the Death Star on another planet but are met by many Storm Troopers, after they manage to escape, they are greeted by another race, known as Ewoks, whom they eventually befriend and work with to take down the generator.Luke is eventually caught (intentionally) by the Empire to reconnect with his father, attempting to turn him back to the light. While the battle between the Empire and Rebellion ensues, Luke and Vader battle again but with Vader conflicted and Luke avoiding him, it is much more evenly matched. Luke eventually strikes down his father after a threat on Leia but refuses to kill him, and is attacked by the Emperor.Vader finally turns, killing the Emperor, while mortally wounding himself in the process. As the shields fail the Death Star and the Rebellion slowly win the battle, Vader dies in Luke's arms and he eventually escapes the crumbling Death Star. Luke burns his fathers body and returns to celebrate with Leia, Han, Chewbacca and Lando.Like any story Lucas writes, this is a long one and despite how long that summary is, it truly doesn't cover everything. I don't think many would argue that Episode 6 is good but pales in comparison to 4 and 5.The direction of Irvin Kershner, whom directed 5, is sorely missed in this film. Marquand is undeniably a good director but it was clear that Lucas wasn't comfortable giving him as much control as Lucas' fingerprints are clearly on the direction of the movie, which leads to some choices being made that hinder the first two acts of this film.The most glaring problem is the comedic nature of the first two acts. While Luke's story is fairly serious, the rest feels almost satirical, especially with the introduction of the Ewoks. I get the concept of the characters but the execution is a huge problem until the third act. I also don't like Jabba the Hut's scene as well. Love the design and sound of the character, but again, execution is more comedic than scary. It especially isn't helped that he and the iconic Boba Fett are killed off in comedic fashion as well.The first two acts survive on the story of Luke and Vader. While I do think Luke's story is a bit rushed (especially the completion of his training) they keep the first two acts from diving off of cliff. Vader is definitely the most intriguing character as the ruthless and powerful man of Episode 5 is now a sympathetic and conflicted man in this, a very stark difference but tremendous to the story.The third act is where this movie gets into its groove. The two battles with the Rebellion/Empire and Luke/Vader are both really well done. In fact, the last interaction between Luke and Vader (now Anakin once more) is still the most emotionally satisfying scene in this franchise.The acting is another tremendous element of this film. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are once again tremendous. However, it's Ian McDiarmid's performance as the Emperor that is the true standout, bringing his Shakespearean skill in full force to play the character.So overall, it's not the perfect film that it's predecessor was, nor is it as good as Episode 4, but it's still an amazing way to end the trilogy. While the first two acts could have been better, the third act is this films true highlight and the part that's worth watching.",

George Lucas gave the audience a peek of what was to come in his future Star Wars films. Poor action, script, annoying characters, such as the ewoks. The Jar Jar Binks of the early 80's, and total boredom. Such as the prequels bring to us today. What's good about this film... nothing. Lucas lost his magic, excuse me, luck in the seventies after The Empire Strikes Back which was made in 1979. I can't believe those Star Wars idioits worship this muck. A truly awful film of any kind. It's sad that all the hype that surrounds Star Wars, out of all five films that were made, only the first two films of '77 and '80 are the only ones that are worth watching. ROTJ is a film that begs the question, \"What the hell were they thinking?\" * out of ****.",

However, the movie is also a continuation of the classic battle of \"good versus evil\", with many religious and spiritual themes. Many topics such as greed, temptation, and redemption are debated in this film, and I've read that George Lucas admits that he injected religion into the 'Star Wars' trilogy (see Time magazine, April 26, 1999). For me the whole idea of the Force is fascinating and I suppose there are various ways in which it can be interpreted -- as God perhaps, or religion itself? Or could it simply be some profound level of meaning beyond our everyday reality; this is the interpretation that makes most sense to me. (Perhaps it could be compared to 'The Matrix'?)It may be that a Christian can see 'Return of the Jedi' and think he or she saw a Christian film, but it is Eastern religion that has been said to dominate, and I would agree. There are said to be many examples of Buddhist philosophy in the 'Star Wars' films and I look forward to reading a recently-published book on the topic by Matthew Bortolin, called 'The Dharma of Star Wars'.",

            "content": "Most people put this as their least favorite of the original trilogy. Not that it's bad it's just not as good as the other 2. However, there is one group of people who say that this is the best Star Wars movie and I can definitely see why. The best parts of this movie are when Luke is with Darth Vader and the emperor trying to make Vader \"return from the dark side of the force.\" It's very deep and emotionally compelling. The climax is also very satisfying. Without giving away too much, it is pleasantly surprising if you consider what happened in Revenge of the Sith. I also like the space battles. They were great and a lot of fun. It's also good to see some continuity with The Empire Strikes Back by making Lando return. While he is kind of minor, it was still nice to see him. I also like the way the Han and Leia thing was resolved. It's still a cute relationship and their interactions are cute and fun. In fact, that's one thing this movie does have over the 2 movies. The interactions between Vader and Luke are the highlights of the film and many of the other characters play off the other characters very well. So taking all of that into account, what makes this movie not as good as the other 2 in the original trilogy? Well there are 2 things that very hard to overlook. This movie is extremely lighthearted compared to the last movie. Well most of the movie is pretty dark but, the ewoks are really cheesy for the Star Wars films. They take out all of the tension in the scenes they appear in. However, it's not that bad since we need something kind of lighthearted to balance out with the overall darkness of the rest of the film. The other problem I have with this movie is that the opening scene in Jabba's palace is way too long and kind of boring when they aren't battling off monsters. Listen, I get that you need to make this movie 2 hours long for your marketing to adults or whatever but this is really pushing. You could've either trimmed the opening A LOT or cut it out entirely and make a change to how they get Han Solo back. Overall, I guess my problems don't hurt this movie that much since I still love it just not much as some of the other films and hey at least we do get that awesome ending in the ewok camp.",

Which is a pity, because the opening few minutes on Tattooine, with the rescue of Han Solo and the demise of the repulsive Jabba the Hutt are terrific. This initial high standard is not however sustained. Mark Hamill is frankly wooden in what should be the pivotal role. Harrison Ford's instinct that his character should have been killed off in this film is probably correct. Carrie Fisher has fun in a gleeful ripoff of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, although the ewoks are just plain silly, looking far too much like teddy bears to be taken seriously in what is supposed to be a desperate battle for the future of the galaxy.2 major weaknesses dog the resolution of this film. At the risk of major spoilage for anyone who has hidden under a boulder for the last 2 decades and hasn't seen this film, here they are:1: Darth Vader, who among other things ordered the brutal torture of Han Solo in the previous film for no reason other than his own amusement, suddenly discovers a shred of humanity after all on seeing his son Luke Skywalker being tortured by the emperor. This is supposed to be the villain that orchestrated the extermination of the Jedi Knights. It will take hard work by Lucas and Co in Episodes 2 and 3 to convince me that this is not inconsistent.2: The destruction of the first Death Star precipitated an Imperial counterattack that harried the Rebels to the farthest corners of the galaxy. The destruction of the second leads to instant victory for the Alliance, and peace. Okay, so the Emperor was killed as well, but is this enough to precipitate the total collapse of the Imperial forces - are all those generals wearing those bits of coloured plastic such mindless sheep? Oh, they are? Hmm.Unless George Lucas changes his mind and creates Episodes 7-9, this ending to the Star Wars series of films must be regarded as unsatisfactory. His dilemma is enormous: of the 3 leads, Harrison Ford is now a megastar and too expensive to employ, Carrie Fisher is probably not interested and Mark Hamill is a wizened shell of an actor doing computer games, though he could probably be understudied by Terence Stamp if a lookalike actor is required.",

That, it does, however it sacrifices its potential in doing so. The first act of the film could have been entirely separate and does feel like story buffer, despite the fact it is critical for the film to make sense. The characters don't see too much development, however it isn't necessary, as the previous film has already invested you in them. On the technical side of things, the bluescreens and the speeder bike battle scene don't hold up whatsoever, but most of the other aspects, such as Ewoks or spaceships do. The sets weren't as good as other films, but when the bar is that high, they outclass most other films. The first act had fun action, an exciting heist plot, a Rancor and a Sarlacc. It really managed to capture the grimy, crowded atmosphere of Jabba's palace. The final act on Endor was slightly repetitive, but still entertaining. But the closure is what this film was for, and it delivered a satisfying ending for this Hexalogy. Overall, this is the weakest of the original trilogy, but it's still a much needed, rewarding wrap up.73/100--Admin--\nViolence - Bloodless killings.Sex/Nudity - None.Language - None.Miscellaneous Themes - None.",

The screenplay lacks the humour of the first two films and the characters are serious and barely recognisable from their previous incarnations. Kasdan makes the fatal blunder of keeping our hero's actions mysterious in the first act making Jabba the Hutt the default lead of the film and confusing us as to whose story is really being told. The audience is left cold by Alan Hume's muddy cinematography and Richard Marquand's weak directing - especially in the action sequences which don't come close to those in the first two films. Lucas painted himself into a corner in this respect by quitting the Director's Guild and severely limiting the talent available to him. ILM, Ben Burtt and John Williams acquit them selves admirably as usual and the drama of the Luke/Darth/Emperor confrontation keeps the film afloat despite the rehashed Death Star attack and the goofy Ewok battle. The Ewoks are criticised for being childish and silly even though they are no less silly than say the Jawas in the first film, however the cartoonish alien elements were used as entertainment in the first two stories and didn't factor into the drama of the final battle sequences which is why I think audiences felt something was off in this story.

Back in the 80s his creative influence over Kasdan extended to the introduction of some hairy little gimps called Ewoks.This however, remains my only real complaint about the additional characters in the film. Its not that the Ewoks are unlikable or insipid - but the fact that these little bears are capable of defeating hardened Storm Troopers with a twig hit to an armoured bonce. This is a narrative complaint, as the characters and their environment of the Ewok village actually lend quite an evocative atmosphere to the Endor scenes - especially the saccharine sweet closing sequence.Personally speaking I think that Han Solo should have died for his friends in this one. Not only would it have added the element of tragedy that made 'Empire so great, but made the Rebels quest for freedom all the more poignant. It all seems far too convenient that the only people we see loose their lives are some unknown rebel pilots. The most emotional moment remains the point at which Darth Vader decides that love for his son is far greater than his desire for power over the galaxy and decides to lob the Palpatine down a power shaft that engineers (disobeying intergalactic health and safety law) had placed in the Emperor's lounge room. The score helps the tears well sufficiently at this point, as Anakins story reaches full-circle.The special effects are second to none, their combination of sophistication and simplicity becoming a unique style of its own. Highlights include the Battle of Endor (the space part of it) and the final showdown between father and son (quite a Freudian moment for all you psychology nerds out there).A brilliant, yet slightly immature end, to the saga. Some fun moments:1)Luke hiding ridiculously close to Vader and not getting noticed. 2)Han Solo surviving a Wembley Stadium sized explosion by hiding behind a log. 3)The Emperor gloating that the rebels are losing the space battle despite the ships being far too small to actually see who is winning. 4)Some one shouting \"Die Dickheads\" as the Super Star Destroyer crashes.",

The good thing about Return of the Jedi is that it's very story-focused and well too. However I strongly felt that storytelling in this movie should have been more deeply focused and colorful than what it is in the film. Another thing is that though Return of the Jedi is better than Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope (according to me) it lacked some or a bit of the cinematic discipline from the previous two Star Wars movies. Also the light saber duel between Luke and Darth Vader is unfortunately and certainly not the best composed light saber duel of the trilogy and should have been much, much better than what it is. Moreover I noticed an editing error in the scene seconds after Luke slices Darth Vader's arm. Despite all of that Return of the Jedi has the Emperor of the evil Galactic Empire who's a memorable villain, a beginning which is heavenly ambitious, it has a haunting atmosphere, has bombastic thrills, has a stunning and rushing score which matches the context of the film incredibly well and gets you emotionally thrilled and enough sudden turns in the movie to satisfy. The movie is overall a deliciously entertaining Star Wars episode which makes you greedy and it is a true welcome back to a galaxy far, far away and a fitting end to the trilogy. My rating: 7.2/10",

            "content": "So it had finally come to be \u0096 the final chapter of an epic story. The attention span of a movie audience has always been a limiting factor for the movie industry. When taken into consideration with the time and cost constraints that influence audience attendance at the movie theatre, we can well appreciate the fact that the series concept well accepted for television, is not considered bankable for the movies. A potential investment in the \u0091continuing adventures of\u0085\u0085' by production companies would result in the application of financial prudence, meaning that the preference would rather be to concentrate on one story and if box office success warranted it, the production of a sequel to take advantage of a potential cash \u0096 cow. This is still a solid norm today, although more risks are being taken in stories like \u0091Star Wars'Good stories will always attract audiences to the theatre, but to bring them back for another chapter, it will have to be special. The principle of high concept would certainly have more relevance here. Of prime importance would be the unique challenge of creating story flow throughout the chapters with each setting the platform for the next. Keeping audience attention throughout the chapters is necessary in order to inspire audiences to return and follow the continuing adventures of their heroes.\u0091Star Wars' is one of those few special stories that can meet all these challenging requirements. It introduces new characters throughout the chapters which created enough interest for the audience. Each chapter ended tantalisingly thus giving impetus to the next chapter. Stories involving mystical worlds with wizards, princesses and knights duelling always seem to captivate audiences thus making them particularly favourable for the series format. This is also evident with \u0091Lord Of The Rings'. Lucas's unique adaptation of ancient worlds to that of the future has firmly claimed an established place in cinematic history.The third chapter offers much in the way of strengths, but unfortunately also in the way of weaknesses. As a result, it does pale in comparison to \u0091The Empire Strikes Back', but it still falls short of disappointing. Lucas had gone much further in trying to delight the younger members of the audience. There may be method here to the effect that being the final act, it should act on a happy note. It may also be that feeling freer to apply the child within him due to the mass audience acceptance of previous characters, Lucas added more comic characters. Even if we consider the first point to be correct, and I personally feel that it is the second, the story has been weighed down with comic characters, which may annoy the older audience. These characters take up much screen time in the third chapter and it began to take on a pantomime \u0096 like style. This undermined the battle between good and evil as the threat of the Dark Side seemed to take a back seat to these characters. If it were not for the greater role that the Emperor played in this chapter, it would have been disappointing.\nThe Emperor is a sublime manifestation of the Dark Side. He absolutely oozes dark menace which serves to accentuate his great power. The eyes beneath his cloak projected ominous intent. Even his surroundings mirrored the evil that he is. His window is in the shape of an unshapely spider web symbolising the disorder and chaos of the Dark Side and hideous design also indicated to us that we were now in the presence of evil. The room is devoid of ornaments or furniture making him appear more purposeful in his evil intent. He does not reminisce or luxuriate \u0096 he exists only to dominate and rule at all costs. His priests have the appearance of demonic minders who submissively attend to their masters needs. The Emperor is purposeful in motion \u0096 confident in who he is and the outcome of his fiendish plan which is unfolding in the presence of his adversary.The stand \u0096 off between the Emperor and Skywalker did much to increase the perception of the Emperor's power. He seemed to be in total control and was getting the necessary reactions from Skywalker. It is these scenes which rescue the movie and keep it in line, not only with the box \u0096 office success of the previous chapters, but also as a story. It gave the continuity to the chapter that was necessary due to the excess inclusion of comical characters. It did not address the balance entirely, but served to anchor the storyline. The Emperor was a character which served to draw on the line of evil characters such as the Bounty Hunter and of course, Vader. The balance of characters between the good and the bad side was generally very good. But for me, it was the Emperor that tipped the balance of memorable characters in favour of the baddies which already benefited from strong audience appeal due to characters like Vader. This is indicative of the fact that stories such as these require immense characters as opponents for our heroes. This creates a greater obstacle to overcome thus maintaining audience attention as they attempt to conquer an insurmountable force. Audiences also enjoy these characters since they solve their problems ruthlessly and with impunity. It may be costly to us in reality, but we can fantasise about it. We imagine the face of \u0091Star Wars' and it is not Skywalker.The comical characters had their place in the movie, but they were greatly over \u0096 utilised. Some of them were silly, especially at Jabba the Hut's cave. The Special Edition only served to exasperate the matter. Alien's continually belching was a joke that was replayed as if we would never tire from the novelty. If their comical nature and screen time had been toned down, they would have strengthened the movie rather than weakened it. A sound balance between the comic and seriousness of these characters was struck in the previous chapters. It was a pity the same was not applied here.Notwithstanding the above criticism, \u0091Return Of The Jedi' is an entertaining movie with a satisfying conclusion. The assault on the imagination launched by the story tapered a bit here. but it remained to be a movie far above the average. The final chapter had despite it's weaknesses, given us a movie which was still one of the best at the time. A traditional story had been adapted and as a consequence of this adaptation, cutting \u0096 edge technology not only needed to be used, but had to be upgraded. Lucas carried this application through to all future projects involving \u0091Star Wars' and although their impact has, and never will be the same, we will continue to look forward to the continuing story of \u0091Star Wars'.",

            "content": "\"Return of the Jedi\" wraps up the original trilogy of \"Star Wars\" films with incredible special effects and quick pacing. Although not as deep as Empire, it's still an incredibly fun movie. Following the events in Empire, The Rebel Alliance is poised to strike a Deathblow to the empire, which has constructed a new Death Star. Meanwhile, Luke, Leia and Lando infiltrate the fortress of Jabba The Hutt in order to rescue the frozen Han Solo. \"Return\" has some amazing action sequences-we get to see the Lightsaber used in other ways apart from dueling, and also a stunning multi-level battle which sets a new standard in cinematic spectacle(And which was emulated to a degree in Episode I). As for performances, they're a little less focused than in Empire, but there still is greatness, especially in the supporting characters. Denis Lawson, the surviving pilot from the first film and who also had a cameo in Empire, gets to shine here, as does Ian Mcdiarmid as the fierce Emperor Palpatine, a character that will be expanded as the prequels continue to unravel the backstory.",

It begins in Tatooine with the disgusting Jabba. Luke Skywalker displays his power of the Force and saves Han and the droids. Then the real adventure begins, with a seemingly dormant new Death Star. A battle with cute little teddy bears called Ewoks, a dazzling lightsaber duel between son and father, the revealment of the ultimate enemy, it reaches quite a level of excitement. The story is very good, the acting is superb, and the effects, like the other SW movies, are excellent, not only for then, but also for today.The costumes are also very good. The only thing in the movie that looked totally goofy was a blue alien that played for Jabba in the musicians section. It looked like a jazzed up stuffed elephant (probably what it was), but didn't take away from the feel of the movie. An excellent movie for SW fans, or those who like science fiction, or for those who are just looking for a good movie. This is one Star Wars that I recommend the most. May the Force be with you!",

            "content": "And the Star Wars saga ends, with \"Return of the Jedi\", a good, but flawed, movie, which was sort of a let-down for many fans, and is considered, almost universally, the weakest movie of this Original Trilogy.The main problem is the tone: it feels like Lucas was scared that the last movie was \"so adult\" or \"so dark\", so he tried to recapture some of the charming feel of the original Star Wars... but this was not made with a light and funny story, rather by recycling plot-devices from the first movie (Destroy the Death Star... again), and adding kid-friendly stuff: the poor Imperial Stormtroopers have become the laughing-stock of nerd-culture, for being defeated by a bunch of Teddy-Bears from the forest. So, a lot of the seriousness achieved by the last movie is lost in this one.Also, it's clear that this movie won't take any risk: the cliffhanger left in the last movie is resolved almost immediately, and at the end, everything turns out fine (spoilers!): everyone survives, Darth Vader becomes good at the end, and the Empire is utterly defeated. The most dramatic thing in the movie was the scene of the death of an Ewok. There is suspense in the movie, but it's resolved almost immediately. The best part in the movie is the climatic Emperor-Vader-Luke confrontation, which resolves the plot-threads left by \"Empire\" in a fitting way. But the rest of the subplots in the movie are less dramatic and more light: not a problem per se, but the tone-shifts gives this movie a weird feel sometimes.All the above criticisms come from the perspective of the tone established in \"Empire\". But if we consider this movie not a \"Space-Drama\" but a \"Space Adventure for kids\", then it's a great movie, perhaps reflecting the fact of Lucas adopting a child during that time. It's funny, intense and the story is good enough to entertain everyone: the kids will enjoy the \"kiddie stuff\", and the adults will laugh and enjoy the adventures of their beloved characters and the happy ending.So, in conclusion, a good, but not excellent, ending for one of the most creative sagas of the 70s and the 80s. These movies are true classics, and a monument to George Lucas' creativity, and the team which worked with him.8/10",

If you enjoy well made films of the sci-fi genre as well as other genres, read on.One of the things I look for in a film is progression. Why are the characters moving from one place to another? How are the characters developing throughout the film.Star Wars and The Empire Strike Back FAIL on both counts. Yes, they have great special effects but to a person looking beyond the visuals; for plot, character and dialog they are both MAJOR disappointments. Return Of The Jedi succeeds FULLY in plot development and PARTIALLY in terms of character development.The hero, and by far the most likable character, of this series winds up being Hans Solo. Luke Skywalker is rendered as an ineffectual emotionless cardboard character who accomplishes virtually nothing in both The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi. Star Wars fans hate hearing that Luke Skywalker is useless in this film; they defend him by offering his redemption of his father.  Ooh, how original!  How many PIRATE films have used this plot device countless times? Darth Vader is a COMPLETE wuss as he is TOTALLY subservient to The Emperor.Most people argue that the opening sequence is a waste of time and has nothing to do with the main story. Well perhaps, but then the film would have been 20 minutes shorter and everyone would have complained about THAT.  I propose that Star Wars has at least 30 minutes of boring footage (Sand dunes, sand dunes, sand dunes. YAWN!) and The Empire Strikes Back should have advertised as \"Sci-Fi Fans ONLY Need View\".The Ewoks are fine.  Remember, George Lucas had lots of cash to spend and you see it on the screen.",

            "content": "Perhaps a bit more comedic and light-hearted than the previous film, but still a great movie all the same. Indeed Return of the Jedi is off to a bit of a bad start because it's intention is to finish off this particular trilogy and saga, and thus we all know the ending will involve the heroes saving the day and destroying the baddies (although it could really have taken us for a ride of confusion by having the bad guys winning instead, but that may have been a bit too dark as closure to the Star Wars saga). Indeed the dark ending to Empire Strikes Back took many by surprise, with the good guys essentially not winning, but that's what many consider to be the winning trump card of that film, the fact that it didn't take the conventional path of stopping the villain and saving the day, but this doesn't make Return of the Jedi a bad movie, in fact it's the exact opposite.So what's the blurb? In the years following Episode V, the Empire has created yet another Death Star, and prepares for the arrival of their illustrious leader, the Emperor. Meanwhile, Luke and the gang are on a mission to rescue Han Solo from the clutches of the evil gangster Jabba the Hutt. After rescuing him, the group once again go their separate ways as Luke returns to Dagobah and an ailing Jedi Master Yoda to complete his training, whilst Han and the group join the Rebel Alliance fleet, destined to launch one last desperate assault on the Death Star to destroy both it and the Emperor.To my mind, there is very little wrong with this movie. Again it takes elements from the previous films and takes them up a notch like a good sequel should. The action is just as fun, and the effects have once again been improved no end to give us a thrilling final battle in the skies above Endor. At the same time the characters continue to be developed and their relationship between one another remains true, making you want them to succeed all the more. Indeed a few added elements could be perceived as unwelcome, such as Leia in her scantily clad harem outfit, and the Ewoks being able to take down a mechanised army of gun wielding Stormtroopers and AT-ST walkers with rocks and sticks, but to be brutally honest I didn't find them too distracting, not detracting from the overall story, which is indeed the best part.The story is largely based around the redemption of Darth Vader and bringing him back from the Dark Side. The section towards the end in the Emperor's Throne Room is especially intense, and there is a true amount of tension between the characters, especially Luke, who must try to rescue his father from evil whilst not allowing himself to be consumed at the same time.Overall, this is my 2nd favourite Star Wars movie, perhaps not as dark as Episode V, but with a gripping story and amazing special effects that will keep you glued to it for the entire running time. As a kid I loved it, as an adult I love it even more, and I'd recommend it to you all!",

It would've been a lot cooler to just have Darth Vader be the sole villain. But I do understand that they wanted to show Vader's sense of vulnerability throughout the movies in the sense that he wasn't the dominating force. And the whole trying to get Luke to turn to the dark side was very forced and could've been more developed.However, I'm still satisfied with the overall ending. The Ewoks were also adorable.",

Everything from production design to visual and practical effects is, once again, taken up a notch and vastly improved upon. The battle of Endor is a brilliant example of how far the technology had come at the time and after all these years, hasn't aged one bit. The movie begins quite well, with Han Solo's rescue by Luke and Co from the clutches of Intergalactic crime boss Jabba the Hutt, it follows quite nicely with Luke's discovery through Obi-Wan of yet more secrets about his origin and the subsequent laying out of the latest plan by the Rebel Alliance to destroy the Empire's newest Death Star. Unfortunately, once the protagonists land on Endor and we have the first few skirmishes with the Empire's troops, they run into the Ewoks. That's when the movie, for me, takes a bit of a nose dive. It thankfully picks up towards the end with the Final Battle and Luke and Vader's ultimate confrontation. That's my only gripe with the movie. Other than that, it is a very entertaining ride and a more than fitting end to a wonderful saga. Great fun.",

Back in the day, Star Wars was my life, so seeing the characters get to this point of desperation was just amazing and if you must know, I cried at the end in the 1st AND 2nd time I watched ROTJ. The 3rd time, I teared a bit, but that is all.Now, I can see why people find this movie the weakest (Ewoks, Jabba's Palace), but here is why those things NEVER bothered me.1. Ewoks- The ewoks and the fact that they beat the Stormtroopers bothers others, but not me. People don't seem to understand the message. The Empire is huge, evil, and control the galaxy. Everyone is under their control. The fact that Ewoks were able to beat them tells a message of how if you rise up and have the determination, you can reach your goal, no matter if you are small or weak. If you saw a teddy bear, you'd probably underestimate it. Could this be why the stormtroopers were defeated? The Ewoks vs Stormstroopers laughably reminds me of the 300 spartans vs the huge army of Persians. They both tell the same message, even if it is hard to imagine Wicket as Leonidas. THIS IS ENDOR! 2. Jabbas Palace- The only real thing that bothers people here is the quick death of Boba Fett, the dance number, and that it wastes too much time in the movie. Personally, none of those bother me. The \"death\" of Boba Fett (he comes back in the Expanded Universe) seems very fitting. The dance number just adds to the atmosphere of the repulsiveness of Jabba and really, I don't think these scenes waste time. Jabba's Palace is creepy and has a great atmosphere.The last duel between Vader and Luke is my favorite. It isn't about how they fight, it is about the characters and the emotional conflict which they totally lost in the prequels, but brought back in Revenge of the Sith kind of. The way the chorus kicks in as Luke yells \"NO!\" and lashes at Vader and cutting off his arm and realizing that Vader still has human to him. The way Vader ultimately defeats the Emperor and sacrificing his own life just to see his son with his own eyes is just tear bringing.ROTJ not only gives me the best possible ending, it is a film that I will always love. It is on par with Empires and A New Hope. And were the Ewoks bad? Yeah they were bad...BADASS! They use their enemy's heads as freaking drums! C'mon, that is freaking awesome! ROTJ, you are a classic along with the rest of the trilogy. 10 out of 10!",

Kurz was right that the audience did not only care for the spectacle.Lucas first 2 movies where awesome. Especially in the frame of time. This third installment was inevitable. And it does not disappoint in a lot of ways.The effects where very good. The sets used brilliant. Jabba the hut and his gang where fantastic to see. I liked the addition of new rebel alliance characters too.And thankfully the spectacle was of very high quality. The fighting scenes in space and the Death Star very entertaining. The Endor fights and Ewoks a suspencefull part.And although the acting wasn't of the highest order, i did enjoy Mark Hamills portrait of Luke Skywalker. I thought Harrison Ford was great as ever. In fact without him wouldv given the movie a lot less attraction. Carrie Fisher so endearing. the lovestory between her an Solo was nice and warm. James Earl Jones voice for Vader absolutely perfect. All in all the movie was a pleasure to watch and gave plenty of emotions.The only flaw must have been the plot and the storyline. Luke, without any additional training, is suddenly a full blown jedi. Who doesn't use any of his force against the Rancor, but does so against Vader, only to lose everything again against the emperor. Strange.Weakened Vader was still strong enough to lift the Emperor and throw him in a shaft without the latter making any attempt to fight back. The same thing happened between Windu and Anakin in Revenge of the Sith; the most powerful jedi Windu powerless and defenseless when his arm suddenly gets chopped by Anakin and falls out a window. I guess he wasn't so powerful after all.Then the continuous fighting between Imperial and Rebel fighters; even though the emperor was dead and defeated, and Vader could easely have ordered to cease fire and surrender, the rebels keep fighting and eventually destroy the death star. A simple cease fire would have given the rebels a big equipped death star too. The cheering around the galaxy was also strange; even when the Death Star was defeated, why would the other Imperial troops surrender? They where still much much stronger than the small rebel army.I hope and Im looking forward to perhaps 3 following movies. Lucas is more than capable of doing so. However i hope he makes the story stick too. And stops using so many CGI effects. It gives the movie the look of animation like tom and jerry. Return of the Jedi, was imo, the best mix of puppets and CGI use.",

The physiological and physical war that goes on between Luke and Darth Vader is done perfectly, now only is is incredibly intense but it's also very Eye opening to see a more personal fight for Vader and we understand just how much the emperor has taken from him. The final three way battle against the empire and the Death Star is done just right because we understand just how much the characters need to rely on each other to succeed, all the arcs feed into each other and I found it to be extremely well done. Now I wanted to address in this review some of the most common complaints with this film and why I disagree with them, for one I thought it was an interesting idea to bring in a second Death Star because it created a new sense of urgency as we know from the get go in this film, the power that it possesses and I thought the way they destroy it in this film was better executed than in the original. While most people were willing to understand that complaint, the Ewoks are extremely hated upon when talking about this film but I really liked the idea of them and found it somewhat inspiring that they went up against the empire. The most powerful scene in this film is that of Vader funeral it was an extremely personal scene and thought that ten silence of Luke staring at his fathers bodies was extremely heartfelt and was a satisfying conclusion to the arc they have built across the series.",

            "content": "Return of the Jedi is a 1983 epic space opera/space fantasy film directed by George Lucas and is the third and final film of the original Star Wars trilogy. Return of the Jedi once again takes us back into the amazing world of Star Wars and continues the journey of the franchise's beloved characters. However, unlike the previous two which are considered two of the greatest films of all time, Return of the Jedi has a few flaws which unfortunately hold it back from continuing this impressive trend. While it does have arguably some of the most powerful and emotional moments of the original trilogy it also has both the weakest and at times even silliest, the main target for this are the infamous Ewoks which has divided fans, as a personal preference I find they add little depth too the story and at times are the cause for scenes to feel unimportant, unnecessary and often stall the movie, as well as the far fetched third act battle which adds my disdain for them. Another of Return of the Jedi's flaws is the inclusion of a second Death Star, which never seems to have the same weight, intensity and fear that the first injected in the Rebels and viewers alike, and primarily serves as the Empire's base rather than an actual powered battle station. However, many aspects in Return of the Jedi do succeed for instance the film once again expands the beautiful and fascinating galaxy of Star Wars also the hugely powerful final confrontation between father and son and finally the jaw-dropping battle sequences in the third act. The first act also shines through with a brilliant conclusion to the cliffhanger at the end of Empire. Many of the same brilliant and iconic shots and scores are continued in Return of the Jedi. However, again unlike the original and Empire a few shots and special affects do nowadays seem dated. Overall, Return of the Jedi is a brilliant and emotional end to the original trilogy-but not hugely satisfying due to the more immature nature of the Ewoks and the stalled pacing of the second act as a whole. Certain aspects and exposition of the disappointing future prequels did seem to seep into Return of the Jedi at times, but generally they do not hold back the movie and is still a thrilling adventure to be viewed by all. 7/10",

            "content": "I still give it an 8 because it's a fun movie. When more \"new star wars\" movies are made (and you know they will be) I hope Lucas hands off the franchise to someone who will start the next series *after* these classic films. Hey, the Dark Side didn't just disappear, and Luke could easily be tempted by the same lust for power that Darth was. There's still plenty of movie to be made after RotJ, movie that can't help but be more interesting than this dreadful (and pointless) prequel stuff we've been handed.As for the movie itself, well, let's just say the first part is great. I'll leave the Ewoks for other reviewers to trash. In the early going we get that fat slob Jabba at his best (worst), Leia in her unforgettable bikini, silly songs, ugly monsters, Han Solo shooting blind, and Yoda at his philosophical best. And, of course, Luke as the \"Jedi in Black\" who seems to be growing a great deal more sinister than this punk Anakin has managed so far. There's a kinda creepy sub-vibe going on in the first part of the movie, which shows that Luke may be more like his father than we thought. Lucas doesn't go anywhere with it (yes I know it was a different director, but if you think anything happens in a star wars movie without Big George's say-so, you're wrong). Lucas also doesn't develop the whole brother/sister thing with Luke and Leia which might have proved interesting given that Leia was just as Jedi-like as her brother. And you have to give him kudos for having Yoda die of old age. Don't look for anything as dramatic as that happening in any \"new\" star wars film. In fact, don't look for anything as interesting as the family dynamics of the original star wars, a key part of why the movies are so memorable, and what makes this one so good with the whole Luke/Darth battle.On a side note, I've never understood the apology for the Ewoks; that Lucas was making a more \"kid-friendly\" Star Wars movie. Coming after a half-naked Carrie Fisher, the Sarlaac (a gigantic carnivorous hole in the desert) and the death of the much-beloved Yoda, just what \"kids\" did George think he needed to pander to? Weird, and the primary reason why this flick seems to be two different movies--one brilliant, the other muppetish and stupid.Note to the \"New Hope\" and \"Episode 6\" people--gimme a break. This is the *third* star wars movie, not the sixth or whatever. Lucas had enough material for 2 1/2 great movies the first time around, and basically faked the last part of RotJ. Taken as a whole, it's great stuff. Don't try to ramrod it into the silly and fake six movie structure that the fanboys talk about. Star Wars, the Original Trilogy stands alone. These new movies have nothing whatsoever to do with the originals.",

            "content": "* Spoilers * 'Empire' may be the best of the three movies in the original Star Wars trilogy artistically, but ROTJ, in my mind, is and always was unsurpassed by the other two movies in terms of action and sheer scale. There's just so much happening in this movie as Lucas tries to wrap up the trilogy; there's the rescue of Han and ensuing capture and escape from Tatooine, then the resumption and conclusion of Luke's training, the planning for the assault on the second Death Star, the landing of the infiltration party on Endor, and finally the interleaved 3-way finale between the battle on the surface of Endor, the battle in space, and the final confrontation between Luke, Vader, and the Emperor. I think one of the main reasons this film is so overlooked in the trilogy is simply because of the Ewoks, which is a shame. That, in my mind, is something that can be overlooked. Yes, they are corny in some scenes, but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. And the ending is a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy - more so than most other sci-fi trilogies these days seem to be able to manage (i.e. Terminator, the Matrix). Who can forget that scene, with Darth Vader dying in Luke's arms...\"you were right about me Luke...you were right...\" It's just brilliant, and at the same time, a sad ending to a great epic story of finding one's purpose, not giving up, redemption, and the ultimate triumph of humanity and love over evil. Too bad Lucas hasn't been able to recreate the magic in the new trilogy, though (mainly because the characters suck, in my opinion). ROTJ gets a 9/10 in my book.",

The opener in Jabba's palace is excellent but the middle act is rather boring.  I won't beat up the poor Ewoks anymore then they already have been beaten up but I must also be counted in the \"this was a big mistake\" department.  Seeing Wookies (the original idea) throwing Stormtroopers around would have been the battle to end them all but we don't get it.  Indeed the presence of the Ewoks symbolize the major problem of the movie, it's utter lack of seriousness in many places.  After the near apocalyptic feel of Empire, this is just too much of a letdown.  On the positive side, the battle between Luke and Vader is great, symbolic and intense and the space battle is still the coolest and best overall space fight sequence I have ever seen.  It's the major joy of this film and it delivers BIG TIME.  Overall a major let down because the Endor sequence is just too hokey.  The rest is largely overblown because the Endor sequence occupies too much of the middle.  Still beats Episode One and Two by a mile.",

Many sequels are lackluster compared to the original, and like Empire, Jedi is not one of those movies! This movie is directed by Richard Marquand. It's really, really good, and it's massively underrated, just because of the whole Ewok ordeal! Not many people were disappointed by this third and seemingly final chapter, to the Star Wars trilogy, but the first two are still better! But it's hard to wrap the a highly popular trilogy up, with a massively awaited third installment! But we do have a very, very good Star Wars movie that wraps the trilogy up brilliantly, which deserves much more credit than it has received!Jedi takes off almost from where Empire ended, and the story is wrapped up from then! I like Jedi for many things! It's a Star Wars movie, it's got really good action, it contains many epic scenes and lines, it's exciting as hell and it's got great character development! One of the bad things about Jedi could be that it pacing is too quick for it's own good. Sometimes, when I watch it, it's like the movie moves really fast from place to place. But it doesn't mean much! The Ewoks however could have been the sole reason I only gave this movie a 9/10! I could have bought the fact that Wookiees were defeating \"The Emperors best troops\" but Ewoks? Come on! But forget the Ewoks, and the rest of the movie is completely awesome and exciting as hell! But is is the weakest of the original trilogy! But we're still a long way from The Phantom Menace, I can tell you that! Mark Hamill is good as always as Luke, and so is Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford in their brilliant roles! Darth Vader is also as epic as in Star Wars and Empire, but we have a new villain in Jedi. The Emperor! Ian McDiarmid is astonishingly creepy in the role, and he contributes to one of Star Wars' most powerful and epic scenes! We have nice appearances by Jabba the Hut and Boba Fett, as well as from C-3PO, R2-D2 and Chewbacca, which I haven't mentioned in my previous reviews!The visuals are much better in this movie, though! So is the editing, sound and music! The movie took home an Oscar for the sound, by the way!So in the end Return of the Jedi is not as good as the two others, but for my money... It's damn close! Not considering the Ewoks! The movie still has: amazing directing, great acting, powerful scenes, great character development, a great script and it's a Star Wars movie! And a damn good one!

            "content": "In preparation for the release of the highly-anticipated Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I took the opportunity to re-watch the Original Trilogy and refresh my memory. After going through the trilogy, I've decided that Return of the Jedi is my favorite Star Wars film. Why? How could it be? The Empire Strikes Back was a masterpiece! Here's why: This film brings a spectacular finale to the Star Wars saga as we knew it (It wasn't going to be for another 30 years until we were going to expect any cinematic continuation of this storyline.). To simply put it, this film was a great ending.This film contains the best dialogue in any Star Wars film I've ever seen. The scene I am referring to specifically is the one when Luke surrenders himself to Darth Vader and urges to him, as his son, to try to reach for the light side of the Force that he once possessed. Prior to this scene, all we had known about Vader was that he is the father of Luke and is a former Jedi who turned to the Dark Side of the Force to spread his reign of evil and power over the entire galaxy. That's all we knew so far. This scene captured the tragic character that is Darth Vader. It added depth and so much character history to the man behind the mask in one simple interaction. It spelled out the (dreaded) prequel trilogy backstory of Anakin Skywalker in few words.Should I mention the lightsaber fight? Like Empire Strikes Back, the film's cinematography was beautiful; the contrast of the bright, colored lightsabers to the shadowed, black silhouettes of our heroes and villains always gives me chills of excitement. I'll always remember the moving camera shot that heightened Luke's enraged domination over Vader; that fight was the most intense of the Original Trilogy.I don't understand the hate on the Ewoks; I love them. The point of the story was that the heroes were to befriend the local population of Endor (it could have been any alien species that just so happened to live on that planet) to help them finally defeat the huge organization known as the Empire. Any alien population, so why not make them look like ugly, cute, bipedal shih tzus? I wasn't bothered by Ewoks at all.Overall, Return of the Jedi provided beautiful closure for a saga to be remembered for decades, and perhaps for all of human history.",

It's rip-roaring entertainment, it's a work of amazing imagination, it ties up the whole of the Star Wars saga...hold it. I think I've got it: It ties up all of the Star Wars saga. Not just Episodes IV and V, but I, II and III as well, and we haven't seen II or III yet, have we?Return of the Jedi deals with far more complex issues than A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, which have such a simple-minded Frank Capra approach. Jedi seems to want to cover too much ground for it to handle. The other two films covered a tremendous amount of ground, but it didn't go overboard for the actors who were presenting us with this material. Jedi would have been that failure that did that if it wasn't so well done.I think the updates on this one were imaginative but unnecessary. I liked them, but I could have picked some things I would have updated, not added. That aside, I do love this film. It has a wacky musical-like feel to it, with elaborate and amazing scenes that involve either partying bounty-hunters, cute little teddy bears or spacecraft that consist of lights and lasers. Don't tell me this isn't a musical. If there were a zany side of the force, this was seduced by it.I guess I could have done with less of Han Solo in this one. He's unnecessary. I think Harrison Ford's performance needs to be digitally altered or there needs to be something that deepens his character a lot more.

            "content": "CONTAINS SPOILERSReturn of the Jedi is, in my opinion, a superb and fitting finale to the epic Star Wars saga.Picking up where The Empire Strikes Back left off, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, C3PO and R2 D2 all set off to rescue carbon frozen Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt.  Meanwhile, the Emperor and Darth Vader are secretly constructing a new Death Star more powerful than the first, aiming to destroy the Rebel Alliance once and for all.Widely regarded as the weakest of the original trilogy, the criticisms levelled at this film over the years are deeply unfair.  I will now attempt to counter these criticisms one by one.  First, some say the film isn't dark enough and that Han Solo should have been killed off (as apparently he did in an earlier draft).  This would be ludicrous as the film already has enough tragedy to balance the ultimate triumph over the Empire.  Killing Han Solo would have been wrong, plain and simple, especially after all the trouble our heroes go through to rescue him in the first act.  As for the film not being dark enough, the Luke/Vader/Emperor confrontation has some of the most intense and emotionally satisfying drama in any Star Wars film to contrast with the films brighter moments.Secondly, how much one enjoys Return of the Jedi depends on ones stance on Ewoks.  Depending on whom you speak, they are either annoying teddy bears or instrumental in underlining the point of the entire story.  I take the latter view.  The Ewoks symbolise the whole `David and Goliath' aspect of the story - ie the triumph of courage, imagination, and primitive technology over colossal technologically advanced evil.  Leaving that aside, the Ewoks are fun for goodness sake!  The slapstick comedy (such as the logs smashing the Imperial scout walkers) is brilliantly done.  What's more, the Endor battle has just enough of an edge to it to let you know its serious (for instance, there's a small and wonderfully understated moment where an Ewok mourns a dead friend killed by laser fire).The space battles remain the best ever put on film.  The Death Star battle in A New Hope remains better dramatically, but effects-wise these are better.  Considering it was all done with models and opticals they are nothing less than a staggering achievement.  Also, the speeder bike chase (making great use of bluescreen) remains as exhilarating as ever.  Compare it with, say, the chase through the city in Judge Dredd and it becomes clear this has never been equalled, even 20 years later.The performances are all solid (if unremarkable).  There are some lazy moments, such as the bridge scene where Luke tells Leia her true identity. Really that scene should have been played far more dramatically.  The film makes up for it instantly though, by following with a brilliant scene with Vader and Luke where Luke tells Vader `his father is truly dead'.  In that moment where Vader is left alone with his thoughts, you just know the turmoil going on inside of him, despite the mask.In fact, Darth Vader (voiced superbly by James Earl Jones) emerges as the best character.  (SPOILER WARNING AHEAD) - His ultimate redemption as he turns the tables on the Emperor remain as unexpected and exhilarating as ever.  This is, unquestionably, the most powerful and moving moment in the entire saga - especially in the poignant and wonderfully understated final scene between Luke and Vader (`just once let me look on you with my own eyes.').The 1997 special edition is actually my preferred version of the film, as it expands on the galaxy wide celebrations at the fall of the Empire, instead of reducing it to an Ewok night on the town.  The music has also been changed here to something more appropriate.  Instead of moving from Vader's melancholic funeral pyre right into the Ewok bash, the audience sees many other planets celebrate, including the Imperial capital Coruscant where the Emperor's statue is torn down.All in all, a brilliant ending and well worth 10/10 (take two points off if you don't like Ewoks).",

The end space battle is mind-blowing and the redemption of Vader is probably the highlight of the entire series. The trouble is, The Empire Strikes Back was character driven and the characters seemed real, but in Jedi they revert to the comic book caricatures that they were in A New Hope. In other words, ROTJ was a step backwards in character development. For example, in the previous film, Lando betrayed Han and condemned him to what could have been an eternity in carbonite. It would have been nice for Han to at least say to Lando \"Hey buddy, thanks for rescuing me.\" But no. Perhaps spending all that time in deep freeze scrambles your memory. Seriously though, it would have added a much needed depth to these 2 characters which is severely lacking in this film. And as for the Ewoks...well, they're not as bad as Gungans. In fact. I've got a lot of respect for any teddy bear that stands up to a stormtrooper.Score 2/5",

The new song is so irritating and the alien dancer/singer looks goofy. The little fur ball jumping around singing is plain stupid. In the original scene the song sounded cool and flowing, the alien characters are puppets, but are serious and cool looking. I went and bought the original Star Wars VI on VHS tape because that scene has been ruined. I think adding computer animation can be beneficial...or damaging as well.",

            "content": "Many feel that the first two installments of the \"Star Wars\" trilogy overshadow the final film.  I beg to differ.  At first glance it may seem this way however to the true \"Star Wars\" fan this film represents closure and a culmination of this incredible story.  The most obvious is the fall of the Empire to the Rebel Alliance.  In this film we also see the death of master Yoda.  To the casual observer Yoda's life ends in the first part of the film and Obi-Wan Kenobi passed away in the first film.  However looking closely at Luke in this film, we can see that Yoda and Obi-Wan are manifested through his thoughts and actions. \nHe believes that Darth Vader can be turned back to the good side because of the good that is still inside of him.  Luke pursues and exploits this conflict and in the end, the fall of the Emperor at the hands of Vader, is the final chapter in the life of Anakin Skywalker.  Luke had indeed turned his father back.  In this universal conflict between good and evil, the good side prevailed.  In addition to the confrontation of Vader, Luke's realization of Leia as his sister is critical.  In the final duel with Vader, Luke's thoughts of his friends, the Alliance and most of all his sister, finally convince him that he must confront Vader.  His initial reluctance to fight was admirable yet he knows that his sister will not be safe as long as Vader and the Emperor are alive.  \"Return of the Jedi\" also features Luke as a fully developed Jedi.  After he defeats his father, Luke realizes his ability and therefore in the eyes of the Emperor, he must die.  Meanwhile in regards to Han and Leia, we get the implication that there are feelings between both of them and they will end up together.  I seriously suggest that those who do appreciate what George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan have put together in this final chapter, take another look at it and look deeper into what is really going on.  Since before I can remember I have always considered that \"Empire\" was my favorite of the series, however now I can honestly say that \"Return of the Jedi\" has taken over.  It the final chapter in one of the greatest stories ever told.  Luke has come full circle.  He has become a Jedi Knight and Yoda and Obi-Wan continue to live and exist in Luke's actions.  The fall of the Emperor and Darth Vader as well as the turning of Anakin back to the good side are the historic events that occur during this saga.\"You were right. You were right about me. Tell your sister... you were right.\" -Anakin Skywalker",

While people claim this was the worst one of the three, I have to disagree.  I think all of the three films are good in their own way. The Ewoks may have pulled this one down a bit, yet there was still many aspects that helped it along. If you really think about it, the series could have gone to hell in the Empire Strikes Back when Vader said \"I am your father.\"  People could have been like \"What is this crap!\"  The majority could have thought as that being the corniest line, however, it worked, and the series became a classic. Regarding the prequels, I was too contemptious of the Phantom Menace to even consider it a real Star Wars movie.  It just doesn't seem like a Star Wars film without Luke Skywalker, Hans Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, C-3PO, R2D2, etc. (This is apart from the fact that The Phantom Menace itself wasn't all that great anyway...). Overall, there is no \"best\" Star Wars.  Their all classics in their own aspects.  (I'm only talking about the FIRST three...episodes 4,5,6)!",

Yes there are problems like the dance sequence original or special edition is not well done, as well as Boba Fett death is dumb, and while I actually like the Ewoks the scenes in the middle of the movie are slow. But their is a lot to love in Return of the Jedi the scenes with Jabba the Hutt and the criminal underworld of Star Wars adds more to the world and makes it more loved in. It also has the greatest space battle in the history of Star Wars and it still holds up today. Last but least it has the greatest scenes in movie history with Luke, Vader, and the emperor, just everything about from the sets, to the music, and the acting is pitch perfect and it rivals anything in A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. Overall Return of the Jedi while not a perfect movie is a perfect ending with all our characters happy and the galaxy is at peace after all this time it's just heartwarming to watch and best of all it feels earned after what everyone went though. Overall that is the why overall it's not best but my favorite Star Wars movie of all time. Overall grade= A-",

I've seen it a number of times since on video and in the theater (Special Edition Version).  I was so pumped up after 'Empire', and at the time couldn't pinpoint what let me down.  Some of it was characterization. Solo wasn't Solo, Luke didn't really seem to live up to the title of 'Jedi' - he had to be helped by Vader to defeat the Emperor. Probably everyone has movies that they daydream about re-writing the ending to.  In my ending for the movie, Vader tries to throw the Emperor into the power core, gets slammed against a bulkhead, the Emperer comes back to finish Luke, and Luke finally figures out what Obi-Wan and Yoda were trying to teach him, and is able to deflect the energy bolts and push them back on the Emperor, destroying him. I thought the Emperor came off kind of like the wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz - not as a powerful evil leader of the dark side.  He cackled a lot, and said things like 'well now, my young Jedi, watch your rebel fleet be destroyed, and your little dog Toto too!'. I kind of thought the Ewoks were cheesy, and yes, the battle scene in the forest asked that reality be suspended too much (two big logs coming together are going to smash an ATST and cause it to explode?).  I am looking forward to the three prequel movies, but now I hear what may be the unkindest cut of all. After all this, Lucas may not make episodes VII, VIII and IX because he says it would take too long, and he never had a story for those anyway.  So we'll get to see the prequels, though we know how those end up, but the finale to the series of movies will probably be the disappointing 'Jedi'. *Sigh*.",

            "review_title": "A strong finale to an awesome trilogy",
            "content": "Note: I am rating and reviewing the unaltered version, which goes for the entire OT. I haven't seen any of the \"Special Editions\" since the 20th anniversary theatrical re-releases, and I consider only the unaltered forms as THE Original Trilogy.After George Lucas made a splash with the first Star Wars, he and the studio were able to hire better writers, directors and crew members for future installments. A New Hope has the clunkiest dialogue and most simplistic storyline of the bunch, as well as the cheapest effects. The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi had bigger budgets, slicker filmmaking and more polished scripts. Each one expanded on the universe that Lucas created in magnificent ways (especially when we compare them now to the later installments).What strikes me each new time I see this is the deliberate pacing. A New Hope took its time, we all know that, but then it had to. It was our introduction to the characters and the lore, and it couldn't be rushed. The Empire Strikes Back was faster paced, except for the scenes with Yoda on Dagobah. Here, all the characters are established, yet the first half is very patient. Compare this to the Sequel Trilogy that seems so afraid to bore anyone under 13. And I love the deliberate way this movie begins. A large chunk of time is devoted to the rescue of Han Solo from Jabba's palace. Each character comes into the story gradually, and I especially love the way Luke is introduced. It creates a great, grimy atmosphere that the movie sustains for most of its runtime. That's one thing that the original trilogy really pulls off, and the later films aren't as successful at: the atmosphere. Each film in the OT has its own tone, full of atmosphere and grit. The great beginning at Jabba's palace perfectly establishes the right tone here, and even when the action starts heating up, and even when the cute Ewoks come into the picture, the movie never relinquishes that gritty atmosphere. The Ewoks may be cute, but they're intelligent and tough, and they fight in one of the biggest land battles in the franchise. And the battles of the last third are interspersed with Luke's dark, slower scenes in Palpatine's Throne Room.It's not a masterpiece or as tightly constructed as Episodes 4 and 5. A New Hope had a clunky script, but fortunately the plot was straightforward enough where it was still okay. Empire Strikes Back had an excellent script, and if there were plot holes and lapses in logic, I didn't really notice. Here, you have some cheap conveniences that hold the movie back, as if the writers knew how to build up an epic finale, but then didn't quite know how to stick the landing at the end. One of the most glaring is how Han's team on Endor finally takes out the shield generator. I don't want to spoil it, but it seemed too easy, and unrealistic. An enemy with any brains at all wouldn't have acted that way. Another clunky scene is when Vader approaches Palpatine about sensing Luke on Endor. First, Palpatine seems surprised and admits he didn't sense Luke, but right after that he somehow has already \"foreseen\" that Luke will approach Vader. Huh? The writers tried so hard to move the story forward in these scenes, and sacrificed some logic. Overall, I still believe the script here is less clunky than A New Hope, and at most, contains just as many holes and conveniences, but as I said, it seemed more excusable in Ep 4 because the story was simpler. Here, the writers try for a much more complicated plot, and in the second half, they were pressured to tie up the entire trilogy in a neat way. So the various coincidences and logic gaffes stood out a bit more as the grand finale seemed overly rushed.But that's close to nitpicking, because I'll be honest: I grew up with this movie, and have seen it, well, I don't know how many times now. It's endlessly rewatchable, as is the OT as a whole, and is a thrilling and rewarding conclusion to the first trilogy. So even if the script isn't perfect, or as tight as Empire Strikes Back, the writers and director definitely did something right, because the flaws don't fully dampen my enjoyment, or prevent this from being the classic it is.",

The only reason for watching this movie is the very reason I loathe the others:  STORY.  The resolution of the Father-Son conflict comes to a climactic head in this movie.  Maybe it's Freudian, but it's comforting to witness Luke's compassion and love for his father proving wiser than Yoda and Obi-Wan's \"kill him and let God glue back together the pieces of Darth Vader\" mentalities.  In the end, Vader saves Luke's life. Which, really, brings us to a conundrum, doesn't it?  Wouldn't LUKE be the one the prophesies foretold of bringing balance to the force (opposed to Anakin, as believed in Episodes 1 and 2, and stated in interviews with Lucas)?  Think: Darth slaughtered the Jedi and oppressed people for years! Luke, however, followed a path of enlightenment, and saved his father (and, by extension, the universe) from himself and the Emperor's grip!  This one aspect of the story was so well-done, I feel it saved the entire Star Wars run.",

Star Wars has been a part of my life for years.Times have changed, but I remember feeling like the characters in Star Wars were friends who I was on a journey with. Do you know the feeling? Like, if I'm watching Empire Strikes Back, or if I happen to stumble onto it on some random channel, I have to immediately watch Return of the Jedi.A few years ago, while at dinner with friends. A cinematographer asked me what my greatest movie experience was. Without a doubt, Return of the Jedi's opening scene, where Darth Vader walks down the plank... I remember the audience's ovation.The movies were fun then. When Return of the Jedi was released, I remember Vader's opening scene and the long lines. The lines for Jedi where ridiculous.Like many of you, I was expecting to feel the same magic, when the last three movies were released. It didn't happen. I could be wrong, but I think the most exciting thing to happen in the Star Wars universe, within the last 15 years, has to be the Phantom Menace TRAILER. I remember downloading this trailer from Kazaa and hearing the audience going crazy. For a split second, when I watched the trailer back in 99, it was 1983 all over again.As the years have passed, I've grown attached to films with similar themes. The hero, who takes off on a journey and has a similar quest to Luke. A few years ago, I sought out the writer of another favorite film, The Last Dragon.The writer, Louis Venosta revealed to me, that Joseph Campbell's book, A Hero With a Thousand Faces, was an intricate part of his writing. I had never heard of Campbell until this time. I would learn that Campbell was the author who influenced Lucas. In fact, Campbell has said that Lucas was his greatest student.After reading several of Campbell's books and meeting with Venosta, I thought about writing the sequel to the Last Dragon, but then realized that I needed to write my own story.As a native New Yorker, and someone who could have lost his life during 9/11, I felt that a story needed to be made. A new myth. I finished writing my first book in 2008. Over the last few years, I couldn't figure out how to get the story out to the people who needed and wanted to read it.Like many of you, I hate all of the remakes. I was watching EMPIRE OF DREAMS, the documentary of the Star Wars films and I see a comparison between the time when Star Wars was made and the current state of affairs in the United States today. When I was selling my book on the streets of New York, a passerby told me that there weren't any new stories since the Matrix.The name of my book is MASTERNEVER AND THE FLOW OF DEATH. You can download the entire book by visiting www.masternever.com I've included an entire soundtrack that accompanies the book. I hope you will download and enjoy the book.I hope you don't mind me posting here. After writing a book and several screenplays, I want to connect with people who have similar interest. The rest of the Star Wars babies. Those waiting for a new myth.I'm also posting here, because IMDb played a vital role in starting this journey four years ago. So, I've come full circle.You can see me talking about this book, mythology and stories, but visiting this video.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBwDNDWirSs",

            "content": "Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi is a classic science fiction film that has enthralled viewers since its release in 1983. It is the third installment of the Star Wars franchise and offers an exciting story with stimulating effects that truly bring the characters to life.The movie follows Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) as he attempts to rescue his friend Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from Jabba the Hutt while continuing his training to become a Jedi Knight. Along with this are several other plotlines, including the struggle between Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Darth Vader for control of the Galactic Empire.What makes Return of the Jedi so captivating is its breathtaking visuals, which acclaimed director Richard Marquand has masterfully crafted. The space battles are awe-inspiring, with large-scale dogfights featuring TIE Fighters and X-Wings weaving past each other in thrilling aerial combat sequences. Equally impressive is the speeder bike chase through Endor's lush forests, adding an extra layer of intensity to the proceedings.Of course, what would Star Wars be without its unforgettable characters? From Jabba's swaggering mobster demeanor to Ewoks' cutesy charm, these diverse personalities make for some incredibly entertaining moments throughout the movie. Additionally, there are plenty of familiar faces making appearances in Return of the Jedi, such as Admiral Ackbar (Timothy M. Rose), Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch), Yoda (Frank Oz), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), and Mace Windu (Samuel L Jackson).The film also boasts outstanding special effects that set a new standard for Hollywood blockbusters at the time. Featuring twice as many visual effects shots as The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi uses groundbreaking techniques such as motion control photography and computer-generated imagery to create stunningly realistic sets and locations that draw viewers into its world.What elevates Return of the Jedi above other films in its genre is its masterful storytelling structure. The main plotline involving Luke's journey intertwines with a variety of subplots - including Han Solo's daring escape from Jabba's palace - all feeding into one another until they reach an explosive climax during which our heroes must battle Imperial forces on both land and sea to save their planet from destruction.While some may consider it the weakest of the original trilogy (hardly a bad thing as all three are excellent), it's no wonder why Return of the Jedi has become one of cinema's most revered films over time; it's packed full of action, adventure, suspense and humor that will keep viewers on edge throughout its entire runtime - not to mention a satisfying conclusion that brings together all loose ends from previous films in this beloved series. With mesmerizing visuals coupled with captivating performances from Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford, amongst others, Return of the Jedi stands out today as one of the best works in science fiction filmmaking history - whether you consider yourself a Star Wars fan or not - proving once again why it continues to remain an enduring classic three decades later. 9/10.",

I've heard the arguments, and I agree that some things, such as the dialogue, are better in - for instance - The Empire Strikes Back. But I\u00b4ve never understood why the fantastic qualities that this movie actually has, aren't surfaced in the debate.\nWhat\u00b4s so good about ROTJ, then? Well, I must concede that my opinion might be based more on emotions than plain facts. What I appreciated in ROTJ when it came was perhaps most of all the incredible imagination it was built upon. For instance the first part of the film, which takes place in the castle of the villain Jabba the Hutt. The environment, the characters, and the incidents taking place there were all mind-boggling and awesome. And I still give the movie much credit for those scenes. Most of the special effects in ROTJ are - still today - simply incredible. Especially those in the speeder bike scenes, as well as those in the final space fight, which makes the scenes in A New Hope pale by comparison. Effects alone doesn't make a film great, but in ROTJ they help a lot.As a whole, the plot in ROTJ is a bit weak. What does work, though, is the wonderful build-up towards the inevitable fight between Luke and Darth Vader. The tension can be felt throughout the film, culminating in some fantastic scenes on the Death Star, when the Emperor shows his potential as a manipulator and persuader. He certainly embodies evil. The last 30 minutes or so of ROTJ is one of the most intense and fascinating sequences I\u00b4ve come across in a film.So, what is ROTJ most often criticized for?  I\u00b4ve overheard that the film is impersonal and illogical. Also, some fans dislikes the death of the popular character Boba Fett, as well as Yoda\u00b4s death. Another impopular scene is the one where Luke removes Darth Vader\u00b4s helmet. And then there are the Ewoks, the perhaps too cuddly bears living in the forests of the Endor moon. To me, those scenes perfectly portray the David and Goliath theme: size isn't all that matters. But sure, some of the criticism above is valid. Just don\u00b4t judge the whole film by that! Because ROTJ is a magic trip into another world, a fantastic spectacle, and an optimized end to the greatest film trilogy in the world.",

            "content": "Return of the Jedi is in my opinion and in many others' opinion the weakest movie in the original trilogy. Despite that, it has many positives.We spend a good amount of the film trying to save Jabba the Hutt. While I understand we had to spend some time with the rescue mission in order to make the events of the previous movie feel at all important, it still feels quite tedious due to how it isn't linked to the overarching story, which is defeating the Empire, in any way. Jabba looks and sounds incredible and Lukes fight with the Rancor is shot very well. Lukes rescue plan, however, seems incredibly stupid. The obvious green screen usage as our heroes are transported to the Sarlacc pit is quite distracting. The Sarlacc pit itself looks awesome.The rest of the movie focuses on the rebels trying to destroy ANOTHER deathstar. The outside shots of the new deathstar under construction are very nice looking. Also the shot when the Emperor arrives to the deathstar is great. Its interesting to see Darth Vader respect someone else so much that he kneels down before them. This makes Darth Vaders possible turn to the light side seem more plausible. Almost everything that happens on Endor is an utter catasthrope in my opinion. The presence of the Ewoks just make everything seem less serious and the shifts from Luke confronting Vader to teddybears throwing rocks at stormtroopers just take so much of the tension away. I really like how the camera and Luke and Vader move in relation to each other in the scene where Vader is taking Luke to the Emperor. Especially I love the shots when Luke is talking to Vader having turned his back to him and then Vader is talking to Luke having his back turned to Luke. Then Vader faces Luke when he reveals he is taking Luke to the Emperor after all. Just shows how difficult their relationship is and how difficult it is for them to share their emotions. The battle in space is very cool and I really like the shot where the camera follows the rebel ships as they enter deathstar. The fight between Luke and Vader is so great because of how conflicted they both are. Either of them could switch sides. I have nothing bad to say about this fight other than that the location is a bit dull compared to the location in the Empire Strikes Back. Luke finally seeing his dad face to face and accepting him was a nice way to tie their arc. The scene where Luke sets Darth Vader on fire was quite beautiful.This movie got a lot of criticism for some of the performances, mainly Harrison Fords. I have nothing to complain about his acting here instead I feel like this was the movie I liked his acting the most. What I don't like, however, is how every other main character other Luke has very little to no development. No matter how much I dislike the Ewoks, my main criticism for the movie is its writing. We spend almost half of the movie rescuing Han. Almost all of the other half is spent trying to destroy something that has already been done in the series. Easily the best part and the saving grace for me is the light- vs darkside conflict and Lukes arc that has been set-up in all three movies.While I think its easily the worst of the three, it still has enough redeeming qualities to receive the respectable rating of 6/10.",

            "content": "\"Return of the Jedi\" has some of the strongest and most poignant moments of the entire \"Star Wars\" saga. There are moments of chilling visual symbolism. The climactic space battle is extremely well-choreographed, possibly one of the most well done special effects sequences in cinematic history. And George Lucas does well on finding a suitable climax for the series. There is a minority that says this was a cheap thing to throw in but I totally disagree. This scene is sad but ultimately touching, which I think will be made all the more so when the six stories are complete. The ending scene in the special edition is far more satisfying than it was originally.Which brings me to my complaints.\"Jedi\" is slow-moving, from the long, drawn-out scenes in Jabba's palace, to the Endor battle with the Ewoks, an act in the film that is so poorly marred by bad pace and editing that you have to wonder whether the editors were suffering from severe attention deficit disorder while they were doing it. And let's not forget those Ewoks. Don't get me wrong, they are cute. But what in God's name do these little furballs have to do with the Force and the Rebellion?And then of course we have the acting. The one guy who seems to be really trying here is Mark Hammil (for once), who was never a very capable actor anyway but he does have some moments in which he shines here. I think what he did best in this one was actually underacting the role rather than playing the same old farmboy whiner (\"A New Hope\") or the hero who thinks he can do anything (\"Empire\"). Then there's Carrie Fisher. I actually thought she was decent in \"A New Hope,\" and she was occassionally quite beautiful in \"Empire.\" And she was attractive here as well, but man, that acting has got to go!!!I think this is the one film I did not really care for Harrison Ford, which is rather difficult because he is one of my top three favorite actors. Between the first two films we got the sense this character was changing, becoming a better man than the wisecrack we were used to. But in \"Jedi\" he's back to the same old wisecracks. In \"Empire\" he really started to look like he was caring for people, especially Luke- which is totally evident in the beginning of \"Empire.\" In \"Jedi\" he's already back to looking down on him. Above all Ford himself seems disengaged from the film, bored with the material- something he admits, and something I do not blame him for at all.Again, there are moments of greatness in \"Jedi.\" The score by John Williams is very good, some of the sets are impressive.These are the moments that illustrate to me the style that should have prevailed throughout the whole film.",

My only disappointment were the ewoks, as they were too teddy-bear like, and seemed to detract from the film's overall serious nature.  The story would have done better making the natives of Endor Moon more fearsome and less cuddly.  The highlight of the film, to me, was the battle between Luke and Vader, and the subsequent battle between Luke, Vader and the Emperor.  The setting of the situation, in both the original and the Special Edition, gave me a feeling of satisfaction, and properly influenced a sense of tension, as I fell all good films should do (I still think the Star Wars IV Special Edition Death Star explosion was tops).  Overall, George Lucas pieced together an excellent film, and I wish he'd used some of the concepts utilized in Return of the Jedi in Phantom Menace.

Yep, the beginning and the ending is the best of this movie and the middle (which consists of Ewoks on Endor) skin down the grading a bit.But that final fight between the trio Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and the Emperor makes it all up. I am completely captured every time I see it, I am excited and sad at the same time. The ending of the Star Wars saga is brilliant! Evil destroys itself, you could say. Luke doesn't do anything, only his being there is enough for Darth Vader to wake up from his dark sleep and tread the path of Jedi once again. The Emperor has lost and while Vader tosses him down through the reactorhole the  dark ruler claims his expupils life. So poetic. And when we finally get to see the frightening Vader's true face all we can feel is pity and sadness.

But the earlier films have built the characters and the fighting cause to such a climax that in the final scenes of this film with Luke and Vader you are left with sensory overload- because it all means so much to you. Acting as always is a top-knotch performance, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill deliver some fantastic roles, while the short appearance of Ian McDiarmid is a memorably acted. While some of the action scenes may seem a bit dated (such as the chase through the forest and the Rancor pit scene), this does not distract from the overall film and they are still enjoyable. With a great mix of action and plot, humour, and of course the classic good and evil battle, forgive me for saying.... the Force is strong in this one.Jas",

I agree that it's mostly due to the Ewok factor, but for me it's not the cute furballs themselves. It's the sight of a fully-equipped Imperial force being brought to its knees by a bunch of primitive antics that grates on logic. In a genre that calls for some suspension of disbelief, this is not too good -- bad even, for some viewers I suspect, so be prepared.That aside, this is a more than competent conclusion to this chapter of the Star Wars saga. George Lucas continues to keep it all moving along with his vision (a rarity nowadays among sci-fi film-makers), and production-wise you can expect improvements over its predecessors. The best scenes are those revolving around the Skywalker Jedi legacy, the well-done space battles, and of course the final confrontation that sees a long-overdue redemption leading to the inevitable triumph of Good over Evil.Despite its relative weaknesses, Return of the Jedi still stands as part of the one of the most accomplished and enduring trilogies yet.

He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first \"Star Wars\" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review \"Star Wars\" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to \"Star Wars\" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of \"Lord of the Rings\" or \"Star Trek\" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.",

The battle with the ewoks itself is the perfect way to round things up, it shows that the battle between technology and the more organically human (despite the fact that they look like freaks and talk gibberish) will always be won as long as there is determination, friendship and teamwork involved, as well as the temptation to avoid joining the dark side (isn't this what Star Wars is all about?)

It made some of the choice that I didn't like in empire strike (expect for Darth Vader telling Luke he is his father) seem tiny.

It could have made leia look like a damsel in distress or just not a confident person but nope they make her fight even more than begore which is good. But other than that, just was alright guilty pleasure. The rest of this film was so amazing that the first half looked okay but just okay. For example, the space battle was so good that just made me feel good and joyful and then rebels one it was an awesome still though, cool looking at the empire with awesome vehicles and ships and all. Also, the lightsaber battle was so great just felt like you were on your edge of the seat though I already have seen the movie it was still great seeing Vader turning after Luke finally understand why the Sith sometimes win. That the sith are not about love or compassion but evil selfish and angry and so gives vader an opportunity to finally defeat darth sidious once and for all ever since the beginning and really at exegol in the comics but with compassion more so than mercy. I also love the emperor in this and how ruthless he was and of course we know the next part of the story for him, but in the meantime, he will be shaking his fist at the skywalker family like Stalin in the real world. I loved the Ewoks just so cute and cuddly lol they are so cool hope we learn a lot more in canon. I loved everything at the end especially seeing the other planets the vader funerial and the force. Just a great end to part of the story but we have last part which will make this very interesting lol. Overall, i loved this film expect the leia slave scene that was cringe but over than that I loved the movie.And overall, the ot is an amazing classic trilogy it had a down but other than that i loved especially the Ewoks and hot battle and endor battle, expect maybe for the Leia slave scene that was cringe lol.

Yoda also has one of the best deaths in cinema history, and another scene I love is when C-3PO is telling the Ewoks about all of his adventures, and the other characters are standing in the shadows, realizing how old they've gotten, how far they've come and how much is still ahead. Oh yeah, and the space battle has no equal. I don't think this movie gets the credit it deserves...how would you like the saga to end?",

Having said that, it is some way behind the other two and the weak links are easy to pinpoint - Dance number in Jabba's palace, Ewoks and the repeat of the Death Star plot from Episode IV. But there are still so many more good points - The final confrontation between Luke and Vader while the Emperor looks on, the superb space battle scenes and the continuing revelations within the Skywalker family - these are all essential aspects of the SW mythology. Lucas' films were alays intended as adventures for children of all ages but to go from the dark, brooding (more adult?) second installment to this cuddly tale takes some getting used to. In the context of the trilogy it is an essential if weaker episode, while viewed on its own it is an epic, space adventure with few rivals. See it (As if you haven't already!) and decide for yourself.......",

            "content": "***********If you haven't seen ROTJ read this review with caution******* `What can you say about the final installment in the greatest saga since the bible.' Other then that it is truly one of the greatest pieces in cinema's history. Although I like to consider the saga as one great movie, Return of the Jedi is got to be my favorite Episode in the series. After Empire Strikes Back the Star Wars saga is at a crossing point, the rebels are showing signs of defeat, but have been strong enough to survive. It's difficult tell how they are going to defeat an empire so big. Like most films it's usually a crack shot chance that is thought up miraculously by the main character. George Lucas knew better then to follow with a random luck victory. The movie starts with two druids (C3PO, R2D2) entering Jabba's Palace; slowly Laia and Luke also show up to rescue Han. Luke goes to Jabba's Palace and fights off from being a nasty animal's meal twice.The group splits up and go their own ways, Luke goes back to Degabath to get questions, find out that he has a sister (Laia), accepts Darth Vader as his father, and watches the greatest Jedi ever (Yoda) die. The others head for Home One to plan for an attack on the empire, Lando Calrissian has offer to lead the attack on the Death Star 2, while Han has volunteered for the Endor mission. While enlisting his crew, Luke comes back and joins Han's mission. During this briefing Mon Monmeth explains the planning to destroy the empire and what great knowledge and sacrifices went into conceiving the plan. Han, Luke, Laia, and Chewy take a military squad and a stolen shuttle to land on the forest moon. The story unfolds brilliantly as the group of rebels, create an alliance with small seemingly harmless creatures. As mission on folds Luke tells Laia about their family ties and convinces her that he most surrender to Darth Vader. We think the alliance is making a surprise attack on the second Death Star but as Lord Vader brings his son before the Emperor we realize that the Emperor himself has set up the whole invasion. The Rebels are caught off guard and go into survival mode. After Han and his crew get captured the ewoks and Chewie use primitive tactics against the overbearing machinery of the empirical forces. Like the Revolutionary War and Vietnam the gorilla warfare destroys the superior power enemies. Luke thinking that the Rebels are hopeless lets his anger out and forms a duel with his father Darth Vader a.k.a. Anakin Skywalker. After Vader announces that his sister will be the next target that he will lure into joining the dark side if Luke refuses to join; Luke uses all his strength and hatred to strike down Vader cutting off his hand.\nThen only of the greatest scenes in motion picture history occurs, Luke looks down at his mechanical hand and then looks at his father whose hand he just cut off. With facial expressions and classical music we the audience knows exactly what Luke is thinking. That Luke is becoming his father it's at that point Luke has become a Jedi Knight and he refuses to be turned or to fight anymore. The emperor doesn't change his heart, he send lightning bolts at Luke's. Just has Han destroys the shield on Endor Luke cries out to have his father save him. Then out of nowhere Darth Vader picks up the emperor and chucks him down a silo. I won't even get into the end your just going to have to figure out how the ending is absolutely brillent yourself. This shouldn't be very hard; if you haven't seen Return of the Jedi walk down to your local video store and rent this masterpiece, but I warn you if you say you haven't seen it someone is going to start laughing at you.",

The battle between the Rebellion and the Empire reaches its final stage. Han Solo and the group fly to Endor to deactivate a shield which defends the reconstructed Death Star, while Lando and the Rebel fleet is preparing to destroy it once again. During all this, Luke sets off to confront his father.There are no major flaws, I don't consider the Ewoks flaws, I think the cute Endor bears are one of the charms of ROTJ. What I do consider a flaw is the beginning. I'm not going to spoil anything, I'll just say that the first 40 minutes could have been easily turned into 25. On the bright side, the movie finally shows us the Emperor in flesh and bones. I won't comment on the acting, special effects or music, we all know that they haven't changed, except for the special effects, which at the time were at their best. Overall, Return of The Jedi is the movie that isn't a masterpiece, but it's very close. the ending of the trilogy was and is a success. Final Score: 4.5/5 or 9/10",

Hayden put at the end of the DVD version now completes the story, reuniting him with his friends and loved ones in jedi immortality.besides the first half hour, which features early signs of the block of cheese that would plague phantom menace, this is the best now of the old trilogy for me.

I honestly hadn't seen the film since the orig version- I had bought the VHS set (used) of the \"special edition\" but had only seen the 1st film- I'd watched a few minutes of that version's Empire.... Other than the end of Jedi showing all the new \"celebration\" footage establishing the cities to be seen in Chapter 1 and 2, and the additional Bespin stuff, and the re-ghosting of Anakin ala Hayden \"I seriously need some actin' lessons George!\" Christiansen (in what might be said to be his BEST performance yet...) it was unchanged. And that means a big yawn. Jedi disappointed me on many levels- repeating the Deathstar, the scene where the Emperor is trying to do in Luke (with \"energy bolts\"- when will something replace the lightening effect?!?!) and the shots of Darth looking back and forth obviously in a nature brain lock of \"What do I do??\"- it could have been executed differently (I know- there's only SO MUCH expression one can give a big IL' dumb black helmet), the use of the goofy-ass giant fish guy as a commanding general, give me a break (GMAB!), the use of what-ever-the-crap-it-was-supposed-to-be as Lando's co-pilot aboard the Falcon. Geeze, George- Those last two were primo instances to exercise your obsession with CGI!!! And since Star Trek VI and a couple of films that overused it, that silly expanding energy ring got tired BEFORE you used it in the \"special edition\". At least continuity was maintained- BOTH 'splodin' Deathstars had it.... (although in Jedi you get to see the sucker expand past the viewer's POV- that was sort of cool). And he did add flames to a TIE fighter spinning out of control into a Star destroyer. Adding all the additional celebration stuff at the end doesn't help the film- the lethargic Pricess Leia performance goes unexplained (\"Oh Paul honey! Put down that guitar and pass me that doobie, or toss me a 'shroom button!\"), making Han look like he's regressed to some naive kid with very stupid lines, Luke returning to Dagobah to \"complete training\" after he's already told Jabba and the 'world' that he's a Jedi (and effectively demonstrated it in spades) was a weird plot device for what? Showing the casperization of Yoda. Whoopee! Hey George! That dropping blanket after der Yoda vanishes was some hot trick, dude.... Oh and how 'bout when the rescuers are entering Jabba the Butt's palace- here we have all sorts of guises- bounty hunters of every shape and size (staying in the shadows I noticed......why? Doesn't scum and villainy have a right to party openly with the fat sluggoid? Or are they too aware of the trapdoor to Rancor land?), even Leia, disguised by a 1953 Chevy AM radio headpiece (makes me wonder what fantasy of youthdom Geo. Lucas was hung up on in that design...), IS disguised, and in comes Big IL' backstabbin' Lando in some gawd-awful seashell and bones facepiece that looks like something Gilligan made up for the 3rd Halloween party on his island.... Geeze, Dude! You own and run a magnificent skyborn floating city that has fabulous wealth written all over, and you dig up this piece of Jawa poodoo?? Now, seeing Leia in a too brief (and I sincerely believe it could have been BRIEFER) beach outfit was OK, but isn't even the thought of Yoda and humanoidal women together a bit \"10 minutes past perverted\"? And George did add more babage to the whole Jabba's lair sequence proving once again the old Popeye film making maxim: \"Out of story substance? Add womens....\" The flying cycle chase(s) are fun, as is the use of the two-legged At-At's, but the whole syrupy teddy bear Ewok stuff? Again, <cough> GMAB. May the forest be with you.",

The final battle between Vader (my favourite character) and Luke is enhanced by John Williams' excellent music. Not all the creatures in the film are annoying- the opening sees the droids Threepio and Artoo travelling to vile gangster Jabba the Hutts palace. This is truly classic Star Wars.

But nothing beats the storyline whereby Luke finally accepted that Darth Vader was his father, that he also had a twin sister, and his attempt to bring Vader back to the \"good side\" (with the Empire also having ideas of their own on Luke). And seeing the destruction of the second Death Star as well as Anakin finally redeeming himself has definitely brought about a proper closure to the story, i.e. with the Empire's finally crumbling to bits after the deaths of both the Emperor and Vader.Of course, with Episode 7 coming out in a few days, let's see how the Star Wars saga continues then, with Luke, Han, Leia, and a new bunch of heroic + villainous characters!",

The full quote went: Luke:Do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Leia:Just images really, *feelings*.With respect to Hothfreeze from the chat forums you yourself said that realizing that most of the Star Wars plot twists (Vader being Luke's father for example.) were not planned from the start was an important way of understanding how the franchise worked. Since it is safe to assume that Leia's Jedi intuition -where strong emphasis is put on what they sense- that these feelings could be an explanation for the images even if that's not how it was originally intended... remember at one point \"Darth\" was actually Vader's first name.Anyway that's not what I have a problem with. Nor am I still hung over so much from the sloppiness in the surrounding details of Anakins transformation. My concern is that damn alternate ending with Hayden Christiansen! By the way don't be mad at Hayden it turns out that he didn't even know about it! This was purely a George Lucas goof he made in an attempt to \"connect the prequels to the original trilogy\". I use to think that George Lucas was not a dumb man but here he exercised such poor judgment that I am in awe. The ending was great up until that point... at least he got rid of the Ewok singing! (hallelaluke's a riiight) I'm starting a collection of all Star Wars movies but I wouldn't feel right with this one so if anyone knows of a way that I can get the special special edition with all the extra scene alterations except the Hayden/Shaw change please... pleeeease tell me how to get it. It would mean the world to me. Then *only then* complete will the series be. If not I'll have to settle the unaltered version and that lacks the scenes of celebration at the end with I thought were uplifting, and instead just shows the bond fire, but I'll go for that any day. Just as Jango Fett asked for a unaltered clone so must I ask for a unaltered DVD and I'm a younger fan so what does tell you about how the older fans felt?

Our main characters go to the forest moon of Endor to deactivate the shield generator of a second Death Star where the Emperor himself is on, giving a chance for the rebel fleet to destroy it however the Emperor has plans for Luke and wishes to make him his apprentice.The special effects and sets are, once again, fantastic. I've already praised them enough before so I won't bother repeating the same praise but expect the same attention to detail and high-quality found in the last two films. The action scenes are also very well done and epic, probably the most exciting battles in the entire series are in this movie. John Williams score is, as always, wonderful, and my personal favourite out of all the 'Star Wars' films.However, what I don't like about this film are the Ewoks, the native race of the forest moon who help the rebels. I'm not going to get into the whole debate on the Empire's best soldiers being defeated by a race of teddy bears (I actually think it makes sense since the Empire probably were not expecting them to attack and they have been likely using guerrilla warfare tactics for quite some time) but I do find them very annoying. They are suppose to be cute and funny, but the comedy just feels really out of place with random cutaways to them doing something really stupid and, to be honest, some of the costumes are really ugly but I don't really mind them as much as most people seem to do. I just wish the creators made them a little less comical.Overall, just like any of the original 'Star Wars' films, I find this to be a near masterpiece with very few flaws. Although not as mature as 'Empire' it is still very good and worth it if you like the first two films, although by this point you probably already have seen it.",

            "content": "Although still great entertainment, it is not quite on the same level Empire Strikes Back or Star Wars. Still, that is no slight on this movie...it is difficult to equal those two masterpieces-- they stand as quite possibly the best sci-fi action movies ever made. The costumes are great, the opening sequence on Tatooine is tense and exciting, and the final space battle blows away A New Hope in terms of scope and size. In addition, the emotion of the final confrontation between Luke and the Emperor/Vader is both cathartic and saddening, as finally the story comes full circle...as Anakin betrayed his Jedi brethren due to fear for his wife's life, so too did he betray the Emperor out of love and compassion for his son. The major themes and morals of the movie may be simplistic and childish to an extent, but it is honest and innocent in its message of love and trust over hatred, anger and fear; there shouldn't be anything wrong with that. More pluses - Yoda and Obi-Wan are back, confirming that Vader is Luke's father- and that Leia is his twin sister!! Han and Leia's love is fleshed out a bit and firmly established during the rescue of Han from Jabba's palace. The Emperor, played by Ian McDiarmid, is deliciously evil as well. This movie is a great transition. The first two movies belonged to Vader, especially Empire Strikes Back. This installment is about Luke's rise and transformation into a Jedi. This is his movie. One could argue that Vader loses this role because he has good in him - because of his inner conflict about his love for his son and his wish to overthrow the Emperor, as stated in the previous movie. Luke's burning of his father's suit is symbolic of this final destruction of Vader. His appearance with Yoda and Obi-Wan at the end is touching. Two negatives - the Ewoks and the ending. The Ewoks are too kiddie, and you can't tell me that the Ewoks and a few rebels could beat imperial troopers and Imperial Walkers in a fight. Also, the ending is a bit too kitschy - rebels and Ewoks partying in the trees? Please. Still these flaws cannot ruin this movie. A great finale to maybe the greatest movie trilogy ever.",

I liked the fact that we get to see more jedi scenes and more lightsabers compared to first 2 movies because let's face it, Star Trek is easily better if it wasn't for some little details such as lightsabers lol.Anyway, I'd say this is the best movie among the 3 oldest movies but there were some ridiculious screenplays in the movie that I haven't really faced in the first 2 movies. First one is that, they promoted the darkside as a great force for 2 movies but the weakest species like ewoks were able to almost single handedly take care of the troops and machines of darkside.Another problem was in the Luke's confortation scene with Darth Vader. The emperor tried to talk Luke into breaking bad by asking him to grab the lightsaber and kill the emperor ?? Well, eventually he did which I thought was kinda late. I could see Darth Vader interfering with it from the beginning. The father and son fought for mins as the emperor sayin' dumb stuff and enjoying 2 strong men tryin' to kill eachother unwillingnessly. It didn't seem genuine to me that Luke didn't go after the emperor few more times as he is fighting to his father, the real target was the emperor as Luke had little love for his father. It's even worse from Darth Vader's side. As we saw in the episode 3, Anakin was fooled by the emperor by giving a promise of saviour of his lovely wife and child from death which was forseen. But the wife died as I recall so emperor didn't really deliver anything. Plus, turning into darkside caused the fight against Obi Wan which led him to become a barely living armless, legless person who had to become a machine to keep living. So Darth Vader should have already betrayed the emperor after he was forced to fight with his son to death.Let's try another perspective, Darth Vader was evil, yes it had very little good in him but it was only against his children not anything else, so isn't it kinda non sense that he didn't think of becoming the emperor himself by killing the emperor ? An evil man would want to be the boss there is no exception. In the movie he acts as if he is so loyal to his emperor but why ? He was suppossed to be evil, evil doesn't really feel loyal except something is in for them ? What was in for Vader anyway ? I believe the whole darkside was kinda bold in the movie and that last fighting scene made me think of those things... In the end Vader acts as if he was suppossed to from the beginning but still feels luckluster for me. I mean how can a guy that smart act like that ? Only reasonable explenation was that he was careless of life, he wanted to die already.",

Also, we finally get a look at the great Emperor Palpatine, leader of the Sith Lords, and master to apprentice Darth Vader, now known as Anakin Skywalker.  And, once again, making his third appearance is my favorite underrated character, Wedge Antillies, leading Rouge Squadron on another faulously shot and fantastically made Kamikaze run.

They look like little Teddy Bears. As I said before, it all rounds out into a nice anticlimax, preparing for the seventh through ninth installments, which Lucas decided wouldn't come.

Amazing feat, considering he seems to stumble on minor obstacles anywhere else in the three movies. Oh well. Thats a minor detail, a much bigger, more annoying one is that the Storm Troopers gets knocked out by sticks and small stones thrown at them.

Tonight I watched them all again to refresh my memory of what it is all about to give a better viewing of Episode II: Attack of the Clones tomorrow night at 12 am. \tI initially saw Episode VI: Return of the Jedi on its opening weekend in Eureka, CA as a full fledged, but young movie aficionado of sixteen years. Hitchcock flicks were my favorite at that time.  Hitch is still one of my favorite past filmmaker with Hawks and Capra close seconds.  These days my tastes lean to Scorsese, Aronofsky and the Coen Brothers.  Coppola, Speilburg and Lucas are wonderful and very good, but to me are more great craftsman than great artists.  All have had artistic successes (The Godfather, Schindler's List and THX 1138), but I think they are better craftsman than artists over all. \tLucas is by far one of the greatest producers and craftsman of all time and has done more for true independent film and the medium of film than possibly any director/producer since Chaplin.  I also feel strongly that Jedi is the best Star Wars film thus far. It has tighter pacing, more realistic and fluid dialog and wonderful performances all around.  Richard Marquand probably has a great deal to do with this, but the experience of cast and crew may be the primary reason.  There was a fluidity in Jedi that the first one lacked, and the second one nearly reached, but not quite.  The cinematography was astounding with a mastery of the effects the first two pioneered.  The campy stuff was still there, but it was more natural and the cast was comfortable with it using it as a tool without stumbling over it. The cast and crew had found a chemistry that was remarkable for any film. \tThe \"weaknesses\" of any of the Star Wars films as pieces of \"art\", or even craft are dwarfed by their emotional impact and timing of release.  I was ten when I saw Episode IV: A New Hope for the first time (several weeks after it was released) and I had to share a seat in the front row with my younger brother who didn't like me much at the time.  Once the music started and the words rolled up the screen we didn't care and loved every single second!  All we told our dad when he met us out front afterwards was \"can we see  it again dad, can we see it again dad...\".  I saw it eleven time in the theater that summer including three time in a row on a great day.  This is amazing since my town had only one theatre/screen and it was exceptional that it stayed around long enough for me see it as often as I  did.   The Trilogy was the first VHS I ever owned (my mother paid $70 each in 85).  I saw Jedi only for times that summer, I had to work unlike in my younger days. \tMy point is that emotional attachment, or detachment to a film is as equally important to what a person may think of it critically as a piece of art, or entertainment.  I have loved all the Star Wars films and have seen them all except for the first one on its opening day and even the first show of that day with the last two!  All that said however, I wouldn't call all of them \"great films\".  Important and amazing films, \"Hell Ya!\".  Some of the best rides I have ever had, \"Hell Ya!\".  Worth watching all in a row every now and again, you bet. \tEpisode VI  is the most \"artistic\" of all the films thus far because it has the advantage of tons of rehearsal and chemistry to rely upon and the advantage of a creator/producer who is responsible to no one but himself and to a much lesser extent the fans.  I think part of  why Jedi is the best may be the fact that I knew that the \"Blue Harvest\" film shot near Crescent City (where I lived at the time) was really Star Wars III (episode VI), where they shot all the wonderful \"forest\" scenes.  I didn't watch them do it, but knowing it was happening and that the speeder chases were truly impossible (since I lived and played Star Wars in those woods for years), yet there they were right in front of my eyes in truly believable DeLuxe color (my favorite by the way) . This may be why Jedi still has the strongest hold on my heart!  I don't think that the story of Jedi is vastly superior to that of Empire, but it is more complex and deals with sophisticated things that I enjoy.  \tI am more into temptation, redemption and what is and is not destiny and how much control over such a thing do we have.  These things are more deeply explored and acted out in Jedi as is the love aspect of family, friends and romance.  A touch sappy in some spots and simplistic in others, but hey George always tells us that he is trying to reach your average twelve year old more than anyone else and these films do just that! \tLove one, love them all it is tough to chose in some ways, but Jedi has my vote.",

            "content": "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original \"Star Wars\" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first \"Star Wars\" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review \"Star Wars\" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to \"Star Wars\" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of \"Lord of the Rings\" or \"Star Trek\" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.",

At least it did have a great message modifying that technology doesn't always win wars again primitive or savages. SPOILER: In the beginning of this movie, Luke Skywalker arrives in Tatooine and defeat Jabba Hutt and rescue Han Solo. After that, we meet the Ewoks and yes we see them doing their cute battle thing. My favorite character, who no one never talks about during an interview or premiere, is the emperor. We see him as his deformed appearance and yes he's cranky, twisted, and sinister as ever. I just like supreme villains. My favorite scene was the conclusion when Darth Vader throws the emperor into the electrical shaft, which was beautiful. The light-sabers are primitive, not like the ones in the prequels so don't take it personal.",

            "content": "Return of the Jedi Completes One of the Greatest Redemption Arcs in Cinema\nThe never-ending war of good versus evil, and in this case the dark side versus the light side of the force reveals once again how sometimes it just takes the right moment to make a step in the right direction. Star Wars: Episode VI -Return of The Jedi (1983) directed by Richard Marquand, written by George Lucas, immerses us into a universe of gorgeous realms with new sentient life forms we could only dream of seeing, breathtaking moments between characters, action packed, fantastical sci-fi battles and the all too real-life feelings of being stuck and hopeless. Within this movie a recurring character feared among the galaxy, once a Jedi beaten and conquered by his emotions, has a final moment of light in his conflict of darkness within.Luke Skywalker must set course to his home planet of Tatooine to retrieve his stolen and sold comrades Han Solo, C3P0 and R2D2, with help from Lando and Leia, from the ruthless gangster Jabba the Hutt. Filled to the brim with criminals and slaves, Tatooine has few boundaries on what is illegal and pays little mind to the laws the Empire enforces. Tatooine is crucial to the development of both the story and main characters as both our hero and villain were born there, but that's not the only tie that binds them. A never-ending conflict continues to arise in the mind of the right-hand commander to the most terrifying tyrant in the galaxy, once Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight now Sith Lord Darth Vader. Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) was prophesied by a cult of space wizards too bring balance to their religion. Throughout the \"Star Wars\" series, Anakin Skywalker's life was a slave, then a monk, then the second in command to one of the most authoritarian, deadly and horrifying emperors in the universe. And in all that time he has never once been free and throughout this adventure of a movie the continuation of his inner conflicting emotions grows stronger with every waking moment seeing his son, Luke. \"I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new empire.\"-Anakin Skywalker (Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith).The gang kills Jabba the Hutt and successfully escape the narrow grasps of execution. Once escaped Luke feels he needs to know the answer to if Anakin is his father and travels to a dying Yoda who confirms his suspicions. While all this is happening, the Death Star's completion is being judged by the almighty Emperor Palpatine with Darth Vader. Palpatine wants Luke to join the dark side and to train among him. The presence of Emperor Palpatine is even more fuel to the ignited flames of the Galactic Republic's mind to start a mission against the constructing Death Star. Luke and his gang use a cargo ship disguised with Imperial code to go to a forest-like planet near the Death Star called Endor. Within Endor it is invaded with Imperial soldiers and soon conflict arises between our heroes and the soldiers. Leia is accidently left behind and the native creatures of Endor, Ewoks (fluffy bear-like intelligent bipedal creatures that are 1 meter in length) befriend. The Ewoks befriend the gang after being explained of the situation in Endor, theirs and the Death Star, and fight alongside them to save their planet and the galaxy.There was not only conflict within Vader, but Luke Skywalker. Darth Vader himself is his father and Luke wants to show Vader that there is light within him. As an act of dignity and compassion, he surrenders himself to the Imperial Army and is soon met with Vader and is guided to Emperor Palpatine. In the previous movie Star Wars: Episode V- Emperor Strikes Back (1980), originally Emperor Palpatine was planning to kill Luke Skywalker, however after telling Anakin that he may be his father he states, \"He is just a boy...\" \"If he could be turned, he could become a powerful ally...he will join us or die master.\" Although harsh, Darth Vader shows compassion and deep within does not want to hurt Luke.An inner fight invokes in Luke Skywalker of the battle of light and dark as he is shown a defenseless Palpatine egging him off to give in to his emotions of anger. Luke accidently does as he thinks he is shown most of the Galactic Republic dying and as he gets his lightsaber a fight ensues between Darth Vadar and Luke. This is the end and the beginning for Anakin Skywalker. As Luke shows mercy to Vader by not killing him and showing true resistance to the dark side, Palpatine then tries to kill him. Darth Vadar although unable to see his face due to his mask he continuously looks between Luke and Palpatine. Luke cries out for his dad, for the first time Anakin shows he isn't a puppet, a slave, he isn't the person he once was and kills Emperor Palatine. As the Galatic Republic is successfully destroying the Imperial Army and the Death Star, a weaken and dying Darth Vader wants his last wish to see his son. \"Luke help me take off this mask... Just for once let me look on you with my own eyes.\" The mask on Darth Vadar's face was helping him live, without it he will die. Luke wanting to save his father is given this shockingly beautiful response, \"You already have Luke. You were right. You were right about me... Tell your sister...you were right.\".Once the Death Star is destroyed the gang goes on a celebration to Endor with Ewoks among them is the ghost of the deceased Yoda, Obi Wan and a young Anakin Skywalker. He is not Darth Vader anymore. The chains throughout all his life are uncut as he truly opens his eyes to something more. Although Darth Vader is by all means not a nice character and person, he was still Anakin Skywalker and once Luke shown him that, it broke his shell, it broke him. He did not die as Darth Vader, he died as Anakin Skywalker. CLA.",

            "content": "Return of the Jedi concludes Mr. Lucas' fantastic Star Wars trilogy. The movie is not as well though-out as the first two but it is still an amazing movie on it's own. The directing and dialogue are also sometimes weak and forced. But the scenes with Vader and Luke are very intense. They make the movie worth watching to the final climactic duel. As such with the other movies, the action goes back and forth quite frequently. While this helped out the previous two films, this tends to hinder this one somewhat. Just as a scene is reaching it's peak it goes back to the 'Battle of Endor' and kind of slows down. The music by John Williams is very good and some new themes introduced like The Emperor's theme and the Endor Battle are a joy to hear. The visuals in this one blow the first one out of the water. The Sarlacc and Jabba might seem kind of cheap by today's fake CG standards. But they actually have stood up well, even 20 years later. The battle scenes in space are still great to watch as well. The only sequence that seems dated is the Speederbike chase, but it still is fun to experience.The only other complaint I have with this movie was the Ewoks were a little too cute and cuddly for my taste. I didn't like the ending too much, either. I don't always like happy endings and I felt this movie needed a darker tone to end it. But, that's just my opinion.Aside from the sometimes somewhat cheesy dialogue and cutesy Ewoks, Return of the Jedi is an awesome movie that ends one of the best trilogies ever made.",

Then finally there comes Return of the jedi to reveal it all and kinda get the real star wars action going on... it looks like the first two movies were just made to introduce it.I give all three movies 11/10 but the reason I'm saying this is because I think the order of these movies in the IMDBs top 250 is wrong. Sometimes when rating an adventure movie we tend to over think the deeper meanings in these films, when in a fact sometimes the truth lies in the entertainment value. But also thinking of deeper meanings I think Return of the jedi is actually the deepest on in the saga as it has the ultimate fight between good and bad.Return of the jedi is a one of a kind adventure/sci-fi/fantasy movie.

But it is still way better than any of the prequel films, the only one of which I liked at all being the third film (episode #3, The Revenge of the Sith).It gives great closure to all of the story lines they started in the first two films, with Luke and his father as well as the rebellion vs. the emperor and his empire, and Han Solo and Princess Leia. It's a fun movie with all of the action and comedy you would expect from the first two films and some new and very cute characters. Still it's not as good as the first two films but that has more to do with the fact that the first two films were so fantastic.

To put it simply it takes what worked from the other two and as a result the film was fun and enjoyable.The problems with this movie is what is wrong with the others in this trilogy. It still has hooky dialogue as well as acting, its still predictable, there are scenes that are over the top, and the effects are starting to show there age.In conclusion Return of the Jedi in my opinion is the most underrated, as well as best in the trilogy and I'm giving this one a 7/10.",

Does anybody else think it's \"far-fetched\" that the Rebel Alliance would let six (counting the two droids) people to try and rescue Han Solo, in the middle of this galactic war in which they were desperately losing, from Jabba the Hut? I'm not ragging on Solo or anything, because he's a bad-ass, but wouldn't duty, in this set of circumstances, come before friendship?Forgetting for a moment that at the end of ESB it's Lando and Chewie who go to Tatooine to rescue Han (do they get there, Lando gets off the ship, and Chewie comes back alone?), you have to assume that Lando was out there with Jabba for awhile. I mean, he had to establish himself as a guy Jabba could trust. That had to take time. I'm assuming Jabba just wouldn't let anybody work for him, especially in a position where the person would be in close proximity with a weapon. Also, isn't there a good chance that Jabba knew who Lando was, being a friend of Solo's? Or did Lando's brilliant disguise hide his identity well enough so that nobody on Jabba's staff would realize it was him?So, assuming that Lando was out on Tatooine for awhile (I don't know, a month or two), then Chewie flew back to get Leia, returned with Leia, they were both captured, etc, then Luke comes out not knowing that Leia and Chewie's plan had not worked and storms into Jabba's throne room with hundreds of henchlings looking to kill him. . .etc, etc, it probably took a lot of time. And from my understanding, the Rebels didn't exactly have a lot of time to spare. Aside from the Solo rescue being the most poorly conceived plot point in the trilogy, does anybody really think the Rebel Alliance would just say, okay, you six go out there, take your time, rescue Solo, because the war will wait? I mean, come on. Luke was the Alliance's (as far as all except Yoda and Obi-Wan knew) only person with any chance to defeat Vader and/or the Emperor. But the Admirals and Generals all said, go ahead, risk your life on Tatooine to get back Han Solo?",

Technology definitely had come some length from the first movie. The movie still heavily relied on human acting and emotinons, yet still maintained comical seriousness. But there is something about this film that just doesn't live up to the first two.I know a lot of people dislike the Ewoks. I do agree that they take away from the seriousness of the situation. Lucas did not direct this one either. The acting and storyline is still phenomenal and great.All the cast does a great job at portraying the characters. Yoda and Obi-Wan still offer guidance throughout. And Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford are at there best.It definitely is a great Star Wars movie and great way to end the trilogy. But it burns me up so much to see that Lucas has went back and \"added\" CGI effects to the original trilogy. It ruined the prequels. I guess Lucas was just not satisfied with them. The original three could not get much better. And it makes me so mad to see Hayden Christianson at the end of this film replacing Sebastion Shaw as the ghost of Anikan Skywalker. I hated seeing him in the prequels. Lucas just wants more money I guess.",

It's easy to summarize this movie, first they go to Jabba's Palace for about 40 min. then Luke's of to Dagobah, the strike team on Endor,Luke surrenders, Battle of Endor. Now most people say they hate this movie because...then they list some technical comments like they were an avid critic!! Yoy! It's my favorite because of one thing: The Battle of Endor. On the ground, the Empire;s \"best legion of troops\" never had a chance, but in space you see the battle turn once the Executioner goes down. The lightsaber duel revealed a little too much of Vader-not enough fighting compared to ESB (even that didn't have enough)I was surprised how quickley Vader got worned out..oh well. The actual Death Star run was nothing like ANH but it had 2 other things going on and didn't provide that much drama. All in all this is the movie you should watch before you go see Epsiode I this summer-it's the most modern (of Eps. IV-VI) and has the most ties to the prequels. My rating: ***  (3 and a half) out of ****",

The first time I saw this it immediately became my favorite movie off all time. I watched it every week for a year. Then I began to look at it critically. It's not the best Star Wars. It's not the best movie ever made. It's still my favorite though. The idea that Darth Vader can be saved is the reason I hold above the other two.   This film wraps up everything nicely. Han Solo is rescued from the bowels of Jabba's palace. Luke returns to Yoda. Luke confronts both Vader and the Emperor. The puzzle comes together. Luke changes so much from the end of ESB to the beginning of this film. The battle with Vader at the end Episode V caused Luke to finally grow up. he becomes his own man. He becomes a Jedi. Darth Vader also has been changed by the confrontation at Bespin. We see Vader as more of a human figure, he's not just this evil machine. He was once a man, a teenager, and a little boy. We feel sorry for him. He's just a pathetic half-man in a cumbersome suit.At the end of the movie you actually care for him. You feel impacted by his last  words on the Death Star II. When you see Anakin with the ghosts of Obi-Wan and Yoda you are relieved. Anakin Skywalker has been saved. Looking at this critically there are a few things that are a step down from the past two films. Harrison Ford seems to be bored with the job of Han Solo. The Ewoks seem like unnecessary addition to make the film more kid-friendly. As the original trilogy was being made it grew up. Star Wars was swashbuckling adventure. Empire was a darker more operatic film that added turmoil to the story and true emotion. In Jedi the most feared man in the universe is saved by his own son. He becomes a father. A lot of the originality seems to be gone because we're used to the material by now. Still this will always be the Star Wars that gives me hope. If Lord Vader can come back. Maybe we all can.",

The story moves along nicely through this wonderful fantasy universe highlighted with sweet FX from the geniuses at ILM.  The climax where Luke finally turns to the dark side and attacks Vader is on my Top 10 list of all time great scenes.  Truly a stroke of cinematic storytelling genius.  Bad Points:  Well, by now, some flaws are bound to manifest themselves. \"More of the same\" is ironically bad as well as good.  Sticking with what works is fine, but there's really nothing new here.  It's more cool looking ships, weird aliens, climactic battle scenes, and the whole good vs. evil jazz.  Also, older audiences will roll their eyes when the Ewoks make their appearance.  I understand Lucas wants to make Star Wars enjoyable to all audiences, but I think the Teddy Bear thing is going a little too far into the cheese dip.Bottom Line:  Not as a good as the first two Star Wars movies, but definitely worth watching.  I mean...if you've sat through the first two, you may as well see how the whole thing ends, right?",

Then make a plan to destroy Death Star II, land on planet Endor, and create new alliances with Ewoks (yeah, honestly would've been better if it was Wookies, but it's fine), then Luke meets his father; Darth Vader (formerly known as Anakin), then confronting Emperor Palpatine (Darth Sidious) and dueling his father and ultimately defeating him down to the ground, really one of the best scenes in cinema.

And what about the roughest, toughest bounty hunter, Boba Fett, flirting with a B A C K U P S I N G E R? Noticed how I capitalized and spaced backup singer? Well, the four backups, 2 drummers, 2 winds, and 1 green thing playing a wind pipe are TOTALLY Unnecessary EDITIONS TO THE COOL ORIGINAL 3 MAX REBO BAND MEMBERS! Max Rebo on keyboard, Droopy McCool on flute, and Sy Snootles on vocals were good enough to perform an entertaining show for Jabba. Again, I DO NOT recommend the \"Special\" Edition to anyone.As for the Original Edition, however, everything looked FINE. The effects in this one were obviously the most mind-blowing of the First 3, and even the weird puppets look fine in Jabba's Palace. And Lucas thinks he can replace that marvelous slime-ball puppet with a new \"better\" Jabba in Episode 1 and, dare I call it this, Episode 4 \"Special\" Edition?!?! Again, Lucas makes himself seem quite stupid with CGI junk in his Original movies. The acting is top notch, and the best would definitely be Ian McDiarmind as Emperor Palpatine. Every scene that he graces in this movie is awesome. And I know people will bash me for this but... I don't care about the Ewoks! They do what they're supposed to do fine, and are there for one reason: You don't need Technology to defeat an Empire. I actually like the Ewoks. Again, John Williams creates the perfect score, and this time the soundtrack has my favorite Star Wars track on it: \"Luke and Leia\". I LOVE that song! Overall, I kind of recommend the DVD's (Return of the Jedi has awful picture quality, could be my TV) but NOT the \"Special\" Editions.

However, it is not quite as good as its predecessors, even though it is inconceivable that one could watch and enjoy those two films and then not see Return of the Jedi.The good:1. Jabba the Hutt. Yes, he's obese, slimy, nasty and gross. But he also helps to flesh out the Star Wars universe (no pun intended) by showing us that there is more than one type of evil here, and the Sith and Imperials aren't the only bad guys our heroes have to contend with.2. Boba Fett. I wrote a review of The Empire Strikes back and forgot to mention this fan favourite. Shame on me. However, there is more of Mr. Fett in this movie. He appears to meet an ignominious end, but I have it on good authority he escaped.3. Obi-Wan is a liar? I won't give away the spoiler even here, but certainly in this movie we begin to realize that while the Jedi are on the side of good, they are not saints and are not above deception to achieve their goals. And that is certainly true of Obi-Wan himself. This actually sets us up to find the events of the Prequel Trilogy less shocking but more palatable than they otherwise might have been. 4. The Battle of Endor in space: tremendously exciting and suspenseful. It is all practical special effects and frankly they are superior to the CGI effects of the Prequel Trilogy space battles.5. The Emperor: a stunning and chilling performance, which reveals the bigger bad and ultimate evil behind Darth Vader all along. \"Do not underestimate the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate you will.\" Luke ignores this advice of Yoda, and soon comes to regret it.6. Darth Vader's redemption; one of the most dramatic and suspenseful moments in cinematic history, and ultimately one of the most emotionally rewarding.The indifferent:1. Luke and Leia are twins. I would say this is cool except...one can't help but think of that one scene in The Empire Strikes Back. \"I guess you don't know everything about women yet.\" And then...ewww...only now do we realize the ewww factor between Luke and Leia ever after.The bad:7. The Ewoks. OK, as a kid I loved the Ewoks. Watching again as an adult, I still think they are cute. But for them to go from just assisting the Rebels in their infiltration of the Imperial base on Endor, to actually defeating an entire legion of the Emperor's finest elite Stormtroopers using stone age technology? Oh dear...I'm afraid that's just completely silly, to the point that I almost feel like Graham Chapman's colonel from Monty Python's Flying Circus should march into the battle and say \"Stop that! This whole scene is completely silly!\" (Bonus points if you get that reference.)In conclusion - overall this is a worthy conclusion to the Original Trilogy, and certainly emotionally satisfying, but it doesn't quite hit the high points of its predecessors.",

John Williams is an award winning composer and created the score for other famous movies like Jurassic Park, Super Man, Jaws, Close Encounters with the Third Kind, and Indiana Jones. If you want to sample his music you can listen to a compilation by Moosebutter called Star Wars on Youtube. Return of the Jedi is the best Star Wars movie. There are furry creatures called Ewoks that are funny and adorable. There are intense lightsaber duels. There is a major plot twist that will blow your mind. If you like good movies I know that you will like this movie. I have no idea why you wouldn't like Return of the Jedi! The one reason you may not enjoy this movie is because it is a Sci-Fi movie, but it isn't like your typical sci-fi movie with killer aliens trying to take over the world. It is about freedom from an overpowering galactic empire and man's struggle with good versus evil. The movie has a great storyline with good acting and pretty cool special effects. Richard Marquard was an excellent director and guided the actors expertly. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher were perfect actors to play their characters. James Earl Jones displayed his unique talents and became an icon as the voice of the dark sith lord Darth Vader. Everyone should see this movie because it is a great source of entertainment, it has many Wilhelm screams which are my favorite, and the plot and acting are fantastic. Star Wars 6 is a movie with epic space battles and insane lightsaber duels that you will be thinking about for a long time.

Given what we've seen to date in George Lucas' prequel trilogy, \"Jedi\" was a harbinger of what was to come: increasingly hyper-detailed CGI landscapes populated with sketchy characters. Nonetheless, this did bring the original trilogy to a satisfying, if uneven, close. The battles raging on the forest moon of Endor and in the heavens above the new Death Star, spectacular as they are, really take a back seat to a smaller- scale conflict involving Darth Vader, the Emperor, and a young Jedi that both are trying to bring over to the Dark Side of the Force, Luke Skywalker. It's this aspect of the story that gives the movie's title (which has a few meanings) its resonance.Oh yes, there are major complaints here. There's hardly a memorable image or scene to compare to what we saw and heard in the two previous movies; the dialogue is often dull when it's not forced. The Ewoks, while embodying one of Lucas' original concepts for \"Star Wars\"--primitive warriors overcoming advanced technology--are at times just a little too cutesy. Worst of all is the neutering of Han Solo, who doesn't have a tenth of the swagger and brashness that made him stand out in what are now called Episodes 4 and 5. But all in all, as a resolution to the conflicts laid out in the first two movies, it gets the job done, and is still measurably superior to what we've gotten thus far in the prequels. As to the changes made for both the 1997 \"Special Edition\" re-release and the DVD, they're of a piece with the modifications to Episodes 4 and 5: some are effective, some detract, and some are of little consequence. Most controversial, of course, is the substitution of Hayden Christiansen for the late Sebastian Shaw in a brief visit by the spirit of Anakin Skywalker (the younger actor plays Anakin in the second and final installments of the prequel trilogy).

I'm not saying that some parts are not weak, but it is not by any stretch a bad film.This time around the focus of the story is very much on a few specific characters, rather than all of them. One character that I really felt that should have had more screen time was Han Solo, who is missed for quite a few scenes throughout the film. Another reason that this film is slightly lacking is that has repeated many elements form the first two films, rather than a new story focus. (Another death star assault and another visit to Dagobah) Although this does sound like a slight turn off after the first two entries of the franchise, it is still a great film which capture all the fun and magic from the first two films. It may not be as deep, emotional or dark as the last film, but it's still tremendous amounts of fun to watch and brings an incredibly satisfying end to one of the greatest film series of all time.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/",

The whole Ewok tribe scenes are boring, and the whole \"Leia is your sister\" is predictable and is far from as shocking as the famous \"I am your father\" scene.But once the Battle of Endor begins, it feels just like another Star Wars movie again. The whole scene is fun, with Han and Co. leading an attack on the Impirial bunker, while Lando and Wedge lead the attack against the second Death Star.But the highlight of the film is the final battle between Luke and Vader. This battle was different from previous fights, maybe because it seemed like neither wanted to kill each other, and appeared to be an analogy of the conflict between father and son.Also, another highlight was the (true) introduction of Emporer Palpatin, the real bad guy.Plus the Max Rebo Band was funny.Jedi was a fun addition to the Star Wars saga, and is well worth a look.",

Composer John Williams Has again outdone himself with a stand alone score. Beautifully written and composed. George Lucas just keeps getting better with every film he makes.

The musical score is top notch as ever, but I have to say that I much prefer the track 'Victory Celebration' from the film's re-releases than the song 'Yub Nub' which was used in the film's original celebration scene. I just find 'Victory Celebration' to be so much more ambient as everybody celebrates and reunites, and what a reunion scene it is, but once again I'll let you find out for yourself, though I am aware I could click the 'spoiler alert' button.But yes, the creative imagination of George Lucas returned with 'Return', so let's hope for the best for the future of the greatest Sci-fi series ever made!",

            "content": "When talking about Return of the Jedi, it's impossible to discuss the movie without mentioning its two versions: the original one released in 1983 which was a touch of genius and the digitally restored version released nearly a decade and a half later. Recently, Lucasfilms has launched a DVD release that contains both versions; original and digitally restored. That's one big mistake; you can now compare them at your leisure in the coziness of your home. Digitally restored, my butt. Digitally meddled and messed and demeaning are a list of more proper descriptions of what Mr. Lucas did to its work. Most of the changes in the second version were disruptive at best; a few were interesting to see and they complement and flesh out some details but only proving out that Mr. Lucas was only stupid and/or lazy enough of not doing them from the start, marring one nearly perfect film. Other changes were totally disruptive, showing that he doesn't care of his fans' memories and he's more than willing to alienate any possible new following. At the end of both movies it's a big celebration sequence: The original one was plain though heartwarming; simple yet self-contained. In the digitally restored mess, this same sequence loses the carefully timed rhythm of the first version and adds footage that only rabid Star Wars fans would get and tolerate. The Cloud City and Imperial Coruscant sections are to be understood only by those who have faithfully followed the series from the very start. One final note: with this dual DVD release, Lucas made another terrible mistake. He didn't provide us with nice and clean copies of the originals; they're not restored, they're scratched, dusty and a few frames were distorted by age. The digitizing was lousily done, allowing for some heavy flickering in some scenes. And yet somebody ought to tell Mr. Lucas that I'll cherish its original work with all its flickers and flaws and put it in a place of honor in my film collection. His updated work will be more useful as a Frisbee for my dog.",

            "content": "Let me say at the outset (and the onset of TPM), that I am a devoted cinephile and a fan of Star Wars, so much so that even now I am waiting in line for May 19 tickets to the Ziegfeld Theater in NYC! Nevertheless, my being a fan of the series does not blind me (as others have been)to the fact that Return of the Jedi simply is not a very good movie at all.What the majority of ROTJ apologists in this posting do not take into account is that ROTJ is a film first and foremost and must be judged as such.  Plot, character, color, and pacing all have something to do with it. The only thing that carried this film (and the only thing that we all can agree upon) were the special effects.  The acting, dialogue, and plot were weak in the extreme, IF you could manage to look past the Star Wars gloss. I lay the majority of the blame at Lucas' door; he was the executive producer and had total control of the proceedings.  Marquand's directing, however, did not help.  The sad part is that Lucas betrayed his own myth and his own enterprise by producing such a clunker.  Events in the Star Wars universe were building to a fever pitch in the vastly superior Empire Strikes Back, and then all the air was let out with ROTJ.  If good taste and the fabled Lucas genius had been working during the production, rather than greed and the fabled Lucas business sense, it would have been a much better movie and actually worth all the kudos it has received.As if anyone needed proof of the elements that undermined this disappointing movie, I'll list some: The Ewoks.  The awful dialogue.  The upstaging of Darth Vader by the Emperor.  The habitual stupidity and consistent blundering by the Imperial forces (it really makes you wonder how they ever consolidated their Empire, doesn't it?)  The unbelievable destruction of the Executor.  The well-nigh cynical tone in the Luke/Leia/Han exchanges.  The under-development of every single character in the movie. And the number one reason why this was a kid's movie, instead of an adult one, was the lack of sacrifice required of the Rebels to win this war.  Let me get this straight: the Rebels lose two ships, some fighters, Yoda, and an Ewok or two, and the Empire is obliterated totally?  Well, that makes sense!  And now we have a Disney ending!  After all, there are sales quotas to be met.The few good points?  Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor--absolutely the only reason to see ROTJ; he's fantastic even though the repetitive and shallow dialogue lets him down.  Yes, the special effects:  the speeder chase, the destruction of Death Star II, the space battle.  The costume design.  The set design.  And the only scenes that moved me in the slightest were the Luke/Yoda farewell and the re-uniting of Han and Chewbacca.The outrage here is that if Lucas, Marquand, and their collaborators had given their audience any credit for brains at all, this would have been a much better movie.  And it could have been so easy, since Lucas had set up the last movie so well.  It was a no-brainer, and they blew it.  Oh, don't get me wrong:  of course the movie made a pile of money (and thus could be considered a success), and was a hit with the less-than-discerning general public, the kids (to whom it was marketed), and the die-hard, see-no-evil Star Wars fans.  Was the movie fun?  Yes.  Was it a dramatic work of art? Why even ask?Of course, this is a culture where Titanic wins Oscars, and fluff is substituted for substance, but it does make me think that I AM on a different planet when the IMDb user comments for ROTJ discuss the \"emotional father/son lightsabre battle,\" \"beautiful direction by Marquand,\" \"brilliant editing,\" and \"Hamill's thespian talents.\"  I am as anxious as anyone else to see TPM, but after reading comments like these I get the uneasy feeling that even if the new movie is of the same quality or worse than ROTJ, no one will care and any critical faculties will be left outside the theater.  And that, like ROTJ's artistic failure, is really too bad.",

The ewoks just, why?Etc, however, despite its flaws, return of the Jedi is still my favourite Star Wars movie; it still encapsulates what's so good about Star Wars. And this movie sets a very good example for young directors, there's the cinematography, the story, the conclusion, and actually how to write characters, if you analyse it, it can remove that nervousness that most young directors have about writing movies, and it's not as impossible as they think it is.Back to the ewoks from before, the ewoks aren't as cancerous as, say, the \"minions\" ugh, there actually not bad as people say they are though I wish they still weren't in the movie, they're obviously just there as products.I wanted to make this review as spoiler-less as possible because it's still a great film and an excellent execution to one of the most gripping, immersive sci-fi movies I've ever seen, pure beauty.",

            "content": "I understand that many people love this film which is great! However, I believe that this is the movie where many of the problems I have with the franchise begin.To start off the pacing is just awful. The beginning of the film goes on for way too long (Jabba's palace and the Sarlaac pit), the only non-tedious parts were the throne room scenes, and it started the idea that everyone has to be related or connected.The most obvious issue I have with this film is that it is boring. It manages to waste a lot of time with Jabba and his cronies, and then with the Ewoks on Endor. Return of the Jedi does not feel like the final film in a trilogy, it wastes so much time and only feels satisfying in the scenes with Luke and Vader.I should also say that I think that Han Solo should have died in the last film (as that was the original intention) because he does not have that much to do in this movie. He does not have clear utility. It undoes the work of Empire to have more of a happy ending which undermines the entire idea of the previous installment in the franchise.I'm not saying that this trilogy should not have come full circle with a more happy ending after the disasters that occurred in Empire, but it should not have had Han survive only to kind of help the Rebels and not even blow up the Death Star!Which leads me into another problem. There's another Death Star. Instead of breaking new ground like Empire, Jedi decides that it is too difficult to find a new way to raise the stakes and resorts to copy the efforts of the original movie.Another thing to mention is Luke and Leia being siblings. This is what I meant when I said that this was the movie where a lot of the problems began. Everything has to be connected now. Everyone has to be related. This problem comes up within both the prequels an the sequels.All of these events are essentially window dressing for the actual story and struggle which is the final confrontation between Luke and Vader. Which definitely brings the film up a couple notches in my eyes. Luke's struggle is continued upon in this film and even almost has him fail, nearly killing his own father after he said he wouldn't fight him, but ultimately resisting the Dark Side and refusing to fight. The love for his son is what turns Vader to the Light again and saves him from the powers of the Emperor.His death scene hits it home with being redeemed despite all he had done and ends off both he and Luke's arcs well.This is the only portion of this movie that I believe to be great, and it is a shame that the rest of it was mediocre at best. This to me was the beginning of the end of Star Wars (except the Clone Wars, good stuff).I give Return of the Jedi a 5/10 with the title of \"Mediocre.\"",

There was a time when I was three or four years old, I watched it like twice a week, I almost remember every line from the characters, every shots, every scene. Since I was a kid, I thought that this is the best film ever.. I love this movie so much especially because everything in it is very very cool, Luke's green lightsaber, the final duel between Luke and Darth Vader, and mostly because my favorite fictional character, Darth Vader's heroic death.. Now that I'm older, I can seemore great aspects of this film besides its \"coolness\". Han Solo's(Harrison Ford) and Darth Sidious's (Ian McDiarmid) acting was trulyterrific.. Harrison Ford truly lighten up this movie by some degree of comedy, since Luke's character has transformed to become more mature, patience, and serious. Ian McDiarmid as The Emperor also did a terrific job, he is portraying Darth Sidious as the most twisted dark villain in my life, as we can see there isn't anything good left behind The Emperor, it is just pure SITH, pure dark side, evil and twisted. The mirror lightsaber battle, DjemSo v.s. DjemSo by Vader and Luke is the most magnificent and greatly choreographed duel at that time, and the development of Darth Vader's character from the dark side back to light is done magnificently, in my opinion much better than his transformation from Annakin to Darth Vader in The Revenge of The Sith. Darth Vader also shows a great moral value, that however bad your sin or mistake was, there always a chance of redemption. Finally in this movie, the greatest villain of all time got the redemption he deserves.However, I must admit this is not the perfect flawless 10/10 movie like Schindler's List or Lord of The Rings Return of The King. There are some flaws in this movie. One fatal flaws that all of us- Star Wars fan regret is how could Gorge Lucas end his double trilogy with a war between 1meter-tall monkey and Imperial Stormtroopers? How could the primitive Ewoks beat all of the modern Elite Trained Strormtroopersw, therefore doomed all of the Empire, a feat that a fully assembled Rebel Army never could have done.. Aside from those idiots Ewoks, this is a very great films.. Definitely better than Star Wars I or II.. Although maybe from performing arts points of view this film is the worst of all Star Wars Original Trilogy, it is still the film that I watched many many times, the film that grow up with me, and teach me how great it is the world of cinematography and performing arts.",

Managing to escape from Tatooine, the heroes are sent to help disable this Death Star's shield generator. This leads to the inveitable final confrontation, as Luke battles Darth Vader for the last time as the Rebels engage the Empire's vast fleet and legions. ROTJ isn't as serious as EMPIRE, and lacks some of that film's character development. While Mark Hammil is given plenty to do, Harrison Ford's Han Solo is reduced to a watered-down version, sort of a slap in the face after Ford's turn in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Carrie Fisher suffers from the same problem. However James Earl Jones is still in top form as Vader, and Ian Mcdiarmid is excellent as the Emperor, the puppet master behind everything, whose role has been expanded in the prequels.   Still, it's a fun Star Wars film, worth seeing for the final battle alone, the enormity of which is only topped by the LORD OF THE RINGS films.

Oh, boy !What is wrong in the prequel INMHO : - the whole \"human factor\" element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - The Force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults, than about wisdom - Too many Jedis at once and too many Light Sabers on the screen - The lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot By the way, if you enjoy the theory of the Force as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, then you should read a few books about Buddhism and the forms it took in Ancient Japan.The magic of Star Wars, IMHO lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice, from a father to his son, albeit the difficulties. \"De mon \u00e2me \u00e0 ton \u00e2me\", (from my soul to yours), as would write Bejard to the late Zen master T. Deshimaru.",

The space battle remains to this day one of the most iconic. And the whole throne room scene is pure brilliance; the emotional weight surrounding it is what really takes the scene to another level.

The film has aged reasonably well, however. The tone here is again different from either of the first two instalments of the trilogy, becoming a shade more like 'Star Wars' then the darker nuances of 'The Empire Strikes Back.' The wondrous imagination that has been a hallmark of the series remains, as does the beautiful score. There is much here to enjoy.The resolution of the film may not be to everyone's taste, but for the most part, the characters do appear to come to their fates in an organic way that feels emotionally true. It would be a miraculous fate to have satisfied all fans, but 'Return of the Jedi' plays out well and the story begun in 'Star Wars' is finally and ultimately completed - all of the plot threads that had been weaving through the films feel as though they have been resolved, for better or for worse.The original (1983) version remains the superior vision. Much has been done to the film in its various re-issues and little of it has improved the viewing experience. As with 'Star Wars' before it, some of the digital eye candy is pretty, but the cost of seeing the film suffer from stilted pacing and burdened by unnecessary revisions does not outweigh the benefits of its enhanced visuals. 'Return of the Jedi' is a triumphant conclusion to a great cinematic trilogy and rightfully the last film in the series.",

            "content": "The final installment of the classic Star Wars Trilogy, Return of the Jedi isn't exactly what many people thought would be. A new, more powerful Death Star is being made, while Luke, Leia, Lando and Chewy try to save Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt as a decoration. After saving not only Han, but everyone from Jabba, Luke returns to Jedi Master Yoda. The film, like Star Wars, starts out a bit slow and gets uninteresting in some parts. Granted, the make-up and costumes were kinda cool, but the lack of anything going on except deals and Jabba getting angry at the guards made the movie quite slow.The shield of the new Death Star being made is located at a forest called Endor, where they aim to destroy the bunker that supports this shield. After a chase involving Speeders, Leia meets and Ewok. This is the part where Lucas decided to make the film feel more kiddy and added these unnecessary creatures. I didn't find them annoying, but the inclusion of their characters in the final film of the Trilogy is one of the most unnecessary things to Star Wars along with Jar-Jar. These small things throw rocks at Stormtroopers, to which they easily fall down and never get up. The whole scene was completely unbelievable and quite weird. It hardly became any fun at all.Leia being Luke's sister was a pretty lame twist. It's like they added it to make sure that Han and Leia would be together no matter what. The film hardly had time for the characters and decided to just have lots of explosions and bears running around. It completely forgot the magic of Star Wars and decided to be a visual effects treat, cause, you know, that's what final installments of epic Trilogies like this should be. Hardly anything important happen to the characters. Hardly any drama goes between them except for Luke and Darth Vader.The final space fight felt flat and forced, since so many new characters suddenly appear and the audience simply couldn't care less about their fate. Well, except for Lando, that is. Granted, it was more colorful and lots of different kinds of fighters are thrown in, but it just felt like one big mess and hardly exciting at all. Some of the effects even seem dodgy at some points, especially the Star Destroyers crashing and blowing up.The best scene in the film would probably be the final Lightsaber fight between Darth Vader and Luke and what proceeds after that. Now that Luke knows the truth, he isn't just fighting some evil monster that kills many people: he's fighting his own father, for the life of his sister and friends, and the future of the whole galaxy. After almost defeating Darth Vader, Luke decides not to kill him, since he can still sense the good in him. But the Dark Lord of the Sith has other plans, and nearly kills Luke with his power. As Darth Vader watches his son in agony, he then decides to save his son and kills the Emperor. What then proceeds is the last moments of the half-man, half-machine Darth Vader's life, previously known as Anakin Skywalker. The death of Darth Vader is simply the most emotional scene of the whole Trilogy, and one of the best.Return of the Jedi is a very, very flawed film. But it's moments like these in the film that make it worth it. It's still entertaining to watch, and the characters we love are still here. The final steps of Luke is done, and the whole galaxy celebrates as the Galactic Empire is defeated, once and for all One of the better changes in the film, where in the original ending, the Ewoks sing a song called Yub-Nub.

What was their plan? It makes very little sense. I know this has been said before, but it is a genuine problem. However, it is fun so I don't hate it, just wish it was better thought out.Next, the Ewok Village on Endor. I personally don't hate the Ewoks as much as everyone else, but I don't like them either. I find them to be mildly annoying and wish they weren't in the movie. I found myself to be bored a lot throughout this chunk of the movie, as there were very little actually interesting things going on. Overall, not very good and slightly boring.Lastly, the duel between Luke and Vader. This is amazing. Easily the best part of the whole movie. Has the best \"character\" scenes and maybe the best lightsaber fight in the entire Saga. It ends in a satisfying and climactic way that left me with a smile on my face. Great.I do have other flaws with the movie, but if I were to list them all, I'd be here all day.Overall, the movie is just pretty good. Not bad but not as fantastic as its two predecessors.",

I was 9 when I first saw it and 7 when I first saw \"Empire\"; and of that movie all I really remember, from when I first saw it, is the huge fight between Luke Skywalker & Darth Vader at the end of the film. I never saw \"New Hope\", when it first came out, because I was considered by my parents to be too young, which is probably fair enough, as I was only 4 at the time. Anyway, as I now own the DVD of the trilogy, I can now watch them whenever. :-DBut to get to the main point of what I want to say, I do wish that George Lucas wouldn't keep fiddling with the movies all the time. Fair enough to tsuj them a bit with regards sound etc, and at a stretch, the special effects too, once, for the re-release, although, for the most part, I can tell when Lucas has added CGI characters etc, and it doesn't look right, because it's not the same. But now Lucas has tsujed them again for the DVD release. Temuera Morrision re-voicing Bobba Fett in \"Empire\" I can probably live with because of his role as Jengo Fett in \"Clones\" & consistency etc, although the person who did the original voice must be a bit annoyed. But to have a different Anakin Skywalker; Hayden Christensen(?), appearing at the end with Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi seems to me to be somewhat unnecessary, not to mention rather complicated. There are now 4 people appearing as/voicing Darth Vader/Anakan Skywalker in the one movie. David Prowse & James Earl Jones doing Darth Vader, as per usual, Sebastian Shaw doing Anakin Skywalker, in the scene where Luke removes Vader's mask & helmet, and now Hayden Christensen(?) doing Anakin Skywalker in the scene right at the end where Anakin appears with Yoda & Obi-Wan Kenobi. 4 people doing basically the one character appearing in the one movie???

However, Return of the Jedi often gets labelled \"the weaker one\" in the original film franchise. For the most part, arguments are made that it could've been better: It should've been the Wookies on Kashyyyk, not the Ewoks on Endor; the finale should've have been on the Galactic Capital Coruscant, not a rehashing of the Death Star, etc. It could've been better, but that is saying A LOT, because what we got was terrific in the end.The epic finale takes place one year after the cliffhanger events of ESB: Luke, Leia and the gang arrive on Tatooine to save Han Solo from the reviled Jabba the Hutt. Meanwhile, the Empire and the Rebellion prepare for an epic battle that will decide the fate of the galaxy, as Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine arrive to see the final construction of the new Death Star.The film leaves no loose ends, and wraps everything up rather neatly. After two movies of mention and build up, we finally meet Jabba the Hutt, and boy was the wait worth it! The illustrious gangster, that seemed to be the only thing Han Solo worried about, is a slimy, slug like creature who threatens Luke and the gangs very survival. Also, after mention, and a brief holographic cameo, we finally meet the man behind Vader and the Empire: Emperor Palpatine. The definitive embodiment of evil, Palpatine is the only figure Darth Vader answers to, and become the final, ultimate challenge for Luke in his quest to revive the Jedi.Several things really make this film stand out. Unlike the previous two, which show exuberant, youthful performances by Ford, Fisher and Hamill, the cast seems worn down and tired this time around. While some see this as a detriment, I always viewed it as a sign of how truly serious the peril is for our heroes. The Empire nearly destroyed the rebellion in the previous film, Han Solo was missing, and Luke had just discovered Darth Vader is...well, you know. Such experiences really have hardened our once hopeful protagonists, who have one final chance to defeat the omnipresent enemy, and bring back peace to the galaxy. It really shows great maturity, particularly in Luke, who was a simple, perky farm boy with big dreams when we first met him.But perhaps the strongest part of the film is the characterization of Darth Vader. For the first time, we really see a tragic, conflicted individual who ultimately comes back from the darkness. A fascinating and fitting ending to one of cinema's most legendary characters.In all, Return of the Jedi cemented the Star Wars series as one of cinema's greatest feats.",

Second, it is the most well written film, and yes, there are parts that aren't that good, but everything else makes up for it in the end. This also gave better character development for both Luke Skywalker, and the main villain Darth Vader. The portrayal of the Emperor is very evil and creepy, and no other villain in any other film had been portrayed like this. Even the controversial Special Edition of this is good, although it may still have flaws. The ending score at the end of the Special Edition to me is better than in the original, but the musical number in Jabba's palace would've been better if they had kept \"Lapti Nek\" and not added \"Jedi Rocks\". So on the whole, to me, this is the best film out of the entire Star Wars saga, and I will defiantly watch it right after I send this review.-Mason Morgan (Malcolm of The Marvelous M)",

            "content": "My favorite movie of the original trilogy. It feels much more personal and human than the first two, which were in my opinion primarily focused on space battles.The space battles themselves would never have been able to elevate the Star Wars films where they are now. It was the characters that made it what it was, and I'm glad this movie focused on developing the characters of Luke, Leia and Vader more than the first two.I honestly didn't enjoy the space battles in any of the first three movies, that is of course because of me growing up with movies with better special effects. However, that's not my only problem, especially in this movie. The final space battle took place at the same time as the lightsaber fight between Vader and Luke. That fight meant so much more for the film and felt much more important than a ton of spaceships firing and missing all the time. The fight was much more tense and overall more interesting than whatever was happening elsewhere.Mark Hammil remains my biggest problem with the whole trilogy. His acting was just as bad as in the previous films (Daniel Radcliffe at least got better over time). He more or less just says his lines, he doesn't seem to actually feel anything. Compare that to Harrison Ford or Carrie Fisher, who actually put on good performances. Ford manages to do that even with minimal screen time especially compared to the first movie.Another big problem was Palpatine's death. The greatest force in the whole universe thrown over the ledge like a ragdoll. That was actually pathetic.Next big problem is Richard Marquand, who puts no personality into this film at all. No vision, no style, barely any memorable shots or sequences (just one from the final swordfight comes to mind).A lot of people seem to dislike the Ewoks in this movie. I actually found them likeable and cute, but I get it.Overall, this film passed by more quickly than the first two, mainly because I found it's content more interesting and the finale actually exciting.",

Back in those days Star Wars nerds mostly identified with Luke or Han and all loved the Princess, but Chewy identified with Chewbacca. Chewy may have been related to Chewbacca as he was tall and angular, had the same color hair with long bangs, glassy look in his eyes, not very verbal and would release mournful groans, but was a really good guy and was someone you'd want to go to battle with.The movie was exciting with lots of action and terrific special effects and the little furry guys were fun and fierce. I never understood the allure of the Storm Troopers because they weren't intimidating or productive.I booed the ending and then started laughing when I realized all the Star Wars nerds who identified with Luke would need plenty of counseling. It was a terrific movie up to then.",

In the enhanced versions at the cinema this was the only one i could sit through without the slight feeling of dissatisfaction.  Its a couple of key scenes in the film which make it so great.  The Jabbas palace bit at the start of the film and the Throne room scenes at the end.  Its seeing the end result of how Luke has changed across the two previous films which i love; from a farm boy to the powerful warrior.  I don't think there's any call for another three sequels when Return of the Jedi finished it all with such a dramatic ending.",

            "content": "This is a strange movie that is the antithesis of \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" While 'Empire' was dark and moody, \"Return of the Jedi\" is as light as a feather.  All of the tension and suspense of the last movie is gone here. The story moves more slowly, the character tension is mild and the overall mood is playful and goofy.  \"Jedi\" is pure fairytale, but unfortunately, the characters in the fable aren't very interesting.Coming on the heels of Empire's cliffhanger ending, Jedi raises more questions than answers.  The first, why are people as powerful as Luke, Leia & Lando having so much trouble freeing Han from an overweight, greedy Jabba the Hutt?  This scene shouldn't of taken a 1/4 of the movie to get done. Second, why is Luke suddenly all polished & somber like?  In the last film, he was really struggling with his future.  Third, why are Lando & Han suddenly best of pals?  As Empire ended, Han wanted to kill Lando for betraying him and his friends.  Now, in \"Jedi\" they are best of friends.\nAfter the rescue scene, the movie's tone was set.  \"Come on get happy.\" Everything was played for fun from then out.  The Ewoks, the space battle & Han & Luke's time on Endor.  Even the evil Emperor comes off like the wicked witch in the \"Wizard of Oz.\"  Only a tamer version.  I admire George Lucas & co for trying to create a modern day fairytale.  Unfortunately, the final product doesn' turn out to be that captivating.  The acting has no soul, the scenes are forgettable, and the dialogue is unoriginal.\nThe only true emotional pull of the film comes from the character tension between Luke & Vader.  Mark Hamill really makes these scenes touching with his heartfelt pleas to his father to change his evil ways.  Unfortunately, this scenes are few and far between. In final, this film should of been a lot better.  A disappointing conclusion to the original trilogy that only grows worse with the passage of time.",

I had never before realized just how right she was.  If one views the whole saga as the story arc of Anakin Skywalker, the title makes a lot more sense.  The pivotal moment of the series becomes when Darth Vader throws the Emperor down the shaft, as Anakin Skywalker redeems himself and returns (albeit posthumously) as a Jedi.  One of the few flaws I found in this film was the Ewoks, but even that can be excused when viewed against the story arc of Palpatine (the Emperor).  A terrific villain, we see how in the first two (presumably three) episodes how Palpatine is able to manipulate persons and events to his liking.  That the Ewoks provide the means of defeating his Empire shows how, in the words of another great saga, \"small hands do great works because they must.\"  I can almost hear Master Yoda saying \"This is the hour of the Ewok-folk, when they arise from their quiet forests to shake the towers and counsels of the Wise.\"The only other flaw I found was the chemistry between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher from the Empire Strikes Back seemed to have been replaced with poor dialogue and too much a transformation of Han Solo into a wise-cracking boob.

But ROTJ has that special epic-ending touch. You can feel the victory, how they're finally free in so many aspects such as literally free from the Empire or reedemed from their actions in the past and fulfilled destiny. Clear example of this is Vader and Luke. We can agree that this trilogy has the cliche plot of a hero about to go into an adventure and fuilfilling his unavoidable destiny. But the way this saga uses is so epic. To watch one of the best villains of all time find his redemption is so satisfying. You cannot see his face, and this makes it even more amazing to understand the character. Just feel the character. See that behind allthat black suit and mask there's a reaaly good person that got his point of view blurred by a bad choice.\nAll this along with the master John Williams on the score...pffff...EPIC. There are a lot of underestimated pieces in this movie such as the one played during Vader and Luke's final duel. This song is literally tellling you that this is the one scene that will define once and for all the destiny of the Force. But it also tells you all the conflict that is going between father and son. And even though the lightsaber duels in the latest movies have a lot much more of acrobatics and action, I'll keep with this duel as my favorite one. Visually and emotionally is breathtaking. The green and red clashing in the dark backgroundis visually epic.The VFX were also pretty good for the tiome this movie was filmed in. This movie has got as well one of the best space battles in the franchise. It looks way better even than some actual-time CGI scenes might look. So, yes, the VFX this franchise have may have turned quite old but just a little. Every time I watch it I get stunned by how good it looks even nowadays.",

            "content": "Contains spoilers.Return Of The Jedi is terribly underrated. It is the best SW film of the OT; it is not only better than both Hope and Empire, but even more superior to Empire than Empire was to Hope. The plots in the film are even more complex this time. The subplot with Jabba was brilliant: you never would expect Luke to have planned a trap and how he slowly sets it is complex and very interesting. The main plot with the fight against the empire is great and has the amazing twist it was all a trap. The characters are deepened even further with Vader having peaceful conversations with Luke, Han finally becoming kind, Luke becoming a Jedi Knight and a real thinker, Leia becoming more motherly, the actors totally master their characters. The action dwarfs that of the previous films with fast complex moves, the sets and costumes are even more elaborate.Most of the complaints about this movie are downright awful. Jabba looks perfectly real with a detailed most organic skin and moving eyes and grotesk and legless, is very alien and therefore otherworldly and scaring. The second Death Star made sense cause, since it was only taken down because of a minor weakness the first time, the empire would logically try to make an improved version of it. The characters being more serious makes them more intellectual and therefore deeper. Lastly the Ewoks could defeat the empire cause they were smart, they used the speed of the speeders against them, and attacked the weak spots of the walkers (the legs), and they couldn't be shot cause they had terrain advantage and were hard too see in the forest.",

Luke becoming a Jedi master on Degobah. Then the amazing third act. Luke and Vader's final battle, the battle on Endor with Han, Leia, Chewie, and the Ewoks against the storm troopers. And of course in my opinion the greatest space battle of the Star Wars saga. I remember when I was a little kid, watching that space battle and how I was amazed by it.

But 9 year later my option is a lot different. 40 minutes does not make a movie. I still am not 100% sure why I do not like ROTJ as much as the other 2 (not including TPM). There is just something missing. Maybe it's the Ewoks that were just in it for merchandising and I think that did let the film down a bit. Like you go from Empire which is really dark to teddy bears running around killing stormtroopers. Sorry, but it's too unbelievable. Another thing I haven't understood is the Space Battle. When The Rebels come out of Hyperspace I reckon there's probably about 15 capital ships at most. Ok yeah they blew the death star up again (something new would of been good) but Surely the Empires fleet could wipe out the small rebel fleet after the death star was destroyed. Then as the falcon has blown up the death star u see about 30 rebel capital ships flying away from it...sorry if u think I am being picky but there are a lot of flaws here. I can understand if people get bored of the movie for awhile. It starts of slow and after killing jabba too the last 40 minutes it's quite slow. Oh the last one is finding out Luke and Leia are brother and sister. And straight away you think of them sharing a kiss in Empire. Plus there was a more passionate kiss cut out as well (thankgod). The acting wasn't the best, I think Mark Hamill tried too hard, and Harrison Ford seemed really uncomfortable at times and was nowhere near as good as in Empire (maybe it was being around the ewoks) On the positive sides though, there are some extremely good battle scenes. I thing some scenes were well written where Luke told Leia he was her brother and then straight after that with Vader talking to Luke. I guess it's a little bit of a let down from the other 2. You just expect a better ending and justifying. Although the special edition ending was a lot better then the original. With a lot better music to end it then that silly ewok song. In the end I'd give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5.",

I think all great stories are built on characters and personalities, and Star Wars certainly is built on the duality of the good guys vs. the bad guys, but redemption is vital to this one very much.Darth Vader is humanized at just the right time.  We see the Empire collapsing and the Death Star about to explode and right at that split second the Father realizes what is truly important in life.  Let us not forget that this IS a Hollywood type ending and not a George Lucas type ending.  I think had George Lucas intervened a bit more, the quality in the storyline throughout ROTJ would have been on par with the first two installments.  I am most certain that Lucas would have developed more on the Luke/Leia story more and given us more into the story than just \"It runs deep in my family, you have it too\"...that sort of thing.The Ewoks however are just too cute for the movie.  Light sabers and Ewoks just don't mix.  The singing scene at Jabba's palace was a bit too much to stomach also.  I like to think that a more ferocious and terrifying race of occupants on Endor would have done the movie a world of good.  The movie never had a heightened sense of danger the first two had so splendidly displayed.  I felt like no matter what happened someone fuzzy would save the show....All in all though, I feel as if the movie was just good enough to make me feel like I did not get robbed of just over two hours of my life and that maybe the ending of the whole thing saved a bad example of teamwork and good acting.  (Lets face it, Ford was way below par on this one as the cynical and resourceful Han Solo)  Fisher looked tired and aged of the whole Star Wars scene and ready to move on.  Mark Hamill was good as usual, but I was somewhat disappointed in his sometimes lack of energy that he normally puts into his work.Clearly the first two installments are above this one, but those were tough to beat no matter what.

(That, and a movie can only be SO long.)Instead, given the money and indulgence to put it into the third movie, he decided to throw in the Ewoks.  Yuk.In any case, it's still a decent movie, tying up most of the story lines and showing Luke's faith in the inherent goodness of his father was well-placed. Darth Vader's final act, to reject the Evil of the Emperor and join the Good Guys, rehabilitates him back into the Anakin that we should have come to know and love in Episodes I and II.(Too bad THOSE movies bit the big one, and never developed Anakin in the first place.)",

Making the presence of ewoks, not so much a scheme, but more essential than anything. And without homage to Yoda and this lesson, it would have been a lesson without anything learned. Without this contrast of something lighter, the movie is grueling with darkness. Luke heads to defeat his Father, and his Fathers master,on a suicide mission. Where he knows might be his final stand.

Mark Hamil by this time has grown into the character of Luke Skywalker and easily walks away with the acting honours, easily outshining a seemingly bored Harrison Ford and strangely enjoying a better chemistry with Carrie Fisher than his costar. The Star Wars movies have always been associated with outstanding special effects and again we are not disappointed - the climactic battle over Endor still holds its own by todays standards. If you can forgive the inclusion of the ewoks then Return of the Jedi stands shoulder to shoulder with the very best space operas around, and makes a satisfying final installment in the original trilogy.",

But the last film (star wars: return of the Jedi) has answered all of them , i think:1.We learned that the other hope that was said in the second film. It was Princess Leia.2.We saw the Darth Vader without mask and it was awesome. That moment was proof of Anakin Skywalker has still lives.3.We saw that Luke has become a Jedi. He is very powerful, because the force is strong in his family.4. Finally and the most amazing thing, i think; Emperor's death by the Darth Vader. This trilogy is in my archive anymore. I think i will watch this films again and again,because they are awesome.",

It is probably one of the best films in Star Wars because of how we get the conclusion we want, and how we feel a sense of closure and security with it.Return of The Jedi thought not to give us turns or twists, but action, adventure and a good storyline. We see events develop like they should. We are given suspense and fear, we are given top grade story telling. This movie seems real as we watch it. We see the development and concluding truths of all the characters. It is an excellent conclusion to Star Wars.Return of The Jedi bonds all the films together.",

(although Empire was and remains Flawless), basically Lucas overkilled the saga with the Ewokes thingies, doing miracles to defeat the Empire's soldiers, i mean c'mon this is the EMPIRE damn it! and not to forget the corny ending with this corny music showing ewokes celebrating (chewbaka looked like a costumed clown dancing with kids in a birthday party!!), plus the ending could have been 100 times better, and it was so fast as if the crew wanted to get over with this whole movie, and what worse is the new digital re mastery of the new DVD edition, which made the movie worse! what the hell is wrong with Lucas?!! Technology Freak?! I must admit there are some glorious moments still, Jabbas Gang war, Yoda's Death, Aniken Reveals himself emotionally, and the the special effects improvement from the first two movies!

You can feel the hate and anger building up in Luke as he gets closer and closer to falling into the dark side.

The battle on Endor between the Imperial forces and the Ewoks is a great battle between primitive and high-tech - of brain versus brawn (stormtroopers don't know their a**e from their elbow). And the final battle between Luke, Vader and the Emperor is classic.There is just the odd dodgy bit here and there, like when the spirit of Obi Wan takes a load off and sits down next to Luke.

The final showdown between Luke & Darth Vader is a moment that is the climax of the film until we see that the good of Anakin Skywalker is redeemed. Here we understand how Anakin truly was the chosen one. Here he brings the force back into balance by destroying his master and turning back to his roots.

But to say that The Empire Strikes back is better than Return of the Jedi is ludacris!The Empire Strikes Back does have a nice fight scene in the Battle of Hoth, but other than that, the movie's plot unfolds too slowly.  Frankly, the whole Dagobah episode with Yoda is rather boring compared to most of the other scenes in all of the orginal three movies.  Add to that the fact that Return of the Jedi has arguably the best land/space battle of all time and it grows harder and harder for me to see how Return of the Jedi is ranked #105 and The Empire Strikes Back is ranked #16.I can't help but notice the order of the Star Wars movies on IMDb's Top 250 list is in the same order that the movies were released (A New Hope at #7, The Empire Strikes Back at #16, and Return of the Jedi at #105). Contrary to the overwhelmingly popular opinion, the quality of movies does not always follow the order in which the movies were released!I apologize for my harshness, but seeing the large gap between TESB's ranking and ROTJ's ranking gives me great sorrow - especially since I just looked at the Top 250 list for the first time today.For those of you who are die hard Star Wars fans I would ask you to re-watch both The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.  Look at the movies as a whole and think about their overall plots.  Remember that in Return of the Jedi we find out Leia is really Luke's long lost twin sister, the second Death Star actually is quite fully armed and operational, and Ewok's can take on the Empire with their furry hands tied behind their backs.For those of you who haven't seen Return of the Jedi, go see it.

(Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke which is the best of the saga. In Return of the Jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire finally falls. I also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills Vader's redemption and returns hi into Anakin Skywalker spirit along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives a sadness and a tear. The greatest scenes in Star Wars are among this movie: When Vader turns on the Emperor. Luke watches and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and...his father (1997 version not Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke rushes to strike back Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending.

Don't get me wrong; I think the ewoks was a cheesy change to the script(the original script called for a planet of primitive Wookies), and it almost most certainly was made to make the movie appeal to a broader audience. In Return of the Jedi, though, it doesn't destroy the movie the way it does in the prequels(IMO anyway).

            "content": "Luke's allegorical phantom confrontation with Vader on Dagobah, the revelatory confrontation between the two on Bespin, and the drama of Solo's being frozen in carbonite set Empire above the other two in the original trilogy.  Empire puts flesh on the mythic bones presented in Star Wars, which is remarkable for the simplicity of its story -- a farm boy, a mercenary and an elder knight rescue a princess from a dark castle and dark lord, then return to disintegrate it!  Return of the Jedi perhaps had the easiest task of the three and did well for the most part.  The great escape from Jabba's sail barge is tremendous fun, if somewhat improbable (specifically, that Luke could foresee where R2 would be in relation to him to propel his new lightsaber to him; but that's the Force -- excuse me, talking bacteria in our blood now, after Episode I).  And the slow, sinister game of cat and mouse in the Emperor's throne room -- between the Emperor, then Vader, and Luke -- elegantly deadly with the iridescent arcs of lightsabers in the darkness, provided a triumphant close.  It was just the Ewoks that brought down an otherwise incredible second sequel.  Cuteness only goes so far when one is trying to portray a struggle for the fate of the galaxy; and unfortunately, Mr. Lucas succumbs again in Phantom Menace. Why, why would one use obviously phony aliens with terrible mock-Asian accents when the stern Englishmen aboard the Death Star in Star Wars performed so well and painted the Empire as a bland, starched, strict entity that -- with the Stormtroopers -- clearly evoked the Nazi regime?  Now we have Jar Jar and his silly tribe and a two-headed pod-racing/basketball analyst; and to make matters worse and as I mentioned before, Mr. Lucas has flayed the flesh from those mythic bones by reducing the Force to something that characters can only feel because of a strain of bacteria in them.  Not the mind, not the soul or will -- bacteria.  Superintelligent bacteria, no doubt, and wise enough to engineer a virgin birth (!?) at just the right time and place in the story's timeline; but still, changing the touchstone of the Force from humanity to bacteria was a poor, poor decision.  Episode I is a visual delight, the lightsaber duels light-years beyond those in the original trilogy; but the original had magic.  And that, I hope Mr. Lucas will understand, is something that all of the digital effects and funny, diverse aliens in the universe cannot replace.  The relevance of this long tangent, then, is that it enables me to say this:  when Return of the Jedi ends, as flames dance before Luke and consume his father's bier, cleansing the black armor and rising into the night, as John Williams' powerful composition presents the Force theme one final, stirring time, there is magic; there is myth and the closing of a cycle.  Treasure it, but keep what comes \"after\" separate -- in a galaxy far, far away. (Of course, it may be that Episodes II and III are able to find the magic again; the great questions remain unanswered:  why did Anakin turn?  how was his body shattered then armored?  I hold out that hope; 5 of 6 would be remarkable. Time will tell.)",

Billy Dee Williams retains some edge from \"Empire\" despite his role being watered down in the script to someone less hardbitten.  Denis Lawson is great as always as Wedge. I *love* Mon Mothma and Admiral Ackbar.And the best scene in the movie: not the Luke/Vader/Emperor battle (I always thought that a bit overrated), but the scene just before it, when Vader is examining Luke's lightsaber and Luke is trying to convince him to come back to the light side.  That's emotionally charged.The bad: The whole Jabba the Hutt part of the movie was too long -- the ONLY instance in a Star Wars movie where I ever got bored.  The reason: it has nothing to do with the Rebellion or the Empire.  The whole time I was thinking, come on, come on, where's Vader?  Why do I care about this gangster dude?  I realize Han had to be rescued, but to devote so great a part of the movie to something totally unrelated to the central conflict seems ridiculous.The lead acting.  Carrie Fisher is over the top.  Harrison Ford doesn't seem to care about a thing he's doing.

It also have the best opening scene I've ever seen. The hole thing at Jabba's place is just great. It has nothing special to do with the plot, but it still takes a great deal of time, typically space opera.

The ROJ poster uses more then half the space and fills it well. I especially like the stairs leading up to Vader and the two ships aimed at his head are a nice touch.

            "content": "I'm not sure who should be blamed for this disaster of a movie, it's either the director or the writer...oh wait, they're both Rian Johnson. Maybe it's Disney's fault for hiring him. Or, maybe it's George Lucas for selling his franchise to Disney (hard to blame him though - $4 billion). Rian Johnson either hates Star Wars or just has a complete disregard for the fans. It is so different that it doesn't feel connected to the saga at all. The characters seem different and there is a blatant disregard for the importance of continuity within the star wars universe. This is the second of three new star wars films. The first, the force awakens, set the stage with some exciting new characters and stories. Poe Dameron is a studly x-wing pilot. Rey is a young scavenger on Tatooine with a mysterious past. Finn is a runaway Storm Trooper and potential love interest of Rey. Kylo Ren is the grandson of Darth Vader and has turned to the dark side. Snoke is an evil leader of the First Order and possibly Sith Lord more powerful than the Emperor from the last trilogy. Best of all, the first movie ends with Rey meeting Luke Skywalker and presenting him with his first lightsaber which he lost when his hand was severed by Darth Vader in the Empire Strikes Back. With eager anticipation, we waited for this next movie to see Luke again and discover the answer to many of these new mysteries. During this break between the movies, a fan made a short movie and posted it on youtube called the legend of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber. This short video had me pumped about the Last Jedi. Unfortunately, hopes were dashed. We are taken back to the scene as Rey and Luke meet. He takes the lightsaber from Rey, looks at it, and tosses it over his shoulder like a piece of trash. Don't get me started on how Rian character assassinates Luke Skywalker and turns him into a crotchety old dude who just wants to die and let the entire Jedi Order die with him. As the movie plays out, none of the mysteries from the first film are answered. Who are Rey's parents? What about Snoke? Not only do we not find out if Snoke is a Sith lord, he dies faster and easier than the average stormtrooper. What about Luke's battle with the Knights of Ren? Or for that matter, who are the Knights of Ren? What about the love story between Rey and Finn? They barely have screen time together in this film. Why is the studly Poe Dameron now an insubordinate punk? Are you starting to understand why Rian Johnson received so many death threats? Still, in true Star Wars form, most of the action scenes are exciting and the lightsaber fights are intense and dramatic. And, the special effects are very well-done, making for some visually compelling set and character designs. While The Last Jedi doesn't come close to the standard that's been set by previous Star Wars films, it's entertaining and moves the saga forward (barely).",

            "content": "Return of the Jedi is a fun action packed movie that is great for people of all ages.After watching my first Star Wars episode, I would have never believed that a furry beast's growl would allow so much joy, but after finally finishing Return of the Jedi I am now pleased by Chewbacca's growl as it represents a humorous sign of adventure to me. Chewbacca's iconic \"RRRAAARGGGHHHH!\" Along with the many other noises the furry beast makes are always perfectly timed with the perfect tone to describe the situation in the movie. These simple noises are one of the many reasons Return of the Jedi as well as the rest of the Star Wars series act as great family friendly action packed movies.In the film Star Wars \"Return of the Jedi'', The adventures of Luke Skywalker and his rebel gang continue in hopes to defeat all evil in the galaxy. With the continuous evading of the galactic empire and the many space battles, what more could you ask for from a George Lucas film? The long journey in order to save humanity in the galaxy is action packed with the encountering of many new creatures as well as planets that will blow the minds of viewers. Viewers will fall in love with cute new little critters who seem to only have good intentions towards the fate of their habitat as well as the rest of the galaxy. Viewers will also find it very interesting to how the movie lays out a greater perspective to how other people/creatures feel about the evil empire in the galaxy.Return of the Jedi includes incredible acting as well as some family friendly humorous moments from top notch actors such as Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), and Harrison Ford (Han Solo). One of the classic features in the Star Wars series that carries on into the Return of the Jedi is the use of positive and negative music. The film crew successfully displays foreshadowing at the beginning of every scene through wonderful or rather sinister music.A viewer may argue that the dialogue within Return of the Jedi is weak nor very complex. This makes sense considering many of the interesting creatures featured in the movie speak in different \"make believe\" languages that viewers can not understand. However, I believe this is the beauty of Return of the Jedi and the rest of the Star Wars series. This idea of \"make believe\" languages brings back the joy of childhood to many of the older viewers. This same idea may make easier dialogue for younger viewers who will understand foreshadowing through the tone of a creature's voice. Also, the lack of complex dialogue between the English speaking characters allows for a younger audience to be able to understand the meaning and plot of the movie more easily. Unlike many other high end films, it's almost as if the actions between the evil empire and the rebel republic itself do all of the talking, so there is no need for a well built script.Overall, I thought it was an amazing film. People who are new to Star Wars will appreciate the countless battles in the sky as well as the fun interactions between the various creatures featured in the movie. While people who are long time fans of the series will appreciate the fight scenes as well as the new key information that will allow the series to carry on into later episodes. No matter what your age or background is everyone's got room to enjoy Star Wars \"Return of the Jedi\".",

            "content": "\"Return of the Jedi\" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. It manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so very convincingly.Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in movie history.Return of the Jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the \"Empire Strikes Back\" to very convincing here), an exciting opening at Jabba's Palace, a masterful performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke finally coming into his own, the resolution of Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely powerful final moments on the Endor moon.Yes, there are slight annoyances. But they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene. It's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter.

            "content": "I was watching the Siskel & Ebert special as to why Star Wars is considered so successful, and no one said it right better than these two late critics. What better way to innovate storytelling, along with filmmaking, than to mix the elements of old mythologies with new technologies. This film is a pure example of that blend. To have such large scale planetary visages in shots, the hundreds of ships zigzagging through space, the montage of creatures in the lair of Jabba the Hutt, and the excellently choreographed hand-to-hand fights. While some people claim this film is not as good as the previous two entries, I disagree. This film brought the whole series full circle, and ended it on a note that's not seen with most trilogies. Did you know that they constructed the interior of the death star entirely out of fishing rods and pieces of metal pipes? Such craftsmanship is indeed unrecognizable. The matte paintings are visibly inherent in some scenes, most notably in the hangar onboard the \"Home One\" frigate, but such small negative details don't detract from the whole picture. How they managed to capture the space battle scenes with so many different ships is still beyond me, and I've seen firsthand the many wonders of ILM, but back in the day when they just had bluescreens and models, this surely took some fantastic talent, and it is still the best space battle sequence I've ever seen depicted in a movie.I will say though that after viewing the deleted scenes, it is a shame that they left so much out of this film, just like with 'Empire,' but the completed project is still a great movie. With some of the rewrites the script is a bit shaky in certain scenes, the ewok elements were no doubt toned down for the younger audiences that were now flocking to see these films, but Mark Hamill delivers his best performance as an actor to date in this film.The first movie showcased Grand Moff Tarkin, who's sophistication and ruthlessness were rivaled only by his charm and ferocity, and the dreaded vader appeared only secondary, he became the main villain for 'Empire,' but in this film, we have an even better performance by Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, the ruler of the tyrannical regime that controls most of the galaxy. I remember people in the theater we're cheering and applauding when Vader, the most ultimate film villain seen to date, turned the tables on an even more evil villain and came back to the light side. This is a tale of redemption, and the best one I've seen so far.10/10. This is one of the defining moments of my childhood and many others, and though I haven't watched it in a long time, I will still remember going to the theater in the spring as a 6 year old boy never knowing how blown away I'd be.",

But unfortunately we get Ewoks playing drums with the empty helmets of stormtroopers, and everybody generally frolicking about. The same with Phantom Menace, end the film after the camera sweeps to Palpatine looking into the fire, a great place to leave everybody wondering what is going to happen next.

But the reason this one is so close to my heart is because there is so much depth and cinematography in this film. first off, there is very little, but also very much change to characters in this episode. Obviously, Luke Skywalker being the main example of character progression throughout the series. In this film, he finally embraces the way of the Jedi and at the same time, carries many qualities of a Sith as well. He does have anger and hate, and that is what drives him to the conclusion of this movie, and that is what I love about it. Also, the progression of the relationship between Han and Leigha..absolutely amazing. You literally cannot talk about Star Wars without talking about that romantic side of the story. And it is perfectly revealed in this movie.

Special effects were also at their best in this movie as well.

As for the plot, yeah, i agree, it was just like the first film. Maybe they could have come up with a bit of a different idea than another Death Star (Yawn!) For Heaven's sake! Didn't they learn their lesson in the first place. And anyway, whenever Darth Vader let the shuttle land on the moon of Endor, he knew he was in for it.Also, the Gamorrean Guard's of Jabba the Hut were not, i believe, convincing, as all they looked like to me were pumped up green pigs. Even the Rancor monster was obviously a model, and not very convincing at all. Oh, and let me ask a question, why did they have to blow up the station which controlled the energy shield with 'charges' as if they were in the SAS or something? Oh yes, and R2D2 sounded different. And why does Chewbacca not have meat and two veg. Doesn't he need to reproduce? That guy must be really frustrated, maybe that's why he keeps grunting all the time.Good points - loved the emperor - really menacing and evil. Thought the scene when Luke batters his father near to death was also quite awesome, with the emperor laughing in the background. etc. The scene when Darth Vader realises he's done wrong, i found quite moving also.If only it hadn't been for those stupid Ewoks!
