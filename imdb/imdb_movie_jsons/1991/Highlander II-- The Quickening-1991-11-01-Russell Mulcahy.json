            "content": "\"Highlander II\" makes one of the worst mistakes a sequel can make...ignoring the plot of the original film. This is even worse when there is a huge cult following. The first \"\"Highlander\" one was enjoyable and engaging...the sequel clearly was written by folks who never saw the original film as so much contradicts it....which is guaranteed to make fans hate the sequel...which DEFINITELY is true as the film has a pathetic overall score of 4.2! The original? 7.1!In the original, Ramirez (Sean Connery) was an important character....an important character who died in the story. Yet here, once again, in the sequel we have Ramirez....again! How? By showing needless flashback scenes...and considering the sequel takes place decades after the first film, this is an annoying choice...as well as a lazy one. But that's not enough...despite being beheaded, he does somehow get sent to 2024! And, to make it worse, the film ALSO is a sci-fi film...set years after the original!So is the film worth seeing? And, is it as bad as 4.2? No. It is pretty bad and completely betrays the fans of the first film...which is confusing as I read through reviews and some of these die-hard fans actually claim to love this sequel and think it was a work of genius!The worst thing about it, clearly, is the nonsensical sci-fi plot....it's not only confusing but bad. Also, having Connery in a sequel (he would have been fine in a prequel) was a bad choice. Also, some of the problem is Christopher Lambert's performance as an old man. Instead of being convincing, he wasn't because his idea of an old man was to whisper all his lines! It just didn't make sense. You can also blame the director for not catching this...or caring enough to change it. Other bad things were explosions just for the sake of explosions, the many anachronisms and contradictions as well as goofs (the IMDB goof section is VERY long). This all just seem to point to the notion that at a certain point they filmmakers gave up on even trying to make a good film.By the way, as bad as the film is, I could really identify with the angry woman who gave MacLeod the finger and then bashed him on the head with a beer bottle. I am sure I'm not the only one and I hope to think she was doing it for all the fans!",

            "content": "Let's start with a quote that perfectly sums up the coherence of the plot: \"Ok, let me just see if I can get this straight. You were mortal there, but you're immortal here until you kill all the guys from there who have come here and then you're mortal here. Unless you go back there or some more guys from there come here, in which case you become immortal here again.\"When this film came out, it was awesome to me. I was eleven back then and it bought me with a dark atmosphere, strong cast, very good effects for its time, fast pace, entertaining action, and sexy Virginia Madsen. Now, I still liked all of that, and in addition, I enjoyed several examples of great camera and directing, as well as the very good soundtrack, but this time all of that was not enough to cover for one of the worst screenplays in the history of cinema.\"Highlander II: The Quickening\" retains the actors and characters from the first film, while completely ignoring the original story. Not only that it is neither sequel nor a prequel, but the stories of these two films are mutually so contradictory that it is impossible to fit them in any way. Even if we completely ignore the previous film, this one is for itself full of holes and illogicality, and it is incredibly stupid. When it comes to story, in this movie every spot is a weak spot. Immortal's mythology doesn't work, quasi-science also doesn't work, and even romance, which is completely redundant, also doesn't work. I mean, they meet for the very first time and minutes after initial introduction they are attacked. He hides her into a garbage can, fights the attackers and kills them. Then she leaves the container and has sex with him against the wall in the middle of the street. Yea, right, very believable. How much this scenario stinks is best illustrated by Michael Ironside statement:\"Yeah, listen, I hated that script. We all did. Me, Sean, Chris... we all were in it for the money on this one. I mean, it read as if it had been written by a thirteen-year-old boy. But I'd never played a barbarian swordsman before, and this was my first big evil mastermind type. I figured if I was going to do this stupid movie, I might as well have fun, and go as far over the top as I possibly could. All that eye-rolling and foaming at the mouth was me deciding that if I was going to be in a piece of crap, like that movie, I was going to be the most memorable thing in it. And I think I succeeded.\"For the nine days of work, Sean Connery received three and a half million dollars and donated the whole amount to charity. I suppose he was just trying to wash away the shame. However, apart from the story, everything else in this movie I liked pretty much, so I can not completely bury it with the rating. Audio-visually I would give it a strong seven, and maybe three for the story.5/10",

            "content": "Never in the field of human endeavour has there been an act of such instrumental, destructive, diabolical folly as this justifiably reviled, quasi-sequel to the original 1986 fantasy in which immortal warriors duelled throughout the ages until one remained. Yes, its Highlander II - a film so bad that Robert Mugabe refused to show it to white farmers on the grounds that it would be \"exceptionally cruel\". Needing to grasp on to a strand of optimism, perhaps only the thickness of a human hair, I long ago decided that the film existed purely as a textbook demonstration for future filmmakers on how not to make a successful sequel to a hit movie. This theory alone explains the cynicism on screen and the ham-fisted, slapdash, car-crash handling of the material. Don't misunderstand; I'm not saying this thing is poor - poor would be generous praise for a Frankenstein fantasy in which all the invention, both visual and conceptual, inherent in the first film's appeal is frittered to nothing. In fact, the totality of the words already used are only the merest fraction of those required to accurately portray the near total devastation that washed over me as I sat through it (I'm ashamed to say not for the only time) on a stormy night 14 years ago. Russell Mulchay deserves to be poisoned and broad beaten with a tent pole in the male ruminations for his decision to helm the whole sorry affair and grind his original good work to dust. It hardly needs saying but the problem for anyone scripting a Highlander II is that Highlander I concluded business comprehensively with no outlet for a second episode. To get around this the makers of The Quickening simply decided to ditch the back-story of the original film and invent a new one which would enable them to write around the fact that all the immortals, bar M.Lambert were, not unlike themselves, dead from the neck up. So although McCloud was originally born in Scotland and Ramierez in er, Egypt, now they were aliens from a planet called Zeist; handy, because this new ancestry meant that all that was needed to reengergise the concept was that another visitor showed up on Earth and the games can begin again. To fully appreciate how awful an idea this is you need only imagine a Star Wars sequel in which the action is suddenly set in present day Earth for reasons of plot convenience or a second instalment of Titanic in which it's revealed that Jack and Rose are actually time-travellers and are thus able to prevent the disaster and save all their friends. Thus Highlander II is effectively the one line joke in the Player in which the writer of the Graduate pitches the terrible sequel writ large and for real. We can only imagine that the owners of the original film were desperate for more because nothing but desperation could possibly explain how this made it to the screen. If blame were slurry and required apportioning by EU agricultural directive then you'd need roughly 6 tankers worth, each containing somewhere in the region of 40,000 tonnes. The shame of Sean Connery and Christopher Lambert is palpable and everyone who felt any enjoyment during this picture is consciously and deliberately complicit in its evil work. As a purely commercial enterprise with no respect or consideration for the 1st film or its fans, we can only hope that all involved lost millions and that having lost their deposit they were forced to sell themselves into sexual slavery. Highlander III, not exactly itself a great sequel, ignored this one completely as ironically it left no outlet for a third episode but it too was a cynical cash-in and could only continue the first film by ignoring its ending whereas the forth in the series simply didn't bother with the first film at all, opting instead to go with the spin-off T.V series. That's the way the rot spread but here's where it started - now please Hollywood...never again.",

Sean Connery lights up the screen, and Christopher Lambert is notable especially in the aged make-up. Virginia Madsen comes off in the best light, although she is not given enough to do, going from strong feisty conservationist to love interest in a blink of an eye. Nevertheless, the script is poor and the editing is still choppy. The film has a serious pacing issue which no amount of re-jigging can correct.It has some redeeming qualities, the sets and score are excellent and director Russell Mulcahy gives some fantastic sweeping shots. The new cut now makes sense; for example why MacLeod becomes immortal again, hinting that he has forgotten a past, prior the setting of the first film, and gone is the idea that Ram\u00edrez and Connor come from another planet.If you must watch Highlander 2, avoid the 'The Quickening' version at all cost and watch the 2010 blu-ray release.

Then we can battle the evil Katana and save Zeist from ... from what?This is the effect of HIGHLANDER II.HIGHLANDER II: THE QUICKENING is set in the future. Well, at least, I think it is. The film begins on Earth in the year 1999. Then, it heads off to the planet Zeist 500 years before. Following that, we're back to Earth in the year 2024. I'd say the film is pretty much divided between being on Earth in 2024 and Zeist 500 years before, but I think it was meant to be on Earth in 2024.Now that that's cleared up ...Imagine, if you will, that most of what they told us in the original HIGHLANDER was crap. Immortals don't come from nowhere, they come from the planet Zeist. The entire original HIGHLANDER movie was lies! Lies! Lies!And if you believe that, I've got some $200,000 property for you down in sunny North Carolina.Connor MacLeod, the main character of the original film (played by Christopher Lambert), is old and dying. When, in 1999, the Earth's ozone layer was nearly completely gone, MacLeod created The Shield Corporation, which then created a shield which would protect the Earth from the sun's violent rays. But in 2024, the world is a dark dungheap, and MacLeod's pretty much to blame.Now let's go back to the planet Zeist. General Katana (Michael Ironside) is pretty pissed. MacLeod's still alive. So he sends his two retarded minions to kill MacLeod. The extremely elderly MacLeod somehow starts dancing around like Dean Martin and beheads both of them. The power of their lifeforce makes him young once again and free to kiss terrorist Louise Marcus (Virginia Madsen) and then try to take down the world's anti-Ozone shield. Oh yeah, the ozone's healed, by the way.So then Katana comes to Earth to kill MacLeod, who is suddenly super-cool and ready to kill Katana. But for some reason, he needs help. So the producers paid Sean Connery $3.5 million. Behold! Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez is resurrected from the dead and comes back (for nine minutes of screen time) to help MacLeod shut down the shield.If you haven't figured it out by now, HIGHLANDER II is completely messed-up.I haven't seen a sequel this bad in who knows how long. It contradicts the entire HIGHLANDER mythos, and thus was ignored in every other sequel and television series that followed. But there is a good side to the film. I think Ebert said it best in his review of the film: he describes HIGHLANDER II as being \"a movie almost awesome in its badness\". How awesome do you hear that? But that's exactly what HIGHLANDER II is: almost awesome in its badness.It may be one of the worst films ever made, and it may be the worst sequel, but it is also a very fun and frequently (unintentionally) funny film. In the words of the Immortal Ramirez, \"If you can summon it all up, at one time, in one place, you can accomplish something glorious.\"Whatever that means.NOTE: There are two versions of the film. The theatrical version, called the Quickening, has just been reviewed here. The director's cut has been re-named the \"Renegade Version\" and changes much of the film's story. The film has also been completely re-edited. The Quickening version runs 89 minutes, while the Renegade version runs 109.HIGHLANDER II: THE QUICKENING by Russell Mulcahy. * 1/2 out of ****.",

The intention was probably good, trying to show the aftermath of McCloud's mistakes after winning the original \"tournament\", but the premise is ruined by Planet Zeist, and Michael Ironside is just rehashing the Kurgen.

Some dialogue is silenced, but we still see their lips moving. The movie is entertaining, still, but doesn't make much sense. Connery's scenes are misplaced, he is almost forgotten, at times. Katana kills David Blake just moments after meeting him in this one. The ending is the most incompetant for the most part. Connor is wearing a prison jacket, then suddenly switches to a trench coat, holding a broad sword after just having a samurai sword. The closing scene is bad also.RENEGADE VERSION: An excellent, totally revamped sci-fi cut of this often misconcepted sequel. This time, they are not aliens from Zeist. They are from the past, more like a different dimension. Character development is re-attached, plot holes are filled in, and we get a chance to see a blue sky at one point.Overall opinions: Lambert's acting is at it's best. He seems to be really into his character in this movie. Ironside is a great villain. He chews the scenery, hams it up with comic book dialogue, and demonstrates some memorable killings (the subway holocaust, and the cabbie killing). Watch both versions, you'll find them interesting in comparison.",

            "content": "Highlander 2: Renegade Version is MILES way better than the original theatrical version! This is the version that it supposed to come out in theater but the movie was cut to 1h 31 min which was ridicules! Highlander II: The Quickening sucks ass and it is one of the worst movies of 1991! I understand why everyone hates this film and I agree with all the haters this movie sucks, but the Renegade Version does not suck! That is why I am giving a score 8 out of 10, but that doesn't mean this movie was epic, perfect or the best, on the contrary it is not even a close movie to an original film! But I like it a lot and I am going to count the reasons what I like about this version. I have a lot of problems with this sequel but Renegade Version was entertaining! I have this movie on Blu-ray Renegade Version which it really surprised me. Plot: It's 2024 and MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) and Ramirez (Sean Connery) are back to save planet Earth. Ozone depletion, time travel and corporate greed are at the core of all the thrilling twists and turns in this stylish action sequel. Featuring new state-of-the-art special effects and digital re-mastering, it's HIGHLANDER II like you've never seen or heard before.Thing's I love in this movie: Christopher Lambert is reunited with Sean Connery and director Russell Mulcahy. I absolutely love the old cast from the first film. Juan S\u00e1nchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez played by Sean Connery become really a beloved character from the first film. The original film was directed by Russell Mulcahy and I am glad he directed the sequel good for him. I love those three in this movie! Michael Ironside is an awesome bad ass villain as General Katana, he is not the best villain like was Clancy Brown as The Kurgan, but he was really close evil tough bad guy, that we all wanted him dead. Ironside was also the bad guy in Total Recall (1990) my all time favorite Schwarzenegger movie. That is one of the reason why I like this movie. I love that this movie is set in 2024 it is a sci-fi futuristic film, you see mostly dark and red world which it is a futuristic world and I love that in this movie.I love the song One Dream performed by Lou Gramm Band I love the song score which is perfect to this film. Highlander 2: Renegade Version really reworked the movie in to kind a the original version supposed to be: they are not really an aliens, they are kind a, just put trough time and they are finding that out. So basically one of them is shipped trough time and they shipped them trough time. They have to fight each other in a combat to the death, when you behead someone you take their energy away and when you kill all the immortals you become mortal and that is basically what happens with a Highlander 2: Renegade Version.The reason I love this movie is because it takes place in the future and it is cool, there is a guy with a wings going after him, those guys are kind a nit. They are some really kick ass fights scenes in it. I love the fact that Ramirez comes back I don't care, that it doesn't make sense or it dopes makes sense. It is Highlander, it is immortals beheading each other to become the one. It is not supposed to be realistic who cares. He use The Quickening energy to bring back Ramirez I would do it. I love that Ramirez comes back he is a cool character and I love him. I love that Brenda J. Wyatt returns in this movie but this time she is played by Karin Drexler when we find out what happened to the character from the first movie.Katana (Michael Ironside) does respect the rules, the immortals never fight on a holly ground.The sky is red in this film because of the field energy. The only problem with film I have is: The renegade version may be a better edited movie than the original crap fest The Quickening, but it still suffers from terrible screenplay which had problems from the very beginning.The fight between MacLeod and Katana was cut short and it could be a longer duel. I wish there would be more an epic swords fight like was in the first movie. Ramirez music score was horrible, Ramirez acting in this movie like an idiot was horrible. I wish they would cut those scenes out when he lands in an opera, I really wouldn't want to see that. In my opinion this is the true original sequel to the original film. Overall: I like this movie it is a childhood movie of mine I grew up watching this movie. I love sci-fi in this movie and I love Highlander 1 and 2 to death but I love Highlander (1986) the best!

Connor McLeod has killed all the other immortals and is slowly dying of old age. But something happens and immortals are suddenly starting to show up again and Connor must fight once again.I don't want to know which drugs the script-writers were using when coming up with the plot for this movie. How DO you start with a movie about immortal warriors on the Scottish highland, and end up with aliens fighting each other under a red sky in 2025?! Do we even want to know? It has to go down into movie history as one of the worst ideas ever. Taking something that was almost a solid story and destroying it completely by introducing weird elements like aliens and shields in the sky.So, apart from that? Well, even if we do overlook that major flaw this is still complete garbage. What did they pay Sean Connery to appear in this? Either he was well paid or the man doesn't take any pride at all in his work. The action scenes are pathetic, the effects are awful.

The dialog is a cheesy camp-fest and the plot is all over the place. Probably the biggest contradiction to the first film in this movie is that Connor and Ramirez are from another planet called Zeist in Highlander 2.

The first Highlander was a great film, it had a good story, good characters and plot that pretty much worked. Highlander II had some of the worst acting I have ever seen, really bad camera work, horrifying choreography in the fights scenes, a story that made absolutely no sense, cruddy special effects and overall, it was just a really bad movie. Though I am a fan of the first Highlander, it seemed to me that a sequel was not possible. Macleod had defeated the Kurgan and won the Prize. Now all of a sudden it's the future, and the immortals came from another world? I am fan of Michael Ironside but this was by far his worst acting job ever as he played the villain, Katana. What makes absolutely no sense to me is that in the first Highlander, the immortals didn't know why and where they came from. Now all of a sudden, Macleod remembers life on his homeworld of Zeist. The one thing that kept this movie up somewhat was Sean Connery's return. Now he died in the first Highlander, but they brought him back. And it really wasn't explained how he came back to life. This was by far the worst of the Highlander series, and the sequels later on disregarded this movie which I felt was a good idea.",

No one expected an \"Empire Strikes Back.\"\"Highlander II\" has the set up for a bad film. Despite terrific special effect, it is choppy, uneventful, and an insult to the viewer's intelligence. But in all due seriousness, THAT WAS THE POINT!This film, in it's original, pre-Renegade edition form, was not meant to be taken seriously. It was just a campy, fun film designed to be a reunion of the characters from part one. If you watch it expecting something deep, you won't like it. But if you view it as it was intended to be viewed, as a light-hearted reunion of Lambert and Connery for ninety minutes of fun, than FUN is what you'll get. Consider it like an early experiment of something \"Fifth Element\" perfected: a campy but good sci-fi film.With this in mind, give it a try.",

            "review_title": "This is why you do not throw good money after bad",
            "content": "In the late 1980s, a quirky independent fantasy film called Highlander became a minor box office hit and an even bigger hit on home video. In this money-above-all-things film business, that means a sequel was greenlit faster than most people could view the contents of a film at the time. A script was quickly approved, stars were signed, deals were negotiated, and filming locations were chosen. Unfortunately, one of the locations they chose to film in was Argentina, which began to suffer major inflation during production. So major, in fact, that the insurance company took control and made the film they believed would make the most money. Instead, what they produced would keep the Highlander franchise on that fabled B list henceforth, and permanently doom the career of most of its cast. I first saw the theatrical cut when it was released on home video, and it was eighty-odd minutes of the most incoherent mess I have witnessed to date. However, I am going to comment on Russell Mulcahy's preferred version of the film. Suffice to say that comparing the two is like comparing apples with dog droppings.The most major improvement in the director's cut of Highlander II is that the story is now coherent within itself. It is still very much a B-film, and it still grossly contradicts its predecessor, but it has the virtue of sequencing things in a manner that leaves the viewer thinking something other than \"what the hell did I just watch?\". Michael Ironside's character is given a little more depth, and anything that entails more screen time for Michael Ironside is a good thing. The story of the big energy shield that covers the Earth also has more development, and we get to actually see, rather than be simply told, why our hero built the thing in the first place. The process of locating the shield generator and turning it off also makes quite a lot more sense this time around. There are also more fight sequences, none of which stretch out past their welcome. Or rather, the fight sequences that were in the theatrical release have been edited differently, putting them in an order that flows properly.According to IMDb estimates, the theatrical version of Highlander II cost thirty million dollars to make. It recouped a little over half of that at the box office, as word of its incoherence caused audiences to stay away in droves. A similar box office performance was enjoyed by RoboCop 3, proving once again that money men are not the sort of people who should be making films. Roger Ebert gave the cut that the insurance company delivered half a star, and Russell Mulcahy was apparently so impressed that he could only endure the equivalent of a reel before walking out. Obviously, he has never let go of the fact that money men took away his film and changed it in an effort to please everyone. So, once the DVD-Video format came out of its infancy, after the copyright arrangements expired, he took the film, recut it to his wishes, and rereleased it. He believes that the film he intended to make would enjoy better success. Response to the Renegade version, as it is called, has vindicated him on this issue.Roger Ebert called the theatrical version of Highlander II a film \"almost awesome in its badness\". This is why Roger Ebert is arguably the most famous film critic of all time - although he sometimes completely misses the point, nine occasions out of ten have him hitting the nail on the head so hard, said nail becomes a projectile. This raises the question of what he would think of the Renegade version, which at least has the distinct advantage of having a beginning, a middle, and an end, as opposed to just one lengthy beginning. Among Highlander II's other virtues, in both cuts, is Michael Ironside. This man could be doing a commercial for cotton candy, and his indescribable habit of pulling mean faces would make it the most compelling celluloid on Earth. Highlander II plays upon his strengths, casting him as some kind of general from the past that decides first he hates Christopher Lamber (understandable), and second, he wants in on the corporation that runs the ozone shield. This is one of the problems with both versions of the film - both cuts give our characters the most idiotic, meaningless backgrounds.Among the Renegade version's finer moments are the duels. The original version of the film ended with a long, proctracted duel between Ironside and Lambert. Apparently, Lambert nearly severed one of Ironside's thumbs during this duel. What nobody told the audience was that the footage used to comprise this duel was intended by the director to be two separate, distinct battles. Not only do the battles make more sense this way, they are simply more enjoyable to boot. Unlike many recent films involving battle, Highlander II was made with the belief that it was better to leave the audience wanting more, rather than wondering if this action sequence will ever end. The characters have more life in them, their stories make more sense, and they seem to have more motivation for what they do. Battles over which cut of the film should be seen by audiences have become a yearly thing in Hollywood, but Highlander II could almost qualify as the first. It certainly qualifies as the best example of such a battle where the wrong side won.I gave the Renegade version of Highlander II a five out of ten. The theatrical cut is a two out of ten, a film so bad that it does not merely make one pity whomever is responsible for it, it makes one want to crucify them. If you are new to the Highlander II saga, make sure you see the Renegade version. If you have only seen the theatrical cut, wait until you see the Renegade version to pass judgement.",

No real reason is given for this ridiculous twist. Oh, and Sean Connery's character from the first movie (Juan Ram\u00edrez) manages to come back to life for a little while, to help Conner MacLeod.

            "content": "In 1999, I was graduating college in Richmond, Virginia and had a yard sale to get rid of excess junk.  I had quite a collection of movies on VHS that I hoped to get rid of because DVD was just coming into its own.  I had a copy of \"Highlander II Renegade Version\" that I bought in th 4.99 clearance bin at Wal-Mart because I had seen \"Highlander II: The Quickening\" and wondering if there was any way possible in improve on one of the worst films I had ever seen.Well, renegade version started out priced 2.00 in the morning.  By lunchtime, it was down to a buck.  As the afternoon wore on, the price went down... 75 cents, 50 cents, 25 cents.  Finally, I had sold most of my films and decided to give it away for free.  As the sun began to set and I cleaned up, this film was still there.  It seems you cannot even give it away for free!Anyway, if you're a glutton for punishment, this is the film for you.  It has \"low budget\" written all over it, and I, for one, cannot possible fathom how Sean Connery agreed to be in it.  \"This movie is awesome and fearless in its badness\" Roger Ebert writes, and for once, I agree with him.  It is pretty bad.  It creates massive continuity errors with the first Highlander by having all the immortals come from the planet Zeist (!?!).  Second, as a plot device, the sky is covered with some kind of orange/red crud to protect the earth, which has lost the ozone layer.   Wouldn't everything on Earth die without any kind of sunlight anyway, since the sun is the source of energy for all the forms of life at the bottom of the food chain?The renegade version is even more unwatchable than this version! You might ask yourself, how is that possible considering that Highlander II is one of the worst films ever made.  Well, somehow they found a way.  Now if they could only put all that energy into cancer research, cancer would be wiped out!I could go on and on just how and why this movie is so stupid, but what would be the point?  Chances are, if you're reading this review, you're some kind of Highlander-head anyway.  More power to you, and there can only be one! (fake laughter)",

            "review_title": "Absolutely Hideous",
            "content": "SPOILERSIn 1986, with a Queen soundtrack to be proud of, there was \"Highlander\". With Christopher Lambert as Connor McLeod of the clan McLeod, 80s cinema had a hero worthy of our attention. With that in mind, it feels obvious now that a sequel was always going to appear. This sequel eventually would make an appearance in 1991, but to this day, I'd be very surprised if anyone felt this film was a good idea.In \"Highlander II: The Quickening\", Connor McLeod is an old man. Having become mortal at the end of the original feature, McLeod saved the world with a \"shield\" to protect the world from the typical 1980s terror that was Global Warming. Twenty five years later and the shield has become a plague upon mankind, covering the skies and leaving the world in eternal darkness. With the help of his old friend Ramirez (Sean Connery) and Louise Marcus (80s icon Virginia Madsen), McLeod does battle with old enemy General Katana (Michael Ironside) as he attempts to fix his old mistake.There really is little good that can be said about this second Highlander film. Simply put, it never should have been made. Rather than trying to think up any good points, let's just look a few of the problems with it.Firstly, the plot of \"Highlander II\" destroys elements of the original film. Whilst in the original, McLeod was born in medieval Scotland and Connery's Ramirez was an ancient Egyptian, in this film they are exciled rebels from a different planet. Sent to Earth as punishment, they are told they may only return home once there is only one of them remaining. This new twist to the Highlander idea is hideous and quite frankly, farcical.The second truely awful thing about this film is the acting. Whilst not a massive fan of Sean Connery at the best of times, in this film he is particularly attrocious as the Egyptian Alien with a Scottish accent who dies to the sound of Scottish Bagpipes. Alongside him is the tedious Christopher Lambert who speaks so softly during the film that the volume needs to be raised to a degree that any sound effect deafens the audience. Whilst a novel if unbelievable partnership in the first film, in the sequel Connery and Lambert are generally awful.The final problem with this film which is worth talking about is the colours and the lighting involved. As a result of the \"shield\" being bright red and blotting out the Sun, the vast majority of this film is set in either pitch black or in a brain haemorraging red and black mix. It is impossible to follow the events in this film, not just due to the abysmal plot, but also because if you look at the screen for too long, you find your retina burning inside your skull.In an attempt to summarise, whilst the creators of \"Highlander\" produced a simple action film which was simple to relax and enjoy, when they created this first sequel to it, they created an abomination. \"Highlander II\" is in the worst 100 films of all times list on this website, the only criticism to be made of this is that it isn't in that list at number one. Avoid this film like the Black Death.",

            "content": "Watching Highlander II right after the first Highlander is a mind-altering amazing experience. I can think of only two movies off the top of my head that have sequels as radically different from their predecessors (the far less known Nemesis series and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls). What Highlander II lacks in intelligence it more than makes up for in completely confusing fun. It's just the sort of bad idea, the uber-complex nonsensical plot-hole full nonsense you dream up as a kinderg\u00e4rtner. It's exhilarating, exciting to see it brought to life on the screen. Why does it take place in the future? Why is there that whole political subplot with the force field? What happened to there being only one? Who are those bald guys? What are all the other immortals doing in the past, just sitting around? If they can witness everything in the past, don't they already know the inevitable conclusion of everything? None of these questions will be answered, but a lot of fun will be had on the way. It's always interesting to see two genres combined in an interesting way, and Highlander II takes the cake. Wheras the first movie was mostly an action movie with some fantasy elements, Highlander II uses an obvious political sci-fi setting to carry the already complicated Highlander mythos to new heights of sheer complexity. I mean, I watched the so-called \"Renegade\" version, which is supposed to make more sense, and I still had no idea what was going on. But if you're in the right mood after watching Highlander, and you're not some nerd fanboy of the Highlander, than watching such an unexpected sequel should be a good time.

It is painful to watch those scenes. Then there is the instant romance with Virginia Madsden. He literally meets her on the street, and five minutes later he is telling her his life story and she becomes the power behind the throne. What a waste of screen time.Add in the angles of Connor as the scientist who saved the world from the deteriorated ozone layer, and there are too many time-consuming sub-plots that are boring. John C. McGinley is in the movie to glare and plot against Connor. Once Connor was young again he should have sliced him in half when he saw him at the office of Allen Rich, and eliminated that problem.Sean Connery spends most of the movie buying new clothes, flying to the USA on a plane that looks like a small Boeing 707 airliner. He joins up with Connor when the movie is almost over. Besides looking great, and admiring himself in several mirrors, I was disappointed that Ramirez was used mostly for comic relief.To be honest, the highlight of this movie is the over-the-top psychotic villain acting of Michael Ironside. He really seems to be enjoying his role, and he makes it fun and funny. No goofy accents, no deep ideas or romance, just killing and destroying.

It is a very convoluted one, and also one full of inconsistencies and unforgivable mistakes which a few commentators have pointed out already. I have no better news about the action sequences either, on the whole they are very clumsy and lifeless. The pace is off too. Because the script and story has no sparkle, I was hoping the pace would liven it up a bit. Quite the contrary actually, throughout the pace is dull and never recovers. The direction is lethargic this time round, while the acting fares little better. Christopher Lambert is rather bland, and while Sean Connery is better being more charismatic he is cursed by some bad dialogue and a hardly credible accent.

However it ignores lots of stuff from the original film, but I still liked it.I hated the facts that they turned the immortals into aliens instead, I mean it was much better when their origin was left un-explained and mythical.\nThe music pretty much stinks, especially in some scenes, it is just a small thundering \"Dun-dun-dun\" or something, that is repeated over and over and over.Christopher Lambert on the other hand, is pretty damn cool in this sequel. But only when he is in immortal shape...Year 2024: Connor MacLeod has become mortal after defeating the last other immortal on earth, but when two other immortals are sent to earth (from the immortals \"Homeplanet\") MacLeod becomes an immortal again, and helps a chick to get rid of the electro magnetic shield that covers earth (since the ozone layer has been destroyed, but it seems like the ozone layer has repaired itself). Sort of neat plot, and I liked the idea with the electro magnetic shield that covered Earth. Even if it doesn't really fit in here, in the Highlander series.The fights are about the same as the first movie, but the villain doesn't seem to do enough bad things. He's just there, and he only fights with MacLeod once.This was a review of the Renagade version BTW, which has a few more scenes than the original version.7/10",

Hey! Let's pretend everyone's from another planet! You know what? Let's through in a conspiracy for the hell of it! This movie seems like it didn't leave the script-writing process until they finished shooting, and then they skipped editing.

If you havn't seen the original Highlaner or the original Cut of this one, wait until you do before watching this.  Lets put this in it's place.  Star Treck had a pretty good film series,(with the exception of the first one)  But when Voyage Home came out, alot of fans hated it, they thought it was stupid and... Awful.  okay, lets watch that one again, many see it as a campy fun ride in the star trek universe(it happens to be one of my favorites).  well thats what H2 is. it is a campy, corny, funny movie.  look and laugh.  Besides, the scene with ramerez in the tailors is hilarious.Ohh, another thing, there are four distinct highlander universes. these are the Universes ' H1,H2H1, H3H1,H4, Tv, RavenAnimated(not sure were THE SOURCE is yet, cause its still in production)Those movies all make sense in their own alternate universe, the Panzer/davis aren't so stupid that they give him the prize constantly, it works fine.  plus, this theory works perfectly, in the third movie, They say that Connors wife died in a car accident, tottaly cancelling out the radiation sickness story from H2.  so watch it, it's not the Black sheep of the series, (endgame was..POOR CONNOR I WANT CONNOR HE IS THE ONE!!!!) sorry bout that.  It's the Funny one, the one to make you laugh, and if you don't like it, fine, it has a big rewatch value just for the laughs",

Some years later and the earth is a wreak, because of the lack of sun the sky is murky and they must resort to using normal cars, trains and other vehicle's due to the shield.Connor is an old man because of winning the prize in this plot they have the choice of returning to Zeist and being Immortal with great power or live on earth as a mortal. Connor chose earth to live with Brenda.At an opera Connor remembers the days on Planet Zeist 500 years ago where a rebellion was being planned against Kitana (Micheal Ironside) and Connor is to lead them. Kitana's forces are too strong and defeat the rebel attack keeping Connor and Ramirez as prisoners.On trail they are banished to earth where they must live as Imortals until the day of the Gathering.In the present again Connor leaves the opera and meets a woman who want's to stop the o-zone shield since the layer is rebuilding itself. Kitana sends two of his men on earth and Connor kills one making him a young man again and Immortal.Killing the other guy Kitana goes to earth to kill Connor himself, Ramirez returns to help Connor.So the three go out to destroy the o-zone shield and stop Kitana.Highlander II: The Quickening is OK as long as you don't compare it with the first Highlander.",

There's no shortage of great and valorous titles, which otherwise contradict the general idea that sequels are flawed films and doomed to failure, right? But there is also the other side of the coin, and a long list of names that gave strength to this installed belief. This movie is, indeed, an excellent candidate for a spot on the disgraceful list of the worst sequels ever released!Well, \"Highlander\" was a film that, despite the criticisms and weaknesses (I didn't spare myself to list them in the review I wrote for it), worked well and gave the audience pure fun and entertainment. This film, however, completely ignores it, contradicts the entire story of the first film and gives us... an hour and a half of rubbish that involves things as absurd as a threat of extinction due to the disappearance of the ozone layer and the return of characters who actually died in the first film, because they came from another dimension conveniently created for that purpose! Fans of the first film rightfully booed it, condemning it to oblivion.I believe that everyone involved, from the director to the actors, prefers to ignore this humiliation that they subject themselves for a good pack of dollars. Sean Connery, for example, seems to be parodying himself, and Christopher Lambert seems contrived and unbelievable in his old age outfit. Although the list of actors includes other relatively respectable names, there isn't a single actor here that could be worth the painful effort of seeing the film... and believe me, I saw it in its entirety and felt I would have made better use of my time watching the Teletubbies.",

The Renegade Version is not bad, but it's not great. The DVD Dolby Digital 5.1 is nice and is in THX that really gives the movie a theater sound.  The picture is nice, but some of the new graphics look like one of those 1990s television show's 3D visuals.  The film's \"new\" story and alternate ending does give the film a better touch and understanding of the film, but really, did Highlander really need a sequel?  Let alone another two sequels that each have abandoned there own origin?  Another thing that baffles the s*** out of me is how the hell can a talent like Sean Connery accept the role of Ramirez when he died in the first one?  (I asked this question in my previous review)How drunk was Connery when he read the script?!  Virginia Madsen's hot, I'll give her that much.  Lambert has some ups and downs in his career and this film is definitly one of his many downs.  Michael Ironside should've torched the script when he had his hands on it.  For crying out loud, Mikey, you were in better films than that!  I really think the first Highlander is an epic and is a film that will always remain a timeless classic, but there are just some films that you shouldn't tamper with when it comes to sequels.

            "content": "The original Highlander is a cult classic and for me, was a very enjoyable film. Despite not making a whole lot of money, there was a big enough following to at least warrant a franchise. The first sequel came out in 1991 and was called Highlander II: The Quickening and was directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander) and stars Christopher Lambert (Highlander), Virginia Madsen (Sideways), Michael Ironside (The Perfect Storm), Sean Connery (Highlander) and John C. McGinley (Platoon). The film was a box office failure and a critical bomb. The reason is tied to the fact that during production, investors took over creative control. Luckily (or not so), a director's cut called The Renegade Cut (of which is the most easily accessible version and is the only version I have watched and will be reviewing) and later a Special Edition was released. Both versions, fixed the fact that the theatrical release depicted the Immortals as aliens from a foreign planet. Despite this movie being the failure that it is, the following year a TV show was released which surprisingly was well received and was probably the only reason any more Highlander movies were made.The year is 2024 and the Earth's ozone layer is nearly destroyed and the only protection is a protective barrier which protects the Earth but at the cost of no sunlight. Who created this barrier? None other than Connor MacLeod, who now lives as a mortal. But when the villainous Katana, another immortal who wants to kill MacLeod. It is up to MacLeod to not only destroy the protective barrier (due to the fact that the barrier is not needed anymore) and to battle Katana.Despite the original theatrical cut being critically panned, I had a small inkling of hope that the Renegade Cut would be at least better. Well, for me, The Renegade Cut is just as awful as I could imagine the original theatrical cut being. As stated earlier, I am a fan of the original Highlander film and seeing this film was just painful. For starters, what made people want to see a sequel to a fantasy film, be a sci fi film? Nobody. This film does have fantasy elements but the main focus is the sci fi and it is just unappealing. The plot itself is fairly dumb. Since when did MacLeod become a scientist? Yes, I know the biggest criticism of the theatrical cut is the fact that the Immortals came from an alien planet, but that fact is completely omitted from the Renegade Cut. But there is still a flashback scene where MacLeod and Ramirez were shown fighting on an alien planet. It makes no sense to me and it frustrates me that any remnant of alien worlds in a Highlander film still remain. Whereas in the first film, MacLeod was made mysterious, this film does the opposite and makes him boring. Despite Sean Connery making a return, even this is a low point for a high profile actor like Sean Connery. Michael Ironside plays the villain, Katana and even the guy known for playing some of the greatest villains in sci fi movies, he just lacks the intimidation factor that Clancy Brown in the original had. Like Connery, even this is a low point for a high profile actor like Michael Ironside. The fight scenes in this film are largely underwhelming when in comparison to the original film. Special effects are largely dated with some fairly noticeable green screens and such. Also, no Queen soundtrack.Highlander II: The Quickening is a film that was a painful experience. Watching the Renegade Cut was a painful experience and it hurts my brain to even talk about the film Highlander II as a whole. It is a huge slap in the face to fans of the original film. This may be the single worst film I have ever seen and that's coming from someone who has seen Superman IV and Jaws: The Revenge. Best to avoid this one at all costs even if you are even curious about it.",

Some time later various versions of Highlander 2 were released in order to hopefully, cleans the taint that this movie has. While I have not seen the original Highlander 2 version of the film, I can say that this version is very good.Basically the movie starts off with some text telling you that it's the year 2024 and that the Earth has a shield around it to protect it from the sun. Connor is now and old man and has some flashbacks to Zeist. Now in the original version of this movie Zeist is another planet altogether. Now Zeist is part of Earth.Anyways, due to some bad guy General Katana who is still around sends some goons to kill Connor however they get killed and Connor is immortal again. Now though the use of the quickening Rameriz is brought back to life and now him and Connor must down the shield.There are a lot of visual changes in this movie. One being that some of the special effects are enhanced. For example, the shield is now blue in color instead of red like it was in the original film. Also other various scenes (like the plane ride, the fight in the shield room, etc) have been changed to look better.This film no matter how many changes are made to improve of it, will never get any better than this. The film is self is still average overall, so if you are willing to see the changes, rent this movie first, to see the improvements.",

            "content": "First of all let me point out that the rouge version makes a hell of a lot more sense then the botched theatrical release.If you look at the mess that is the Highlander franchise this film is the only addition to the story that actually fits in with what went before. Sure people didn't like the sci-fi angle. It seems most fans would rather have magic then science fiction used to explain things. Fair enough, but still this is a proper sequel. It does something new rather then just rehashing the same thing over and over or messing to heavily with the original classic so as to squeeze it's premise into the story. It was a reasonable concept.Really aside from the dislike of the sci-fi approach I don't see why people complain about this. It has great action, great humor (especially from Connory) and an interesting and original plot. It also had Micheal Ironside doing a superb job as the bad guy and the only bad guy in any of the Highlander films that has come remotely close to the quality of the Kurgen (indeed I prefer Ironsides character).The problems with the film were twofold. First some idiot at the movie studio decided the film needed to have the same kind of flow to it as the first movie and so edited it to do this. This involved combining two separate fight scenes together to make the one big one in the theatrical release. Hence his sword magically changing back and forth to a different one during that scene.The other problem was simply that they had completely failed to understand what most of the fans of the original wanted from a sequel. Truth is they still don't understand that and it's been so mixed up now they never will get it right without a reboot.Still, the voting on this film has clearly been effected by peoples dislike of the direction it took the franchise rather then the actual quality of the film. How this can score lower then the pointless third movie with it's fluffed out Connery moments and the Fourth movie which destroyed the entire franchise in one swoop, I do not know.Anyway, get hold of the \"rouge\" directors cut of the film and try and watch it with an open mind. It's much better then you were lead to believe.",

            "content": "The reason for the success of the original HIGHLANDER was that mostly everyone who went in to the cinema to see the film had no idea what to expect. Nobody knew anything about how an Immortal could be \"killed\" or about the mysterious prize that awaited the victor of the \"Gathering\".And so with its sequel the producers and the script writers  tried to emulate the success generated by these ambiguities by introducing HIGHLANDER fans to new plot revelations they would never have imagined such as Immortals actually being aliens. And in contrast to the fantasy theme of the first film the producers decided to include a more SCI FI theme to this sequel.Unfortunately many fans of the first film disliked these elements of this sequel. But people must realise that back in 1986 the producers had no intention of making a sequel and that the 1ST HIGHLANDER was to be a stand-alone film. But it was because of the success of the 1ST film along with the countless letters the producers received from fans who \"WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THE IMMORTALS\" that this sequel was given the go ahead.So the HIGHLANDER fans cannot blame the producers for scripting this film they way they had done.I thoroughly enjoyed the 1ST film back in 1986 and I was suprised when I heard there was a sequel was planned. I never got to see HIGHLANDER II in the cinemas when it was released. But I knew about the controversial storyline and to be honest I actually found it quite intriguing. I also found that most of my friends enjoyed HIGHLANDER II more than the 1ST film because of the effects and the storyline.When I finally got to see the film on video I thought it was very well done although it was somewhat loaded with script  continuity errors in relation to the story of the  1ST film. To be honest I did not feel that this film had \"damaged\" the HIGHLANDER saga like some people  have stated. In fact it is the stupid THIRD FILM along with the pathetic TV SERIES and the  even sillier ANIMATED SERIES that has eroded the  novelty and entertainment value of the original HIGHLANDER movie.And now after recently watching the 1ST HIGHLANDER movie again after a long interval I feel that it has aged badly and reeks of campiness (even my dad who watched it for the first time thought it was silly that these people were still using swords in the present age instead of using modern guns and explosives!!)And this is where HIGHLANDER II triumphs. It has not dated at all since 1991. And the storyline about the ozone layer accurately reflects the crisis today where there is now  a city near the south pole that is without Ozone protection.The special effects are excellent and the fight scenes are the best in the Saga. I particularily like the swords and weapons of the Alien Immortals (Especially Katana's broadsword). Michael Ironside gives a sterling performance as the evil Katana whose charisma and viciousness far outshines the villains of the other films (Kurgan, Kane). The lovely and underrated Virginia Madsen also delivers a fine performance. And there is a genuine sense of warmth and comraderie between Connery and Lambert's characters in this film that never appeared in the original HIGHLANDER movie.It is a pity that the producers never continued with the ZEIST storyline in the other sequels even though HIGHLANDER II was the most successful film of the series.I would recommend the new RENEGADE version over the old QUICKENNING version as it has more footage and action and less of the harsh editing that permeated the older version.All in all HIGHLANDER II is the best of the series regardless of what some fans say (it is because of these fans that the Saga has been dragged out in the form of the stupid 3RD/ 4TH films and the sad TV and animated series.)At least HIGHLANDER II like the 1ST is an ORIGINAL film!!!",

            "content": "'Highlander' is a movie that shouldn't have sequels at all. The first movie is almost perfect, from beginning to end. The fact that the original story doesn't explain a lot about the immortality element, makes its characters more believable in a poetic kind of way.Since they had to create a sequel, this was the only way to do it. In what other way can you approach this movie for a second time, without trying to extend and analyze the elements of the original movie? How can you bring back the highlander, without coming up with a concept similar to the quickening?Of course, this doesn't mean that the story is good. It is one of the worst sequels of all time, but it still is as good as a Highlander sequel could be.Russell Mulcahy did a fantastic job directing 'Highlander II'. The opera introduction contains some of the most spectacular cinematic scenes ever filmed and the whole movie has a very intense Gothic atmosphere. The sets are wonderful and I believe one of the sets is one of the largest sets ever created for a movie.That's what's great with 'Highlander II'; it provides a great cinematic experience, something that is missing since the heavy use of computer graphics. Even though computers create very realistic virtual sets, the trained eye can always tell when a set is artificial and evidently less effective. Perhaps Burton's 'Planet of the Apes' is the first movie that brings back that old feeling, with the space station introduction.Another thing that is great about 'Highlander II' is Sean Connery's performance, which brings fun to the story for a second time. Michael Ironside is great too.The producers, in an attempt to rescue some of the sequel's pride, came up with the 'Renegade version' a few years later. Although it is more down to earth (in every sense) than the 'Quickening version', it is less over the top and since it didn't become a masterpiece, it is more boring.So, even though 'Highlander II' is based on a weak story, it contains some brilliant elements, namely the direction and the performances. Russell Mulcahy will be directing a new installment next year and I am sure that it is going to be great. A talented man wouldn't repeat the same mistakes for a second time, would he?7/10",

The really bad ones could only hope to attain a 9 on the Highlander II scale.Highlander II is so bad, it reaches back into the past and spoils the first one. The first one did not try to explain the immortals. That was one of the coolest things about it. Fans who watched the first one could come up with their own interpretation of why the immortals were immortal. After you saw the first one, you could develop your own personal cool theory and explain it to your girlfriend / discuss with mates about why they were immortals...Highlander II decided to destroy that \"cool factor\" with their silly idiotic explanation. The twits that made the movie must have been high on something! Or perhaps they got a mentally retarded 5-year old to come up with that explanation!

Yes, there are a lot of acceptable reasons to list the negative parts of this film, but anyway, try to focus on a different angle.In my opinion, this film has a real great vision of a \"cyberpunk future\". Somehow like in Blade Runner, and that kind of movies: dark streets, rain, depressed people, technology, giant firm, activists (in a good sense), who try to fight against them, etc.Weak parts are many, for me the superficiality of the story is the biggest. For example, you can divide the film into certain scenes, but these part are too short and roughly developed: when you start to enjoy one...it's over. The story is simple, but even in this situation, due to the \"short scenes\", you ask yourself: \"WHAT was that, and WHY happened that?\" The execution of the visual part of this dark future world is very nice, but the lack of a coherent and progressing story is a bit painful.The performance of the actors are sufficient, good performances, just maybe Michael Ironside overacted a bit his role in some scenes.So, everything at all: I know, that this film has a lot of disadvantages compared with Highlander I, and does not meet many fans expectations, but I think, that it isn't as bad, as lot of people says.If you like cyberpunk, and you doesn't wait too much things from the Highlander I - just watch this movie in itself, don't relate too much to the first part - then I think it's a fair good movie, even more than a Watch-it-Once.",

It is one of my all time favourites. It may have some laughable details in the depiction of the swords, such as swords being able to hack through steel girders, but I can forgive these silly little details in the original movie, because it is such great fun to watch.The same can not be said of Highlander 2.This movie is bad.It is so bad one can hardly believe it is anything more than some kind of sick parody, as opposed to a true sequel, and, if one is stupid enough to watch it, will leave that person in a shocked stupor wondering just how the makers of this film could have corrupted the themes and characters of the original film to the outrageous extent that they did. I will not bother giving you any details about this movie. I have seen it, and I can honestly tell you that you are better off not knowing anything about it. I kid you not.Even Christopher Lambert threatened to quit during the making of the movie, because it was so bad.Highlander (the original) is an excellent movie.

Trust me on this.***ADDENTUM: Looking through the comments, I can see a great disparity between people who give this movie good reviews and those who rate it as downright awful.This is not the contradiction it seems to be however. Upon closer inspection one will notice that the majority of bad reviews, like my own, are based on the original theatrical release (The Quickening), which is truly awful, while the majority of good reviews are based on another version of the movie (The Renegade Edition), which, I am told, is actually quite good. I have not seen the Renegade Edition, so my review is based on the earlier version.The Renegade Edition of Highlander 2 is quite different from The Quickening, because the original director went back, and completely re-edited the film, restoring it as closely as possible to the way he had originally intended for it to be, as opposed to The Quickening, which had been heavily meddled with by various people within the studio that produced the film. ***",

            "content": "\"Ashes to Ashes. Dust to Dust. If you don't take it out, it's going to dust.\"--- a line spoken by Michael Ironside 's bad guy character Katana in Highlander 2.I don't know if the actors thought they were returning to a good movie or they were contractually obligated to be in this movie, but something went horribly wrong. How do you mess up a movie starring Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery as Connor MacLeod and Ramirez with the talented Virginia Madsen playing the smart love interest Louise and the best movie villain actor ever, Michael Ironside as the villain? This movie managed to do so. Highlander is a movie franchise about an immortal warrior who walks the Earth alone through the centuries occasionally encountering and battling others like him until there can be only one left. The only way to kill a Highlander is for him to be beheaded in battle. It's a simple premise and many interesting storylines can be built on the concept, but this movie plot wasn't one. It's so confusing that at one point in the movie, Madsen's character Louise tries explaining the confusing plot and MacLeod replies, \"Something like that.\"I think the plot is that Ramirez and MacLeod are in the past when Ramirez is still alive since he dies in the first movie. They get captured by Ironside's character Katana's army and before Katana is about to kill them at the beginning of the movie, some council of three bald-headed white guys in an ex machina plot device say Ramirez and MacLeod must go to the future and must choose to remain immortal or die old as humans. Ramirez and MacLeod are teleported to the future to 2029 and we see MacLeod as an old man in bad makeup with a weepy voice you can barely understand. Humankind destroyed the ozone layer in 1999 which killed off a lot of humans so MacLeod created a shield over the Earth to save the rest of the human race from dying off so humans can no longer see the changes in the seasons and climate. A company called Shield manages the ozone layer shield for the entire planet. Louise sneaks into Shield with her team called Cobalt and finds out the ozone layer is back to normal. Shield doesn't want the world to know so it can stay rich. They tried to capture Louise and she escapes and goes to find old man MacLeod. Meanwhile in the past, Katana is tired of waiting for MacLeod to return to the past so he can kill him. The council of three bald headed white men says MacLeod is going to die of old age. But that isn't good enough for Katana so he sends two of his goons to the future to kill old man MacLeod. Back in the future, MacLeod is revered and respected even back the hoodlums in the future. MacLeod sees Louise is wanted on the news for breaking into Shields but no one cares about her being a wanted woman and it's never addressed again even when she escapes and changes back into civilian clothing. She finds MacLeod and tells him the ozone layer is normal. He doesn't believe her and then the two goons from the past comes to battle old man MacLeod which is old man Macleod running away from the first goon until he outsmarts him, beheads him, gets his the goon's sword and turns back into young MacLeod impressing Louise who watches the scene. The look on Lambert's face and everything exploding around him is classic MacLeod from the original movie. Then, it returns back to stupid with MacLeod fighting the second goon on the Back to the Future Part II hoover board which made him look goofy. The anticlimactic fight scene ends with a bored MacLeod pulling a string and beheading him. He walks over to Louise and reintroduces himself as the young MacLeod, the score from the original Highlander plays and they kiss and have sex on side of a building. Who does that? Oh, and everyone else in the movie ignores the fact that old man MacLeod is now young and talks to him like nothing is different. If everyone in the movie knows MacLeod is an immortal, the movie never addresses it. He calls out to Ramirez who magically appears in a theatrical stage in Scotland in the middle of the play. I have to admit all the scenes with Connery, even in their stupidity, are quite funny. He plays it like a Shakespearean actor stuck in a bad movie. Meanwhile back in the past, Katana is watching all of this. I don't know if he's been sitting in a cave for centuries watching on a hologram or if it just placed MacLeod in 2029 and MacLeod remembers everything that happens in the past or what. The movie never addresses it. But Katana says the clich\u00e9, \"if you want something done right, you got to do it yourself\" and is teleported into the future to kill MacLeod since he couldn't wait. My favorite scene in the movie is the playful fight between MacLeod and Ramirez and you can tell MacLeod and Connery enjoyed that scene. I don't know if they ad lib their lines but it was a good scene.\nI don't feel like writing anymore about this movie. I think you get the gest of my point. The fighting scenes were anticlimactic. Even the final battle between MacLeod and Ironside. After he defeated Katana, MacLeod said bored, \"There can be only one.\" It was funny when Connery ex machina himself out the movie halfway through and Lambert gave him a look telling him he was the lucky one while he had half an hour left in this craphole. Madsen and Lambert get to their destination and find out the ozone layer is indeed normal. All MacLeod had to do in order to turn off the shield is to walk through it. Instead of returning to the past, the movie ends with the shield destroyed, stars reappearing in the sky, MacLeod walking away like nothing happen, and with him kissing Louise by a lake and then the movie just ends. I thought he was at least going to return to the past.\nSo the movie sucks, the actors did the best they could with the garbage script they were given and fulfilled their contractual obligation to complete this movie. . This movie is the Jason X of the Highlander franchise and luckily it didn't kill the franchise and the Highlanders 3 and 4 were so much better and truer to the original than this laughably bad movie. If you look at it from being so bad it's funny, it's not that bad and you'll find yourself laughing at the stupidity of the movie. All of Sean Connery scenes were funny. It was obvious Lambert hated being in this movie, but he enjoyed working with Madsen, Connery, and Ironside. Luckily, the franchise surprised this atrocity of a movie, and at least we have three out of five. I haven't checked out Highlanders 5: The Source starring Adrian Paul as Duncan MacLeod. I enjoyed the Highland TV series from the 90s starring Paul and I recently watched the trailer and saw Jim Byrnes from the TV series is in too, so I'll give it a fair shot.\nBut I watched Highlanders 2: The Renegade Version if that made a difference. I got the complete series on sale and this one is separate from the rest of the movies. But you want something to laugh at it because it sucks, check it out. If you are a true fan of the franchise, then skip it because it will only make you angry for how it wasted a talented cast.",

Mostly love the actress who plays Heather.  But she doesn't do movies much.But I also like Chris.  Who probably does movie  more for money than most actors.  (why would anyone do Druids??)  But it was his Highlander movies that he was best at.H2  isn't for true fans of the first movie.  (whats a true fan.  don't look at me.  More like obsessed fans.

Now a supervillain played by Michael Ironside best known as the man who gave all in stages against those bugs. Ironside as another reviewer wrote gives a great Jack Nicholson impersonation.I guess for box office insurance the producers brought Sean Connery back from the first Highlander film.

Five years later, the sequel bell rang, and this movie is what Mulcahy came up with.  And all I have to say is:  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!?!?The movie starts off in 1999, with the Earth slowly dying because the ozone layer is gone, and the Sun is baking us.  Conner McCloud, the Highlander, now mortal, has invented a shield to protect Earth from the ultraviolet rays.  Skip ahead 25 years, and the Earth is dying once again, because the Sun can't shine through the shield and all of the Earth's pollution is trapped inside the shield (the ultimate greenhouse effect).  McCloud must now try to find out what the Shield Corp. is hiding from him.  Oh, and there's some nonsense about immortals thrown in for the hell of it.Other than the fact that this is just a terribly made movie, it has a type of sequel cancer, called Halloween 3 Syndrome, where the sequel disregards everything that has happened in the previous movie(s).  In the first Highlander, all of the immortals were just differently-abled humans.  Now, we're told that they're actually aliens who were banished from another planet.  And to become The One in the first film, McCloud had to be the only immortal left.  Well, come to find out, there are lots more immortals, so that nonsense about \"there can be only one\", well, that goes right out the window.  The whole film appears to be a ripoff of Total Recall.  Connery, who died in the first movie (but look, there he is!!), all but looks at his watch to check his hours billable.  Lambert, who always appears to be having fun, appears to be having fun.  The production values are garbage, and the FX are sooooo 1980s.  This movie is a full flight of stairs down from the first one.  Even the score, by ex-Police drummer Stewart Copeland, is a dropoff from the great Queen music of the first one.  This movie is on equal grounds with Plan 9 and should be avoided, unless you're some kind of sick Chris Lambert or Virginia Madsen fan.  Rent the original instead.",

I actually made my fianc\u00e9, her sister and her sisters boyfriend wait to eat until I finished warning everyone in the line, I was on a mission to make the world just that much better. I think I was successful in most cases, many people thanked me. New Yorkers, standing in line in January, thanked me for telling them they were more than wasting their time, they were sacrificing it to the unworthy. Highlander II: The quickening and Serenity mark the ends of the scale upon which all SF movies can be measured IMDb doesn't have a zero rating or I would have used it. It is the cinematic equivalent of absolute zero, and I saw both Toxic Avenger and Battle beyond the Stars in theaters on their respective opening weekends. SPOILER WARNING: This next paragraph contains the spoiler I mentioned up front, skip to the \"YOU ARE NOW BEYOND THE SPOILER\" message to avoid double spoilage. They must have offered Sean Connery a couple of shipping containers full of unmarked bills and the promise that his character would die early in the movie to get him involved.

For me, after that movie it should have ended as the hero triumphed and he and his gal could live happily ever after and there was no more threat that a crazed immortal could take control of the world and do twisted things to it. Yet even though the hero was the last one standing after said movie, there are still many sequels and television shows after the hero in the first movie killed all the other immortals. Here is the first sequel to that film and while the first film to me was okay and nothing great, it shines a whole lot brighter than this very bizarre and horribly written sequel. I am surprised that any other sequels were made after this one or the television show as this seems like it would kill any chances for that to happen it is so bad. In this movie it is the future, the Earth's ozone has been totally destroyed thus McCloud the immortal who slashed all the heads off all the other immortal warriors actually devised a shield that covers the Earth and protects it from the sun's harmful rays (the ultimate pair of sunglasses). Well at the start of the film he is old and weathered and then he fights two guys who fly around in circles on clearly visible wires and kills them and ends up young again. Do not ask all I know is the immortals are from strange planet, somehow Sean Connery's character returns and the whole film is just bizarre and not in the good way like in another Sean Connery movie \"Zardoz\" or the equally strange in a good way \"Brazil\".

Highlander II: The Quickening, or growing up, people used to call \"Highlander II: The Sickening,\" was just one pile of a mess and quite literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't even know where to begin, but then again, neither did the cast & crew.Nothing made sense, just scenes spliced together. Things just happened and then the movie went on. The special effects were horrible, the acting was forced and the ideas underdeveloped. I am guessing a lot of this was supposed to be comedy, and I will admit one scene did make me smirk: the airplane \"safety\" video was pretty clever and funny. Unfortunately, in the entire film, those 15 seconds were the only mild- fun I had.I can't even give the synopsis because I doubt there was ever a finished script. But suffice to say, the \"only one\" had destroy the machine he built and the stakes aren't really that high, either way. This movie was an abomination, from beginning to end. It's the exact opposite on how to construct a film. And unfortunately, it's been over 14 years since I've seen the original \u2013 IF I saw it \u2013 and I cannot remember that one in the least to compare it.

Since the idea of immortals being aliens is pretty lame (rest of series has immortals' roots unknown), they made the re-edited RENEGADE version where they are immortals, not aliens. I really like this movie. Connor Macleod's hair was better in part 1, but it's still cool. He is a really bad a** dude in this movie.

The film was never completed before cinema release. 2. It was edited together by studio executives. 3. 19 minutes of the film was cut, leaving gaping plot holes.Recently the director (Mulcahy) and producer (Panzer) using their own money completed the film and edited it back together following the original story boards and script. The result is the Renegade Version. To my knowledge it has only been released this way on R1 DVD and laserdisc.This version of the film is terrific. All references to the main characters originating from an alien world are gone. It is edited with the missing 19 minutes included to give the story a compelling imaginitve story arc. The special effects have been enhanced and look stunning, all the edited violence put back in and the original 2:35:1 aspect ratio is presented. In short Highlander 2 'The Renegade Version' has turned out to be a highly enjoyable, visually stunning science fiction action feast. The best improvement is that the movie now does not look out of place within the trilogy.The original version (Quickening) should only be viewed to bare witness to how studio executives have now idea what film making is about. Every director who has to suffer the incompetence of interfering executives should quote this example.In brief Highlander 2 'The Renegade Version' is terrific science fiction and an easy 7 out of 10.",

It's produced with a decent budget but the action was all visual effects and mindless violence. After The Hunt For Red October, Connery didn't need to wait to long to get his ponytail. Since apparently your hair still grows in the after life, Despite biting the dust in the first movie, Connery is back. \"When you need me, you only have to call my name\" Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez is a hell of a name to tell if you were in a tricky spot. Luckily simply \"Ramirez\" worked.Apart from James Bond, Ramirez is the only other character Sean Connery has played in more than one film. He received 3.5 million dollars for nine days of filming (which amounts to about 10 mins screen time). Connery used all the money as donations for charitable causes. Did he take this one for the money?? At least he did some good with it if he did. There are too many differences in the two versions to list, scenes are cut and changed around, dialogue is changed or missing, but in both versions, the plot is pretty much a muddled mess, there are a lot of continuity errors and most of the supporting cast are awful (Especially following on from watching The Russia House which was filled with wonderful performances). Virginia Madsen is gorgeous, but her character is annoying and her constant costume changes (every scene) are a distraction. Michael Ironside (whilst a decent actor) seems to be doing an awful impression of Kurgan from the first movie, however he is nowhere near as intimidating as Clancy Brown. John C McGinley (an actor I like) is awful and how on earth did Jerry The Cab Driver ever get cast in a movie?? In the Renegade version the end fight is split in to two scenes about 30 mins apart, making the end fight a tad anti climactic and over too soon!! Connery's scenes are more spread out too in this version too, to make it look like he is in it more. The airplane scene is split into separate parts for example. Sadly my favourite line of dialogue of his is missing in The Renegade VersionMaCloud \"It sounds like magic\" Ramires \"Well it is..... hmmm kind of\"Referencing the Queen song A Kind Of Magic wrote for the first movie.

Connery didn't seem like he really wanted to be in this one, but couldn't find a way out of it - and it really showed in his poor acting. Lambert did a fair job, but not as well as in the original film. Ironside steals the show in the acting department. The plot is totally unbelievable and the special effects, especially the \"shield\" aren't very good. They did maintain continuity with the first film pretty well. However, overall, it is a definite step downward in writing, performance and adaptation.

            "content": "Sequels are difficult to make right especially when their parent film made such a high impression on its initial fan base. The crew who made Highlander (1986) were almost entirely against making a sequel because of how well received the original was. Unfortunately when it comes to film contracts, it's not so easy go against what is wanted. So that already created friction between the film crew and the studio itself. Then on top of that, deciding to drastically make edits to the finished script last minute is never a thing that's going to roll over well. Nobody was happy with how things were being changed so frequently and it led to one of the most disappointing sequels to a promising start up franchise. Many fans considered it to be a lot like Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), where it completely ignored anything that was setup in the first film. Thankfully over time Mulcahy was able to form his own cut of the film. It may not be good but it is also not the worst sequel in existence.Being written by Brian Clemens, William N. Panzer and Peter Bellwood, the story has some points that are good, but most of it is completely deviant from that of the first film. What's even stranger is that both Panzer and Bellwood had worked on Highlander (1986); producer and writer respectively. Clemens had certainly enough years of experience to help in the writing process but it's unknown how much he contributed. The story takes place in 2024 where the ozone has depleted and shield has been placed around the earth to protect it from the sun. The person behind this successful project is none other than Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert). However there's a resistance group lead by Louise Marcus (Virginia Madsen) who believe the shield can be destroyed because the ozone has recovered. Meanwhile an antagonist by the name of General Katana (Michael Ironside) is out to kill MacLeod because as the tag line goes, \"there can only be one\". This is the simplest way to describe this and it certainly needs work.From what is elaborated on, it turns out both Ramirez (Sean Connery) and MacLeod were sent from another world to earth. This place is where all of these immortals come from. However with that said, it entirely negates and washes out any heart Highlander (1986) had to begin with. What was the point of killing Ramirez in the first film only to bring him back again? Not that viewers wouldn't want to see Connery again, but his exit was in such poignant way, it's weird to resurrect him. Having the script explain the background to MacLeod's situation was fine but it gets lost really fast with the inclusion of the sci-fi element of ozone depletion and shield use. It just feels like the wrong genre considering what the first film had established so well. The script does however reference the history of the first film so it's not like omits everything, which is why so many people make the claim that it is the worst sequel. Thankfully the writing for the characters is half there too.Christopher Lambert maintains his character's personality even with the odd story he's given to work with. Sean Connery although having him return in general is off putting, has a performance that is very affable. He has a number of good scenes that involve him getting familiar with the new surroundings of the future. Even Virginia Madsen, who doesn't do a whole lot at least has a few lines that can grab a viewers attention. On the other hand, all the villains on screen are way over the top than they should be. Michael Ironside can be a menacing villain but here he walks around with a wide grin overacting every line. The same could be said for his henchman. There's also a subplot about the head of the shield business David Blake (John C. McGinley) wanting to overthrow the co-creator of the shield, Dr. Allan Neyman (Allan Rich). McGinley is about as evenly matched to Ironside in this movie. Every bit of dialogue from this guy was given way too much energy.Speaking of energy, the action is also lacking in that too. For a story about an immortal swordsman, there's only a few scenes that involve sword fights. Other times its gun fire or not at all. And when these scenes do occur, they aren't that exciting. Old fashioned action should be though. It's sad when even that becomes boring. Unfortunately camera-work wasn't all that impressive this time round either. Captured by Phil Meheux, the shots are uninteresting. Most likely because the setting is so different from that of the original. Meheux did however work on The Mask of Zorro (1998), Bicentennial Man (1999) and Casino Royale (2006). The music was a little better though. Composed by The Police Band member Stewart Copeland, the score to this film is unfortunately hard to find but does provide some adequately constructed material. Even if some of the original themes Michael Kamen created seep into the cracks as well. That's cheating. Copeland also scored Wall Street (1987) and Taking Care of Business (1990).Some say this is the worst of the worst. Not so, there are sequels that far surpass this. Sure, the antagonists are way too silly and the script makes significant changes to what the original film laid out. Even the sci-fi edge is all wrong and really should have been omitted or worked in another way. Still though the protagonists are likable and the music is acceptable. It's not a good story at all, but it's not the worst.",

Highlander 2 is bad but I honestly prefer it over the original.The acting was fine like in the original. Michael Ironside is really hammy as the villain. The cast knew the script was terrible in fact Christopher Lambert tried dropping out of the film.The plot was messy, the script should of been rewritten since Highlander 2 isn't another rushed sequel. I said that because Highlander 2 isn't a rehash and it came out six years after the original. The film retcons the original mainly the theatrical version. The Immortals are aliens in the theatrical version and in the Director's Cut, they were banished to the future and reborn. The Immortals being aliens reminds me of the 2014 Ninja Turtles reboot because Michael Bay wanted the turtles to be aliens.The film looks better than the original since it had a bigger budget. The effects are fine, digital effects were added. Roger Ebert bashed the effects so apparently the theatrical version has terrible effects. The production design is good, the city honestly looks like Gotham City in Tim Burton's Batman.Overall, Highlander 2 is bad but not terrible. I honestly prefer it over the original which I know is a hot take. The acting and effects are fine. If you enjoyed Highlander, you might as well give it a shot.",

It's even reminds me of original Dune books by Frank Herbert and David's Lynch adaptation (version by Denis Villeneuve is great, but too Pop for me). Funny thing is: Virginia Madsen plays princess Irulan in Dune and she play's eco terrorist in Highlander. It has a little bit of Total Recall 90' brilliant madness. And yes! Michael Ironside is here to be the bad guy for us once again. I think this movie shouldn't be forgotten no matter how \"bad\" it is and how low the ratings are.

The biggest issue seems to be that its not a rehash of the first movie which seems to be what some people were expecting. They wanted another highlander set in Scotland amongst the glens. However that story had run its course and the only logical progression for an immortal was to set the movie in the future. \nThe plot is focused on a cyberpunk styled future where the planets protective ozone layer is diminished and only survives due to a shield developed by the Highlander, who is now an old man as he is now affected by ageing. \nWe now learn that he was from another world and when inhabitants from his old home arrive to kill him his immortal powers return.\nThis movie shares some of the same music and themes as the first which if you allow yourself to get over the disappointment that this isn't a clone of the first movie, you may well find an enjoyable sequel.\nMichael Ironside is one of the best Hollywood villains ever and is a suitable replacement for the Kurgan. John C. McGinley plays the role of the slimy corporate weasel to perfection and of course we have Christopher Lambert as MacLeod, as good as he was in the original. As for the Scottish element, we see Sean Connery being fitted for a suit in Edinburgh while drinking whisky, cant get much more Scottish than that?\nFranchises have to evolve to survive, and this sequel is an evolution of the original story. Is it a bad movie? In my opinion no, its fun, has a great cast. great effects, moves fast and has enough of the spirit of the original to keep may fans of the original happy. What its not is a carbon copy of the original and it seems for some that is its biggest crime. The \"I don't like change\" argument isn't a valid reason to hate a great movie.",

I have never seen THE RENEGADE VERSION, which I'm told is better, so I can only judge the studio cut (although its hard to believe that this is salvageable). The only real reasons to watch HIGHLANDER 2 are pyrotechnics and Sean Connery (different for Lambert fans). It opens with Labert sitting in an opera house in the future, suddenly remembering planet Ziest, and this movie's explanation for the immortals. There's some nonsense about an ozone-shield and the sky looks like a neon display. Labert is getting old, then he kills some aliens and turn young in an explosion of sparks. Huh? The film's logic is f***ed. Things drag on noisily in what looks like HIGHLANDER meets BLADE RUNNER until... Connery comes back from the dead (at this point you won't care why). It's no surprise that Connery gets all the best scenes, too. He arrives on Earth in the midst of a performance of Hamlet and mocks the actors. Later he romances a woman on an airplane and they're shown a hilarious flight-safety movie in which a plane explodes. The rest of the picture is sword fights and sparks in dirty, rusty places. Some of the action is good, and Michael Ironside is fun to watch as the villain. But for any one good part, there are at least three bad ones. A particularly stupid scene has two aliens with goggles and rocket packs who torment Christopher Lambert and stick their tongues out a lot. On the whole the movie is pretty silly. The first movie was nothing great but it was better than this. I'd still take this movie over ENDGAME, because this has a s***ty 80s appeal that the TVish ENDGAME could not provide. Mulcahy is a director with vision and not much else. The film would have done well if as much energy had been put into character and story as had been put into design and special effects.",

WTF!!!) Having seen the first film at the pictures I was sure this could not fail to at least be okay, boy was I wrong. As an idea it's almost as bad as \"Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season\" but at least that was a spoof, this is real. To be fair as a film on its own it only sucks really bad and maybe that would be okay, but as the sequel to Highlander? The film might as well be called Terminator 2 because it has much relevancy to that film series as it does to this one.The acting is tired and ineffective, much like the direction which seems to largely be about how many windows they can blow up as there wasn't enough glass shattered in the first film. The story and script are abysmal and just re-write and ignore every little scrap of info we gleaned from the first film, it's almost as though the writers have picked up the video of the first film, read the back and thought, \"That sounds good, let's write a sequel!\" without even watching the first film! This is without doubt the worst sequel of all time and avoid at all costs, the rating is higher than it should be.Addendum: Interesting point of fact, the first film, like Raiders of the Lost Ark, got bad reviews from a number of critics, unlike Raiders, it also failed at the box office but lived again through home video, the poster for this film was full of reviewers plaudits, but the film was terrible, the lesson of the story?

Panzer and Peter Bellwood, was just a train wreck of a storyline. The plot was all over the place, and it made very little sense. If you put \"Highlander II: The Quickening\" up next to \"Highlander\", then this 1991 movie is a sheer dumpster fire. Even with a cast ensemble that included Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery, Virginia Madsen, Michael Ironside and John C. McGinley the movie stood a snowball's chance in Hell. And it was solely the lousy writing and the incoherent script that caused the movie to fail.The acting performances in the movie were adequate, and they had a good cast ensemble. But the movie was just derailed by the horrible script, and even talents like Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery, Virginia Madsen, Michael Ironside and John C. McGinley could do next to nothing to lift the movie up to a bearable level.Visually then \"Highlander II: The Quickening\" was an improvement from the 1986 \"Highlander\" movie, naturally. But oddly enough, then this 1991 sequel didn't really make all that much use of special effects.If you enjoyed the \"Highlander\" movie, then chances are slim that you will enjoy this poorly constructed 1991 sequel. Yet, I managed to endure it and sit through it for a second time here late in 2022 since it was originally released back in 1991. I have to admit though, honestly, that I had entirely forgotten the storyline in the movie, and with good cause, and thus I opted to watch it again here in 2022.My rating of \"Highlander II: The Quickening\" lands on a generous three out of ten stars.",

It was, but it was also ... different. I was wondering if I was remembering it wrong, but then realized there are multiple versions, and in fact the original theatrical release is almost impossible to find.The craziest part of the first version was that McCloud and Ramirez turned out to be from another planet, calls Zeist. That detail was so roundly mocked that they cut it out of later versions, but now it even makes less sense, if such a thing is possible. Now they're from Earth's \"distant past\" (where nevertheless people fight with machine guns) and were exiled to the less distant past. There's an exposition...eh...I mean \"sentencing\" scene, where it's explained to them that they will be \"punished\" by being made immortal (huh?), unless their heads are cut off.The less distant past was in principle the time of the first movie, but there's really zero connection to that movie. Just for one glaring example, since McCloud and Ramirez were exiled together, why didn't they know each other in the first? The biggest disconnect is of course that Ramirez returns after getting his head chopped off in the first movie. This is never really explained. Actually, nothing is explained, and nothing makes sense. The laws of both logic and physics are thrown right out the window, and trying to swap the alien planet for the past ended up introducing a lot more problems than it solves.I could pick the movie apart piece by piece, but that would take a long time, so I'll focus on the much shorter list of good things in the movie.

This makes me even wonder if anyone created a script at all ( I already know what went wrong on the set, but every film has a screenplay ).Also, every bad movie has somewhat redeeming values and I will list them for the viewer here: -Looney villains who laugh at our heroes even though there is nothing funny about the scene.-Sean Connery is excellent in any scene he is in, even if what monologue comes out of his mouth is beyond ridiculous.-For some fans of B-movies, there are continuous plot-holes to spot and gratuitous bloody violence !-Michael Ironside gets mad in one scene and \"transports\" himself onto a train for no reason at all, kills the conductor, speeds up the train, while laughing, to where it crashes and everyone dies except him ( since he is immortal ). It has to be seen to believe, I know! It's recommended for any pure film buff who has to see all the award-winners and all the turkeys !",

This is along with having to contend with Christopher Lambert in ridiculous old man make up doing a hilarious croaky old man voice at the beginning. The convulted and sketchy plot from here on in is also a big problem. There's some nice action here and there, but generally the magic's definitely gone with this mis-firing sequel. **",

No, this isn't the worst movie of all time - it's \"funny\"-bad, not bad-bad, like Moment By Moment. But my, what a steaming incoherent pile of dreck.

As much as I hate to admit it, I saw this movie in a movie theater without having seen the first movie. Grudgingly I visited the first Highlander expecting the same torpor that I that got here, but to my surprise I actually like that movie. That depressed me because it made me hate this movie even more! I didn't see Highlander III, I just thought I would quit while I was ahead.Highlander 2: The Quickening is a movie that doesn't require suspension of disbelief so much as it requires a full-frontal lobotomy with a chainsaw. The script was edited with a cheese grater and written with the wan hope that anyone watching the film wouldn't ask too many questions. We're not supposed to shake our heads when the movie begins in 1999; shift ahead 25 years then shifts backwards 500 years to medieval Scotland and then to another planet. I make it a practice not to dismiss a movie right off the bat but when the movie shifts time three times 15 minutes, I begin finding a better use for the cinema light to examine my ticket for the refund policy.It begins 500 years in the past on the Planet Zeist and I assume that the rotation works on that same time table as earth even though it's sun is so close that the inhabitants should be deep fried. It coincides with earth time so that it can explain why the movie shifts to medieval Scotland to explain how Connor McLoed, one of the planets \"immortals\", has found himself in a kilt on horseback. He is sent to Scotland as punishment for leading a rebellion and as a term of his sentence, he's immortal. But not really. Well sorta.Actually the movie tries to explain this in a bit of dialogue that isn't much help. A character says: \"You're mortal there, but you're immortal here, until you kill all the guys from there who have come here, and then you're mortal here. Unless, you go back there, or some more guys from there came here, in which case you become immortal here, again.\" It's pretty bad when the characters are as confused by the plot as we are.Also, in 1999 there's some business about the O-Zone finally collapsing and threatening to fry mankind. Connor offers up a shield called Shield (?) to keep the rays of the sun from turning us into charcoal. The idea of the shield isn't quite as difficult to explain as that immortality thing but it isn't any more logical. McLoed's big idea involves concentrating the planet's energy into a \"lay-zur\" and is shot up into a satellite. Therefore Earth is saved from solar radiation (proving, I suppose, that if we would have depended on solar power, there would be hell to pay).But, there's a drawback, there is no sun and the temperature consistently 99 degrees. Being 99 degrees raises another question of why, in 2024, we find Conner attending the Opera surrounded men in tuxes who should all be passing out from the heat. Furthermore there would be a major loss of food production and the land would be desert, but hey at least the arts are finally getting a boost.Sean Connery puts another dent in his reputation by appearing as Ramirez, a Zeist- banished warrior now clanking swords in medieval Scotland. He doesn't appear much in the movie and I wasn't surprised given the material. But then I saw Highlander and I wondered how managed to fit into this movie since we last saw him in the previous film minus a head. Maybe Zardoz had something to do with that.Maybe it's asking too much, but this movie has to be seen to be believed. Nah, that's asking too much, don't see it and just believe me, it sucks.",

Have you read James Axler's 'Deathlands', Stephen King's 'The Dark Tower', or Fred Saberhagen's 'Swords'? These are all tales which deal with the second rising of civilization on the ruins of a previous civilization that met some sort of disaster - natural, self-afflicted, etc, and was wiped from the annals of time.Joe Dawson said it best: \"They have existed since the dawn of time.\" Long before the rising of our current civilization (Rome and on til today) there was another civilization, one that had become technologically advanced. That is where Connor, Ramirez, and Katana (and possibly the Kurgan, I'll tell you why later if I have enough room). Even there immortals are mysteries but in a society definitely on the downward spiral, immortals are banished to random points in the future (to prevent the Prize from being won and upsetting the balance of power further) instead of executed. Ramirez (immortal already) happened to land ~2000 years before Connor (still mortal, see HL:The Series and HL4:Endgame to see that immortals can sense if a mortal has the potential for immortality). The reason that I think that the Kurgan is the simple fact that he knew Connor's name when they first met. Knowing that Connor is immortal is an ability that he would have but knowing his name would either require a spy in the McCleod's (unfounded) or prior knowledge of Connor. The reason why Katana waited so long to take an interest in Connor again is that it took Kurgan 400+ years to fight Connor.",

            "content": "I'll never forget my initial viewing of the film (The Quickening) back in the mid 1990's.  I had just seen the original Highlander and liked it so much that I thought I ought to see the sequel.  After my initial viewing of the film I was in awe and quite upset because the film just didn't make any sense with regard to the first film.  The film left a somewhat bad taste in my mouth.  Nonetheless, I purchased the film on DVD (The Renegade Version) and decided just the other day to bust it out and watch it.I've come to a conclusion about this film after watching The Renegade version and thinking long and hard about this film.  I refuse to accept this film as a sequel to Highlander!  Sure, it has some of the same characters and elements, but I still cannot see it as a sequel.  What I'm trying to say is that if you should have no problem understanding the movie if you haven't seen the original Highlander.  The film stands on it's own and actually has a fairly interesting story, but when you throw the original Highlander into the mix the stories collide and a number of contradictions appear.One such contradiction is that in the first Highlander, Ramirez seeks out Connor MacLeod and Connor has no idea who this guy is and from there their relationship grows.  In this film they've known each other ever since they first were exiled to whatever time they were exiled to (I can't remember when exactly, again this is in reference to the Renegade Version, NOT The Quickening version).  So, you can see that there is a MAJOR contradiction there.  If you accept the Highlander 2 story then why doesn't Connor already know Ramirez in the first film?So this is what I propose.  When you watch the first film, pretend the sequel doesn't exist, it makes perfect sense on it's own, and there are no contradictions within itself.  And as you watch Highlander 2: The Quickening/Renegade just pretend that it has nothing to do with the original Highlander film.As far as acting goes, I thought all the actors did a fine job.  It wasn't Oscar worthy, but it was just fine.  The special effects were pretty good too, nothing to get really excited about, but they did their job.If you are a huge fan of \"Highlander\", then there is a good chance that you are going to dislike the sequel.  But, maybe if you view it as a movie of it's own, you may like it more.  Anyhow, I hope my explanation above made sense.  Thanks for reading and be sure to check out my reviews for the rest of the Highlander series.  Thanks,-Chris",

No doubt about it, not worth three points from ten \u2013 but only from the point of view of a fanatic \"Highlander\" fans like me.\"Highlander\"-fans aren't fools; deep inside they know that a sequel would make as much sense as \"Titanic part 2\". Immortals had slugged it out for 10,000 years, there could be only one and decapitation will \"Queen\" was blaring. And that should have been that.But deep inside the \"Highlander\" fan rooted for more. We hoped and less than ten years after the original, producer William Panzer fulfilled our hopes. They were all there Christopher Lambert as Connor MacLeod, director Russell Mulcahy, Sir Sean Connery as Ramirez even. We drooled and ran off to see the film without thinking twice.What could have gone wrong? Well, pretty much everything. We felt a bit queasy after some amateur Wagner-rendition greeted us instead of an epic \"Queen\" soundtrack. This came with a set that looked like it was scavenged from the garbage bin of \"Blade Runner\". A hackneyed, plot hole ridden background story that seemed to have been penned by imbecile (did I mention that I was 12 when I watched this?) and Sean Connery and Christopher Lambert who at all times looked like they didn't want to be involved with this.Where to start? MacLeods archenemy sending two bumbling idiots to kill the protagonist (and thereby rejuvenating him)? Ramirez' resurrection that seemed to have been a script-writers equivalent to pulling an itching haemorrhoid from his anus? The general premise? One could go on but the point being that this film would have been a complete train wreck if it weren't a \"Highlander\"-sequel.Of course we left the cinema cursing, having been duped and, disgruntled, bought the video a few weeks later. Than we went and bought the even worst \"Highlander 3\" \u0085 and \"Highlander 4\" and watched that miserable TV-show; each and very one of those zillion episodes where a pain to watch, week after week wondering why one had put on the TV in the first place. Knowing all the while: \"There can be only one\". I already dread having to another sequel or remake, which will come as certain as the day is followed by night.A \"Highlander\" fan couldn't help but give this film 10/10 but realistically no more than 2 points (and that's being optimistic).",

            "content": "I've heard so much about the wretchedness of this movie, and also because I'm a huge fan of the original, I really had to sit down and watch this apparently hilariously bad movie. So, I sat down, watched it, and found myself laughing my socks off the whole way through! This movie is just so bad on so many levels, and boggles the mind so many times, you really can't help but laugh. I mean, was this meant to be an action movie? Because the decisions made in the practically non-existent story and the almost impossible events that occur will leave you in stitches!So what's the muffin? In 1994 the Ozone layer is fading, and thus a mortal Connor MacLeod comes up with a shield that will block out the sun and thus save the planet, at the expense of the fact that it would cause ecological devastation and wipe out humanity in many other ways, but whatever. Anyway, apparently the Immortals from the last movie weren't just a select few for an unknown reason, no, no, they were aliens, banished from the Planet Zeist 5,000 years earlier to earth and granted immortality as punishment(?!) Hey, if that's punishment, sign me up for more!Anyway, because the evildoer who runs Zeist named General Katana (imaginative name if ever there was one) is apparently bored and he decides 5,000 years after MacLeod left the planet that he should now kill him, and thus teams up with the evil leader of the Planetary Shield to hunt down and destroy MacLeod.So, what specifically is wrong with this movie? Well, apart from the fact that it takes everything established in the previous movie and turns it on its head is a bad start. The number of gaping plot holes in this movie would be enough to sink Greenland, for example, how calling someone's name can make them magically appear from the dead? What on earth happened there?!But it get's worse, the acting is as hokey as you could possibly get, the special effects are laughably fake, the fight choreography isn't as good as the original, the villain, and for that matter any of the other characters, have nothing to make them interesting, and basically, if you happened to watch this movie first rather than the original movie, you wouldn't know who any of these characters are because there is little to no reference to the original. The idea of a sequel is to build on the previous movie with at least some reference to it so as to enhance the story, but this one appears to be made up as it goes!Overall, it's a jumbled mess, but incredibly funny to watch. I was just astounded the first time I saw this as to how wrong they could possibly make this film! I totally recommend you watch this film if you're in the mood for a laugh, especially if you've seen the previous film, because like myself you'll probably be giggling till your sides hurt!",

You can't be told how bad this film is, you have to see it\u0085 But be warned it's not bad in cute way, or like an Ed Wood film, it's bad like having a root canal without the novocaine way.Highlander 2 had appeared to come from good pedigree; the original team were in place including the director and the main cast Lambent and Connery. But when a film starts out with an alien world called the plant Zorg or Ziest you know you are in trouble.Now for sure there are worse films out there, but these are probably student films or what Roger Corman left on the cutting room floor. What takes Highlander 2 into uncharted realms of movie badness is the sheer scale of its drop in quality from the first. It's like having a favourite old sweet frail aunt when you were a child who would give you chocolates and toys, and then all of a sudden she ingests 5 tubs of steroids takes out a chainsaw and hacks all your family and friends to death. This is the kind of shock you get from watching highlander and then moving on to highlander 2. There are no words in any language that can describe just how bad this film is.You also have to wonder what awesome substances must have been past around the studio and cast that no one thought this film was a bad idea and that the best idea was to burn the negative on the spot.With regards spoilers there is no way to spoil this film however this film is the mother of spoilers for the first film. It exterminates the premise of highlander which was the mystery of the immortals. It's rare that a bad sequel can have such a negative impact on the quality of the first film, but highlander 2 does a good job of destroying the first film. Once you know who the immortals are you can never look at the first film in the same light, such is the sheer biblical badness of this film and it's so called plot.It will probably take another thousand years before anyone comes close to making another film as bad as this one. As has been stated many times, it's awesome in it's badness!!",

Well, this is the real deal. This is so terrible it makes the likes of Waterworld and Battlefield Earth look watchable. Without a doubt the worst movie I've ever watched at the cinema.*** Spoilers follow *** Right from the start the plot is painfully stupid and contradictory, and totally ruins the premise of the first movie. The flashbacks that were so interesting in the first are totally absent. You see the immortals are actually aliens from the planet Zeist who fail in a rebellion, and as punishment have their memories wiped, are exiled to planet Earth, and are made immortal unless they have their heads chopped off. At the start of the movie, Connor McCloud is very old having lost his immortality by becoming 'the one'. General Katana, the leader of planet Zeist (and now many others), decides to kill him anyway, and thus dispatches two idiotic chicken like creatures to Earth to kill him. When he kills them, their energy conveniently restores his youth, and thus the General then travels to Earth to kill him personally.One terrible scene then follows another until mercifully the film was over. So many unbelievable and moronic things happen I struggle to pick out even a few as examples. Hopefully my synopsis in the previous paragraph has given you some small insight into just how horrible this whole mess is.I've never seen the renegade version, but since the original is so staggeringly poor I really can't imagine how it can be made much better except to rewrite the plot and re-shoot the whole thing.I've seen some bad movies in my time but this is one of the very few truly deserving a rating of 1/10.

Sean Connery did a good job though once again and Christopher Lambert always achieves good acting, at least that's what I think.  Michael Ironside's acting as the role as the arch-enemy from Zeist, Katana, was also very nicely done.  I always think the Ironside plays an excellent bad guy.  The only reason why I watched this was because I had nothing better to do. Maybe the Director's Cut is better.  I'm not too sure.  E-mail me and tell me if you think I should see the Director's Cut or not.  Anyway, I give the original theatrical version two stars out of five.

            "content": "First of all, let me make clear that Highlander is one of my all time favourite movies.  It had a slightly naff ending, and didn't require a sequel, but given they were going to make a sequel it didn't mean that the sequel would necessarily suck.  But suck it did, and BIG TIME.Let me get a few things straight:1. It was bad for being set in a thoroughly depressing future2. It was bad seriously reducing time-flipping editing which was such an attraction on the first movie3. It was bad for resurrecting Sean Connery (mistake 1), and then killing him off again (why bother!)4. It was bad for not having Queen as a soundtrack - mind you they made the right decision to stay away!5. It was bad for callously dealing with Connors relationship with Brenda (not that the first film was brilliant here either)But these above reasons, and more, are not the reasons I hate this movie: which I do.  The reason is simple, and indeed a mistake made by a certain Mr Lucas:They tried to remove the mystery and explain it all as the most inexplicable alien punishment ever invented!Here was I enjoying Highlander, loved the mystery that every now again a mother might give birth to a son who was destined for immortality.  That was a beautiful premise, not unlike a mother might give birth to a child who was strong in the Force.But just like a Metachlorian(sp?) count, the mystery was blown away with several rocket launchers, illusions shattered with baseball bats, and dreams dried up with a hair dryer.Oh what a waste.  If you saw Highlander - and like it, and have not yet made the mistake of seeing Highlander II, and this article puts you off seeing it, then my job is WELL DONE.To those who like it, I only wonder whether you also liked Mr Lucas explaining away The Force as a predictable device that can be utilised with the correct injection of a few Metachlorians (sp?), assuming a Psychologist can persuade them to cooperate!

However, here we have a sequel that does the opposite - the sequel is so bad and does such a hatchet job on the original idea that it actually does damage to its predecessor!  No small feat, that!Highlander was a great film with an extremely tight screenplay.  The movie wraps itself up neatly and leaves almost no opening for a sequel, so when the filmmakers were charged with a follow-up, they had a difficult task. What they did was chew up the first movie, defecate it into a film can, and thread it through a projector.  What they got was Highlander II.The immortals are not mystical earthly creatures, they're SPACEMEN!  Connor McLeod looks 137 years old until some other spacemen visit him and then he's young and immortal again!  And forget about dying if your head gets chopped off, because Sean Connery materializes!  Never mind that he died in the 1300s in the first movie.I tend to view Highlander as a single film.

There are broad, hammy performances, jarring leaps, and inconsistencies by the carload. And has anyone got any idea how/why the Zeistians ever evolved their bizarre immortality code? If I ever make a list of the ten most jaw-droppingly stupid movies, this will definitely be there. BUT....I give it a three [and not a two or below] solely for the charm and humor of Sean Connery's performance as Ramirez. Unlike others who, having apparently decided to play their roles here for laughs, went totally overboard into eye-rolling panic or guffawing villainy --Connery plays every one of his scenes in this strange new century with delightful lightness and panache. Whether gracefully bowing out of a stage performance of HAMLET, paying off a snooty men's tailor with his pearl earring, experiencing his first airplane ride (a wonderful sequence!) or giving his life to save MacLeod  & girl from a Nameless Evil Machine, Connery is the definition of the gallant cavalier, and saves what otherwise would be an unsavable film. I salute him.Watch it for him if you think you can stand the rest of it....",

As with the first movie the origins of the immortals are not really explored; only to say that they were transported into another time on earth to fight for the prize.The Macleod DVD version has a crisp transfer from the original negative so it looks great. There are over a hundred updated effects and there are extra scenes which give the movie a better sense of structure. There are many set up shots which give the viewer a richer feel for the surroundings in which the action takes place.I agree that the whole series is a bit of a pig when continuity is considered but I have to congratulate the makers on trying to return the product to something near their original vision (and make some cash in the process).

It is listed as a comedy on the site but I think they have mistook it for a comedy because it is so bad it can be quite hilarious at times.

Usually I'll give sequels the benefit of the doubt, but not this one, I found it worthless within the first 5 minutes and the rest of the film was like watching the same scene being played over and over again with little to no set changes. Like some really bad theatre play.Basically, the film tries to put too much science into a story that shouldn't be based on science, as well as environmental messages, the intervention of aliens and other idiotic plot-holes and inconsistencies. For example, how in god's name is Ramirez brought back to life just by calling his name? How does the random teleporter from Zeist (original name much) to Earth work?

This happened at the end of the first movie, which pretty much brought an end to the story. Highlander II, well, where do I start? The same actors, same director, it couldn't possibly be terrible right? Wrong! This movie is without doubt the worst sequel ever made, and is high up on the list of \"Worst movie ever made\". In 2024, Connor is an old man, and remembers that he is an alien from the planet Zeist who was banished to Earth, along with Ramirez (Despite the fact that he was born in the Highlands of Scotland and Ramirez was Egyptian?!?) Some old enemy from his home planet, for reasons not made very clear, dispatches two Hyena/Porcupine buffoons with hover boards to kill Connor (who was an OAP a couple of years from death anyway), Connor, despite being extremely old, manages to defeat them both and is made young and immortal again (huh?!), then his old mentor Ramirez, again for reasons and methods that go unexplained, is resurrected (despite being decapitated in the first movie). So Connor wants to destroy this shield that is covering the world since the ozone was destroyed, and this General Katana guy (a laughable performance from Michael Ironside) has just decided he will come to Earth and get all rowdy. To cut a long story short, Ramirez inexplicably stops a head chopping propeller with bolts of lightning from his hands that play bagpipes, then disappears for good, Connor kills this general guy and shuts down the shield. The continuity in this movie is so shocking it beggars belief. Although the hardest thing in the movie for me to accept is Ramirez, having been resurrected in Scotland, then flies to America. Now exactly how does a 2500 year old Spanish Egyptian Alien who has been dead for 400 years manage to apply for and get a passport in 24 hours?! The acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, the editing is terrible and the plot is possibly the most nonsensical drivel ever committed to the screen.

I found the scene so ridiculous that I laughed all the way through it.(3) The room in which anyone trapped therein is cut to pieces by this huge ceiling-fan thing, which descends slowly, slowly, slowly toward our heroes. What corporation, what government, what military organization would build such rooms? I can't believe such rooms have EVER existed outside of the movies.(4) The fact that the characters have unannounced powers. In one scene, Sean Connery is able to lift the abovementioned ceiling-fan thing with his mind long enough to save his companions, even though the thing looks like it weighs tons. NOBODY has telekinesis in this film - until this moment. In another scene, Christopher Lambert merely stands in a high-energy beam, and not only does he not get vaporized instantly, but roof of the building in which he's standing, and the satellite receiving the beam, both dissolve in fireballs -- yet our hero walks away unscathed! Maybe I should look for Highlander 3 and see if either Lambert or Connery plays someone with X-ray vision or the power to fly like Superman.This film was completely loony.

Since I saw the film it has been my standard by which all other bad films are judged.  The phrase \" it wasn't as bad as Highlander II,\" is oft heard after viewing a bad film. If I could have given this film a zero (or less) I would have. Considering that I sort of rate things lorgarithmically (a 1 is ten times as bad as a 2) this film is the all time worst, it is the only film I have ever given a one.  And I have seen such losers as \"Crime Wave\" and \"BC Rock\".  The only explanation I have for not walking out on this film is that I was so stunned by how awful the film was that I was unable to move.  I do not understand why the actors involved (particularly Connery) would agree to do this film (contractual obligation, based on the success of the first film?).  I am forced to resort to threats of physical violence when friends who have not seen the film suggest it as a rental. If you get the idea that I think this film was bad, you just might have the right idea. This film might not have been so bad (might have gotten a 2 or 3) if it hadn't been for the first film, which was a classic sci-fi/fantasy film. \"The Sickening\", as HII should be called, utterly destroyed every idea that the first Highlander led you to believe.  I firmly believe that much of the second Highlander was pieced together with bits from first film that hit the cutting room floor.  There are approximately 20 seconds of good footage in this film (the prison morgue scene and the Shakespeare stage scene, for the curious).  I found myself clinging to those scenes in my memory, just to remain sane. In order to recover from this film, I had to go to counseling for several years.

The reference to the \"planet Zeist\" has been dropped - in this reworking of the story, it is now revealed that the immortals come from an advanced ancient civilization that existed on this planet in a time long forgotten, and which is capable of things like time-travel. Things have generally been cleaned up, and the ending is also slightly improved.Granted, some things still don't make a huge amount of sense, but what the heck. It's just a lot of fun to see.

Ages later \"The Quickening\" (Highlander 2) happened to be playing on TV while I was waiting for something or someone and watched about5-10 minutes of the first part of the movie (i.e. in the first 1/3 part of the movie, but not quite the beginning). I remember being quite confused and couldn't really follow what was happening, but I also remembered my brother saying that he had seen it and that it really wasn't any good.Fast forward a few decades, and after my wife had bought the director's cut of the first Highlander, she told me she had seen either the second or the third way back in the theaters... and while she said it wasn't really any good, she had fun. I remember I had done seraches about \"The Quickening\" and how director Russel Mulcahy managed to do a \"Renegade\" director's version of this first second.Alas, the other night my wife and I decided to watch \"The Quickening\" as we hadn't seen it available for streaming. And what an experience that was for both of us. If I had seen this film in theaters, I probably would have walked out long before the middle-part.

Although on a production perspective, the film isn't as horrible as one would have thought considering just how marred production itself was. Even if most of the cast accepted to play in this strictly for the money or exposure, the acting is, for the most part, not horrible. Even the always delightful Michael Ironside who is obviously hamming it up to a degree bordering on the ridiculous, is a joy to watch.There is a reason why all subsequent Highlander offerings chose to completely ignore the storyline of this film (if only the Disney Star Wars would have done the same thing after The Last Jedi...), as the irigin / backstory of where the \"Highlanders\" come from is both far-fetched, awkwardly handled, and should have been left for another type of film entirely. Instead of adding to the mythos of the film's legacy, it seems to be tacked on for no real reason, and actually doesn't really play any real part in the story or characters, save for explaning the return of Sean Connery's Ramirez, and the existance of Ironside's \"Katana\" as a lead bad guy.Personaly, I foudn that the film was trying too hard to be \"hip\" in the era in which it was released. Similarly to today's productions which feature very millenial sayings and expressions reguardless of which time-line said films are supposed to take place, \"The Quickening\" seems to try a little too hard to be very \"early 90s\", from the over-the-top high-pitched laughs of evil henchmen, to Ironside's very \"modern\" (for the time) dialogue, which goes completely against his character which is supposed to be from a far-distant past.I can only recommend this film to masochists who enjoy watching train-wrecks in action, and maybe to the absolute die-core Highlander completists, whom I can safely assume probably have done what subsequent Highlander films (and TV series) have done: ignore this mess of a film entirely.Rated 3 stars out of 10 due to decent production, Virginia Madsen who does her best with what is given to her in terms of shody (at best) script, Sean Connery's charismatic appeal (at least he doesn't entirely sleepwalk through his performance) and of course Michael Ironside, because his portrayal is perhaps what inspired so many over-the-top villains in other films.",

Whatever people might say about insurance companies, creative control being lost and actor's feuds and egos, it was doomed to failure.I'm specifically talking about \"The Quickening\" here as I've not seen any of the Special Edition/Director's Cuts of the film.What you soon realise is that the person directing the actors (and whoever wrote their lines) had no idea what they were doing. Katana spontaneously decides to come to Earth, kill MacLeod, destroy random things, spout random gibberish, decide that intergalactic warfare obviously isn't for him and choose to sit on a corporate board and all the while trolling around with a mechanical sword which conveniently warns our hero about an incoming sword strike with an unconvincing thunk. And he gurns and cackles throughout in the style of a pantomime witch. 'Immortals come from the planet Zeist' is a horrible concept, whoever thought of it. The trick with a sequel is to answer some questions but pose a few more. Keep the audience guessing, don't mess around with the story universe. Don't kill the mystery and please, for the love of God, DON'T BRING BACK CHARACTERS THAT YOU KILLED OFF QUITE CLEARLY IN THE FIRST INSTALLMENT (unless they're played by Alec Guinness).Sean Connery grins from ear to ear throughout this film. Remuneration aside, I can't understand it, because his contribution is as awful as any performance by any actor in any film, ever. The audience burst into laughter when he offered his earring as payment for a suit. We were, admittedly, watching it at Bad Film Club in Chapter, Cardiff, so that probably helped. But it's awful. And why would an actor playing Hamlet carry a REAL sword on stage?'The Brow' (aka Lambert) does exactly in this movie what he did in the first but his 'old man' acting is atrocious and considering he spends most of his time napping, he manages to conjure up an impressive amount of energy and nimbleness to kill of the two spikey-haired morons Katana sends to kill him. This is what happens when you have too much money and too little talent.Nonsense, awful, nonsense.",

Christopher Lambert, a woefully bad actor (forgive me for stating what's known), must have been directed to play the elderly Connor MacLeod as a throat cancer victim, because he wheezes his lines like a dying, laryngectomized parakeet whose electronic voice box is a broken accordion embalmed in chalk dust.  Mercifully (and because the movie would be uncommercial otherwise), MacLeod's immortality is restored and he therefore becomes youthful again a quarter of the way into the movie (or a fifth of the way, if you're a bad boy and are watching the longer \"Renegade Cut\") and Lambert resumes being grating in lieu of outright appalling.Michael Ironside is an actor of whom not much is required for him to look villainous, and while his performance here is about 3,000 meters over the top, it's strangely vacant, failing to negotiate a tonal balance between the epitome of evil and a particularly unruly asylum inmate.  Sean Connery delivers his every line of dialogue as though it's a dashing one-liner or OO7-style catchphrase, and of all the screenwriters' juvenile affectations here, this is the most embarrassing.The success of the \"Highlander\" saga (or shall I say franchise?) is informative.  It reveals, I think, that a cult will develop behind any series of films to which a specific mythology is attached (e.g., \"Hellraiser,\" \"Nightmare on Elm Street,\" \"Lord of the Rings\").  \"Highlander II\" takes on some ecological concerns, too, expanding the series' scope to the near future, its characters and story spanning thousands of years both past and future and the tyranny of enemies both mortal and immortal.  Never mind that these films are flat, silly, infantile, wooden, its characters forgettable and its action scenes routine; they have far bigger things in mind.",

It's not completely a bad explanation, but the rest of the movie is a massacre.Point 1: the movie starts showing us that the sun has destroyed earths atmosphere so now it's hot as hell, so McLeod and a group of scientists create a fake atmosphere or something, and it's some nasty green stuff and people don't like it.

OK so they get sent to earth, and as you remember on The Highlander(ya, that movie that's actually good) Connor McCloud doesn't know that he's an immortal, until he gets stabbed or whatever, then he's cast out as a demon, but Sean Connery shows up and he seems to know a hell of a whole lot, like he's been around for a long time.

The environmental-issues inte this movie doesn't either fit it...a desperate attempt of the producers to make something intresting. Christopher Lambert is still good in his role so i guess the movie is worth seeing at least one...but no more. The ending is okey I guess and the sceens where McCloud and his friend is shot to hell with machine-guns. It makes me think how they really survive everything cause the flesh would have been heavily destroyed. But there is no point in trying to be a realist...just watch the movies and enjoy the saga..but avoid this one !!!! Watch III and IV and the first of course",

The sound effects in this one is like a couple of steel buckets banging together.\nHarking back to the original, it was shrouded in enigma. No idea where the immortals came from, no idea how the Kurgan knew where to find the Highlander and so on. It worked a treat and the fact that some half-witted scriptwriter/director/producer thought it would be a good idea to retro-splain it to us dumb movie fans in a sequel is bewildering.\nJust watch and you see that the cast are going through the motions and why wouldn't they. Michael Ironside is usually great at playing menacing tough guys, but here comes across as a psychotic clown more akin to a dodgy side character in some Horror Channel pulp.\nJust so bad, maybe the worst film ever on this kind of budget, probably the worst sequel ever made.

Production was a disaster, the movie went over budget, there were conflicts with backers, and eventually Mulcahy and the others had the movie taken away, completed and edited without their involvement. As a result, a weak movie became truly unbearable.The movie is just bad. I've sat through Troll 2, Plan 9, Boggy Creek, and a number of so-bad-they're-good films. This is not one of those. It's inconsistent, full of plot holes, switches from serious to cartoonish randomly, the acting is bad (although Virginia Madsen went on to win an Oscar, McGinley, Madsen, Ironside, and Connery are more than competent actors). The film takes away everything great about the original, and that is the worst thing a sequel can do: retroactively make the original worse.The movie has its moments, but they are rare. Any time Sean Connery was on screen makes it feel like a different movie, but his screen time is minimal. Very.Because of the badness, the movie has been remade twice. A recut called Renegade Version replaced the alien plot line to a time travel one, among other changes, but the movie couldn't be saved. A special edition cut was made that updated the effects (which are the least bad thing in this movie).And despite having 3 following movies, none of them even acknowledge this movie. It was removed from Highlander's timeline entirely (as was The Final Dimension). You are not missing anything by skipping this movie.",

In H2, everything changes and Conner and ramirez show up somewhere out of space and must return to earth to save the planet.

In Highlander 2, we are told that Brenda Wyatt from the original died in 1995 (it says it on a Tombstone). In the third film, the detective Stenn says that she died in a car crash years before, and that was set in 1994! Ok wait, there's more. What was the whole thing about being from another planet? That theme, thankfully, was not repeated in Highlander 3 or 4. Not to mention the lack of an Ice Age caused by the shield being over the earth. And because Connor won the prize he should live a life of misery while growing old? Wow, what a prize! And after he gets his little \"fountain of youth\" and turns back into young Connor, why do he and the girl kiss? They don't even know each other at all. Cheap with a capital \"C.\" I think that they should call the following sequels 2 and 3, just so that they can completely at least attempt to erase whatever memory anyone may have of this motion picture travesty. Whoever thought of this screenplay must in some way be related to the writer from \"The Fast and the Furious.\" Just very amateurish and teenage-like.

            "content": "I'm sorry, but I must submit a complaint to IMDb's top executive management staff. As I write this review I immediately noticed that the Vote menu, only let's you to pick voting from 1 till 10 out of 10 stars. I'm quite sure the reason behind this is that all IMDb developers and managers thought every single movie ever made would fit their rating within that interval from 1 to 10. Well, starting today I formally request that an option for users to pick \"0\" must be coded into the website, because the first movie to earn that rating has finally been done, and it's called Highlander 2: yes my friends, this movie deserves ZERO out of 10 stars.ZERO OUT OF 10 STARS! That's 0 out of 10! (yes, no stars... NO STARS AT ALL).Now why does this movie receive the lowest rating of all time any movie has received on IMDb? The simple answer is that there is a reason that made it lose the remote possibility of getting a 1 out of 10. You want to know which is? Disrespect Richard Wagner and RossiniHow dare these guys to begin a movie SO BAD, with a Wagner Opera? Richard Wagner (or Rossini) could have single handedly:1 written a better script 2 act as main character 3 act as supporting character 4 act as female character 5 direct 6 produce 7 do special effects10000x times better than ANY of the people involved that worked in this movie. Instead, we got Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery and a bunch of people who apparently were drunk, stoned or simply failed the 3rd grade at least 4 times in care of making this disaster. I have NEVER seen a movie that gets bad BY THE SECOND. Yes, that is BY THE SECOND. Each second that passes by this movie gets worse and worse. It never tries to redeem itself, it just keeps getting WORSE with every scene, every spoken word, every single moment. Just when you think the movie hit rock bottom, something amazing happens that digs a new lower standard. This movie tanks so bad, it could be used to dig a tunnel through the Earth's core to reach China.Speaking of Earth, I would like to know WHO on Earth thought:1 this movie was going to be a worthy sequel 2 this movie was going to be a classic 3 this movie was going to gross huge at the box office 4 this movie was going to win an award (any award) 5 this movie was going to establish the careers of Lambert and Connery 6 and last but not least, this movie was WORTH MAKING ?Any Shannon Tweed movie would swipe the Academy Awards winning 15 Oscars if it had to compete against Highlander 2. For example: at the end of Act I, there's a scene in which a rejuvenated MacLeod \"skate-chases\" a minion sent by the villain (a guy called Katana), who's flying in a sort of \"Bobba Fett\" turbine- mechanism. The scene is a perfect parody of Marty McFly's Back to the Future's 1 and 2 scenes in which he skates away from Biff Tanner cause they fly on and on and on, only that it's so boring it feels like your watching someone play Microsoft's Flight Simulator. Right immediately after MacLeod disposes of the minion, Sean Connery's Ramirez pops up right in the middle of a Hamlet play and is almost ran over by a dump-truck. I kid you not! It's one of the most puzzling... wait, what am I saying, it THE MOST PUZZLING switch scene I had scene in history! But wait, remember what I wrote earlier about this movie getting bad BY THE SECOND? Well, the immediate NEXT scene is even MORE PUZZLING! I won't spoil it because I urge you to watch it with your own eyes: you seriously won't believe it.The first time MacLeod becomes an immortal, everything around him randomly explodes: cars, restaurants, warehouses, empty buildings that are completely abandoned, you name it. This city must have the worse gas pipe system ever built! Then you have the subway scene: don't get me started on that one. This scene defies every single scientific law, physics, logic, common sense... you name it. While doing it, it sets a world record in which in less than two minutes, it manages to make the worst possible references to insult The Terminator, The Wizard of Oz and Alien. What happens is that an alien (who has never been to Earth before, let alone the US) abruptly crash-lands into a moving subway and while getting up and recovering from the time travel experience, he says to a nearby passenger: -\"Where the hell am I? This sure doesn't look like KANSAS does it?\"Did these people hate Julie Andrews, James Cameron and/or Ridley Scott? A few seconds later you will witness the complete ignorance of the people who worked in this film, as it totally disregards and makes no difference between the physical concepts of VELOCITY and ACCELERATION. Throw in a giant wind-machine built inside the subway and the result is a colossal, monumental, abysmal pile of garbage.Whoever worked in this movie deserves to go to jail and be sentenced to pay perpetual reimbursing tickets and fees (with interests) to those people who bought tickets or rented this film. There is nothing anyone can say to justify their relation with this piece of junk. Seriously, what a great way to disrespect Wagner and Rossini, and even Isaac Newton! The only way to make up for this, is to allow IMDb to let users vote a score of ZERO OUT OF 10 STARS ON THIS MOVIE.FINAL RATING: 0 OUT OF 10.",

I found out, it's by making up a bunch of complete drivel that makes no sense, and adding a bunch of stupid characters who apparently don't have the slightest hint of logic to them.  Like the main bad guy, who, realizing that McLeod is about to die of old age, decides he can't wait two weeks and sends some guys to kill him.  This, of course, makes him immortal(again).  And, somehow, brings Sean Connery back, who looks remarkably good for a guy who's been dead for 500 years.  I'm still not sure why they apparently have gotten rid of jet engines, but apparently they have, because there they are, flying across the Atlantic in a small turboprop.

The best experience for the first film, arguably the DVD release changes that although it is of fairly bad quality and the \"stills\" section is messed up (due to poor authoring, as it appears to be merely converted over to from the LD version without any tweaking, so it flies by, thus requiring a person to use the \"frame by frame\" feature while paused).Highlander 2 is no exception to the theatre=bad video=good rule. While the original idea of the first movie was carried over in this sequel \"The Quickening\" with a new idea by the original creators of Highlander (and they have the right to create their own stories of characters they invented, IMHO) that the Immortals (with fans begging to know of their \"true\" origins) that the Immies are all outcasts and refugees from another time and another place, ie: they are aliens from the planet Zeist.Zeist is a planet apparently somewhat like earth, with a mix of futuristic and ancient technology (ie: machine guns, laser pistols alongside broadswords and battle armor), that is undergoing a power struggle between the Priestly rulers and the warlord General Katana. There is a rebel force trying to overthrow Katana's position, lead by Ramirez and Macleod. All of this supposedly takes place \"500 years ago\" (which is irrelevant time distinction since it takes place in another galaxy). Ramirez and Macleod are \"sent back\" as punishment for their crimes, and when they appear on earth (reborn in different time periods in earth's history) they become immortal. This explains their quest \"that there can be only one.\" I think this idea was nice, had it been developed further, and I would have loved to see stories about how the other immortals got sent back (like Kurgan for example, the villian from the original film).However, to make a long story short, most fans of the HL mythos apparently hated this 1990 film and demanded that the \"original story be followed\" (ie: the creators pretend that nobody knew the history of the Immortals and that they were simply \"born different\" than other humans). Although I think the creators of the HL story (the same guys who made the first movie) were justified in making what they called \"The Renegade Version\" (actually there are three versions of the film, the one on video ends immediately after the shield is destroyed, another features an ending where Macleod and his new love interest leave for Zeist together in a celestial moment), as they had gone over budget and had their movie edited short by the insurance agents (or whomever).However, the whole point of muting or editing out various lines from the film that referred to Zeist, I see as unnecessary pandering to the fans. But, the creators were obviously wanting to salvage their rep with the fanbase and recoup their losses in video sales (the DVD is of excellent quality this time, although it still features the same stills flipping too fast problem the first disc had). So I guess they did what they had to. I would have liked to have seen more of the original story/scenes featured on the new DVD (Renegade) as deleted scenes or something, or even had a branching version. The DVD disc features a \"making of\" documentary which basically defends the creators and gives their explanation and their concession to make a \"revamped\" version.As a movie in and of itself, Renegade Highlander 2 is pretty good. While the action scenes tend to be less exciting (for me anyway) than the first film (mainly because there seems to be less actual sword fighting and more horsing around with other weapons and situations), is is watchable and enjoyable. To a non-highlander fan it can be just as interesting of a sci-fi/action film as well.IMHO, this film is the second only to the first film (at least the Renegade version on DVD). It is better than Highlander 3, which apparently tried in vain to imitate the first movie but with cheaper jokes and bigger budget effects (still, nothing beats the final scenes in the first film just after the final battle). The recent \"Endgame\" was a major disapointment and how it can be claimed that it was better than 2 is beyond me. I would attribute part of Endgame's appeal to the huge Series fan base that has grown since 1992 (when the TV series began, remarkably the opening of the first season included scenes from Highlander 2, just watch... looks familiar, no?).Not a bad film, I suggest fans and non-fans alike give a good honest viewing of the Renegade version and see if I'm wrong. If you want to see it in context of the first film, fine, I think either way, it gels quite nicely with the original continuity-wise (which is more than I can say for the other sequels and even the series).",

As a huge fan of the original Highlander film, I was excited when I heard a sequel was in the works.  A friend of mine that was an even bigger Highlander fan saw Highlander II the first night it came out.  I will never forget him coming back from the movie with a disgusted look on his face.  That night he gave me advice that years later I still regret not taking.  He told me never to see this film because if I did, it would destroy the memory of the first Highlander forever like it had just done for him.  Needless to say, I did not take his advice and saw the film the next day.  Why was I so stupid???  As foretold by my friend, Highlander II is so bad, it makes it impossible to fully enjoy the first film.  It is beyond my understanding why the makers of Highlander II would choose to completely ignore all the things that made Highlander great and, among other things, contradict the plot and storyline of Highlander at every possible point.  How uncool is it to find out that the immortals are aliens???? How ridiculous is it to have Sean Connery reappear 500 years after his death with no explanation???  How much did you want to track down the people responsible for this film and beat them senseless with a dead fish???? Forever more the word Zeist will be \"fightin words\" in my vocabulary.",

It was boring, confusing, and above all, totally contradictory to its predecessor, one of the greatest Fantasy/Adventure films made in the last few decades.  However, every cloud, no matter how dark and ominous, has a silver lining. This cloud's lining, for instance, is known as Highlander 2: The Renegade Version Director's Cut.  This version restores footage that had to be cut from the theatrical run, rounding out the story and actually making sense. It deletes the entire \"Zeist\" subplot, now grounding the Immortals on Earth(they now are still exiles, but from the distant, pre-ice age past). It explains why Brenda no longer seems to exist, why Katana has such a grudge with MacLeod, other important things that The Quickening failed to point out.So, in closing, stay away from Highlander 2: The Quickening. And run to the video store and pick up Highlander 2: The Renegade Version(preferably the Widescreen Edition).",

So you can easily understand the plot; he is a forgotten hero and he now lives with the good memories but suddenly he has the chance to save the mankind again..well so innovative! Probably at the beginning (after 10 minutes) there is no more connection with the Scottish medieval world and they begin to talk about another planet where all the immortals come from..so you think are we talking about Superman? Then suddenly you see some cyberpunks who have a Back to the Future style flying skateboards..so you realize that the producers ran out of ideas before even starting the filming of the movie. At the end we can admire a \"wonderful\" fight scene who you can easily link to Star Wars and at the end you realize that the whole film is a 90s B-Movie with a very sterile plot. But the worst thing of this movie is absolutely Highlander shooting with an automatic rifle when all the previous movie was about swords.The only positive feedback was probably Sean Connery portraying a funny Ramirez making him the only smart and not predictable character of the movie with a stunning performance by one of the best actors in the world of cinema.",

Once you realise this you wonder how did I end up watching the wrong movie.  Connor and Ramirez are now aliens (?!) and other immortals from the planet Zeist (?!) have come to kill MacLeod. Excuse me, whatever happened to the Prize?  You now, the one that made Connor one with all living things.  And, whatever happened to Brenda?  And, didn't Ramirez die in the first film? Fortunately, there is a director's cut that fixes most of these problems by re-editing the film and adding 19 extra minutes of footage.  This \"Renegade Version\" of the film isn't perfect (and can never hold a candle to the first film), but is a very good attempt to fix a horrible mistake. Finally, it should be noted that the blame for Highlander: The Quickening does not fall on the director or the producers of the film, but on the film studio that took it upon themselves to screw up the movie.",

Now that's some original thinking right there. They also tried to get around the fact that Ramirez (Connery) was dead. I still don't understand how they accomplished this.

Continuity was obviously nowhere in the minds of the movie's creators, because they've completely disregarded the premise laid out in the original Highlander.The original Highlander movie left us with a victorious Connor MacLeod enjoying The Prize as the last living immortal. This new movie picks up several decades later with an old and frail (???) MacLeod looking back on his life in regret. Society is in shambles. The planet is in rough shape, its Ozone layer completely gone with only a planet-wide anti-radiation shield, built by MacLeod himself (???), standing in the way of our destruction.It's just another day for MacLeod...that is, until he's ambushed by some old friends who want to chop off his head! (You see, contrary to what the original movie said, all of the immortals are actually alien exiles from a planet called \"Zeist\". On Zeist, MacLeod and the other immortals who were exiled to Earth were part of some sort of rebellion or revolution (never explained). MacLeod and Ramirez were captured by the enemy and exiled to Earth. The last surviving immortal on Earth can either grow old and die or go back to Zeist (I guess that's what they prize was supposed to be, at least according to this movie).)Apparently, the bad guy, Katana, who exiled MacLeod to Earth in the first place, is upset that MacLeod is going to grow old and die rather than come back and give him a shot at some revenge, so he sends some henchmen to come after MacLeod. The story goes on from there. Aside from a side plot regarding a conspiracy surrounding the planetary anti-radiation shield, the movie is just the same old sword fighting decapitation fest, this time in a more futuristic setting and with worse acting, writing, plot structure, and lower production value than before.The only bright light that shone from this black hole of a movie was Sean Connery. Despite being in a horrible movie, he gave a great performance as always! Even so, it doesn't make up for how bad the rest of the movie was.

Even the little things that meant we had to have a suspension of disbelief ( Connery as a Spaniard with a Scottish accent who lived in Japan or a French sounding Scottish Highlander. C'mon. Seriously) were a good thing. So what happened to the second one? Aliens? Where did that come from? Ramirez is still alive? How does he get his head to stay on his shoulders? Staples? I thought the prize was to help mankind. Didn't work did it? They should have left well enough alone, let alone made more. It all leaves one burning question: in the first movie the premise was \"there can be only One\". So where the hell where all these other ones hiding? Is there more than one prize?

Ok firstly the writers should be shot, it is the most half-arsed attempt I ever witnessed. There is little continuation from the 1st film eg. In the 1st film 'Macleod' (Lambert) has never met Connery's character before yet in this film he's reminiscing about their days together on the Planet Zeist. Those stupid flying things which attack Macleod are the worst villains ever, clowns would have been scarier. I watched this recently and laughed all the way through, the ending I cant even remember cos I was trying to write a worse film. So in conclusion it's the most implausible sequel you will ever bear witness to. The tagline to this movie should've been 'There should be only one'",

They completely destroy the wonderful story that was told in Highlander, with some nonsense about being aliens from another planet. Although I normally like Michael Ironsides, I hated his character in this movie.  He tried too hard to be like Kurgan from the first movie.  The whole \"save-the-earth\" subplot was nauseating, and none of the characters were very interesting.  Sean Connery should have not even bothered with this role.  And the special-effects just weren't that special.  There was nothing good about this movie, really.  I wonder what the Europeans were thinking? The only thing that possibly could have made this movie redeemable would have been an earlier release.

The original directors and producers have now gone back and re cut the movie and inserted 19 minutes of extra footage and they have even gone as far as to reshoot a couple of scenes. The result is a much better film to watch which is set in a world which could exists within the Highlander Universe. No more out of planet experiences for us then!! Filmed in Argentina this film gave us some of the largest sets seen in recent times and also some of the largest explosion sequences. In hindsight you realise how good this film actually looked and it really isn't as bad as you remember it. I think IMDB should give it its own title Highlander II: Renegade as the film is totally different to Highlander II: The Quickening and whilst The Quickening may only get a derisory 3.3 on the IMDB scores I'm sure that Renegade would get much nearer to 6.5.",

This video contained a lot of footage from a new movie called 'Highlander' which had done a short spell in the theatre but was now over. I had to wait till the movie came out on video. I did and as soon as it was available I went out and rented it immediately. A love affair began. I watched the movie 5-6 times that weekend. It was fascinating. I thought back to my Scottish roots and imagined my ancestors battling it out with other clans on the highlands of Scotland. But it was more than just that. This was a great movie with great acting, great plot and great actors. I bought the video when it came out. Five years went by and while listening to the radio at work, I heard some reporter talking about Highlander II. 'No, it can't be! Yes, it is!! Excellent' A sequel to my all-time favourite movie was about to hit the theaters. And I was there, almost first in the queue waiting to get in on the opening night. Little did I know that less than 2 hours later I would be walking out those same doors with an angry expression and wondering why people cannot leave well-enough alone. The film still had the line-up of Connery and Lambert and both of them acted well and added their wit and charisma to an otherwise dull and predictable movie. The idea of releasing a movie on the success of its predecessor without putting any thought into the plot, is greedy and an insult to its fans. This film was the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced in the business although it's not the worst film I've seen, but it's far from being the best. As one comment made earlier said 'This film is as bad as the first one is great' sums it up perfectly.",

Bad idea!! it is just bad all around, acting, plot, storyline, direction, everything! it seems to totally contradict the first movie too, which is a big no-no for sequels. how can highlander come from some other planet if he was supposed to have been born in Scotland? weird. oh, but it does have \"that-guy\" from scrubs, the really cynical doctor, also in platoon, among other movies. yeah, the ozone thing is weird too. you would think they would all be dead, because of no sun. i think they decided they wanted to have a sequel, but couldn't think of anything, so they went with the most absurd idea possible in hopes of getting people to watch the third movie simply to forget this one ever even exists.",

It has been years since I have seen it and yet, that atrocity still lingers in my thoughts, its awfulness is embedded in my mind. I cannot stress it enough.It sucks, even if you are a die hard fan you will be insanely disappointed, no revolted! DO NOT see this movie!...What was Connery and Lambert thinking. This movie simply steals moments from your life, moments you will never get back. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY ONE!!",

            "content": "Semi-SpoilersThere are a lot of cinematic franchises and they all have a `mythology.' Back and side stories that give a film(s) a deep rich texture.  In some cases, like Star Wars, the filmmakers are extremely detailed and every single frame is scrutinized, and will even include elements (both visually and story wise) that only most deranged Nerds will notice.  Highland is rare bird.  It is the only film series that I can think of that take a great deal of pride in its mythology yet doesn't seem to care a bit about continuity. Stars Wars, Back to the Future, Lord of the Rings, and Aliens, were very very careful in this area, but not Highlander.  Each entry into the Highlander series fails to fit with the others.Highland 2: The Quickening (considered by most to be the series lowest point), we are give 2 story lines that have nothing to do with one another. Story line number one is about an energy shield that was built (by the Highlander himself, Connor Macleod) to replace the severely damage ozone layer, and story line two deals with the `prize' and the immortals home planet.  The movie plays out just the way you think it does, so I won't waste any more time on the story line.What creates the continuity problems for this series is that the original is not open ended.  Connor won the `prize' at the `Gathering.'  `The Gathering' was the final battle, Connor was the last one, and he achieved the `prize.' We were not left to assume that these three things occurred, they were stated.  They Occurred.  End of Story.If you want to have an idea on how bad this film is?  The Highlander creators no longer consider this film as part of the series.",

            "content": "In the VCR age, I expect a lot of us have developed the habit of \"around to it\" lists. If a friend mentions a film, or it's a sequel or for whatever reason, we add it to the list. Usually, in our tidy fashion, we get around to watching it. The original Highlander movie was a bit overdone, had something of a weak ending, and being a sword-fantasy, was of course wildly implausible. But on the whole, it was well acted, nicely paced, internally consistent, and had the almost always saving grace of featuring Sean Connery.I write this comment for the sake of anyone out there who has put Highlander II on their list. ATTENTION- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!(or your dollar). I put it on my list because I knew Sir Sean (He deserves the as yet unbestowed title) would be in it, and was curious how the writers would manage this, his character being rendered quite dead in the original. I will respect the policy of IMDB, and not give it away. But I must say it was disappointing and not worth a hill of beans as literary invention. YOU could have thought of something just as good, and I know I could have thought of something better. As for the rest, if you can't wait to spend your time and money on less-than-one dimensional characters, plot cliches so worn out the Goodwill wouldn't take them, villains who cackle and sneer without the saving grace of being the least bit funny, and a best scene that consists of a guy buying a suit of clothes, then this just might be for you.",

Let's put it this way; you ALMOST can't see the strings on some of the effects.Also, I'll admit that I thought Christopher Lambert was kind of cute in the first movie. But from a girl's perspective, Christopher Lambert done up as an old man through most of Highlander 2 is not something I find too appealing.I know the first movie was a fantasy also, and not super believable if you look at it in the \"real life\" point of view. But somehow it was interesting enough to make you want to be absorbed in the story told by the movie.\nHighlander 2's story is not only a SSSSTTTTRRRREEEETTTTCCCCHHHH, it also jumps around too much to make any sense.I must say, as a fan of the original Highlander, I was quite disappointed by Highlander 2.The only reasons I would suggest it to anyone are: if they are either morbidly interested to see how it compares to the original; or they gleefully revel in watching ultra-cheesy movies.",
