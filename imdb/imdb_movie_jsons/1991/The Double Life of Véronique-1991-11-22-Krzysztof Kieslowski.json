            "content": "The Double Life of Veronique (1991)Director Krzysztof Kieslowski is one of the undisputed poets of Cold War and post-Cold War cinema. The movies in his Polish/French trilogy, Blue, White, and Red, are finely tuned, sensitive, imaginative dramas that use mystery, music, psychology and visual fluidity to immerse you in another world that is beguiling and fascinating.That's exactly what goes on here. It's a stunning movie-making \"achievement\" in how it pulls off this unique blend of amorphous elements, leading you into the ambiguity of the director's invented world. And into the world (or worlds) of the lead characters, both played by Irene Jacob, a classic kind of restrained French (French-Swiss) actress with a limited range, but within that range she has penetrating beauty and a moving, melancholic aura for the camera, which lingers on her face through much of the movie. Her roles as the two women who are classic doppelgangers--they look alike, have similar talents (singing), and both have heart problems. And they overlap in reality for just a few seconds, with only one seeing the other until later, when the other finds she took a picture of the first.This is an unashamedly lofty film. It has high art written all over it, but not in the experimental or cutting edge way of independent filmmakers of this time. Rather, it pushes European mainstream film to its most refined limits, not giving up a narrative logic, not giving up musical scoring and photographic pyrotechnics, and not giving up a cast of beautiful people doing beautiful things. In fact, the star, first shown as a child, is looking at the stars in pure wonder, and the beauty of the world is sustaining and truly marvelous for her--and this I think is the life view of the director. That the world is amazing, filled with odd and beautiful coincidences, and is mostly there to be lived and enjoyed regardless.To some extent, he is both characters, both Veroniques. The allegories of 1980s Europe, splintering under Communism's last few years, have been written about a lot (the Polish Weronika gives herself to her music and dies for it, trapped somehow, the French Veronique is free to reject her talent, travel, and yet, ultimately, end up a puppet to her personal weakness). But the fact is, Kieslowski was both the successful Polish director who died young (though he didn't expect that I'm sure) for his art, and the successful expatriate living a life filled with art and pleasure. He embodied the modern Europe, filled with the heady optimism that led to the love of a new Europe without borders, infinite in its possibilities.It's worth noting that Communism has just fallen when this movie was made. There is a brief scene (the bus scene with the soldiers) that inserts this with, as usual, elegance. (Note here that he again makes the individual's inner needs more important than the greater politics.) The French Veronique is free to be hedonistic, the Polish version cannot quite do that, though you feel her struggle with what to do with her life as a singer.All of this is obviously impressive. For its intentions and its inner coherence, the movie is terrific. But it's also starting to feel self-important, a little overblown in both its allegories and even in the basic doppelganger hook that holds it together. It's also a slow movie. If you don't completely drown, happily, in the aesthetics of the film (which would be easy to do), you might find there are little moments made too important, too detailed, too unaware that the audience is getting ahead of the movie and is restless. For me this was in some of the musical segments, in the marionette scenes, and even in the very last moments, which should have blown me out of the water.Final word. I think it would help to see this film before the Three Colors trilogy, because they are better movies, especially \"Blue\" and \"Red.\" I have seen \"Red\" several times, and it also stars Jacob, and I love it completely still. This predecessor is thinner in comparison, but only in comparison to this remarkable director's startling successes immediately after.",

            "content": "I save films. By that I mean that some films I expect to be so precious that I want to save them for some future drought, or blue period where I need spiritual insulin. Or it may be that a valued filmmaker has died and I know there is only so much to see new and I want to pace it through my life.Kieslowski is something of a demigod in my film world. It isn't that he has mattered so much in the sense of affecting me. Its because he can push geography with the slightest touch, infer emotional richness with the most subtle of motions, show us beauty headon \u0097 headon without artifice. His the most delicate power I know in cinema. His \"Decalogue\" is complex, open, engineered to be contradictory in ways that seem natural. But they are not where the real juice is. Its merely where he worked out the way to weave vision and narrative conflict with his companion and creative partner.It's \"Three Colors\" where it pays off. These are miraculous and I wish them on any open soul. They will tear you gently in ways you will not notice for years, and then know all of a sudden when you meet someone.In between \"Decalogue and \"Colors,\" we have this, essentially an adventure in moving from Polish to French vocabulary, both emotional and chromatic. Here we see some of the strokes we will encounter later, in one colored film even with the remarkable Irene. But he seems unsure here. Things aren't integrated between cinema and narrative as they were before and would be afterward. The eye doesn't inform with curious discovery, instead seems to glance around and hover. I suppose it is because the story isn't well developed in the way that others are. The deal with Kieslowski I think (beyond the beauty) is that he is able to infer future urges that probably will loop back into places and persons we see. (He closes a very few of these ordinary loops in the third colors film). But he never closes them, not the ones that matter. So we are left with our own emotions going ahead and anticipating results that matter to us, things started and not finished, breath sent out for us to catch and breath.This film is based on Alice in through the Lookingglass, with a number of less-than-deft fixtures to the source. He tries to build grand arcs of anticipated futures around this symmetry but they aren't fragile and supported by our wishes as we have elsewhere. I think it was simply a time of adjustment for him, and I cannot recommend this, even though I saved it for decades. I will suggest that if you do watch it, see the same story, the same emotional effects, the same tantalizing near-closure in \"Sex and Lucia\" by someone less gifted with the eye, but more gifted with the mysteries of women. Watch out for the delicate tearing.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",

            "review_title": "Beautiful, but somewhat unaffecting",
            "content": "Much of this is an adoration of French actress Ir\u00e9ne Jacob by Director Krzysztof Kieslowski; in a sense it is a homage to her, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and one of the most talented. If you've never seen her, this is an excellent place to begin. She has an earnest, open quality about her that is innocent and sophisticated at the same time so that everything a man might want in a young woman is realized in her. Part of her power comes from Kieslowski himself who has taught her how she should act to captivate. He has made her like a little girl fully grown, yet uncorrupted, natural, generous, kind, without pretension, unaffected. She is a dream, and she plays the dream so well.The movie itself is very pretty, but somewhat unaffecting with only the slightest touch of blue (when the puppeteer appears by the curtain, the curtain is blue, and we know he is the one, since she is always red). The music by Zbignew Preisner is beautiful and lifts our spirits, highlighted by the soprano voice of Elzbieta Towarnicka. But the main point is Ir\u00e9ne Jacob, whom the camera seldom leaves. We see her from every angle, in various stages of dress and undress, and she is beautiful from head to toe. And we see her as she is filled with the joy of herself and her talent, with the wonder of discovery and the wonder of life, with desire, and with love.Obviously this is not a movie for the action/adventure crowd. Everything is subtle and refined with only a gross touch or two (and no gore, thank you) to remind us of the world out there. V\u00e9ronique accepts the little crudities of life with a generous spirit, the flasher, the two a.m. call, her prospective lover blowing his nose in front of her... She loves her father and old people. She is a teacher of children. She climaxes easily and fully. To some no doubt she is a little too good to be true. And she is, and that is Kieslowski's point: she is a dream. And such a beautiful dream.An actress playing the character twice in a slightly different way has occurred in at least two other films in the nineties: there was Patricia Arquette in David Lynch's Lost Highway (1997) and Gwyneth Paltrow in Sliding Doors (1998). It's an appealing venture for an actress of course and when the actress is as talented as these three are, for the audience as well.Note that as Weronika/V\u00e9ronique is in two worlds, Poland and France, so too has always been Kieslowski himself in his real life. It is interesting how he fuses himself with his star. This film is his way of making love to her.Kieslowski died in 1996 not long after finishing his celebrated trilogy, Trois Couleurs: Bleu (1993); Rouge (1994) and Bialy (White) (1994). We could use another like him.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "St. Veronica, often called the patron saint of photographers, was, according to legend, one of the women who followed Christ to his crucifixion. At one point she handed the weary savior a cloth to wipe his face on. He did so, and when he handed it back to her, there was imprinted an image of his face on the cloth. The name Veronica, indeed, is a corruption of the Latin \"vero icon\" - the true image (yes, a contradiction in terms, I know). When Kieslowski's Veronika is unknowingly walking to her death, that is, to the audition that will lead to it, the French Veronique unknowingly photographs her from the bus in the Krakow square, while frantically trying to get snapshots from the ongoing riot.Veronika, of course, ends up straining herself too hard singing, and because of her heart condition, snuffs it while singing those beautiful lines from Dante's Paradisio, about the ascent to heaven. Veronique, in turn, for some reason realizes that she has to give up her own singing career, and, seemingly without a single moment of regret, instead dedicates herself to teaching the music of Van den Budenmaier to untalented, bratty schoolchildren. There is little doubt, after watching the movie, that the Polish Veronika did indeed, somehow, die so that the French Veronique might live.The opening sequence of the movie also contains the outline of Christ's life. Veronika is shown \"the star that will start Chrismas Eve\" (oh, the horrifically nonsensical astronomy we teach our children... but I digress. ;-) ), and immediately afterwords we are taken to France, where the child Veronique is being told about the leaves of spring. Christmas is the birth of Christ, while spring is the time of Easter, and his suffering and death.So, is this, indeed, Kieslowski's very radical, and breathtakingly beautiful, take on the story of the suffering of Christ? Discuss, class. ;-)",

            "content": "The above statement works not only as an honest description of the film, but also of the character (or characters) portrayed by Ir\u00e8ne Jacob. The Double life of V\u00e9ronique is not a film that allows easy description, it doesn't seem to fit in to any genre or category, it is a film that must be experienced under it's own terms, as a serious, hypnotic work of art. Director Kieslowski sets up the odd dreamlike atmosphere right from the start, using mirror reflections and odd camera distortions to show us the bizarre way that Veronique/Veronika sees the world around her. The use of sepia printing also gives the film an odd distilled look, taking us right out of any \"real\" reality, giving each of the frames something special. The problem this creates is that it takes away any real connection we have with the characters, we never really feel anything for them or are even that concerned for their outcomes, Kieslowski moves his actors around his \"stage\" in the same way the marionettes are manipulated in the film, but the film works on such a subtly hypnotic level I don't think that Kieslowski ever wanted us to feel part of this world. Kieslowski follows Veronique/Veronika through Paris and Poland, intimately probing her with close, hand-held camera, the cinema-verite effect of this making the viewer feel almost like a voyeur, following the women's every movements and encounters. The Double Life of Veronique is a film that definitely deserves to be seen and requires multiple viewings if we are to get everything out of it's complex, pre-destined narrative. A film full of beautiful images and haunting moods that you'll remember long after, if only there had been a little more focus on the characters I would certainly give it a 10. Maybe my next viewing will lift its marks. 8/10",

            "review_title": "The Movie & the Music",
            "content": "Only a few of the previous comments on this movie has mentioned the use of music. Just like in Trois Couleurs Bleu, the music of La Double vie de V\u00e9ronique is very indivisible from the film: the visual and the auditive form a united whole and also elements of it are directly part of the story. And when it comes to music made for film, Zbigniew Preisner's powerful score for this one is as good as it gets.When there is little dialogue, it is not just the images and expressions on Ir\u00e8ne Jacob's face that tells the story, but also the powerful strains of music intermingled with it.Even with just these elements in place, it would be a movie worth seeing, though obviously a narrative based in little extent on dialogue and with less emphasis on a clear-cut story than your average American movie is unfortunately lost on some of the earlier commentators.And even this seemingly sparingly laid out narrative reveals itself to the careful watcher to be a rich tapestry of symbols, metaphors and hidden meanings. Ki\u00e9slowski, just as in his other movies, demands participation of the viewer, and the one who expects passive entertainment has found the wrong film to watch.Krzysztof never liked discussing meaning when it came to his movies, but liked keeping that up to the viewers, and few other directors have ever been able to lay out more food for thought and fruitful interpretation than him.I saw the Three Colours trilogy before seeing V\u00e9ronique, and the many similarities, both musical and in visual narrative, makes it feel like it almost belongs together with those three to form a quartet. In some ways it has more in common with Blue than Red and White do. Had Juliette Binoche also been cast in the role of V\u00e9ronique, as I understand that Krzysztof originally had intended, the similarities had been even greater. She was, however, occupied with shooting Les Amants du Pont-Neuf at the time I believe, and so Krzysztof opted for the less experienced Ir\u00e8ne. I don't think the film is any worse for it: she is brilliant, and not just a pretty face as some people put it, but a very intelligent and aware actress as anyone who has seen her interview for the Red DVD release should discover if they haven't already.In short: a wonderful film, wonderful music, great acting. But not a movie for everyone.",

            "content": "I watched this film a second time because I thought I might have missed something during my first viewing. It turned out I hadn't, but with the second viewing I had a better understanding of the two characters and who they were in relation to each other. Portrayed by Irene Jacob, both Weronika and Veronique share some sort of psychic link which is broken when Weronika collapses and dies during a musical performance. Weronika's death and burial so soon into the picture is somewhat jarring, as it leaves one feeling that an integral character in the story had no opportunity to impact the outcome. That feeling of confusion moves along in the story as Veronique struggles to learn the identity of a secret benefactor who makes unidentified phone calls and sends her packages with odd enclosures. How can one best describe the film? It's erotic and seductive to be sure, as well as sensitive, dreamy, romantic, ethereal and mesmerizing. At the same time it can be mysterious and incomprehensible. Director Krzysztof Kieslowski allows the viewer to individually interpret his movies and this one struck me as a dreamscape, almost as if the characters of Weronika and Veronique weren't real in the first place. The effect is so disorienting that it will take some time for me to discover whether I liked it or not. I lean toward the former, though with a sense of apprehension, as seeing it again at another time might prove to move me in a different direction.",

Bur director Krzysztof Kieslowski doesn't provide much else besides an affirmative answer, and the concept itself is limited because the two Veroniques are never allowed to meet (if they did the whole thing would be just another Twilight Zone episode, with subtitles). It's certainly a beautiful movie, with quite a few magical moments balanced against an unforgivably vague narrative concerned mostly with the French Veronique's pursuit of an enigmatic puppeteer. Along the way are some intriguing, teasing suggestions of several more-then-coincidental similarities between the two women, but the effect is not unlike watching a film where every third scene is missing, and because the burden of meaning is placed entirely on the viewer it will likely infuriate anyone expecting a more coherent story.",

            "content": "Watching this exquisite film for the first time 15 years after it was released would be a very different experience from watching it back in 1991, had I got the opportunity. That this \"first time\" viewing actually comprises two viewings which are, though not back-to-back, only 3 days apart means yet a different experience. Finally, having gleaned a considerable amount of material before going into the cinema has perhaps changed significantly my perception from what it would have been had I first watched in back in 1991. Had I watched it back in 1991, without any foreknowledge of what the film is about, I would probably have made an immediate association to Hitchcock's classic \"Vertigo\" \u2013 an abrupt death of the heroin leading to the mysterious \"resurrection\" of same. I would be looking for clues to explain the mystery and a satisfying twist at the end. And I could not have been more wrong.Armed with all the literature I've read, written from back in 1991 to quite recent times, by both professional critics and non-professional but almost equally erudite IMDb posters, I know what I would be looking for. There's only a thin line between the film being mysterious and poetic, and the words \"poetic\" and \"poetry\" appear in just about everything I read on this film. \"Poetic\" could mean technical thing like rhyme and rhythm, but here of course, it's senses and perceptions, as well as a frame of mind.The critics (back in 1991, mind you) talked about the frustration of trying to make some senses out of this film. But there are always two sides to a coin \u2013 there is the joy and liberation of being able to see in the film anything you want. I do not see anything particular in Veronique's long red scarf dragged along the floor during her brisk walk along the corridor. But I am chilled right down my spine by the look and smile the alto gives to Weronika at the beginning of their duet. For some reason, I see death, but probably because of my foreknowledge. The images of the two old women seen moving slowly by Weronika and Veronique no one would fail to connect, but everyone would see different meanings from it. Each frame in this film contains details that are meticulously constructed by master Kieslowski, to provoke the audience's senses and intuitions, not to challenge their intellect. The entire film is shot in a sort of perpetual late afternoon glow which is close to sepia tone but a tad brighter. Images and motifs are so rich that it's hard to find another film that is comparable. One review has given a full discourse on the use of music. I would only mention the deepest impression I had, of a scene almost towards the end when Veronique wakes up from what looks like a short nap and moves through corridors and stairs to her lover the puppeteer's workroom. The loud, pulsating music invokes such a powerful sense of mystery that is almost oppressive. But when she finally gets into the workroom, looks at a puppet and asks with a most ordinary smile \"Is it me?\", the music suddenly disappears, as if it was never there before. Cinematic magic! Enough praises have been heaped on Irene Jacob by everyone, or maybe never enough. She does particularly well in bringing out the subtle difference between the two women she portrays \u2013 Weronika (cheerful, even playful, focused) and Veronique (more sensuous, melancholy, slightly bemused). This film is so rich that you can never say enough about it (and I have not even mentioned the \"puppet scene\"). I will certainly want to watch \"Double life\" again, on the big screen, maybe not so soon again as during the current screening but in some hopefully not-too-distant future re-screening.",

            "content": "Seeing the films of Krzysztof Kieslowski is a special experience, now, more than two decades since he stopped making films, and died soon after. The Polish director's relative short life (he died at the age of 54) and career (less than two decades) is now turning into legend. Each of his films shows the quality and the emotion of a true master of the cinema. \"The Double Life of Veronique\" (or \"La double vie de V\u00e9ronique\" in French) is one of his best known movies, made at the peak of his cinema career, between the Decalogue and the Three Colors trilogy. Somehow I missed it at release. Now, in the perspective of the life and death of the director, not only that it stays as a remarkable piece of cinema but it is enriched with new significance.Fate and identity are the two big topics of this film. Have you ever had the feeling that you are not alone or even unique in the Universe, that somewhere or maybe in some other time, a parallel destiny is shared with yours? Did you ever feel like your life is not the result of your own decisions, that higher forces manipulate you life, same as a puppeteer controls his marionettes? If you ever felt something like this or if you can understand or imagine such feelings, this story of two young women, living in two different parts of Europe, sharing talents, feelings and fate without their lives ever intersecting for more than a few seconds, this story should not seem strange at all.Beautiful films (and books, and paintings, and musical works) have complex layers of meanings and a multitude of details that are revealed to the viewer, reader, listener. This is exactly the case with \"La double vie de V\u00e9ronique\". One can use multiple keys to read the story. There is a political reading about the parallel destinies of the two women who are born and live on the two sides of the curtain that divided Europe and was just falling down by the time the film was made. There is a philosophical reading about destiny and about the controllers of the destiny (the puppeteer, the writer who creates characters and write about their destinies). There is a religious reading with multiple symbols that ask to be examined from the name of the main character to the music that is sung and played during the film.Each of the scenes includes details that support the multiple stories and have their place in it, in some cases relating to other scenes in the peer story. The only exception was the secondary thread about presumptive perjury by the French Veronique whose sense I could not decipher. Music plays an important role, as the two women are musicians, they sing and teach music that reflects their relation with fate and God. So does light, which is in some cases maneuvered by the characters. The mirrors also show up in many scenes, sometimes as a reflection of the self, in other cases as a gate to the other side, as in Lewis Carroll's stories. Shades and mysteries follow the characters and the viewers at any corner and in any moment.Kieslowski's mastering of the art of cinema is matched by the superb acting of Ir\u00e8ne Jacob. She is strange and beautiful, sensitive and expressive. I can also wonder why her star paled after Kieslowski stopped making films, and why other film directors could not make better use of her beauty and talent. She is part of the same generation of French and French-speaking actresses as Juliette Binoche for example, but their post 1995 careers were so different. What a pity.I am happy to have discovered \"La double vie de V\u00e9ronique\", even if so late. It's a film to see and see again.",

I think the film is more accessible for european viewers, the same way Dawn by law might be for american viewers (I can\u00b4t bear that pretentious american underground movies at all, with cool men swearing all the time, trying to be funny... I can\u00b4t identify with most of nineties american characters). There are many american art house films buffs as well, so I can\u00b4t say this is a general fact, it\u00b4s just my view anyway.Regarding the development of the characters, Tsylia probably couldn\u00b4t understand at the beginning of the film how both women are described so poeticly. Weronicka is watching at the stars, while Veronique is watching the leaves fall. I see this is not evident but it  says a lot about the two. Weronicka is more spiritual, magical, and Veronique is more practical, more \"down to earth\". If you cannot see the metaphores throughout the film you will not grasp anything about the development of the characters, that\u00b4s for sure. Furthermore, Irene Jacob performance is sublime, you can see on her face so many \"difficult to express\" sensations, she\u00b4s not just a beautiful face as it has been stated below (I can name hundreds of pretty american girls on stupid films, I was shocked to read Irene Jacob is just pretty, couldn\u00b4t these people see she\u00b4s a valuable actress as well). In any case she\u00b4s pretty in the sense Catherine Deneuve is, I mean she\u00b4s not the common beatiful woman, you can see by his gestures that she feels alone in the world, that she feels the fullness of life, ... She sometimes seems like an angel in this film (Weronicka).I\u00b4m an atheist, but I admit the religious or spiritual feeling of the film engages anyone. The film evokes the idea that gifted people such this soprano singer have a spare part somewhere in the world, the same way the puppetier has a spare marionette for the one he uses most.God is not mentioned but the scenes are revealing: Veronique caresses the bark of a thick tree in the very last scene, which could signify her real father as well, or just the idea of fatherhood.The music is ten out of ten, if you feel nothing while listening to Preisner\u00b4s masterpiece, you\u00b4d better not say you\u00b4re sensitive anymore. This is his best for me alongside with the music for Short story of a killing and Damage soundtrack which sounds cruel and mysterious to me.I can\u00b4t think of any other film more precious and lyrical than this one.",

            "review_title": "A Masterpiece",
            "content": "This is a film which defies explanation. The story, on the one hand is quite simple in concept. There is a linking force between two women who live countries apart yet somehow have a sense of the other, even a love and kinship with each other. The one of them seems ignorant of it until that link is severed, at which point she sets about trying to understand the link she has lost.Truly, what sets apart the film is not the unique concept (though it is fascinating) but, rather, the way Kieslowski tells the story through dreamlike remembrances, refractory light and reflection, beautifully haunting and lifting music, and a performance from Irene Jacob which must have been a combined effort between her and the director.Beginning with the latter, I have to say that there is something odd yet wonderful about Irene Jacob's (\"Au Revoir les Enfants\") performance as both Veronique and Weronica. Avoiding voice over to add interior monologue is a challenge. When you are working with an actress who performs as brilliantly as Jacob the answer is acting. At almost no point in the film are you left wondering what she feels or what she is thinking. Her face says it all. Her body language punches it home.Hers is a face which can shine forth with innocence, passionate desire, heart-heaviness, soul rending grief, and exuberant joy, even as she astounds with singing performances which carry away the audience. She really is what makes this film work. Without her there is nothing here to watch.This understanding that what the audience connects to is through what they see and experience through the film allows Kieslowski to create a true work of art. Like The Mona Lisa, theories abound as to what he meant by it but ultimately he has left it up to us viewers to find meaning within.Many have said that they see religious allegory. Others see supernatural connection of spirit between people or even reincarnation. For me, There are some key scenes that lead me to believe that it is, at least in part, about generational knowledge and human collective consciousness.In many ways it seems that Veronique learns from the experiences that her counterpart Weronica has had even when she is totally unaware of the connection. She has a sense of what she should do in any given moment or situation, despite never having had a similar experience. She just knows what is the right thing to do.This theory of mine is furthered by the presence of both girls' fathers and their interesting relationships with them. The one seems far closer than the other but is that because she has learned from the other's mistakes or because we must all learn the balance between a past generations knowledge and our own self knowledge.In ways, I think this film encourages us to find a balance between the two, realizing that we are more than just ourselves or even the various possible paths we could take through life. We are communal beings who live amongst others, not just in our physical environments, work, school, and home, but also in our spirits, minds, and hearts.The film provokes one to rumination and thought, to be sure. I am confident that while another person may see \"The Double Life of Veronique\" and see something completely different within it, they will see something which captures their heart and wakens their spirit as only great art is able to do.",

            "content": "Krzysztof Kieslowski's The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique (originally titled La Double Vie de V\u00e9ronique) might be the best film in the late director's accomplished oeuvre. Perhaps most lauded for his monumental Three Colors trilogy, Kieslowski first explored themes of duality, synchronicity, and fate in this cinematic reverie. Ir\u00e8ne Jacob, also the star of Red, handles a double role as two women cut from the same metaphysical cloth -- the Polish Veronika and the French V\u00e9ronique. Her presence as both women is at once whimsically childlike and sensually melancholic; relentlessly alluring, it is easy to see why she became Kieslowski's muse. Jacob is perfectly fluid in the shift between characters, an embodiment of ideal femininity, as dreamlike as the tone of the entire film.Actor and director are symbiotic, relying on hazy, autumnal ambiance and mood for narrative, utilizing a subtle minimalist approach to dialogue. This is fine art, unlike heavy-handed Hollywood productions. The tone is consistently ambiguous -- emotionally resonant, to be sure, but beyond a vaguely somber, wistful undercurrent, the movie allows the viewer to fill the \"empty space\" with his or her own thoughts and feelings. It's a true testament to Kieslowski's mastery, and few films are ever so transcendentally sublime.The lack of this masterpiece's availability on DVD is a sad affair. There are rumors of a release in 2005, but for fans of movies like Am\u00e9lie hungry for something with a little more depth, The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique comes most highly recommended -- even if you have to search high and low for a copy on VHS.",

I was stuck in a sort of trance while watching this, as beautifully photographed scenes seemed to follow one after the other for the film's entirety.There wasn't a moment that I had lost interest, and the questions posed throughout are some that I found myself thinking about on many different occasions as a child. Do we, perhaps even simultaneously, share the same thoughts, feel the same feelings, and take part in the same actions as another person we have never met? Is it more than instinctual for us to avoid certain things, or act in certain ways? This film spoke to these questions, but of course never answered them. It turns out, I believe, that there are no answers to begin with.This is the fourth Kieslowski film I've seen, and most certainly the best. Visually, it shares a few things in common with the Colors Trilogy, and Ir\u00e8ne Jacob (Veronique and Veronika) was actually the main character in Red. Her acting is extremely good in both films, and the mood she creates in this one is understated, but incredibly graceful. I should mention the music in the film as well, which in addition to being beautifully presented, plays an important role in the connection between the two women. This is one of the best films ever made, presented by a man of great vision who left us far too soon.",

It is not my favourite Kieslowski, I would reserve that place for Blue and then No End and the Dekalog series but it has a lovely quality to it. I have never liked the ending really but enjoy the way it comes about. The general concept it strong and it is this that gives the film a slightly haunted quality which it pulls off.

It had the most promising storyline of all his efforts, but he went nowhere with it. Rather than developing what could have been a real mindbender, he chose to focus on symbolism, mood and camera technique.Film school students should love this flick. He does tons of wacky things like filming through a glass ball, through a man's spectacles (twice), through a distorted train window and, of course, using the trademark Kieslowksi microscopic close up on a cup of tea (ok, in \"Blue\" it was a cup of coffee, and in Dekalog 2 it was a glass of water...same friggin thing). But to people who don't go ga-ga over that sort of stuff--to people who are searching for good old fashioned literary substance--this'll be a somewhat aggravating experience.If you like impressionistic movies like Fellini's AMACORD or Tarkovsky's ZERKALO, then you'll probably love this film. But if you prefer the clearly-defined work of Kurosawa, Bresson or Kubrick, then I'd advise you to pass on this and check out Kieslowski's other works instead. Try the Three Colours trilogy & the Dekalog series...between those, there's 15 hours of good, classic Kieslowski to pique your brain.",

Every scene of this film, in some respect, matches other scenes to come. You'll have to pay attention to subtle clues and details as well as the metaphorical film language to notice them. Fear not! THIS isn't some kind of intellectual thinking persons picture. HOWEVER some profound questions are raised here about the very existence of SELF as well as the definition or what we define as human experience.There isn't much you can say about this film that hasn't already been said and if you've never heard it said please allow me to say it: This is one of the greatest films ever made and I strongly recommend watching this film alone. Why alone? Perhaps this is odd to say but the loneliness that haunts this film is surprisingly comforting.

Usually I'll chalk it up to the average viewer's lack of patience for more intense, intelligent cinema. However, in this case, any ridicule of artistic excess seems just.This is a film where nothing much happens and not much makes sense. Why does Veronique have an exact double half-way across Europe? The film introduces this idea and then simply lets it float about without explanation. Of course the viewer is left perplexed and frustrated. What was the director trying to say? Did he even know what he was trying to say? There's plenty of symbolism throughout the film that is very cryptic, not offering the viewer much help towards deciphering the story.This film reminds me of a modern art gallery, where pretentious \"art experts\" endlessly debate the meaning of a black square inside a white square. Sometimes a piece of art can simply look interesting while saying nothing coherent or concrete. That is the case with this film. It's a collection of pretty pictures that don't add up in the end. I suppose one could re-watch this film a dozen times, trying to glean some sort of deeper meaning. However, I'll pass. It's brutally slow and tedious; the prospect of continually re-watching this dull tale is not very appealing.Perhaps this film is highly regarded because many reviewers feel it's so cryptic and strange, it simply must be an artistic masterpiece. No one wants to be the uncultured everyman to stand up and say, \"This film makes no sense. It's a pretentious mess. Nothing of interest happened and the characters are not at all compelling.\" The cinematography is beautiful and Ir\u00e8ne Jacob is beautiful. Based on that, the film earns a 4/10.",

Consider the use of the puppeteer as a metaphor for the condition, look at how he says he makes two because they are fragile and break easily (just as Weronika breaks in her concert).  Veronique speaks of how she always knows what to do in every situation as if her life is leading up to something.  Theres a telling scene about midway through the film where Veronique walks between shadows through a slender path of light her face gazing rapturously at the the sun.

            "content": "Two exact look-alikes, the Polish Weronika and the French V\u00e9ronique, inhabit the world of Krzysztof Kieslowski's memorable The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique. Both women are played by the same actress, the radiant Ir\u00e9ne Jacob, winner of the Best Actress award at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. Born on the same day, they have green eyes and dark hair, congenital heart problems, and are talented singers, one a music teacher, the other a choir soprano, though each has a somewhat different personality. By its very nature, the story defies rational explanation and Kieslowski does not offer any, but the premise suggests that the separate self is an illusion, a projection of mind rather than an inherent expression of ultimate reality.Shot in Krakow, Poland and Paris, France, the film is suffused with the stunning cinematography of Slawomir Idziak and a sublime score by Zbigniew Preisner beginning with the song she sung by Weronica at her debut concert in Krakow. Weronica's story fills the movie's first thirty minutes. Weronica's exuberance and childlike innocence are captured in the film's early moments when, after an outdoor choir performance, she remains standing wide-eyed in the pouring rain, looking up at the sky, as the others run for shelter.Strangely though, Weronica tells others about an odd feeling that she is not alone, a feeling that is reinforced when she catches a glimpse of her doppelganger, V\u00e9ronique, in the center of a Krakow square photographing a political protest demonstration (though she does not pursue her or mention the incident to family or friends). Though Weronica's desire to be a pianist was thwarted in an accident, her beautiful singing voice enables her to win a competition to join a musical company. As the young singer begins to perform her first concert, however, her heart condition sadly prevents her from continuing and the film shifts the remainder of its attention to V\u00e9ronique.As we first see V\u00e9ronique, she is in the middle of making love but suddenly bursts into tears without explanation, the incident occurring at the same moment when Weronika suffers serious heart problems at her concert in Krakow. V\u00e9ronique has given up a promising singing career because she intuitively knows that it is \"wrong for her\" and instead becomes a music teacher of young children. During this same period she also schedules a cardiogram as if she has had some kind of warning. The film is propelled by the emotions V\u00e9ronique is experiencing: a strange feeling of being alone in a suddenly uncertain world and an unexplained sense of loss.The mystery deepens when she begins to receive enigmatic packages in the mail from Alexandre (Philippe Volter), a puppeteer whose exquisite marionette performance she has seen and whose gifts are tied to objects from his children's stories. Concluding from listening to a cassette tape that was recorded at the Saint Lazare train station, she meets Alexandre, but her expectations of love are thwarted by his mundane reasons for the subterfuge, although it serves to enhance her sense of closeness with Weronica.Though it is tempting to search for some sort of explanation, The Double Life of Veronique is better off not being analyzed but should be savored for its elusive and impenetrable poetry. If it has any point to make other than its captivating quality as a work of art, it may be that, in life, energy is wasted in trying to figure things out and that the only thing that makes sense is to submerge ourselves in its beauty and succumb to its mystery.",

Just as she collapses from a fatal heart attack in the middle of a performance, the action shifts to France where we meet Veronique - played by the same actress Irene Jacob. She was born on the same day as Weronika and is her double. In fact, she felt a pain at the moment that Weronika died.The Double Life is a beautiful looking film, not just because of Irene Jacob's perfect breasts. The music is a central element and strength of the film. It is a very romantic film and the minimalist approach to dialog adds to the beauty. The railway sequence is quite unforgettable. In watching the film, its important to let go of reason and rely instead on emotions.",

            "review_title": "over-specialization, material and spiritual",
            "content": "Much of this may be considered spoiler, and is intended for people who have already watched the movie.Weronika (W) of Poland and Veronique (V) of France seem to begin life with identical natures, but develop into extreme opposites: W becomes spiritual in her personality and view of life, attending to the inner and the private; and V becomes material, attending to the outer and the social. At first I saw the same connections I thought the girls see; but later I interpreted events differently from how I think they do. I'll use a few scenes as examples.At her father's place W wakes in a fright with a vague sense that she's not alone in the world, as if some spirit visits her. Later when she sights V in the square, she seems to have an other-worldly experience, as if this other girl is connected to that spirit. I assumed the same connection; but on watching the movie again, I realized that I had barely noticed something obvious in that scene: W is in imminent physical danger of being run over by vehicles and being knocked on the head or arrested by riot police, while V is physically safe and sound on her bus. To have an inner experience on seeing one's double is fine; but at the same time, the sight of her double being safe and sound should encourage W to want to protect her own body and to get out of the square. Instead W reacts in her usual private way, standing in almost a trance as behind her the riot police prepare to move. Run W, run!! As for that other spirit, it is W's way of experiencing and reacting to her chest pains, for which she never seeks medical treatment. But she carefully defends her inner life as she prepares for her concert and tries to avoid her boyfriend Antek. He seems to be of good character, but any love affair can stress the spirit.Beginning with her first scene as a young woman, V vaguely senses some sort of loss in her life. Later the parallel to the scene in the square happens in the hotel room. V vaguely tells the puppeteer Fabbri (F) that she's always sensed there was someone else, and she's always known what to do. When F asks V to tell everything about herself, she promptly empties the contents of her purse onto the bed, then smiles sweetly as he goes through them. When V sees the photo of W that has been in her purse for a long time, V seems quickly to connect the photo with that someone else who has always helped her know what to do, and to connect her sense of loss with the assumed death of that person. I assumed the same connections myself. But after watching again later I paid more attention to some aspects of this scene: we can take the contents of her purse as her private inner self, what little she has of one, which she so willingly dumps onto the bed, and which F goes through in a mocking manner, for example, making her crystal ball disappear - much as in an earlier scene he drives off with the angel-spirit on the side of his van. V's private life is under stress as it always is with a lover, even one of good character, which F lacks. To grieve at the assumed death of someone is fine; but the sight of the photo of her double from inside her own purse should encourage V to look within and to take care of her private self. Instead she reacts in her usual material way, imagining a dead body somewhere, and allowing F to enter her with the sort of mechanical sex one sees in bad pornography. Dig in, V, dig in!! As for the loss V senses, it is her was of experiencing and reacting to the withering of her own private life as she glides superficially and mechanically through the motions of her social life. As for her always knowing what to do, it is due to her own keen attention to the outer world and its social conventions - attention that W clearly lacks, though she tries to be kind to people.(BTW some have supposed that F has mysterious insight into some connection between W and V; but he could base his novel on nothing more than what V does and tells him in the hotel room.)W flourishes spiritually while paying the obvious price for never getting medical help for her heart condition. V flourishes materially and socially, but in the end she seems purely mechanical in going through all the right motions: she moves the puppet of herself while F controls her; she drives her car to dad's place; she operates its power window to reach to the tree; then she runs like a puppet to dad, who has been working wood with his new sophisticated tool. Each girl succeeds in her own way, but also pays a heavy price for being over-specialized.The many parallels between W and V serve as artistic device to compare and contrast them. But connections between W and V, other than each sighting the other briefly, are not required in this interpretation. For each of the girls that sighting is an awful tease, since she cannot realize how easily the other girl can deal with the current situation, in which she is so unaware and helpless herself. Here is a pair of stories: the first is a slight revision that lets each girl survive, and the second brings them together.",

I can only agree with some of the previous posters that yes, it is a reflective film in that each shot in the first half has a counterpart in the second half and yes, the director may well be exploring the areas of metaphysics, spiritualism, duality, etc but what is certain is that in Irene Jacob he has found the perfect vessel through which to project his thoughts, ideas, etc. I find that this film is far too complex to be dealt with succinctly in a report of this nature and demands further viewings.

Each of us is matched somewhere in the world , by our exact double -someone who shares our thoughts and dreams.An interesting and strange movie about two identical women , each has talent for music , each recognises affinities with her obscure soul-twin, each entertains doubts about her current lover and each has a a weak heart , and along the way , we learn from their suffering ; both women contend with the ups and downs of their individual lives , with V\u00e9ronique embarking on an outlandish love story with a puppeteer . Stars Irene Jacob who's terrific and unforgettable as the two women and director Krzysztof creates some spellbinding and gorgeous scenes , but the audience has to willing to forget plot for atmosphere . Kielowski may not proffer the lucid moral insights of his earlier Dekalog series , but it is hard to imagine anyone else making a more mesmerizing and amazing study of spiritual disquiet . Prior to filming , Krzysztof Kieslowski asked Ir\u00e8ne Jacob if she ever wished for a different name when she was a child . Jacob told him that she had always wanted to be named Veronique , and the name was used for her character . According to Harvey Weinstein, after seeing \"The Double Life of Veronique\" at Cannes, Quentin Tarantino approached him to enlist his aid in casting Ir\u00e8ne Jacob as Fabienne in \"Pulp Fiction\", Jacob turned down the role to participate in the film Three colors : Red . If the story is simplicity itself , this certainly not an easy movie , but coherence is assured by Irene Jacob's dual acting . This is first collaboration between Krzysztof Kieslowski and Ir\u00e8ne Jacob , they subsequently worked together on : Red . Whether you swallow what seems to be Kieslowski's thesis or comes down to a matter of faith ; but there's no denying his ability or compassion to invest places , objects and passing moments with an almost numinous power .Kielowski carries out an effortless control of mood and proceeding a subtle use of repeated motifs . Mr. Kieslowski started his career shooting documentaries and later became associated with the \"cinema of moral anxiety\" movement. It grouped several Polish directors, including Krzysztof Zanussi and Andrzej Wajda, and aimed at depicting the conditions of Poles under communism . His best known work was the Three Colors trilogy: Three colors : Red (1994), Three colors : White (1994) and Three colors : Blue (1993). Three colors : Red (1994) brought him Academy Award nominations for best director and best screenplay (with Krzysztof Piesiewicz) in 1995, Three colors : blue (1993) shared the Golden Lion at Venice in 1993, and Three colors : white (1994) earned Mr. Kieslowski the best director award at Berlinale in 1994. Announced his retirement from filmmaking after completing Three colors : Red (1994) , being final movie for filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski until his early death in 1996 at 54 . Rating : 6.5/10 .

            "content": "I loved the use of glass in this film, to distort images, add color tint, and cast partial reflections. There is obvious symbolism in these types of gorgeous visuals, the use of mirrors, and a sprinkling of supernatural elements that convey the central premise of the film, that we may have a double out there somewhere in the world, leading a separate and yet spiritually connected life. Without spoiling anything, there are memorable point of view shots and dreamlike images that are truly haunting.Kieslowski is artful in telling this story, applying a light touch and not turning it into standard fare where everything is tidied up and thoroughly explained. That's probably part of the point, that there may be things in the world that defy rational explanation, things that we get glimmers of only through our intuition, or senses. On top of the intriguing premise, you have the stunning Irene Jacob in the double role of Weronika and Veronique, and her performance is wonderful.Where the film fell a little short for me was in the narrative, particularly when the setting shifted to France. The pace got a little too slow for my taste, and there were elements of the story (like the false testimony V\u00e9ronique offers to provide to help a girlfriend) that seemed extraneous. That was where a little more connective tissue between the parallel lives, or broader picture of the concept would probably have made it more interesting. At least on the night I saw it, this was a case where the story didn't keep up with the visuals, but despite that, I thought it was well worth seeing.",

            "content": "Having loved Krzysztof Kieslowski's \"Three Colours Trilogy\", especially 'Three Colours: Red', those films made me interested in seeing more his work, with 'The Double Life of Veronique' and 'Dekalog' being particularly highly recommended.While not quite as good as the \"Three Colours Trilogy\" (or at least as good as 'Blue' and 'Red', it's about on par with 'White'), 'The Double Life of Veronique' is at its best mesmerising. It is somewhat slight narratively, not as thematically rich as for example 'Red' and Weronika is a slightly more interesting character than Veronique, with a slightly longer length Veronique could have had a little more development than she did.This is in no way denouncing 'The Double Life of Veronique's' quality, because so much works. It is stunning visually, the very stylised but often gorgeously jaw-dropping cinematography is innovative in its use of colour and camera filters to enhance the ethereal atmosphere created. The music is every bit as hauntingly intricate and symbolic as the score in 'Three Colours: Blue', and is like a fascinating major character in itself, the use of it is inspired too.Kieslowski's direction is assured, thought-provoking and unobtrusive, his style is distinctive and unmistakable and there are many great visual and dramatic touches that help keep the viewer fascinated. The film is very intelligently and poetically written, while the story makes the most of its ingenious concept through heavy but thought-provoking if initially perplexing use of symbolism and an atmosphere that's ethereal, hypnotic, poetic and haunting. There are many powerful and moving moments here.Irene Jacob mesmerises in her luminously sensitive dual performance, where she shows great emotional range with two completely contrasting characters. Her Best Actress award at Cannes was more than richly deserved.Overall, slight but intelligent, beautiful and mesmerising, the cinematography, music and Jacob being the three main reasons for seeing it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This is a beautifully filmed movie, with music that conveys an extraordinary atmosphere of mystery and longing. One sees the wandering of the main characters in this sort of spiritual daze, and the movie lets us attempt to fill in its \"meaning\" with everything that appears  on screen.\nAs beautiful as it is, I found it extremely tedious. I think the director could have put anything on screen and had the same reviewers leaping about for the meaning of the symbolism. (In fact, some reviewers simply have it wrong - e.g., although the puppeteer is initially shown as manipulative, within five minutes, the main character is saying that she's always loved him - it is she, not he, who empties the contents of her purse when he says he wishes to know all about her).The movie is like a poem with many beautiful images and no point - except the myriad of \"meanings\" that different readers will impart to it. One needn't like American movies to want a story - it's a pretty human desire. One wants a point in virtually all poetry as well - there's a thread that carries one stanza into the next - whether one's reading Shelley or Heine or Rilke, Gautier or even Verlaine. They want to tell us something - this movie sets up the premise and lets it drift like a cloud.  There's a very Kafkaesque story-like feel to this movie. Yet in Kafka, the main character always seeks meaning - he is rational and is alternately cowed, defiant, driven in his attempts to find out the truth. Not so with our main characters here - they are aimless.As beautiful as this movie is, there's really no point to it. The movie asks a question \"what if...?\" and doesn't attempt to answer it. I can't say that I thought it was a waste of time - it's obviously lovely, care has clearly been taken - and it does create an atmosphere of fuzzy longing and cloudy beautiful mystery.

Basically the story starts in Poland with the life of young Polish woman Weronika (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob) who has a keen ambition to become a singer, and aside caring for her sick Aunt (Halina Gryglaszewska) in Krak\u00f3w, she is prepared to leave most things to achieve this dream, including spending time with her boyfriend Antek (Jerzy Gudejko). She gets noticed by turning up at a concert rehearsal session, impressing the musical director with her beautiful high soprano voice and offered an audition, and eventually she is successful, and she reconnects with Antek who has been following her somewhat, but when she finally gets on stage to enchant an audience with her she sings her parts, but collapses and dies during performance. The story then shifts to Paris where on the same day young French woman V\u00e9ronique (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob), a doppelg\u00e4nger who in a sudden moment feels grief and sadness, she teaches music and takes her class to see a musical piece by the same composer who performed with Weronika, conductor Van den Budenmayer (Aleksander Bardini), and in a few instances she hears more of his music playing in places. The next day she tells her father that she is in love, all of the sudden with a man she has never met, after receiving an odd shoelace in a letter envelope she believes it is from a puppeteer she has seen a few times, also a children's book author who in one his stories mentions a shoelace, Alexandre Fabbri (Philippe Volter), and she reads more of his work, and also hears more Budenmayer music, including sounds of a car accident. V\u00e9ronique feels manipulated finding out that it was Alexandre wanting to gain her attention and meet again, she eventually lets him off and they sleep together and make love, and the next morning he finds a photo of Weronika that obviously looks just like V\u00e9ronique, but she denies it is her as he is the one who took the photo. The end of the film sees Alexandre working on a new book, focusing on the lives of two women born on the same day in different cities of the world with a strange connection, obviously based on what he found falling with V\u00e9ronique and finding out about Weronika. Also starring Kalina Jedrusik as Gaudy woman, Wladyslaw Kowalski as Weronika's father, Janusz Sterninski as Lawyer, Sandrine Dumas as Catherine and Louis Ducreux as Teacher. As the two identical women Jacob gives a performance worth watching, but I will be honest and say that I much preferred the first woman more than her second because she has an extraordinary singing voice that goes perfectly with the opera music, the second performance for lacked as much depth, in fact, I found after the first woman's death the rest of the film was a tiny bit slowed down, nevertheless overall it is a worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Good, in my opinion!",

            "review_title": "The murky puddles of the mind.",
            "content": "Two countries, two women, one link... These are the clues we are given by Kieslowski in order to piece together Veronique's central mystery. It is, without question, a cinematic masterpiece, one of those rare, elliptical works of cinema that on first appearance seems to present two separate narratives unfolding in succession, with the director linking them through coincidence, chance and uncertainty. However, those familiar with Kieslowski and his work will know that this particular director would never make a film of such simplicity, and there is more information to be divulged as we wade through the murky puddles of the character's mind(s).The story begins in Poland, where we find the adolescent Veronika singing opera with her school choir. After getting caught in a rainstorm she goes home and makes love to her older boyfriend... so already we have themes of sex, music and the passage into womanhood, three very important factors that will resurface throughout the course of the film. Later in the story, Veronika gets the chance to audition for a highly prestigious opera company, but dies on stage before the audition is over. The story now moves to France where we meet Veronique - an older, though identical incarnation of Veronika - who works as a music teacher for an elementary school. It is at this point when most viewers begin to become baffled by the strange adjustment of the character, but in reality, no change has occurred. On the night of the audition, Veronika's death is a metaphorical one, and the sense of anxiety conjured by this important event causes her to faint away, thus losing the job.So, when we meet the same woman some time later she has remained in France and taken the job teaching music at the school. All other events surrounding the 'death' are symbolic and subjective of Veronika/Veronique's guilt and embarrassment (...note the point of view shot from within the grave and its roots in dream-logic). It is only after exploring the world as Veronique and seeking out surrogate father figures (or indeed, lovers) that the character is able to escape into one of her father's picturesque painting and find forgiveness from her family... or so it seems? This is merely one interpretation of the central events of the film, which, along with the later Three Colours Trilogy, demonstrates Kieslowski's interest in subjective realities layered upon various coincidental narrative view-points. From this, it is easy to see the director's attempt to fill his story with other stories that grow from the central narrative and either depict, or dictate, Veronique's state of mind.Here we have the themes of the opera, the performance of the marionettes, various confessional monologues, as well as the more conventional ideas of coming of age and growing sexual awareness, alongside the assorted political ideologies at work within the subtext. It's a particularly remarkable achievement in so much that the director takes us on a cerebral and emotional journey through one woman's psyche without any of us being fully aware of quite what is happening. As a result of this, the film works on multiple levels and, although it might be something of a clich\u00e9 to point out (lest we forget that a clich\u00e9 is full of truth... that's what makes it a clich\u00e9) but the film offers viewers the chance to interpret the images in situations however they desire, meaning that the overall film will have a different impact on everyone who views it, marking it out as a haunting dream of a film begging to be explored.This notion is further explored with the use of cinematography - which is spellbinding throughout - with the director and his esteemed cameraman Slavomir Idziak employing all manner of colour tints and strange optical filters (as they had done previously with A Short Film About Killing and would continue on their next project, Blue), to paint both Poland and Paris as strange, Gothic, ethereal dreamscapes that manage to convey the character's inner-emotions, as opposed to simply creating a mood. Of course, none of this would be possible without the stunning and intricate performance of Irene Jacob, who, unlike most actresses of her age, is able to exist naturally in two completely different worlds, whilst simultaneously presenting us with two very different characters.The fact that she is able to build such a subtle and invisible symbiosis between the two, whilst leaving the viewer completely oblivious to any broader sub-textual implications, is an astonishing achievement in itself. The Double Life of Veronique remains one of the defining works of European cinema in the 90's and is easily one of the greatest and most iconic films ever created by the late, great Kieslowski.",

            "content": "This is a story of two women, the Polish Weronika and the French V\u00e9ronique. Both women are played by the stunningly beautiful and captivating Ir\u00e8ne Jacob. Weronika gets her story told in the first third and then V\u00e9ronique has her turn. In addition to their being identical in physical appearance the two women share many other traits. Both are musically talented, have similar heart conditions, are the same age, and have parallel experiences. While the two never meet, they intuit the existence of each other in some mysterious ways. This storyline may be hard to swallow for the literal minded, but the movie is not out to convince us of anything, but rather to create a mood and have us consider possibilities. I think most people have wondered who on the earth most resembles them in appearance and experience and this film taps into that speculation by way of exaggeration. And who knows, is what happens in this movie any stranger than the existence of entangled particles at the atomic scale where a change in the state of one effects a change in the other no matter the distance separating them?Much is left to the interpretation of the viewer and anyone who is looking for some definite meaning will most likely be disappointed. Many scenes and events seem to be of little relevance. For example, when Weronika is having an acute heart problem she looks up and sees a man in an overcoat walk by and expose himself. These ridiculous events certainly happen in everyday life, but why put this in here? There is a stern, scowling woman who appears in both stories, but there is no hint given as to her tie-in.This is artfully filmed and could be considered a warm-up for Kieslowski's \"Three Colors: Red,\" since many scenes are lighted in soft red light and many physical objects are red. The lighting takes full advantage of Ms. Jacob's beauty. Given the musical talents of the two women, it is not surprising that music plays a key role in the film. There is a concert scene that has Weronika singing an incredibly magnificent aria. I played that scene several times. The soundtrack composed by Zbigniew Preisner lends a haunting quality to the proceedings and much would be lost without it. In a playful twist, music from an 18th-century Dutch composer, Van den Budenmayer, is referenced and played. Turns out that this is a pure creation of Preisner.The Criterion Collection DVD has an alternate ending for the U. S. version. Any additional significance contained therein was lost on me.When I first watched this I did not much appreciate it. Thinking that maybe I had missed something I watched it again and was glad that I did, since I found it much more engaging. Perhaps I was too busy reading subtitles on first viewing and missed the exceptional visual qualities. And I was better able to follow the subtle courtship game that V\u00e9ronique and her suitor were playing.",

Picture this: a man walking his dog with a baguette underneath his arm, cut to a girl playing frisbee by herself fetching the frisbee each time she throws it, cut to another girl who looks like the first but isn't who steals the man's baguette. Drama. Intrigue. Mystery. Or more likely - something that just doesn't make sense. And this is the camp that the film belongs to.It is a dangerous move when you abandon many notions of narrative - sometimes it can pay off big, but for me, this didn't make it. Still as I said moments of beauty and maybe you'd get more out of the overarching project of the film than me....",

            "content": "Parallel lives ideally bound together by some banal photographic clicks doomed to shake the soul and to generate a visual vortex determined by the perception of an impalpable, aleatory mystery, maybe some anomalous violence within the limits of a distortion in the space time continuum. Strange consonances, mutual echoes of existences fastened to invisible threads that join together and keep apart. Subterranean feelings of overwhelming voids lived like sudden and unexpected moments of melancholy wrapped in mystery. Hands leaned against the bark of the trees in order to penetrate the arcane vibrations of the nature and to trace the broken thread that join us to a parallel existence swept away forever, whose fleeting trace can be seen on a creased sheet of sensitive paper. Kieslowski chooses the sweet and gentle Irene Jakob to play the main character of his first movie after the worldwide famous Dekalog. It's impossible to forget the scene where the protagonist \"lifts her eyes to the sky like a flower to the rain\" (please, Sting, excuse me you can) to receive the raindrops in her face with open arms and to feed on their tonic energy. The movie is imbued with a flavor of magic innocence and candor and painted in light tones, while the music composed by Zbigniew Preisner seems to burst forth from the bowels of the film substance. The director models all around the figure of the protagonist a world of the same consistence of the marzipan, the same gracefulness of harmonious notes levitating in the air, the same delicacy of a handful of romantic kisses given passionately. All things considered, \u00ab The double life of V\u00e9ronique \u00bb looks like an inexhaustible hymn to the life and to the capacity of regeneration peculiar to our vital tissues after an indirect experience of death, thank to the discovery of the absolute love, impalpable like the atmosphere that surrounds the whole story, unlikely and ethereal at the same time, sublimed by strange relations referring to subtle Kieslowskian metaphors always on the look-out. A kind of love bred by sudden tumults of passions wrapped in the thickest mystery, that come true thank to mysterious sound messages referring to a station touched lightly by the shadow of destiny.",

            "review_title": "Brilliant!",
            "content": "A few spoilery bits throughout!Just like a constellation you're unable to decipher yet sure its stars are linked together to form a certain pattern, the lives of Weronika and V\u00e9ronique are inextricably, and inexplicably, linked by an invisible thread only intuitively felt. The former lives in Poland while the latter in France, they were born on the same day, share a knack for music (Weronika is a choir singer with an ethereal, angelic voice; V\u00e9ronique is a music teacher), and suffer from a cardiological problem. They're, in a mythological sense of the word, doppelg\u00e4ngers, who'd better live in two parallel worlds lest bumping into each other would result in putting one another's lives into a tailspin. In one sense, the film is about that person in your dreams who you think, besides looking exactly like you, complements you in ways beyond your capacity even if you're sharing the same affinities as well. A splitting image you'd easily mistake for your other half even though you're pretty much a whole. Someone you long to meet to be fulfilled, and when awake, you grieve for the implausibility of it all. And I think it's within this realm where the movie operates on a subconscious level so that you're effortlessly connected emotionally with it by merely letting yourself immersed in its sepia-drenched images and its downpour to wash over you. However, I wouldn't buy that description at all. In another sense, it's a film about discovering one's own identity. Insofar this seems a proper description that I can't refute, I still think this is just scratching the surface; focusing on obvious details and disregarding the overarching theme. For me, The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique is about grieving for your younger, juvenile self despite the naivety that led to its demise; about a deep-seated longing for the past that grows on while growing old even though you're more mature and successful now than you were way back when. And this is exactly where the film manages to hit some nostalgic notes, for the film seems to celebrate that desperate longing in one way or another. Besides the puppets show I'll mention later, there's a scene that sums up all this in a few words: V\u00e9ronique's father shows her a fragrance to try it, she tells him it's nice but the one he showed her the other day was more pleasant. \"This is from the end of Autumn, the other was from the beginning,\" is her father's reply, which he follows by wondering whether people would need this fragrance at all. The movie is chockablock with subtle visual and narrative details carry multi-layered symbolic significance that I couldn't get my head around in my first watch.The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique is an enigmatic metaphysical tale with an expressionistic set design and cinematography littered with subtleties functioning as an objective correlative, stressing every emotional beat along the way. There's a lot of reflections in The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique and the look-alike characters see themselves, or rather sense each other, in many things: images; objects. Throughout the first half, we see recurring distortions, upside-down images and mirror-like reflections, some show convexity and others concavity. We see plenty of objects such as a tram window glass, a man's magnifying spectacles, and a starry marble. They're all suggestive of something wrong rippling Weronika's life and irking her of late while bringing her fears of not being \"alone in this world\" to the fore. Besides, there are many juxtapository images the editing mix in that accentuate the dual nature at the core of the film. Indeed It's a film where objects and images hold immense value to the characters but also work as clues of revealing significance, and expository tools to the viewer as well. It's not until the marionette show where I started to fathom the film through the \"metamorphosis by death\" metaphor. The shroud is a cocoon? No wonder why there's a shot from the point of view of a corpse! Through this scene, Kieslowski makes a parallel to V\u00e9ronique's double life, indicating that with the death of Weronika, V\u00e9ronique began a fully-fledged new life. Moreover, by letting the camera linger on Jacob's face, Kieslowski captures the intensity of her internal conflict, and by ending the dizzying fits of Weronika with an off-kilter, tilted angle, we collapse with her. Thus, the camera is both a guiding force and a participant in Weronika's crumpling life and Veronique's quest of love and working out her existential issues. The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique is just a flawless harmony or a poetic mood piece, buoyed by Idziak's ravishing cinematography, Preisner's haunting score, and sees Ir\u00e8ne Jacob - in one of the most riveting performances I've ever seen to date - emoting endless feelings across the film's fleeting runtime, taking you on a rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish.",

We had never seen a Krzysztof Kieslowski film and were very much looking forward to it. What a tremendous disappointment. We found almost nothing to like.The story line was weak and confusing. The entire atmosphere of the film was contrived and phony artiness. We almost turned it off several times but toughed it out to the bitter end hoping it would get better. When it was finally over we checked user ratings and noted it is most popular with \"under 18 year old males\" and we suspect this might be because what we have is soft-core pornography posing as art.

The idea is neat - there are two ladies, Weronika in Poland and Veronique in France, both played by excellent Irene Jacob, they meet only once and still just see each other in Krakow during the anti-Communist strike of 1990. Weronika the Pole is a great opera style singer, though she never studied this seriously before, she misses her Mom and comes to Krakow to her drinking Auntie. There, she gets attention and accepts the invitation to sing in serious concerts. But she is deadly ill and dies suddenly during her debut. Veronique lives in France, she is a teacher, she is quite happy with her love life, her relatives and her hobbies. Anyway, this is where the extreme boredom creeps in, while you are through the French part of the film. I am sorry for all those who love the film, but the excellent tempo and impeccable style start to evaporate at about last 40 minutes of the film, and then you only plead yourself to watch it till the end. Good film indeed, all made in honey yellow amber color tones and full of sudden and subtle details - creeping old grannies, shambles on the background and peeling walls. Cool and deep work.",

            "content": "\"The Double Life of Veronique\" is an absolutely beautiful movie in every sense.  The film tells the story of two identical-looking women, the Polish Veronika and the French Veronique, who seem to be aware of each other in some way, but who have never met.  The movie doesn't attempt to explain the similarity of these characters; it is far more interested in telling their stories and leaving the mystery as a sort of resonant background that colors the events that unfold.  The radiantly beautiful Irene Jacob plays the double role of the title characters, and she is brilliant; the film doesn't give her very much dialog, but she communicates volumes with her facial expressions and body language.  The cinematography is gorgeous, with most of the film shot through amber-colored filters of one form or another, essentially eliminating the color blue from the movie and giving everything a slightly distant look.After seeing Kieslowski's three subsequent movies, his wonderful \"Three Colors\" trilogy, it seemed to me that \"Veronique\" was almost intended to be a prequel to them, with scenes in each movie alluding to scenes in the others.  Certainly, anyone who loved \"Three Colors\" will appreciate \"Veronique\" as well.Overall Rating:  9 (out of 10), or 4 starts (out of 4)",

Weronika is Polish and V\u00e9ronique is French; their names aren't the only thing they have in common; both are musical and have had similar experiences in life... and they look identical.In the early part of the film we follow Weronika as she visits her aunt in Krak\u00f3w. Here she auditions for a part in a concert. Later as she walks across a town square during a demonstration she sees a French tourist who looks just like her. Shortly afterwards the action moves to Paris and that French tourist, V\u00e9ronique, takes centre stage.There is something strangely hypnotic about this film; at times it has a dreamlike feel even though there is no suggestion that anything we see isn't happening to the characters. Similarly there is a haunting relationship between Weronika and V\u00e9ronique even though they never really meet; there is just the brief moment when one sees the other in the town square. While each of their lives clearly effects the other somehow the film is about more than that as we as we see their loves and lives; joys and sorrows. Ir\u00e9ne Jacob, who is rarely off screen, is mesmerising in the dual roles of Weronika and V\u00e9ronique. Director Krzysztof Kieslowski does a great job bringing the story to life and creating the amazing atmosphere. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for something rather different.These comments are based on watching the film in Polish and French with English subtitles.",

The face of the person she sees is her own. Somewhere on a Polish plaza, to briefly surface and drown again in the crowd. \"La Double vie de V\u00e9ronique\" teaches you to appreciate escaping the comfort zone of trusted logic, recognize its pitfalls and see a strange, maybe even absurd fantastic premise in an otherwise realistic picture as a chance to discover something that cannot be named. Sure, Kieslowski pictures are always a combination of beautiful images, evocative music and a strong cerebral component, but \"La double vie de V\u00e9ronique\" is his most enigmatic, thought provoking work. Various threads are spun by writer and director which appeal to the viewer's imagination, so that they may be connected or respected just the way they are. Or perhaps seen as a whole in the eye of the beholder in front of the screen: Two different lives, one face, strings attached or mere coincidence? Is there fate? Does the demiurge work as puppeteer or are our actions influencing others in a way we would never anticipate? There are no metaphors in my work, Kiesloswki once said. Sounds challenging? Feel free to connect your own dots in this magical adventure of parallelism seen through the looking glass!Just one thing: The purpose of art is not to provide answers and be prescriptive in its implications, be they moral, social, historic or otherwise, but rather to open up new pathways and perspectives and question what we've been used to take for granted.

But if I'm ever going to assign the word ''transcendent'' on a movie, this would be one of the best candidates.I think I can't explain it because it isn't meant to be explained. It is meant to be FELT and artistically appreciated. Of course, you can also ponder about the depth of some of the lines but it's very difficult to find an objective meaning or message to the movie as a whole. Sentiment and mood is what Krzysztof Kieslowski really masters here. It's almost surrealist in its approach but with some dots that connect so we can still have a satisfying story for the movie to play on. It partially reminds me of ''Un Chien Andalou'' , especially when Veronique pretends to cut her eye with a ring, just like in the beginning of Luis Bunuel's movie.The sick, strange or surreal green that enwraps nearly every shot is one of the best I have seen, comparable to The Matrix (1999). And it makes me feel like I'm in some sort of dream, a gloomy but not nightmarish dream, but meanwhile it also creates complementarity through adding red in the shots.Till I figure out more about the movie, it has any score between:An 8,7 - 9,4 from me.",

            "content": "It is no wonder that it was hard to Kieslowki to find a suitable title for this movie. In fact, the double life of Veronique is the leading, but not the main theme of the work.Consider the two halves of the movie corresponding to the lives of the two Veroniques. The second half of the film is mostly devoted to the strange and failed love encounter of the French Veronique. By making her lover a puppet player who can't resist manipulating or taking advantage of Veronique, either for his books or his plays, Kieslowski seems to hint to the idea of Veronique being no more than a puppet of life. This now becomes the main theme, in which the double life is but another product.\nBut it was not essential to Kieslowski to simply hint at the mystery of life, so paradoxical as to produce the strange events shown in this film. As he later proved in RED, there IS an order of life, even if paradoxical to man's mind; an order capable of transcending - and transgressing - our rational perspectives. The only problem for Kieslowski - as for the puppet player/writer - was to make sure that these transgressions occur and are in fact possible. And it is here, IMHO, that the film fails: I couldn't really believe the \"metaphor\" of two women being the same, at the same time, one feeling like the other, or one following the other's story. It is not like the (true) story of the journalist finding himself in a novel by Cortazar, who never knew him. This fact often quoted by Kieslowski, revealed to him the strange symmetry of life when rightly perceived by man and was the sort of rationally-twisting life symmetries that he wanted to show in his movies.But in this work these rationally-twisting symmetries are  too \"worked-out\", too artificial to be credible. Given that this was the stuff of the color trilogy, the Double Life of Veronique may rightly be considered as a first approach to such major artistic and visionary problem.",

            "content": "It had been a bear finding a properly subtitled version of this film, until the wonders of YouTube finally helped our cause. Ir\u00e8ne Jacob's immeasurably understated grace and beauty permeate this film, from the first moments in Krakow where she elevates her voice to angelic proportions, to the second half where she tries to connect with herself in another way.Quickly put, we see two aspects of the same life and experience. Weronika in Poland, a radiant singer with little training but an apparent divine gift, enjoying life with full vigour and finally reaching the dream of become a stage presence, only to be seized from our world by the maker above. It seems unjust, but perhaps she had an inkling of trouble when she spotted her double on a bus slightly before, a jarring experience that nonetheless made her keep her focus.On the other side, in France, we find V\u00e9ronique, who suddenly abandons singing to teach music to children. She finds herself intrigued by a puppeteer who strikes a cord within her with his marionette show, and slowly comes the realization that she is half of a now incomplete whole.Kieslowsky's brilliance shines in this movie. As we'll see later in his seminal Three Colors, he uses closeups of mundane items to represent stages of reflection or worry. In \"Bleu\" it is a sugar cube dissolving in Julie's coffee while here we see a teabag immersing itself, emptying its flavour in hot water and thus ridding itself of its duties. Kryztof also perfectly captures Poland in revolutionary moments and the imperilled safety of one individual.Weronika goes from the ecstasy of singing to that of physical ardour to apotheosis whilst her French counterpart regresses from singing to teaching to fleeing to finding, and finally understanding. Jacob is near perfect here, hitting all the right emotive notes. Her almost radiant happiness as she sings hymns at the start, during a torrential downpour, is an unforgettable moment. Her grief at finding herself in the final scenes is also palpable, a bravura performance for the actress.A fine film, deep in starting blocks for other movies from this director, The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique is a must for anyone who has led more than one life or feels connected to others.",

The lighting is invariably beautiful, shot in sepia tones which mirror Tarkovsky.  Of greatest interest, though, is its influence on 'Amelie'.  The theme of a young girl drawn inexorably towards her destined lover, achieved through a series of bizarre, improbably (indeed, supernatural) events is present in both and there are similarities in appearance and personality between Irene Jacob here and Audrey Tautou in Amelie.Maybe this is far-fetched, but I also detected what might be a precursor to Spike Jonze's films (scripted by Charlie Kaufman).  'Being John Malkovich', along with 'The Double Life..' carries puppetry as a central analagous idea, both films featuring puppets of the main characters.  Also, the notion of one of the main characters writing the story of the film within the film (which we see in 'the Double Life...') is obviously the central premise of 'Adaptation'.'The Double Life of Veronique' is therefore definitely worth a look considering that 'Amelie', 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' all seem to borrow heavily from it.",

The images are often striking; the camera swishing over Veronique as she twirls gleefully from her bed... Rain cascading over Weronika as she sings alone in the open air... Veronique listening in hushed anticipation to a near-silent phone call as neons and incandescents bathe her face... It's like a dream.Irene Jacob inhabits her character(s) with a smooth, authentic gentility. She seems to feel every moment as if it were her own.The story is nearly as oblique as the numerous reflections, distortions, and visual abstractions through which we regard the landscape of the film, and yet I felt a sort of tacit kinship with its dreamy quality. It calls to mind Andrei Tarkovsky, or David Lynch in his airier moments. The film's brief, lilting coda encapsulates this tone beautifully. Narratively, it's beyond rationality, and yet it's delivered with an inexplicable knowingness that transcends petty notions of narrative clarity.My only real criticisms are, for one, that Kieslowski overdoes it occasionally with the garish green filters, which can obscure and distract from otherwise beautiful imagery. A couple of interstitial sequences are a bit overlong, which made me mildly restless. Nevertheless, The Double Life of Veronique is a gentle, quietly powerful film made with care and subtlety.",

Ms. Jacob's performance was excellent, and I can understand why it won her a Cannes prize. The music feels ethereal.

As presented, it could have been made into a short much more effectively than a feature. I agree with other reviewers who lament that too little time was spent developing the story of the Polish woman and too much of the French woman. I will concede that while the plotline itself is nothing innovative, it was still a cool idea.The marionette sequence at the beginning of the film was mesmerizing, at least to me. The nudity felt thrown in just to give it an R rating.

Although Kieslowski is a highly skilled director with a respectable list of great films on his resume, this is my favorite of his oeuvres.The photo is fantastic. Every shot could have been disassembled and put up in a photo exhibition. The music is excellent. The story is a little diffuse in an interesting way and very rich in its scope for interpretation. Actually the film is so much broader than just confined to a single story. And this is like life; life is not always as grandiose as we think or wish it to be, but the simple things can be beautiful. It covers many small things in life, and like Kieslowski's other films, the approach is steady yet light-handed, relaxed. It is poetic, it is about love, about life, about mysteries.It is a tragedy to not take advantage of an opportunity that comes into one's way, maybe once in a life time - and we suffer regret. Ir\u00e9ne Jacob has similarities to Juliette Binoche, probably Kieslowski's type of ideal woman: independent and beautiful. Like for example Binoche in the Blue film of the Dekalog, the women in his films have adopted to loneliness. But they cannot handle it completely - nobody can.In the end, it is sense of utter satisfaction to have completed this film that does not disappoint on any single point.

            "review_title": "at times a confounding experience, but one I hope to revisit, for Irene Jacob and the direction",
            "content": "The Criterion DVD for The Double Life of Veronique includes many of the bells and whistles when it comes to special features, not to mention a long, in-depth interview with the director, Kieslowski. Maybe I'll watch that some time soon, but not right after watching this film. I could go looking for some easy answers - if there are any, which I doubt anyway - but I'd rather stay for now in a moment where I can just ponder everything I watched. It's such a rich and moving experience, and is one of the most unique mystery films I've seen in a very long time - possibly ever.In a way its chief mystery is what it's all about, which remains, possibly, elusive even to the end. Of course we have an idea of the concrete fact that there were two babies born on the same day in different countries, France and Poland, and they grew up to be beautiful young women with dark hair and brown eyes, and looked exactly the same. There's also a moment where the two see each other (one sees the other on a tour bus in Krakow, this in the midst of a protest/riot in the streets, and yet this other woman on the bus won't see her, at least not yet). Will they try to look for one another is a key question.But Kieslowski is so not interested in anything conventional here. The mystery is about discovering things, but not necessarily the deeper mystery of one knowing for sure the other exists; in other words, this isn't one of those double movies like, say, The Double (2014). We really get two stories here of these women, and they're full-on character portraits: the first half hour is dedicated to Weronique, the Polish woman, who is a professional singer (and former piano player) who has a heart condition. The rest of the film focuses on Veronique, who is a music teacher and, after seeing a puppet show performed by a charismatic man named Antoine (or is it Alexandre, one of those), he starts to... stalk her? Follow her in an intriguing way? Certainly he leaves clues for her to find, and when she does... then what? I'd like to make note for a moment music in the film. I don't think it's some flippant \"artsy\" choice on the filmmaker's part that each of these people are involved with music. Music is so central to the film, especially when Weronique is singing and becomes her most vulnerable, but also in those moments (on the flip-side image, so to speak) where Veronique isn't paying as close attention to the music she's teaching her students. Notice the opera that Weronique sings comes back more than once, like when Veronique is watching the marionette show. There is significance there, and it may be rooted back into that realm that music can lie with every person - like romance, which this film has, you can't always use the utmost logic ('the heart wants what it wants' so to speak) so why a music moves one person won't necessarily be the same for another. Why is music so paramount for Weronique, while for Veronique it doesn't seem so? Or, is music one of the things that connects them in that elusive, deep-deep down inside sense that they both have? Or maybe they're latent Jedis or something (I kid).How this is all filmed is completely absorbing; Kieslowski uses hand-held camera-work, but in a steady way that often creates tension, like when the two Veroniques are walking out in public (i.e., French side after she leaves her rendezvous with this not-so-mystery man and tries to go through crowded streets, and the Polish side after a rehearsal, where her heart becomes weak and she stumbles to catch her breath). How he uses color is especially breathtaking as well, and not always in ways that forces it but suggests things - red filters and bright whites and yellows here and there (not as blatant as the Colors trilogy, but maybe this was a practice round). So even when things get so enigmatic that it could, in just a few moments, become pretentious, Kieslowski reels it back in and makes the direction vital and important in ways that are unexpected. The camera itself is often another character, which is impressive.I've come all this way and haven't noted that without Irene Jacob this might all not work, or at least as well. There may be a moment here and there where it doesn't seem like she's doing much - she's so beautiful (on the cover I thought for a moment it was Ingrid Bergman with her eyes closed) that one might underestimate how deep and powerful she gets into both these women. The vulnerability is what's so staggering, and how much she feels the moments of joy and wonder, how her face registers genuine curiosity and in seeking out this mystery, and that crucial scene at the caf\u00e9 when this Frenchman is revealed, notice how her face changes - it's subtle, but it's really there. I could watch Irene Jacob in this film or Red and see an actress so in tune with the character(s) that she in a way does half the work for Kieslowski. In other words, even when I was wondering, more than once, 'this storyline, such as it is, is getting a little weird and quixotic, maybe for its own good', she really grounded me in the emotional logic, and the pathos becomes so much that it makes something like a scene near the end this mix of heartbreak and bewilderment that I've rarely seen like this in a film.It's at times confounding, in certain choices and moments, but never in ways that might alienate; Kieslowski asks the audience 'come, a little closer - find out more about these women, and whatever the outcome, the journey is genuine and interesting.'",

            "content": "\"La double vie de V\u00e9ronique\" by Krzysztof Kiewlowski shows in a most remarkable way how a person can be split in two individuals \u0096 Weronica who lives in Poland and V\u00e9ronique who lives in France. According to classical Aristotelian logic, however, an individual is bound by place, time and body. Nobody can show up in the same body in two different places and/or at two different times, but a look at several mythologies shows that this concept of individuality is nothing but our heritage from ancient Greek thinking. Logic and metaphysics that form the fundamental of our sciences but also of our daily perception are Aristotelian as well. According to Celtic logic, for example, a two- or tripartite individual causes no problems at all, since here the spatial and temporal axes do not go into the definition of the individual.In order to treat multi-partite individuality, it is thus necessary to abandon Aristotelian logic. Since Celtic mythology (as mythology in general) cannot be formalized like Aristotelian logic, one must understand that time- and space-bounding of individuality in classical thinking causes mono-contexturality, i.e. an abyss between two persons as big as the abyss between the Here and the Beyond. On the other side, a poly-contextural notion of individuality allows the exchange between individuals. Already in a three-valued poly-contextural logic, the question arises if Death means the loss of individuality as it does in a two-valued mono-contextural logic. It seems to be merely a decrease of matter, but not of mind. So, when Weronica dies in Poland, she is able to survive as V\u00e9ronique in Paris. It is remarkable that this kind of \"doppelganger\" shown in Kieslowski's movie does not belong to the frightening ones. In the opposite, since our perception of this world is not a two-valued \"light-switch\" system but colorful, so also the logic on which our perception is based should not be a yes-no logic but allow more values outside of this mono-contextural dichotomy.While only very few people accept that two-valued logic is long outdated \u0096 although already Heisenberg's detection that subject and object cannot be differentiated anymore on the level of high energy physics proves that this logic is fragmentary -, it is amazing that poly-contextural moments show up so often in movies. Very seldom, however, this has been presented in such an intriguing manner as in \"La double vie de V\u00e9ronique\". Since science fiction in literature has announced the various developments of computer technology such as robots or cyber space, it is possible that up to now still fictional elements of our thinking are now announced by film that precedes the future change in our perception and its logical and metaphysical bases to which belongs without doubt also the abandoning of the mistaken Greek concept of individuality.",

It's mesmerizing and that's really something for me because i can't remember another film i've seen that i can use this word about or maybe just a couple and they are almost all by David Lynch. No, i don't compare this film to Lynch's but they have something in common. They all look like dreams.\"La Double vie De Veronique\" is really like a dream to me. It looks like a dream, it features one of my dream girls, the story is not so important at all, just like in a dream, and it also features so many metaphors along the way. The whole film is as if taken from Kislowski subconsciousness and put on celluloid. Of course there's also a motif about duality, fatherhood but what struck you first is the overall atmosphere. The cinematography is excellent, here i go, i started with it, forgive me Irene. That's what makes the film so mesmerizing and really succumbs you in it. While i was watching, i really felt i wanted to be there, to live in this world, so melancholic and magical.

I can't imagine how it is possible that she fell into mediocrity, or at least i heard so. But you know, i'm not that surprised either. She's not for everyone's taste. And of course i mean her acting abilities too. I heard some users think of her as just a \"pretty face\". Actually i don't think that's bad. Good film actors have to have charisma, a magnetic quality that attracts you in them so that you feel concerned and involved, i would love too see Glenn Close from the back rolls of the theater but not in a erotic thriller. And about the acting abilities - people see Al Pacino shouting at people and think that that's what is all about but it's not. Not all the people in the real world are so aggressive, passionate or so extrovert. Irene Jacob's acting is really very sublime and that's really hard. It's just that her heroine is that kind of person. I would really like to see more of her movies and to see her in new movies too. If not else she remains one of my favorites.And here comes the music. It's beautiful and it's really in the right mood with the film. I was even thinking at one point what if the film was based on the score and not the other way around. \"Gospodin\" Preiner is the man responsible. Well done is the least i can say. I'm trying really hard to find the music of the film. The scene with the concert and the subsequent death of Weronika is just so heartbreaking. By the way i like her better than Veronique. Yes, there is differences but you've got to find them by yourself. Or maybe just because she's a \"bratushka\"(a Slav).",

            "content": "A very beautiful, if somewhat confusing, film. A lot of the people commenting here have already said it, but I will repeat it anyway: Irene Jacob does a fantastic job in this film in terms of acting, and she's angelically beautiful too. Although there is very little dialogue, she conveys a huge amount to the audience - another example of Kieslowski's genius for visual narrative. Her performance, combined with the fantastic cinematography, shot composition and selection, and music, make this film a treasure to behold. Virtually every single frame of this film would look amazing if you blew it up and hung it on your wall in a picture frame, and I bet that if you sat blindfold in your living room while the film played, you would have a pretty amazing experience as well. The storyline of the film was admittedly fractured and vague a lot of the time, but sitting here a couple of hours after watching it, things are starting to click in my head. The Polish part was fine in terms of narrative, very engaging. Then we cross over to France, and we are shown a lot of tiny snippets of Veronique's life, which we immediately try to start piecing together to form a story. None of these snippets ever join together to form something concrete... this is Veronique's lostness and confusion as she searches for something to fill the void left by Veronika. At least that's what I think. There are still parts I don't understand, such as what exactly happened outside the cafe where she meets the puppeteer, and what happens at the end of the film when Veronique touches the bark of a tree and we see her father inside the house. Strange. Maybe I will understand more when I see the film again, which I certainly will - but probably best to wait at least 6 months. The only gripe I have with the film is that it seemed a bit drawn out and boring about 3/4 of the way through, when very little was happening... but I have to forgive Kieslowski this because a film this great doesn't come along very often.",

            "content": "The Double Life Of V\u00e9ronique (La Double Vie De V\u00e9ronique) is the 1991 French-Polish film by Krzysztof Kieslowski, written by himself and Krzysztof Piesiewicz that was the presage for the greatness of the Three Colors Trilogy (Blue, White, and Red), and was an international sensation at both the Cannes and New York film festivals, for here is where the gilt-hazed camera work of Slawomir Idziak, the music of Zbigniew Preisner (although slyly credited to the fictional Van den Budenmayer in the film- a running joke within Kieslowski's later works), and Kieslowski's own vision first touched greatness- even if it is a conditional greatness, more of sensuality than sense. The film has been rhapsodized by international film critics as Kieslowski's 'coming out' film, but one can see it is clearly a bridge between the direction he was headed with his TV series The Decalogue, and where he ended up in the Trilogy.The film is not linear, which is the first thing that separates it from the typical Hollywood, and even contemporary European, films, but there is a cloying coyness to the film's reliance on synchronicities and contrivances that is more pronounced than in the Trilogy, where the errors Kieslowski made here were modulated. A film, or any work of art, that has a number of interpretations is exciting, but one with unlimited interpretations is a cheat, and reeks of narrative laziness. The Double Life Of V\u00e9ronique falls just short of going too far, but the relentless scenes of cogitation for the sake of cogitation- and revealing lead actress Ir\u00e8ne Jacob's lovely face and body, border on the obsessive; which would not be a bad thing, considering a good portion of the film's tale is on that topic, but the plain fact is that there is nothing new brought to the table on said topic.Many critics have read so much nonsense into the film- such as the early death of Weronika absurdly representing Poland's absorption into the Soviet Bloc- in this most apolitical of films, that such readings only highlight the film's greatest failure- a lack of coherence. Yes, the film has to be given some latitude, narratively, but open endedness, to a fault, is still a fault. That Kiesloski did not repeat this in his later films is a recognition of this fact, and may explain his near obsessive need for tying up the ends of the Three Colors Trilogy in Red. Such things as how Alexandre got Weronika's possessions? Could he be the lover that Weronika was leaving Antek for? After all, he's famous and travels. Thus his later obsession with her twin, when he meets her, would have psychological resonance, as well as explain his stalking and sending of things. One can resist the temptation to figure out every last detail in a film like this, for much does not stand up to intellectual scrutiny, but to not ground the narrative in some bit of internal diegetic reality is to rob the film of its solid foundation.The Double Life Of V\u00e9ronique ultimately misses greatness, if by a hair, because of these flaws- such as its too contrived, and lacking in chemistry, romance, for it often tries to force its implausible mystery at the viewer, rather than letting it evolve more subtly. In this way, its directed ending- even if more mysterious, is actually more in line with the Pulp Fiction sort of storytelling than that in the Three Colors Trilogy, which might explain why The Double Life Of V\u00e9ronique was highly awarded, whereas Red lost out to Quentin Tarantino's convoluted yet plot driven film at that year's Cannes Film Festival. The ending, where Alexandre tells V\u00e9ronique of his plan for a book similar to the film is simply too much, and such preciousness is a flaw in the screenplay by Kieslowski and Piesiewicz. One wonders what a greater screenwriter, like Bergman, could have done with these ideas. He certainly would have muted some of the obviousness, for even in Persona- another overrated, but greater, film, he does not go so far as to have the two aspects of what could be one person/persona played by a single actress. Thus, the film relies more on its strengths- which are undoubtedly great: the acting of the sensual yet innocent Jacob, and the evocative imagery, where the narrative's oneiric progression works best in its hermetic cosmos, crafting the dialogue of the two women from silence, even as the camera fixates on the radiant Jacob.I wonder if Kieslowski was aware of the scientific studies done on twins separated at birth, and if this fact influenced this film, even to the point that the two women were, indeed, twins- one adopted by a Polish family, and the other by a French family? Such a hint that this might be the case could be evinced through further watchings, which I shall engage in, and which might just raise this slyly intriguing cocktease of a film above the bar for greatness. Until that time, however, I am left with the critical truism that while the narrative interior of a film can get away with not being analyzed too closely, the same cannot always be said for its exterior workings. This is why the film left me with a lack, yet why I also will view it again. Sometimes success and failure can have the same result. Other times not. Just ask Weronika/V\u00e9ronique.",

Glimpses of eternity; life, death, mystique, spirituality, romance, art; darkness, light, reflections, shadows; echos, silence, music. A slight brush of the flapping of the soul's invisible wings; a glance at the spirit's fine and delicate contours; a peek at its mystical, miraculous and metaphysical silhouette. Sublime cinema! The Double Life Of V\u00e9ronique is the creative pinnacle of Kieslowski's otherwise extraordinary rich career. This majestic film is a festive celebration of the wizardry of unrestrained, ingenious film-making, a showcase for singular quality of cinema as a collaborative art form. The film's steady, always radiant yet subtle energy, is a magic flow of transcendental forces, a wide river which makes artificial boundaries between two countries, Poland and France - between Weronica and V\u00e9ronique - irrelevant and obsolete. V\u00e9ronique opens with an exterior shot of a Polish choir girl; her gaze lifted towards heavens, her angelic voice soaring as the spring downpour disperses the rest of the choir girls. A living angel singing an ode to the creator, a gifted girl celebrating the majesty of living. That's what artists are put on Earth to do - aspire to heavens. La Double Vie De V\u00e9ronique is a reflection of Kieslowskie's deep artistic longings, a mirror reflecting his most intimate film aspirations. The film was made during the crucial time in his life, the time of revolutionary upheaval - the lifting of the iron curtain; the time, also, of his moving to France from his native Poland. The character of Polish Weronika and her mirror image, French V\u00e9ronique, are composites of the artist's soul, the embodiment of his artistic strivings. Supremely gifted with angelic soprano, Weronika is the artist's Polish alter ego. Her heart condition is a poetic metaphor of the fractured soul of an artist behind the iron curtain witnessing the collapse of the old world. Weronika's final demise is symbolic of the passing of an era and Kieslowski's eventual leaving his native Poland. There has always been a dynamic duality within hearts and souls of eastern European artists. Constrained by the rigor and dogma of the totalitarian ideology, the artist's domestic roots and artistic inspirations were in constant conflict with the longing for the western freedom of expression and unrestrained creativity.V\u00e9ronique, a music teacher, is Weronika's body-double and, symbolically, Kieslowski's French incarnation. She is introduced in an erotic scene that surprisingly leaves the French copy of Polish Weronika saddened and melancholic. As the film moves from Poland-set first act to modern day Paris, we find V\u00e9ronique feeling a strange sense of loss, a vague sensation that a part of her had mysteriously disappeared. In an early scene in Poland, Weronika takes a note of a passing truck hauling an upright statue of Lenin. It is the time of turmoil, the time of sweeping, historic changes taking place.The old Poland of the Kieslowskie's young, formative years is swept away by the course of history - forever gone. A heartfelt loss that an immigrant artist in a foreign country feels deeper than any other human being. V\u00e9ronique's heart condition is symbolic of an uprooted artist's heartache - the pain for the things which a person leaving his country irrevocably looses. V\u00e9ronique's search for the identity and whereabouts of her secret admirer through the maze of urbane Paris, is a primal quest mirroring Kieslowskie's own search for artistic identity and recognition in the new, unknown, more challenging foreign terrain. The original soundtrack composed by master composer Zbigniew Prieznev compliments every aspect of the film to an extent that its haunting score becomes an integrated narrative element and its melodies turn into magical strings connecting the two women.Genre-defying, as many European movies are, the films effortlessly crosses various cinematic terrains. This is a genuine masterpiece that will forever remain the finest achievement of the late 20th century European cinema. On another level altogether, this majestic metaphysical thriller could be viewed as the first cinematic acknowledgment of the validity of the string theory of the universe.",

Weronika is a Polish opera singer who while performing at an outdoor concert, continues to sing in a heavy rainstorm. Afterwards, she meets her boyfriend, Antek, and they get it on. She tells her father that she does not feel alone in the world. She visits her aunt in Krakow and meets a friend at a concert rehearsal. While listening, she sings along and the director is so impressed with her voice that he asks her to audition. While walking down a street during a protest rally, she notices a woman taking photos of the crowd. The lady looks like her twin. Her double gets on a bus which drives away. She passes the audition and the following night, and while singing a solo at a concert, collapses and dies on stage. Her spirit travels over the audience. That same day in Paris, Veronique(Irene Jacob), feels a great sadness for no apparent reason. Later, at her classroom, she leads her students in a classical piece by the same composer that Weronika was performing when she died.,Veronique falls in love with a puppeteer and writer named Alexandre and as the couple go through a photo album, he sees a picture which looks like her. Veronique explains that it can't possibly be her, since she took the photo. There is no real ending for Double Life, but Irene Jacob in the dual role, makes it work.",

            "content": "\"La double vie de V\u00e9ronique\" is a film with a hard to follow storyline. It is about two women (Weronika in Poland and V\u00e9ronique in France) that have more in common than only their names and their appearances (both characters are played by Irene Jacobs).It remains vague what this \"more\" precisely is. The two women seems to be aware of each other, without direct contact. During a vacation of the French V\u00e9ronigue in Poland there is a moment that they are physically close, but pass each other unnoticed.Some will say the \"more\" is something of a shared soul, others will say it is more a shared fate or predestination. In favor of the last interpretation is the fact that both Weronika and V\u00e9ronique have problems with their hearts. In the second half of the film there is also a puppetmaker who produces two puppet versions of V\u00e9ronique, suggesting that somewhere above there must also be a puppeteer.My personal interpretation is that the film reflects most of all an identity crisis on the part of director Krzysztof Kieslowksi (1941 - 1996). \"La double vie de V\u00e9ronique\" was his first film outside Poland in his new homeland France. He would live in France until his untimely death in 1996.The death of Kieslowski was a loss to all lovers of cinema, but was I think especially harmful for the career of Irene Jacobs. After a small role in \"Au revoir les enfants\" (1987, Louis Malle) she played leading roles in the Kieslowski films \"La double vie de V\u00e9ronique\" (1991) and \"Trois couleurs: rouge\" (1994). After the death of Kieslowski the rising curve in her career more or less came to a halt.",

The strength of the film lies in this omnipresent connection between the two women that look alike, feel each other's emotions and yet they have never met. Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, that tragically passed away five years later, created this masterpiece that marked his career : a wise mix of poetry, whose plot oscillates between dream and reality. The silences, the palpable emotions, the almost-buried memories, the constant distress feed this synergy between the two women. The whole movie excels thanks to the puppets' play, a real metaphor of the connection between the women. The yellowish photography, sometimes flirting with a well-polished sepia, enhances the emotions and the actor's glances. \"The double life of V\u00e9ronique\" is visually meticulous, sensitive and whose originality has lost none of its superbness since its released.

Another reason was the fact that this was his first collaboration with Ir\u00e8ne Jacob who later appeared in his masterpiece Three Colors: Red. So yeah i wanted to see their first collaboration.

The movie follows two identical Veroniques, born on the same day - one Polish, one French, both with an identical heart condition and the same great operatic singing voice,both look like each other, they are like separated twins.We never really truly understand the connection between the two Veronique's they both look the same, the same thing is happening to both, and they feel something that they cant describe, they never feel alone, they always in a way feel each other.Its weird because i cant say that i disliked the movie, and i don't understand much of what happens, at times i felt like i was under a spell, very weird felling, some scenes are almost hypnotizing. Because of Kieslowski visual beauty, the yellows and oranges on screen perfect, but also because of Ir\u00e8ne Jacob, she is amazing. The luminous Ir\u00e8ne Jacob does wonders with her difficult double role as Veronika/V\u00e9ronique, which requires her presence in nearly every frame of film. Guided by the sure hand of Kieslowski, Jacob projects an authentic goodness and innocence, coupled with a palpable sensuality and sensitivity. And this seems effortless. And to think that Andie MacDowell was almost cast to be in the movie, No way she would had been as great as Ir\u00e8ne.While watching it i was amazed by the visual beauty that once again Kieslowski managed to put on screen, by the charming star that Ir\u00e8ne Jacob is on screen, but after the movie ended, the movie left me with questions lots of them, it left me confused.I think Kieslowski wanted us to end the puzzle by ourselves the thing is that he doesn't give enough pieces, maybe the puzzle just cant be done, and in film i like to finish my puzzle.

The story (if a story at all) lacks a point of view or a stance or anything of substance unfortunately. The movie itself is filmed beautifully and well scored but has nothing else going for it, in my opinion. This is simply because the story wasnt there, the character had nothing to offer as connectivity and it was detrimental to the presentation of the story (again, if any).",

The filming itself was great, beautiful shots of Krakow and Paris along with great camera angles and movement (such must be exceptional for me to even notice!). The heroine is stunningly beautiful and I confess the mere fact that I couldn't take my eyes off of her by itself causes me to give TDLOV a thumbs up. Whether you see, find, etc., a plot, suspense is present, whether for its own sake or not! The introduction of interesting characters is intriguing, even if at least some of them clearly go nowhere. Likewise odd incidents (the flasher!) arouse curiosity if -again- the itch created is never scratched.

            "review_title": "Spiritual Bonds and Pure Emotions",
            "content": "Krzysztof Kieslowski's Polish films weren't exactly social descriptions but the Polish reality exhaled from them. After he had made The Decalogue and The Short Films About Killing and Love, he made his first international film La Double vie de Veronique which was followed by The Three Colours film trilogy. Already in No End (1985) Kieslowski worked with the screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz and the composer Zbigniew Preisner, with whom he made all of his subsequent films. In result of this masterful trio all the international films by Kieslowski are characterized by aesthetic styling. Compared to his Polish features they were also more ethereal, absurd and almost fantasy-like. In them, women rose out from the kitchen to Kieslowski's protagonists, and therefore he reached completely new emotional scales. The Double Life of Veronique tells the story of two young women, Polish Weronika and French Veronique who unconsciously share a spiritual bond.Weronika is a very talented singer, but she has a weak heart. She has to choose between artistic and normal life, because singing might have tragical consequences for her heart. When she wins a singing contest and the judges give her a chance to perform, she gets a heart attack in the middle of the concert and dies. The French Veronique is the double of Weronika and she also has a breathtakingly beautiful voice and a weak heart. Without knowing it Veronique shares a spiritual bond with Weronika, when Weronika dies she suddenly starts to feel vacant and blue. To avoid the pain she decides to give up art and starts to teach music in a school. One day a man, Alexandre who writes books for children and makes puppet show performances, arrives to the school. Veronique is immediately enchanted by him. A few days after Veronique starts to receive mysterious clues from Alexandre, an empty cigar box, shoe lace and a tape. The tape leads her to a railway station where Alexandre is waiting for her. They go to a hotel room and have sex, after that Alexandre finds a picture that Veronique has taken in Poland and sees Weronika in it. He of course thinks that it's just Veronique in the picture, but when Veronique herself sees the picture she begins to being aware of her double. Alexandre, who badly wants to be a real author wants selfishly to steal the double life of Veronique for his book. In result of this Veronique leaves, knowing that Alexandre is not the man she is looking for.In his interview book, Kieslowski on Kieslowski, he tells that he is always searching for the balance between understanding and mystery. Because if he shows too much the mystery disappears, and if he doesn't show enough -- no one understands a thing. But this is exactly the beauty in Kieslowski's films and in order to attain the new emotional scales of his international production, he had to preserve the mystery. In the end where Veronique realizes Alexandre isn't the right man for her, she leaves from there to her father's house. Kieslowski said that almost no one in the United States understood the ending -- by his producer's request he made an alternate ending for the States. They didn't understand where Veronique went, or if they did, they didn't know why. Kieslowski explained it through examples in his interview book that it is hard for Americans to realize the meaning of home. In European culture the family structure is much more stronger. Veronique touches the old tree seeking for comfort, care and safety.Just as Kieslowski's Blue, The Double Life of Veronique is also about music. Blue is about composing and Veronique is about singing. Zbigniew Preisner's masterful score is so beautiful that the audience could burst out into tears just in result of that. But, in addition, Idziak offers us some breathtakingly beautiful images with the help of the touching story by Piesiewicz, told us by the master of visual narrative, Krzysztof Kieslowski. The Double Life of Veronique deals with sensitivity, sensations and relations. It is a film about emotions. Loneliness, love and passion. It is about the relation between the spirit and the body. It's about eroticism, art, life and death.Many film fanatics see Jean Vigo's L'Atalante (1934) as the most beautiful film ever made and I couldn't agree more, but if talking about the new cinema (post-1970's) I can say without a doubt that The Double Life of Veronique is the most beautiful film. But what makes it so beautiful? Of course the cooperation of Kieslowski, Pisiewicz, Idziak and Preisner, but also the multidimensionality of it. The harsh Polish reality can be seen beneath the surface and, the story Kieslowski creates with Piesiewicz is breathtaking. It is so real and close to ourselves. The Double Life of Veronique is about our deepest emotions: it overflows with Pure Emotions.",

It's full of evocative images that can make you digdeep into your own life. Jacob plays all the emotions withsuch skillfulness, she shines. A real gem. Don't watch it ifyou're depressed. It can make you go very sensitive. Thismovie is so beautiful it made me (almost) cry each of thetwo times I saw it.I recently saw a trailer for the movie \"Passion of Mind\" withDemi Moore playing a woman from the US, feeling like shehas another life in France, but she can't distinguish whichone is real and which one is not.

            "content": "Like the other Kieslowski films, the film do not offer much entertainment value but philosophical value. After listening to the audio commentary, I realize this is even more complicated film than I thought.I wasn't bored by it, but rather, perplexed. Knowing that it is Kieslowski film, instead tried to grab on to find its concept, I let the scenes express themselves as they are. I did have a haunting feeling through out the film, especially through the \"green or red\" dim mood coloring. It was intimate, yet mysterious surreal. Annette Insdorf's audio commentary of the Criterion Collection DVD did point out many connecting details and thoughts that did not revealed to me in my first viewing.After some more thoughts, I started to think that this movie really did fail to hold the audience in 2 ways: 1) Krzysztof Kieslowski: Although this movie is deeper than the eyes can see, it is even less entertaining movie than his others that I'd watched. The intrigue went as far as the movie title. After that all the clues are so obscured that without a guide, it is a total \"perplex\". He had put so much effort into placing clues that he neglected to keep his audience. Granted, his meticulousness I do appreciate. Appreciating is different from enjoying. Green mix red is not an appealing color either, unlike the captivating colors in the three color trilogy.2) Irene Jacob: She is truly one of the most beautiful actress in the last few decades. The movie showed the full array of her beauty and the glory of her curves, not to mention the full blown of her eroticism. However, I can't find her performance inspiring. This is an expressive movie, and it is essential that the leading character express convincingly, i.e. Irene Jacob alone by herself, which I did not find her successfully do although I have to say quite a load for her to carry playing 2 characters. A movie I think I can compare with is Wong Kar-Wai's \"In the Mood of Love\". That movie would have been totally dull if Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung did not have their a great performance which I thought they had. I did not think Irene Jacob was tremendous either in Red though much better performance that this one. I thought Krzysztof Kieslowski did made Red interesting. Maybe I found that Irene Jacob is an overrated actress (was she ever considered as a good actress?), or perhaps Kieslowski is not the right director for her.It doesn't take away my appreciation of the grandeur spiritual message that I found in this movie, nor will it stops me from further watching Kieslowski's other movies, not at all. This is not a movie I would recommend to everyone, but a movie worth the while to be studied.",

            "content": "\"The Double Life of Veronique\" very much lies in that grey area of cinema where nothing quite makes sense, but everything does seem to all connect together on some strange, indecipherable level. A famous example of this is \"Mullholland Drive\" - nobody has ever really been able to give a straight forward solution as to what the film is about, but it's still a very affecting piece of work, and the main comparison I had in my head while watching this film.This is a completely different movie, though, and what it achieves is much more impressive in my eyes. The plot couldn't be a whole load simpler; two women, identical in looks, age, and name, lead parallel lives - one in France, one in Poland. One day, one of our heroines catches a glimpse of the other by chance, seemingly setting in motion a chain of events I won't describe, lest I spoil it for everyone. Needless to say, it's an outlandish plot, but Kielowski wisely doesn't question this.Instead of focusing on its plot, it instead focuses on nailing down the eerie atmosphere that permeates nearly every scene - a strategy that absolutely pays off. Very few films out of the horror genre manage to capture such an atmosphere and it's staggeringly impressive, thanks in no small part Ir\u00e9ne Jacob - an actress who by now is slightly forgotten, but has given performances that would be career-best for many Hollywood stars. This is definitely one of them, capturing a wide-eyed innocence and strength that few actresses ever manage.A lot of thought is given to what this film means. It's a fair question, but as I mulled it over in my head afterwards, I realized it's not really the point. The film itself is the one searching for the meaning, and while it has no answers, its questions are much more engaging. My interpretation is that Kielowski is asking whether or not we aren't actually as alone as we like to think we are sometimes - that there are forces, far beyond our comprehension, pulling strings and making things happen. Almost everything that happens in this film appears distorted or magnified somewhere else in its running time - repeated, endlessly, forming patterns. It's not going to suit every taste, but it's a fascinating look at a take on life that most wouldn't have thought of.",

The Double Life of Veronique is a haunting musical epiphany and with such visual poetry, it is filled with symbolism, some frank eroticism, and a slight dark humor. Kieslowski loves to filter colors to have an effect on his films, if it was part of his Three Colors Trilogy, it would've been \"Gold\". The photography was nostalgic, the lighting gives different shades on different moods of the characters. Irene Jacobs was enigmatic and sensual in her role as Weronika and Veronique. The story is simple, but there is more than the plot here, Kieslowski is more concerned in the visual rhyme, and his mystical narration of the story. He kind of connect the whole film together with strings but still leaves it like a scattered puzzle, it encourages uncertainty, and that is what I really liked about it. It leaves us with haunting questions that remains for us to answer, maybe in our own lives, rather than making us a complacent viewer that understands everything about the film and the world. I admire how Kieslowski made the film a reflection on the possibilities that the film indicates a reality beyond physical mundane lives. This film is both delicate and mysterious.

It is too partisan to call this movie one of the most profound features in the history of cinema, but it does carry a weight that is beyond your typical French meets accidental, beyond few nice gazes, beyond colorful stills of fashionable youth in ambivalent scenes of dramatic gentleness.The plot is simple: Two Veronicas are not twins but they happened to look very much alike, born in two different universes, to two different mothers, but they are metaphysically connected, one making all choices right, and the other not.  Given that we all look like someone else, what's the likelihood that there's someone out there on this planet of 5 billion that looks just like us?  Would we have anything in common with them, as we might with our friends?",

That's the way I saw this film. It is evident that it is entirely dedicated to Ir\u00e9ne Jacob's beauty, who gives a very good performance, perhaps one of her best, if not the best. And she is beautiful indeed! Zbignew Preisner's music excellently rendered by Elzbieta Towarnicka's voice, completes the beautiful images, by pleasing your ears and your soul. That's all. Do not expect any story, because there isn't any. The film is about two women, the French V\u00e9ronique living in France and the Polish Weronika living in Krak\u00f3w, Poland. They look alike like twins, like two drops of water. V\u00e9ronique seems to feel Weronika, like it often happens with twins, however, they are not. Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction is excellent, perfectly rendering this poem of spectacle and hearing.",

            "content": "i will openly admit that i really didn't know what to think when the closing credits started to roll on krysztof kieslowski's the double life of veronique. this is a gorgeously-shot, completely immersive film that unapologetically leaves the viewer with many unanswered questions.the storyline follows two women, played by the same actress, who share a mysterious mental and emotional connection, despite having never met. the most apparent aspect of their subconscious connection is that veronique, the young french woman, seems to make decisions based on the parallel experiences of her polish counterpart, weronika, without consciously knowing why. the first act of the film follows weronika almost exclusively as she begins her singing career. After a dramatic and significant event in weronika's life, the film turns to veronique for the final two acts, focusing primarily on her uniquely developing romantic relationship with a children's author.the double life of veronique is so rich and densely-woven that i found myself getting lost in all of the sensory and thematic layers. the cinematography is striking, with many memorable shots exhibiting a surreal and beautifully disorienting quality. the camera exposes a number of fascinating visual motifs as the film progresses - windows, reflections, and certain color associations, just to name a few. music plays a signficant role as well in the surreal connection between weronika and veronique. many musical cues throughout the film provide potential clues in unlocking the mystery of this film's meaning.and it is, most definitely, a mystery - at least it is to me after seeing the film only once. kieslowski is known for creating films that ask questions, rather than make statements and the double life of veronique is no exception. (in fact, it is perhaps the strongest example). he gives the viewer so much to process in this film and yet maintains almost complete ambiguity, leaving it open to any number of interpretations. as i continue to ponder and even revisit the film, i'm sure that my own interpretations will begin to take shape. in the meantime, i am haunted by its questions and anxious to sink back into the double life of veronique.",

I think director was successful in the sense that during the movie you'r always expecting something to happen by not too much things happen.The naked scenes of Irene Jacob was really aesthetic but it looks like director has used her beauty too much..

            "review_title": "Review: La double vie de Veronique (1991)",
            "content": "Review: Right away, The Double Life of Veronique is very well shot; it's as close to painting on film as you can get. The photography appears twenty years ahead of its time. I can see where Kubrick got his inspiration for Eyes Wide Shut (1999) and where Sophia Coppola got her inspiration for Lost in Translation (2001). The quality of the production compels an automatic recommendation. It's clear Kieslowski and his DP, Slawomir Idziak, have a mature appreciation for natural beauty. The lighting is beautiful, the locations are beautiful, the sets are beautiful, the sounds are beautiful and the actresses are beautiful. Nothing filmed is ugly, gratuitous or cheap.It seems Kieslowski is so interested in filming the intimate human condition he has no time for a traditional antagonist. He borders on insinuating that life, itself, is the villain. I know bad things can happen to good people. Weronika and Veronique both have a heart condition, but only Weronika dies. Did Weronika choose to sing even though she knew it would result in a heart attack? If there's life after death, does your soul function as your guardian angel while you're still alive?This is where Kieslowski separates himself from other directors: He calls attention to realistic issues people have with life, especially when thinking about their own lives. It's the upside to eastern European filmmaking that western pragmatism rejects as proto-narcissistic. There can be positives in pathological thinking if the result is something objectively good and honest. I think Kieslowski is trying to say something good about nature and humanity. It's possible that Kieslowski is a pre-modern \"epistemic realist\", but, because he evolved under the web of the iron curtain, he only knows how to paint in a language of ethereal nihilism.The problem with these Slavic writers and directors (e.g. Strugatskiy, Tarkovsky, Zulawski) is they try too hard to be artistic and diaphanous; They try too hard to be nuanced and somatic. They feel like they have no obligation to be relatable or dramatic. The medium of film demands a different approach to art. Relatability and drama is what gets the audience involved. Can I be allowed to participate? I want to care! I want to feel like I'm in the movie! No. I'm just supposed to watch. Ok....fine.La double has serious story and pacing issues that undermine the poignancy of the film. Specifically: the relationships in La double feel trivial and flat. If the film had been written by Leos Carax, or Derek Cianfrance, I believe it would've been much better. I get it. Slav auteurs are used to living in the oppressive communist tundra where they've been told there's no God and that nothing really matters; and now, twenty years later, they suddenly realize they could've moved to France and pined for the affections of some lonely woman - like they always wanted. The unappealing side of Kieslowski is that he likes to imply the issues his characters face are universalisms. When I watch The Double Life, I don't feel like I'm learning about *the* human condition, I feel like I'm learning about *his* condition. The duality of man is now the duality of a woman? I guess? In some ways I think Kieslowski secretly wishes he was that young French Veronique; and, in some ways, I think he just *wants* her.Generally, I found Veronique to be twice as interesting as Weronika; I liked her laissez-faire attitude and lack of ambition. It's implied that Weronika's death functions as a kind of wave-function collapse for Veronique's future. Veronique chooses to avoid singing because, subconsciously, she knows it will result in death. I guess certain life choices are empirically wrong. Instead of focusing on her career Veronique decides to focus on finding love. That's a message I can't disagree with.Irene Jacob, of course, does a great job from start to finish. The most compelling scene occurs in a caf\u00e9, where Veronique finally converses with a man her own age. \"Here we go!\" I said, \"Maybe they'll get into an argument, or, or something!\". I found myself wishing the entire plot was just about Veronique and the title of the film was just \"Veronique\". More things of consequence could, and would, have happened - if the film wasn't trying so hard to push a metaphysical philosophy. If the movie is supposed to be an intellectual commentary on the mental prison of deterministic existentialism, and the burden of living with the knowledge of Schr\u00f6dinger's cats, then the characters are going to have to do something about it. Challenging the meaning of reality is too complicated to do in allusion and metaphor alone. Audiences see references as only motifs, not some build up to an epiphanic revelation or hidden truth.Films like The Double Life (and Three Colors) have no real arch. The characters are sometimes written to appear as if they've overcome something, but they really haven't. Everyone is sacrosanct. I think that's part of this whole artsy fartsy thing. Oooo they really didn't get over it. Oooo they're just choosing to continue their lives because..... the world is beautiful, and willpower, and....time...man. The innocent brooding bourgeois lost in modernity; ma moiti\u00e9, ma raison d'\u00eatre! I can see the Proustian allegory - \"It comes so soon, the moment when there's nothing left to wait for\". The Double Life is Kieslowski trying to be Claude Sautet, but without the charm and wit. Apparently you have to actually be French to write dialogue that good.Boiled down, The Double Life is another story about a person trying to ignore how desperate they are for inspiration (some say love). In my opinion, the film is as desperate for inspiration as its protagonists. Watching La double, does however, lead to other, more interesting questions it may not have even meant to ask.",

A philosophical, arty film its also subtle, full of Kieslowski's directorial magic, and gives the lead actress her most challenging role. There are two women, the Polish Veronika and the French Veronique ( Irine Jacob). They do not know that the other exists. They share the same losses and the same health. Weronika is a singer, and Veronique is taking singing lessons. But their lives and souls are bound together, and their personalities are yin-yang opposites, one practical and one a stargazer. Each has the strange feeling that she is not alone in the world. When Veronika dies onstage while singing, suddenly in France, Veronique is stricken with a strange feeling. Although Veronika has died, but she still lives and inhabits Veronika. She explores, searching for the truth about her double life, and meets a strange puppeteer who somehow is a link between both girls.This film demands to be analyzed. Is it about being puppets in some enormous scheme of things? Like Descatres 'Demon Hypothesis'. Or about fate? Sacrifice, Love, a soul in two bodies? Political symbolism? Or is it simply about some mysterious dimension of the spiritual? The symbols can be interpreted in various ways successfully and more ambiguously is the end happy or sad? Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction uses light and shadow, and the atmospheric music, make \"Double Life\" a work of art. Metaphors about the inner states of the characters include: the stars and leaves, are the personalities of Weronika and Veronique one a dreamer, one down-to-earth. Kieslowski also used a minimalist approach to dialogue, often using pauses and silence that speak louder than the ordinary words.This bewitching tale of love, loss, and interconnected souls winds a spell around this film. Interpretion can be argued over endlessly. An exquisite jewel. A work for a gallery.",

She has a gift for music, and especially singing. She likes to apply a golden ring around her eye. She runs a lot. She is always breathless because of a heart defect that she is unaware of. She is searching for love. Veronique lives in France. She lost her mother as a kid. She has a gift for music, and she teaches it to young children. She likes to apply a golden ring around her eye. She runs a lot. She is always breathless because of a heart defect that has just been found out. She is searching for love. Weronika sees V\u00e9ronique in Krakow, the city she lives in. She stops in the middle of a place crowded with people demonstrating and riot squads. Her alter ego is getting on a bus which will take her back to France. Before the bus leaves, V\u00e9ronique has time to take pictures of the place and of Weronika, but she does not see her. During the first half-hour of the film, the subjective shots which represent Weronika's vision are unsteady, the fisheye angle twists the perspectives, until Weronika herself collapses, on the stage, among the music instruments and in front of the audience, in the middle of a song. After Weronika's death, we follow V\u00e9ronique. She is making love with a man, and, right after it, she feels an immense sadness. She says to her lover \u00ab It's as if I were grieving \u00bb but she is unable to explain why. She decides to give up on the concert she was preparing, the same concert, we can imagine, during which Weronika died. V\u00e9ronique follows her intuition, and Weronika's death prevents her from dying herself. In the school where V\u00e9ronique teaches, a man manipulates puppets for the children. He makes the puppet die and become a sort of angel. Later on, V\u00e9tonique receives an anonymous phone call, then she gets a lace in the mail, and then an audio tape thanks to which she finds the place from where the anonymous man sends his objects to her. She finds him in a bar in the Gare Saint Lazare in Paris. She recognizes the puppeteer. In a hotel, after they have made love, and confessed their love, she empties her purse on the bed because he wants to know her better. He looks at the photos she took during her trip in Eastern Europe. He says that she is pretty on the pictures. She notices Weronika for the first time. She starts to cry. Weeks, maybe months later, she wakes up in the middle of the night and finds her lover making a second puppet of herself. She asks why he made two puppets of her, and he says that it is because they get damaged. She manipulates one puppet, while the other is lying motionless. The puppeteer reads to her the first version of a tale he is writing about two women on two different continents who are in fact two versions of the same person. This focus on the puppets reminded me of an essay written by Furio Jesi on Rilke's poetry. Jesi writes: the doll, in its form, tragically announces to men that it is her, not them, who will survive in the Infinite. \u00bb. To me, the puppets are a reminder of the fate that awaits V\u00e9ronique as well, that is death. The two women will disappear in death but the two puppets will remain. There is a very important dreamlike dimension in the film which features a dwarf who is also a lawyer, an old exhibitionnist, conversations of secondary characters with no beginning and no end, a subjective shot of the dead Weronika being buried. The film is also very poetic. I think of two shots in particular: the two versions of the old lady crossing the screen, and the image of the old church reflected backwards in a plastic ball. To appreciate this film, you need to get rid of the need to understand and analyze everything, and accept the absurd side of reality. My sister saw the film with me, and at one point she said: \u00ab there is something in this film that is us. \u00bb That \u00ab something \u00bb can be defined as the atmosphere, the setting, the green and red colors. the light. Kieslowski's movie addresses that part of our brain that is the center of our emotions, of our sensations, and of the memories of those sensations. It remains with us like an old dream that we had forgotten.",
