            "content": "Robert De Niro is one of those actors that just melts into a role.  His performance as rapist, convict, and all-around not-a-very-nice fellow Max Cady is certainly one of his most memorable performances for its stamina, strength, and excessiveness.  The film by Martin Scorsece is a remake of the classic film starring Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck.  Although Scorsece keeps the spirit of the film intact, he does make some very modern changes. He changes the role of Sam Bowden and family from one of harmony to dysfunction.  No character is the epitome of a universal good, but rather flawed(very flawed) goodness.  Nick Nolte does a fine job as Bowden and Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis both give deep, emotional performances. The film is really a sea of emotion...most of that emotion being fear. Scorsece adds some arty touches with the camera, but it is his gritty style that really dominates the film's impact.  Scorsece also is ever the protector of film as he gives cameos to Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and Martin Balsam(all in the original film).  The other acting standout goes to Joe Don Baker as a hired private investigator.  But make no mistake....this is De Niro's film all the way.  He has some of the best lines as he harasses the Bowden family, terrorizes the Bowden family, and strips the Bowden family of all civility, pretense, and dignity.  This film is definitely a keeper!",

            "content": "The climaxes are emblematic of the differences between Scorcese's version and the original. In 1962, Mitchum was ordinary, ironic, sneaky. Peck was Peck. And the climax was quiet. Crickets chirped. There was no wind. Bodies crept around in black shadows or splashed together in shallow water. In this one, Nolte is a lawyer who has broken the code and DeNiro is his nemesis, tatooed, obscene, half his face burned off, a raving maniac. Not sinister, just absolutely loco. And the confrontation is situated in a howling gale, earsplitting noise, rushing rapids, the groan of fiberglass hull splitting on rocks, blood all over the place.I don't know that one version is in any objective sense better than the other, although I vastly prefer the earlier version. I liked Mitchum's character better. He was quite ordinary in an extraordinary way. But from the beginning DeNiro seems to overplay the role. His accent, redolent of grits and red-eye gravy, seems to sit uncomfortably on him (maybe he's played in too many New York movies), whereas Mitchum's sly Southern drawl comes out oh so naturally. And that sinister grin of Mitchum's is worth a dozen lessons at the Actor's Studio.But there is one scene in which DeNiro outdoes Mitchum in terms of sheer impact. It's when the wrecked houseboat is being swept out into the raging river with DeNiro shackled to a stanchion about to be drowned. DeNiro launches into this fit of screaming nonsense and singing gibberish hymns, insane in a way you'll never be. It's an explosive performance.Juliette Lewis is remarkable too. Her \"umms\" and \"ahhs\" and other hesitations fit her barely nubile personality exactly. Her scene with DeNiro in the mock Schwarzwald of the high school auditorium is impossible not to admire. Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange turn in professional performances, as do the other principal actors.I'm not sure why I like the earlier version better. Maybe because it was so awesomely simple a story compared to this one. There was good and there was evil. We all know the world doesn't work that way, but it's fascinating to watch a simple-minded tale being spun out like a well-told fairy story. This one invites us to think about things. Unlike Lori Martin in 1962, Juliette Lewis gets a temporary case of the hots for the well-read and manipulative ex-con. And unlike Peck in 1962, Nolte has committed sins. He held back information that might have helped his client, DeNiro, because he was convinced that DeNiro was guilty and should be put away. I can't figure out what Jessica Lange or the dog did, but everybody has to be redeemed anyway because of original sin. Scorcese's Catholicism may be showing.\nOverall, this is flashier in every respect than the original -- more guns, more blood, more \"force majeur\" -- and maybe that's part of the problem. At times it looks as much like pandering to an audience of kids raised on MTV's quick cuts and sexy bodies and on Sly Stallone's action movies. I mean that at times it felt like the movie was talking down to the audience.\nStill, it's an interesting movie in its own right. Not badly done. But I wish they'd stop pushing out remakes of classics. Leave well enough alone because otherwise you're liable to find yourself in Dante's Purgatorio.",

            "content": "To me, it's amazing that there's actually a place in North Carolina called Cape Fear, but it provides the perfect setting for this movie. Several years after attorney Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) defended convicted rapist Max Cady (Robert DeNiro), Cady gets out of jail and decides that Bowden didn't do a good job defending him. After Sam and Max meet each other a few times, Max starts getting crazier and crazier. After he tries to enter Sam's house, Sam and his family go into hiding at Cape Fear. Then, the terror really begins.Martin Scorsese brought a unique intensity to movies like \"Mean Streets\" and \"Taxi Driver\", but this is something completely different. Whereas his earlier movies simply made you identify with the characters, \"Cape Fear\" makes you both identify with the characters and find them unpleasant. Not only Max Cady, but also the Bowdens. They are never the \"ideal American family\", but Cady's threats against them make them get progressively nastier in their attitudes towards each other and to other people.I think that it's safe to say that after watching \"Cape Fear\", you will never look at any person the same way again.",

            "content": "Scorsese inherited this project from Steven Spielberg when the two swapped films.  Spielberg got Schindler's List and Scorsese got Cape Fear.  It would've been interesting to see how it would've turned out the other way around.  As it turns out, Cape Fear is a film that follows Scorsese's usual themes, mainly guilt.  Nick Nolte suffers from it, and Robert DeNiro helps to amplify the guilt.  He attacks Nolte indirectly, letting Nolte inflict the most damaging on himself.  In order to fight this loon, Nolte has to sink to his level, which is what DeNiro's Max Cady wanted. Scorsese's use of the camera is fluid and always moving.  Those slow zooms on Cady, the whip cuts from one scene to another and the whole end sequence is a doozy.  Bernard Herrman's great score is pumped through your speakers in Dolby sound and gives the film, a proper level of menace.  Watch this instead of \"The Fan.\"  You won't be disappointed.",

            "review_title": "A case of slicker and bigger not meaning better, but not a remake to be denounced",
            "content": "Not one of Martin Scorsese's best films by a long shot (though he has also done worse). This said, as said in my review for 'Hugo', even when Scorsese was not at his best the films in question were still better than the worst films of most. This is also coming from a director who when at his best, like with 'Goodfellas', 'Raging Bull' and 'Taxi Driver' for examples, gave some of the best films out there.'Cape Fear' is a remake of the 1962 film with Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum. While the remake may be slicker visually (the earlier film is still very well made instead, but Scorsese's film is gorgeously audacious) and be bigger and more expansive in its themes and character complexities, there is a vast personal preference for the more atmospheric, creepier and more eerie earlier film, one that didn't need excessive violence, gore or profanity to deliver the shocks, with an ending that was a masterclass in sexual tension and quivering fear and Mitchum unforgettably burning into the memory as how to haunt one's nightmares wile doing it in a much more subtle way.This is in no way denouncing Scorsese's film though. It is not as good (often very good though with major problems, while the 1962 film to me is a near-masterpiece let down only by the female characters not being as interesting) and perhaps not necessary. However, compared to how a lot of remakes have fared, which has seen abominations like the remakes for 'Psycho' and 'The Wicker Man' that should never have been made in the first place, it isn't halfway bad and hardly an amateur project.Where Scorsese does score over the 1962 film is in two things. One is the more expanded upon relationship between Cady and Danielle, which is genuinely disturbing and effectively makes the skin crawl as ought, it also further added to what was an already sadistic human monster (or shall we say psychopath?) like Cady. Even more so of an improvement is the portrayal of the Bowden family, instead of being humble and neatly black and white like it could have been (not knocking the 1962 film here) each member were portrayed as flawed characters with strengths and vulnerabilities, and much more of a family falling apart at the seams.Visually, 'Cape Fear' looks fantastic, the use of cinematic techniques not only dazzling in technical beauty but also adding a lot to the horror-like atmosphere rather than distracting. That is not surprising considering that it is the work of the great Freddie Francis, achieving great success with the likes of Amicus and Hammer. The film cleverly utilises Bernard Hermann's wonderful score from the 1962 film, arranged and conducted by Elmer Bernstein, there was the worry as to whether it would sound melodramatic, exaggerated and anachronistic in this particular film when it worked so brilliantly in the 1962 film, but it actually succeeded in giving the film a real eeriness and dramatic thrust and tension.A good deal of 'Cape Fear' is hugely entertaining. The first half in particular is rich in dreaded suspense and genuine entertainment. There are too scenes that chill the blood, like the scene between Cady and Lori and that between him and Kersek. Scorsese directs adeptly, often with a visual mastery, a knack of suspense and compelling character interaction.Robert De Niro's performance has been praised for being terrifying but also criticised for being over the top to the point of being a cartoon, both valid opinions. To me, while there is a much bigger preference for the creepier but more understated Mitchum and there are times where De Niro does fall into overdone parody, it is a very powerful and often scary performance in a fascinating, chilling and larger than life role, apart from the unstoppable Terminator-like traits in place bordering on the cartoonish. Nick Nolte does a very good job, bringing intensity and empathy to a morally ambiguous character that is written as much more than a heroic sort of role.Juliette Lewis' performance has also polarised viewers, again to me she was compelling in her rebellious attitude and sexual curiosity but also in the ability to think straight. Joe Don Baker is the standout in support and a casting highlight, a very strong performance. Having Peck and Mitchum (and Martin Balsam) in cameo roles the anti-thesis of their 1962 'Cape Fear' characters was a masterstroke.However, was not crazy about Jessica Lange, a very good actress. She didn't have an easy character to play, one with not a lot to do and one who seems to be in permanent shock and terror, but Lange both overdoes it and phones it in to the point that the character is annoying. While absorbing most of the time, especially in the first and second acts, a few of the Cady character building scenes did drag and go on for too long, 20-25 minutes trimming may have made things better.More problematic was that the thicker the story got the more excessive it got too. Especially suffering is the ridiculously unintentionally funny and illogical scene where Kersek's body is found and an ending that is ludicrously overblown and missing the suspense, sexual tension and quivering fear (plus that masterly improvisation touch with the egg) conveyed so unforgettably in the 1962 film. The violence did disturb a good deal, but at numerous times it didn't feel necessary, sometimes less-is-more and more atmosphere is better, and felt over-the-top, cartoony and more at place in a graphic cartoon or something.All in all, inferior but still surprisingly well done despite being a long way from perfect. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

But honestly, I watched \"Cape Fear\" because I bought \"The Simpsons\" 5th season on DVD, and I had no idea that the Sideshow Bob episode where he tries to kill Bart was based on this movie. So, I knew I had to rent this movie if it was good enough to parody on \"The Simpsons\". And it was very disturbing to watch. Robert DeNiro is one of my favorite actors, and he completely freaked me out in this film. Especially the scene between him and Juliette Lewis. Even though in some ways this film is done a little over the top, it all adds together very well. I was very impressed with this film and would recommend it to Martin Scorsesse fans of course. Even though I wouldn't say this was his best work, it is one of his best thrillers though.9/10",

            "content": "Even though Robert DeNiro was nominated for Best Actor for this Martin Scorsese directed remake of Cape Fear, my heart is still with the original. The multi-tattooed voluminous DeNiro is far less menacing than Robert Mitchum was in the original.One thing Scorsese did was change the billing to reflect the importance of the characters. Mitchum was billed second to Gregory Peck, the upright attorney who Mitchum threatened and stalked along with Peck's family. Then again Peck was producing the original Cape Fear so of course he was first billed. Part of the problem was that with some 20 to 30 minutes additional running time Scorsese used it to make his characters a bit more complex. DeNiro was a real basket case as Max Cady in this one whereas Robert Mitchum was just plain no good.Nick Nolte plays attorney Sam Bowden and he's also far more complex and not such a good guy. In the original film Peck was an attorney, but he was a witness in the trial that convicted Cady of rape. Here he was Cady's attorney and he tanked the case because Cady was such a psycho he deserved to be behind bars. Cady in fact does have a grudge of sorts against him. And it's not good to get a psycho mad at you.Also Peck and his whole family which consisted of Polly Bergen and Lori Martin back in the original was your basic all American white bread family. Their very wholesomeness made the scope of Mitchum stalking them all the more frightening.Nolte and Jessica Lange have marital problems and their daughter Juliette Lewis is not Mary Poppins. Not that they deserved what DeNiro was going to do to them, but it does blunt the impact of the scope of his evil.Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and Martin Balsam from the original cast all played supporting parts here. But while the film that Scorsese did is a good one, their presence made me all the more hunger for the original.",

            "content": "Martin Scorcese's filmography as director is one of the most accomplished in modern film history.  While Cape Fear can't even hold a candle next to \"Taxi Driver\", \"Raging Bull\" and \"Goodfellas\", it is still a fabulous remake of the 1962 noir classic and it keeps the viewer on the edge right through until the closing credits.Robert De Niro (in yet another brilliant teaming with Scorcese behind the camera) plays Max Cady, a psychopathic rapist who was sent to jail 14 years earlier for such crimes.  He leaves prison with vengeance.  Not for his victims or his prosecutor, but his defence councillor, Sam J. Bowden, played by Nick Nolte.  It seems Bowden did not defend Cady to the best of his ability.  Cady knows this and wants some payback.Cady's initial return into Bowden's life could not have come at a worse time.  Bowden has been forced to move his family to Florida after his infidelities threatened his marriage and career.  His wife is distrustful and worst of all, Bowden is on the verge of beginning another affair with a female workmate.  Added to that, his daughter is at the difficult age of 15.Almost by ozmosis, Cady understands these problems in the Bowden household and acts on them.  He begins terrorising Bowden and his whole family, taking it from one extreme to the next.What makes Cape Fear such a good film is the rapidly increasing sense of claustrophobia.  Scorcese makes a point of using almost only close up shots towards the end of the film.  It is a great touch that makes the viewer that much more scared as the film goes on.Along with that, Robert De Niro is superb as Cady.  Only occasionally does the role slip into parody.  Mostly he is expertly evil.Nick Nolte is good if not great, the same for Jessica Lange as Leigh Bowden. It seems as if they were void of any great lines in this film, which is unfortunate given their immense talent.  Julliette Lewis is absolutely brilliant as the young daughter, Danielle.  She slips effortlessly between curious sexual awakenings, rebellious teen and straight thinking woman.  Add in small roles for Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck (the leads of the 1962 version) and you have a great ensemble cast.So not the best Scorcese film ever, but some tight editing, great camerawork, a haunting theme and devilishly over-the-top  acting help make this a frighteningly fun movie to watch.

            "content": "This brutal, violent and suspenseful thriller combines a scorching performance by Robert Deniro, sumptuous location photography, and a powerful script that raises disturbing questions about religion, sex, and class distinctions in our so-called classless society.At first glance Max Cady seems to be just another creep, a rapist and convict out to torment and humiliate a nice, upper-middle class family. \"He's an ex-con,\" yuppie lawyer Sam Bowden smugly says, with fatuous self-satisfaction. But gradually it becomes apparent that things are not what they seem. The wholesome, \"superior\" middle class family is rotten with corruption, while the vicious, \"psychotic\" ex-con is a man of extraordinary courage, intelligence, and spiritual strength. Even his most horrible acts of violence are connected to the corrupt and self-serving behavior of his \"betters.\" What makes this movie work so well is that director Martin Scorsese breaks away from his usual mean streets milieu. If Max Cady had been an Italian wise guy, the movie would have made excuses for him. The outcome would have been predictable. But here the great director remains an impartial observer of criminal behavior, rather than a sentimental apologist for ethnic violence. (As in GANGS OF NEW YORK.) Max Cady is pure evil, but he speaks the truth about the evil of allowing class distinctions to flourish in a so-called \"democracy.\" When it came out, this movie was reviled by critics, especially by effete yuppies like Terence Rafferty at GQ and VANITY FAIR. Most of them whined about the violence, but it was painfully clear that what really disturbed them was the possibility that an ugly ex-con really could be smarter, tougher, and more virtuous than a spoiled yuppie lawyer.Shocking!!!",

            "content": "Cape Fear (1991) **** (out of 4) Martin Scorsese's remake of the 1962 Gregory Peck/Robert Mitchum thriller has a flaw here and there but overall I feel it's one of the best of its kind and the director's most underrated film. Robert DeNiro plays the crazy ex-con out to seek revenge on the lawyer (Nick Nolte) who he feels misrepresented him. This was the first Scorsese/DeNiro film I ever watched and it made me the die-hard fan I am today. I saw this thing four times in the theater and only God knows how many times since then but it remains one of my favorite thrillers as I feel the director hits all the right notes when it comes to the suspense but he also sprinkles in some very dark humor as well. DeNiro is simply wonderful in his role and comes off very threatening and at times downright scary. Nolte and Jessica Lange also turn in strong performances as does Juliette Lewis. Peck, Mitchum, Martin Balsam and Joe Don Baker also add great support. It's strange but I still remember the four screenings of this in the theater and I remember them quite vividly. I still remember all the suspense and terror that was running throughout the theater and all of this came back as I picked this film to show my buddy and our dates. The film went over very well with them but it also worked extremely well for me even after all these viewings. The stakeout scene towards the end remains one of the most suspenseful scenes from any movie I've seen but there's also the equally disturbing scene where DeNiro goes to visit Lewis at school. I also gave the original film four stars but overall I prefer this remake. The original was pretty much good guy Peck versus bad guy Mitchum, which was a lot of fun but I like the changes made to the story here. We've got the evil DeNiro against the bad boy Nolte. I like the fact that Nolte's character wasn't very likable and I enjoyed the changes that made the wife and daughter connect to DeNiro's character. The level of strong characters in classic Scorsese film's in here to be seen and with the strong performances this just adds to the overall greatness.",

De Niro's cigar-chomping, sneering performance would be a highlight under different circumstances, yet he's used here as the ultimate bogeyman, hiding under a moving car or springing up like the killer in \"Halloween\". Scorsese revels in the opportunity to show an ordinary, wholesome family being dragged down into the gutter by a savage beast of a man, but the picture is really ungainly. One neat touch: the stars of the original version, Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam, appear in cameos (Peck and Mitchum cast amusingly against type).

After 14 years in jail, Max Cady is released and goes back to New Essex to seek revenge on Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), his attorney at the public defendor's office back then when he was convicted.  Now, I can't tell you why he seeks revenge on Bowden without spoiling the plot of the movie. However, I can tell you that De Niro is excellent and that Nolte, Jessica Lange, Juliette Lewis, and surprisingly enough, Joe Don Baker, are very good as well.

I was only a kid back then, but even after all these years I felt again that this movie gives great doze of fear. Mostly it is because of brilliant portrayal coming from Robert De Niro (Max Cady is definitely not kind of guy who you wanna meet) and great Martin Scorsese ability to 'manufacture' terrifying scenes (for example when Nolte is hiding behind trash cans and when De Niro says: 'Counselor, could you be there?' - that one reminded me of Walter Hill's \"The Warriors\" and Luther in the same movie). Scorsese + De Niro (his all time favorite) never fails to deliver when they have as good script as this. Here, there is relationship between lawyers and clients, parents and children; also law in America is comprehended, where are holes in system, what can or cannot man do to protect his family and so on. I also read some of the comments that compare this one with the original and spits on this movie. To those people I say that this is an Oscar winning picture for some remakes I have seen in my life.

Revenge, retribution, manipulation. Marty's usual laying on of the Karo syrup. But unfortunately somewhere in Universal's high-rise a memorandum came down: everyone ham it up.Nolte only speaks with eyebrows raised, Lange bitches her way through cigarettes, Lewis \"Ohmagod's!\" her way though her scenes, and Bobby D...well, he's on a whole other magic carpet. Affecting some sort of Cajun/Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid, he chomps fat cigars and cackles at random atrocities such as \"Problem Child\". And I want you to imagine the accent mentioned above. Now imagine it spouting brain-clanging religious rhetoric at top volume like he swallowed six bibles, and you have De Niro's schtick here. Most distracting of all, though, is his most OVERDONE use of the \"De Niro face\" he's so lampooned for. Eyes squinting, forehead crinkled, lips curled. Crimany, Bob, you looked like Plastic Man.The story apparently began off-screen 14 years earlier, when Nolte was unable to spare De Niro time in the bighouse for various assaults. Upon release, he feels Nolte's misrep of him back then warrants the terrorizing of he and his kin. And we're supposed to give De Niro's character a slight pass because Nolte withheld information that might've shortened his sentence. De Niro being one of these criminals who, despite being guilty of unspeakable acts, feels his lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts on the outside. Mmm-kay.He goes after Notle's near-mistress (in a scene some may want to turn away from), his wife, his daughter, the family dog, ya know. Which is one of the shortcomings of Wesley Strick's screenplay: utter predictability. As each of De Niro's harassments becomes more gruesome, you can pretty much call the rest of the action before it happens. Strick isn't to be totally discredited, as he manages a few compelling dialogue-driven moments (De Niro and Lewis' seedy exchange in an empty theater is the film's best scene), but mostly it's all over-cranked. Scorsese's cartoonish photographic approach comes off as forced, not to mention the HORRIBLY outdated re-worked Bernard Hermann score (I kept waiting for the Wolf Man to show up with a genetically enlarged tarantula).Thus we arrive at the comedic portion of the flick. Unintentionally comedic, that is. You know those scenes where something graphically horrific is happening, but you can't help but snicker out of sight of others? You'll do it here. Nolte and Lange squawking about infidelity, De Niro's thumb-flirting, he cross-dressing, and a kitchen slip on a certain substance that has to be seen to believed. And Bob's infernal, incessant, CONSTANT, mind-damaging, no-end-in sight blowhard ramblings of all the \"philosophy\" he disovered in prison. I wanted him killed to shut him up more than to save this annoying family.I always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers, but here it's necessary. This really *is* Scorsese's version of Freddy Krueger. The manner in which De Niro relishes, speaks, stalks, withstands pain, right down to his one-liners, is vintage Freddy. Upon being scalded by a pot of thrown water: \"You trying' to offer sumpin' hot?\" Please. And that's just one example.Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 flick and want a thrill out of seeing Balsam, Peck, and Mitchum nearly 30 years later (or want a serious head-shaking film experience), avoid a trip to the Cape.",

            "content": "When it was released in 1991 GMTV film reviewer Paul Gambacini described Scorsese's CAPE FEAR as \" being ham directed \" . This is yet more evidence that if you want to be a film reviewer it's not what you know , it's who you know . CAPE FEAR isn't a film that suffers from \" ham directing \" , it's a film that is rather formalist and suffers from what David Bordwell describes as \" intensified continuity \" . If you're unfamiliar with the term then please look it up and Scorsese wasn't the only American director using the technique because many other directors especially Oliver Stone were doing exactly the same thing in the early 1990s . If Scorsese is to be criticised for doing this then the entire American film industry is equally guilty If there is a problem with intensified continuity it's that most directors quickly abandoned it with the exception of Oliver Stone which meant he was destined to cinematic obscurity . Watching these type of films in 2007 means they appear rather dated , similar in some ways to watching films from the mid 1980s where you realise the most important aspect is the soundtrackCAPE FEAR is a fairly entertaining movie but can't be described as a Scorsese masterpiece . DeNiro gives a rather OTT performance as Max Cady , so much so that you find yourself thinking of him as a comic book monster rather than as a real life character . Interestingly enough Scorsese is a director who can be described as misogynistic but by far the two best performances are by Lang and Lewis The one problem I have with the movie is that it mainly ignores the inadequacy of the law when it comes to stalking . Check the scene where Bowden explains to Lt Elgart that Cady hasn't \" been trespassing exactly - Well what exactly ? \" . The film would have worked much better and would undoubtedly have been much more credible if this angle had been developed more , but credibility has been sacrificed for entertainment and whilst not a heavy criticism it does make for a flawed movie",

While I can not truthfully say the original was better due to the fact that I never saw the original, I have a feeling that Scorsese has brought his maestro touch to the film that changes it slightly from the original to make it better, because this is quite the suspenser.Here, a very dangerous and evil man named Max Cady (played in one of the best villain roles of the 90's by Robert De Niro) gets out of jail after 14 years of imprisonment, and decides to get vengeance on the lawyer (Nick Nolte) and his family (Jessica Lange the mother and a young and supple Juliette Lewis as the daughter).  At times the film is surprisingly slow, but the film is never boring, and suspense is always in the air; the climax/ending contains some of Scorsese and De Niro's finest work.  Also, De Niro steals the show as the animal Cady by making the person who is supposed to be the hero into a flawed character, thereby turning the film almost into a Film-noir, which is quite a feat for Scorsese and company.  Not perfect, but it shouldn't be.  Those are Scorsese's parents briefly buying fruit. A-",

He takes the great (and sexy) Jessica Lange and turns her a shrill, screaming annoyance. Nolte, strong movie bad ass, is turned into a weak (most of the time), dumb (almost all the time) movie bad ass. And legendary DeNiro is somehow over-the-top and uninteresting at the same time.

And for some reason, there seems to be even more of a desire to do so with the two \"Cape Fear\" films. By pure coincidence, I happened to watch the original on cable (I don't believe I had ever seen it), and just 2 weeks later the 1991 version was on cable.I have always had a great deal of respect for the body of work of Gregory Peck. And while I don't think that Nick Nolte's body of work compares, this film was in what I consider to be Nolte's most productive period. With Robert Mitchum, I didn't always like the roles he chose, but he, too, had many admirable performances. Robert DeNiro was not a favorite of mine in his early years, by the time this film was made, I was really beginning to respect his work. So, my comparison has little to do with whether or not I like the lead actors, I like them all. But then there is Polly Bergen, not a favorite of mine, though I also didn't dislike her performances. In 1991 it was Jessica Lange, also not one of my favorites.But let's get the point -- I strongly preferred the 1962 film. And here's why (not in any particular order):1. I liked the feel of the old South in the 1962 film, which is virtually absent in most of the 1991 film. 2. I admired the restraint and subtlety with which Robert Mitchum approached his role in the original, far more than the over-the-top nature of Robert DeNiro's performance (which is unusual for DeNiro). 3. Gregory Peck was the pillar of virtue in the first film, all the better to draw a distinct line between him and Mitchum. But Nolte is a compromised (though successful) lawyer. The line is blurred. 4. The rape scene in the original was tragic, but eating part of a woman's face is way too far over the top in the later film. 5. The wife in the latter film is emotionally damaged to the point where the viewer feels little sympathy for her. 6. Even the daughter in the later film gets no sympathy here...she's too far along in her sexuality, where the daughter in the early film was almost prepubescent, in practice, if not physicality. 7. The one thing that the newer film has in its favor is a very strong performance by Nick Nolte. It's not better than the Gregory Peck performance, but it is Nolte at his peak before the long slide. 8. The Cape Fear island locale of the ending of the first film was far more spooky than the family house in the second film. 9. It was nice seeing Gregory Peck (this time as a bad guy), Robert Mitchum (this time as a good guy), and Martin Balsam in supporting roles here. But Mitchum and Peck are in roles that just don't fit them. 10. In the first film, there was building suspense throughout the film. Here, the real suspense only comes toward the end of the film. 11. In the original film, violence was used as needed. Here the violence is excessive and over-the-top in order to thrill the audience. 12. The husband and wife sliding around in the blood in this film was simply childish excess. 13. The final insult to our intelligence in this film is that the family all lived despite the violent storm where the boat was destroyed and sank. Trash. Just trash.The original -- Robert Mitchum's masterpiece, This remake -- just tawdry excess. And my respect for everyone connected with it is just a little less after seeing it again after all these years.",

Don't even get me started on Juliette 'Willing to go down on the director as I have absolutely NO talent whatsoever' Lewis.

Meanwhile, Max Cady/De Niro plays to cat and mouse with his family which is increasingly menaced .This exciting film with interesting screenplay by Wesley Strick contains psychological characterization , grisly triller , tense situations and is pretty entertaining , though overlong . It's brilliant , atmospheric and slickly developed , almost a masterpiece . Phenomenal and artistic main titles by Saul Bass , Hitchcock's usual . Lavishly produced by the great Steven Spielberg and Barbara De Fina , Scorsese's ordinary producer . Awesome performance from De Niro as a self-educated wacko with ominous purports , though sometimes hands the role overblown and overacting way . Major asset are the continuous suspense and marvelous acting though at the ending becomes into an unbelievable terror film . Casting is frankly awesome with exceptional performances, especially by Nolte as a wily advocate at law , Jessica Lange as suffering wife and Joe Don Baker as a tough eye-private . Brief star cameos by Gregory Peck , Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam who starred the classical version (1962) by J. Lee Thompson and screenplay by James R. Webb , still daring for his time . Musical score by Elmer Berstein based on the soundtrack composed by the master Bernard Herrmann with a similar style from Hitchcock music films . Sensational and colorful cinematography in Panavision by the excellent and veteran British cameraman Freddie Francis . The motion picture is splendidly directed by Martin Scorsese , one of the best contemporary filmmakers . It's a must see for Robert De Niro and Nick Nolte fans.

While all the elements of that original are indeed here in this remake, the new elements that director Martin Scorsese adds to the tale only cheapen that visceral sense of terror.For a basic plot summary, \"Cape Fear\" tells the story of lawyer Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), wife Leigh (Jessica Lange), and daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). When Max Cady (Robert De Niro), an ex-con freshly released from prison who was unsuccessfully defended by Sam, begins to terrorize the family, they must make some difficult decisions in order to deal with such a terror.All the basic elements of the classic Peck/Mitchum thriller are present in this version of the tale, but its the new elements that downgrade the experience. I realize that Scorsese wanted to be his own little twist on the story, but unfortunately all the additions are negative rather than positive:For example (spoilers included):-Making the family a \"troubled unit\" does no service to the plot. Gregory Peck as the stout, unshakeable lawyer is better than Nolte's more ambiguous soul.-The subtle romantic hints between Danielle and Cady are utterly ridiculous. For this story to really work, the daughter character needs to be pure as the driven snow, not on the verge of being roped into a romantic relationship with him! Of all the changes made to the original in this effect, I found this change to be the most \"unforgivable\".Finally, though no fault of anyone's, the performance of Robert Mitchum in the 1962 version is un-matchable (e.g. iconic). De Niro gives it his best effort, but it just isn't quite as good.Overall, then, I will be steering people AWAY from this version and TOWARDS the original after this viewing.

Perhaps the new version's morally-complex screenplay and dynamic cinematography highlight the fact that the old Cape Fear is a bit static and, well, dull.That's not to say the new version is perfect. The afore-mentioned cinematography, while unsettling at first (especially DeNiro virtually walking through the camera), eventually grates. Why do we need to see extreme close-ups and dramatic zooms of locks being closed?In fact, it is bizarre that the parts of the film not set in Cape Fear are by far the best, what with the genuinely weird death of the private investigator and the 'I don't whether to look at him or read him' line from Robert Mitchum. It is in the final twenty minutes that the viewer is left numbed and ultimately tired at the 'kill the b**tard!' histronics the film endlessly subjects us to.Despite all this, the ultimate compliment is perhaps that The Simpsons chose to parody this version rather than the 1962 version!",

The acting from all including the great DeNiro is appalling.  All the elements of bad film making culminate in producing an atrociously poor movie.The scene where DeNiro is beaten with chains, Iron bars, etc then just gets up and, of course is perfectly ok, beats up all the attackers.  Has this film become Superman V or T3, he would have had every bone in his body broken, not to mention internal bleeding but that doesn't matter, this is a Scorsese film, it must have a hidden genius.I wish people would watch films and give an honest impression of what they see even if their opinion isn't popular.

I was a teenage girl at the time and it was quite a shocking experience to feel attracted to the masculine magnetism of Robert Mitchum as Max Cady while knowing his character was a dangerous violent rapist. It got me thinking whether I would be smart and strong enough not to play with fire if I came face to face with somebody oozing the same kind of overwhelming sexiness as Robert Mitchum in this movie, even if I felt at the same time the hidden menace emanating from him, like from Mitchum's Max Cady in every scene. I didn't know the answer to that question and it scared the hell out of me.The original was scary, because it brought the menace so close psychologically. You didn't know where Max Cady was going to show up, in the big chase scene you didn't know for sure whether it was really Cady or just somebody harmless after the girl and you didn't know whether he was going to find his way to the family in their hideaway and how he'd find them.The remake on the other hand was bad from the start. The first scene with overly tattooed and crazy-eyed Robert De Niro training in his cell already got me thinking that the movie was going to go from bad to worse. De Niro's Max Cady was a one-dimensional overly obviously crazy and dangerous guy with little or no sex appeal. He was so over the top stereotyped cartoon bad guy that it was laughable, not menacing. And what's with the hanging under the car scene? Can a scene be any more unnecessary than that? A huge part of the scariness of scary movies is that you don't know how and where the monster will appear. And Scorsese tells us exactly how the bogeyman gets to the hideaway. The mistake of telling how the bad guy gets to the hideaway could still have been excusable if the movie makers hadn't chosen such an unrealistic way of transportation for Max Cady. I mean, hanging under the car for several miles? Are you kidding me? Did Scorsese really expect the viewers to buy into the concept? Nick Nolte and his family were all unlikeable people, so I found myself wondering why I should sympathize with those people. I'm not a big fan of Juliette Lewis anyway and with her voluntary flirting with the unattractive De Niro and her dysfunctional family relationships it was difficult to believe that her father would be willing to go to extremes to protect her. No, it felt like it wasn't about protecting the family, it was a pissing contest between Nolte and De Niro, about which guy was the toughest and baddest. Nolte cared less about keeping his daughter and wife safe from a violent rapist than he cared about one-upping De Niro by making sure he wouldn't get to mess with what was Nolte's.All in all, a movie not worth all the hype it got when released.",

The movie does have graphic violence, but it is not overdone--only enough to show the true mental state of Max Cady (De Niro).

Thrillers should be subtle unless you want to make them a completely dumbed-down slasher movie. Presumably Scorsese wanted to do just that. He certainly succeeded. The film uses every corny technique to scare the viewer and completely fails.The acting is terrible, the dialogue worse, the cinematography and editing unimaginative, the soundtrack annoying and the characterisation crude.If I had not had to watch this film for a course on film history, I would have stopped after 15 minutes.

Unhappy at losing fourteen years of his life unnecessarily Max sets out to get even, he rapes one of Sam's co-workers, he harasses him at every opportunity yet remains within the confines of the law & Max threatens Sam's family including poisoning their dog. Sam has nowhere left to turn, the police can't do anything & he fears for his own & his family's lives...Directed by Martin Scorsese this is a remake of the original Cape Fear (1962) & while I admit I have never seen the original I thought this was a decent enough film. The script by Wesley Strick was based on the novel 'The Executioners' by John D. MacDonald & is a psychological thriller that is maybe a touch long at over two hours but entertains, has a good solid story, good character's & an edgy feel to it throughout. A lot of the film is spent showing how clever Cady is, how he can use the limits of the law to harass & threaten the Bowden family knowing the law can't touch him, it tires to point out the inadequacies of the law & that intent isn't taken into consideration. Then it tries to say that taking the law into your own hands is the only option, which of course it isn't but you can't really blame the Bowden's. Then the climax is a big Hollywood action set-piece on a boat that is out of control during a fierce storm. The film works well enough, it comes together nicely, the character's & dialogue are fine & it's reasonably logical. A good if unspectacular thriller that probably goes on for twenty odd minutes too long.Apparently Steven Spielberg was set to direct this but never & ended up as an executive producer on it. The film looks nice enough, there are lots of close-ups & some strange camera angles which give the film a bit of style. The violence isn't too graphic, there's some fights, a rape where Cady bites a chunk out of his victims cheek & there's some blood splatter as well. Director Scorsese apparently wanted Harrison Ford to play Bowden but I guess he didn't want to do it while the likes of Drew Barrymore & Reese Witherspoon both auditioned for the role of Danielle.With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 this has good production values although some of the model shots of the boat at the end aren't that impressive. The acting is good, Robert De Niro is just watchable no matter what he is in while Nolte puts in a good performance too. Three cast members who appeared in the 1962 original, Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum & Martin Balsam all have small roles in this remake.Cape Fear is a good solid psycho thriller remake that maybe goes on for a bit too long & outstays it's welcome but is worth watching all the same.",

De Niro and company apparently believed that all of today's adults have regressed to the infantile when they decided to do this remake.

I found some dark humor in the Max Cady dialogue at the time which added to my enjoyment but now I don't even find the same humor in it.

Whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come.\" \u2013 Robert De Niro\"Cape Fear\" (1991), a remake of a memorable 1962 film by the same name, was initially a project for Steven Spielberg, the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay (which was based on \"The Executioners\", a classic thriller novel written by John D. MacDonald) so that it more suited his themes and preoccupations. And so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison Robert De Niro. Like \"Jurassic Park\", \"Poltergeist\" and \"War of the Worlds\", the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast, the beast being the creation of the father, a lawyer who failed to defend De Niro during his trial. In typical Spielberg fashion, the father slays the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and virtually every \"daddy\" figure in Spielbergland, the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that Spielberg so enjoys.But Spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to Martin Scorsese, who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare. The result is one of Scorsese's worst pictures. But an artist's misfires are often very revealing. When the story doesn't work, the characters don't connect or the images don't sear, we find ourselves gazing at a kind of naked wreckage; the broken wheels inside the machine. This broken machinery is often what the director's cinema is about, you just don't notice it when the ride's working.\"Cape Fear's\" an impersonal film, so it only faintly echoes Scorsese's thematic obsessions (\"You already sacrificed me!\" De Niro yells, but the film's themes of sin, guilt and Catholic redemption are cookie cutter). But what the film does, though, is expose the kind of language that Scorsese's filmography hinges on. Watch how Scorsese's camera desperately darts back and forth, how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to whip up excitement, and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention. There's a crass, sensationalism to Scorsese. A desperation. A feeling that the neo-realist movement just wasn't fun enough, wasn't explosive enough, without an injection of some near-pornographic mania. But more importantly, watch how the film makes no spatial sense. A showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound-stage, a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family's house doesn't seem to exist anywhere in particular. There is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture, Scorsese unable to film space or cook up any sense of a tangible, spatial environment. The reason for this is that Scorsese's camera always has to be bound to his central character. Resnais can take you around a French Hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building, but Scorsese can't do this. There's no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his films. He's all about the character. Volatile characters who you sense are created simply to fight for your attention. And you break that tether, you leave that boxing ring, that taxi cab, you look away from De Niro, and everything collapses. Scorsese simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting, which is fine, but in a way it also means he is incapable of being the kind of \"action\" film-maker this screenplay of \"Cape Fear\" required.Incidentally, Scorsese tried to rectify this problem with \"Gangs of New York\", where the space and the sets become the central character, but even this self-consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis, the actor drawing Scorsese's camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb.5/10 \u2013 A silly, poorly shot B-movie. Still, we have Robert De Niro to pick up the slack. De Niro, who gives his body over to Scorsese like a tattooed Christ, gives the film its only great scene. In an improvised sequence with a young Juliette Lewis, he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her. A kind of symbolic rape, lauded by in-the-closet paedophiles, the scene ends with the girl running away, both aroused and repelled by the ugly man's interest. Unfortunately, De Niro's Big Bad Wolf performance can't be imitated by Scorsese. You'd need the operatic, comically baroque visuals of someone like De Palma to make this work. But Scorsese? Nope. Worth one viewing.",

Nick Nolte  plays Sam Bowden, Cady's lawyer who intentionally buried a valuable  document, which may have allowed Cady's prison sentence to be  significantly shorter. Cady learns to read while in prison. He starts  with 'See Spot Run,' then proceeds to study law books. Cady's rage and  desire for revenge grows with each additional day that he is in prison.  Although Cady's original prison sentence was only eight years, it is  increased to fourteen years due to battery of another inmate. He  memorizes the Bible and tattoos his body with scripture referring to  vengeance. When Cady is finally released from prison, he immediately  seeks out Bowden and his family. Cady has become a scripture slinging  psychopath hell bent on revenge. The director Martin Scorsese is  attempting to prove that everyone has skeletons in their closet. Bowden  might appear to be a terrific lawyer and loving family man on the  surface, but underneath the perfect image lies a cheating husband and  corrupt lawyer. Scorsese also shows how powerful the emotion of revenge  can be and how it can distort ones version of what is right and wrong.  Scorsese demonstrates this by showing Cady's knowledge of scripture and  his acceptance of the terror that he is inflicting on the Bowden  family. Scorsese's use of cameo appearances by Robert Mithcum and  Gregory Peck was brilliant. The fact that they played such opposite  roles in the original film was an interesting twist. I enjoyed the  original 1962 version more than this remake, but I feel that the blood  being in color definitely added to the terror that this film inflicts.",

It was a movie that set the standards for most later thrillers and featured Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum still in their prime. How was a remake ever going to surpass the original? Martin Scorsese really pulled this off! He makes \"Cape Fear\" an haunting atmospheric thriller that still is one of THE best in its genre.\"Cape Fear\" is a real psychological thriller. It doesn't rely on scares or anything like that but more on its atmosphere. It's a very insecure- and therefor also really an unpleasant atmosphere, since you just don't know what is going to happen next and what the Cady character actually tries to achieve. It's a real unpredictable character, that is capable of anything. You're just waiting for him to explode!It also definitely helps the movie that evil Max Cady character is being played by Robert De Niro. He has played some tough gangsters in his career but none of them can match up to Max Cady. It's a real monster, who sends shivers down your spine. The way he makes the Bowden's life miserable is clever, totally evil and actually scary. On top of that it all also feels very realistic. Nothing feels overdone and it feels like this also really could happen in the real world.Too bad that in the end the movie turns into a sort of 'monster'-movie, with the villain reemerging time after time and when he can't seem to feel any pain. It's perhaps the only mistake the movie makes and the only lesser part of the movie, although the ending still remains an exciting and tense one. Something the 1962 version lacked.The movie is also very moody with a great visual style. Scorsese uses a lot of (old) classy tricks, that provide the movie with a great style and atmosphere. The atmospheric cinematography is from horror expert Freddie Francis, who knows how to create a chilling, haunted mood.It was a great movie that they decided to re-use the musical score from the original, by genre-expert Bernard Herrmann. But then again, why should you replace a perfect score? It suits the movie perfectly and truly enhances the atmosphere.Not only De Niro is memorable in his role, basically every character in this movie gives a fantastic performances. The movie features some of the best ensemble acting you'll ever see in a movie. Every actor gives one of the best performances out of their careers. Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Juliette Lewis, Joe Don Baker, all are absolutely great and they're even better together. It shows what a great actor-director Scorsese also is. He brings out the best of every actor. I mean for instance, in which other movie did Juliette Lewis ever give an Oscar worthy performance? Also a nice touch that a couple of actors from the original version make a cameo appearance in this movie and they are not the least; Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck and also Martin Balsam. Robert Mitchum's part was actually quite big and he shows that he still had it in him. Peck's cameo is mostly fun as Cady's lawyer. Obviously he got that particular role for playing in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\". It was great to see him in a courtroom sequence again.Perhaps Scorsese's most commercial movies but also definitely one among his best. \"Cape Fear\" is an haunting and memorable movie and should should be a reminder movie-makers of this present day how to make a good genre movie. This movie is definitely still among the best in its genre and is filled with a couple of classic sequences and one classic performance of De Niro.

I found myself watching this movie for a second time, and not quite sure why I did see it again. It might have been for the actors in it, or the Hitchcock-like style of it, but most likely, it was just because I remembered that Juliette Lewis is in it... and she's every bit as talented as she was in later films. Truth be told, the movie just isn't really that impressive. The direction is sub-par for Scorsese, the acting is below common expectations for Nolte and De Niro and the pacing is dire. The directorial style shows inspiration from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Normally I would immediately say that this is a good thing, but Scorsese misuses the suspense-building elements that Hitchcock used to great effect in his films... and thereby ruins a lot of needed intensity. A good bit of the music(if not all of it) is also inspired of Hitchcock... this isn't all bad, but there are scenes where it seems completely out of place. The movie has some good scenes, but they are few and far between. I barely paid attention to the film on my second viewing... that says something about how meandering, overlong and slow it is. Just when you think it's about to end, it goes on. And on. And on. The narration is somewhat flat, despite Lewis' talent. The acting isn't particularly impressive, compared to what De Niro(who should be restrained, physically, if necessary, from ever attempting a Southern accent again) and Nolte has done in the past. The direction isn't anything special for Scorsese. All in all, this is OK for a thriller, but not something you'll want to watch more than once. I recommend this to fans of Scorsese, De Niro, Nolte and, to a lesser extent, Lewis. Big fans of Hitchcock should probably avoid this, though. I won't say that Scorsese taints his overall body of work... but it's close. 7/10",

It is the same role, for the same script, in the (presumably) same movie. The fault might not be entirely the actors'; yet I have chosen roles that require much of the actors' thought and creation, so that the roles' success or fall may be safely attributed to the performances' qualities. Some of the difference might come from the creative visions of the directors, etc., from the remakes' concepts \u0085--yet a lot must be attributed to the actors' individual aptitudes. Mitchum's performance as Cady is one of the subtlest in cinema's history\u0097and of the most ambiguous and enigmatic as well \u0085--while De Niro' s role is inexcusably bad, crassly bad, beyond any justification. This shows who De Niro is besides Mitchum, who Pacino is besides Vittorio Gassman,and who is Lemmon besides the (quite related, otherwise, and not so dissimilar) Fonda. (The order of the viewings does not interfere the judgment\u0097I have seen De Niro and Lemmon first, before the Mitchum and Fonda versions.)

Indeed a classic art, of a refined plenitude, that never ceases to delight. Why did he later changed, and his roles began to repeat the same gruesome psychopath? Even otherwise very good, very delightful performances are nonetheless stained by this routine\u0097one of the best actors ever transformed into a clich\u00e9\u0097in a parenthesis, I will remark that the same thing was said about other three actors\u0097Fresnay ,Jouvet and March.I cherish RDN since the first time I saw one of his movies. When I was a teenager, I was still able to enjoy the crap of the crap. I mean, his \"Cady\".Is he aware of his decline? Does he know he is no longer a great actor?There are others who have made many very bad roles\u0097yet they never stopped being great actors.Is this what Hollywood did to actors like RDN, Hopkins, Pacino, or what they did to themselves?Who's to blame?When he does a bad role, Hopkins is banal, ordinary; but RDN is very bad,very low.Penn knows how to be a brute, or at least how to look like one. But RDN turns this into a machine, into a clich\u00e9. He turned playing a villain into something very mechanical, very machine-like, a mere machinery\u0097it is obvious he does not like them. Where is the very pure drawing of his best performances?",

            "content": "This is probably the only movie where I can say that the remake was better than the original.  Scorcese took a good script and made it a very good script.  The important change that he made was having Max seek vengeance on his lawyer, who did not present all the evidence to the judge, instead of the juror.  This made it a much more interesting story.     Another thing Scorcese added to the script was having Cady be very well read. All throughout the movie Cady quotes from all classic literature which, for some reason, made it a more interesting story.  A third thing that Scorcese changed was the girl that Cady beat up. In the original, she wouldn't testify because Cady threatened her.  In the remake, she wouldn't testify because she \"new the system\", and understood that she would be attacked by a lawyer, on the stand.  This also made it seem more interesting and believable than the original.        The acting was great, especially deniro, and Nolte played a pretty good, modified, role (In the remake Sam Bowden is more fearful of Cady than the original, that's why I say a modified role).  Though this movie wouldnt make my top 5 Scorcese films, it is still a very good movie.  If you have to pick between viewing the original and this, go for this movie.  It's more interesting, with an improved script",

I just saw this one again and I have to tell you, I'd be hard pressed to come up with a more despicable screen villain than De Niro's Max Cady, who oozes malevolence in every scene he appears in. I'd really have to catch the 1962 picture again to see if Mitchum's take on the character is a vile as De Niro's, though reading my review of that film, I'd have to guess they were about even. But wow, Max Cady here is as psychotic as they come, and has an answer or solution for every roadblock that comes his way. For her part, Juliette Lewis puts in a stellar performance as Danny Bowden, daughter of attorney Sam (Nolte), who along with her father and mother (Jessica Lange), become targets of Cady's wrath and retribution for a legal case gone wrong fourteen years earlier. It's no wonder that both De Niro and Lewis received Oscar noms for their portrayals. For fans of the original screen version, Peck and Mitchum are both cast in the story as different characters on the side of the law. I'd like to think that Peck's character, Lee Heller, was a nod to his role as an attorney in one of my all time favorite films, \"To Kill a Mockingbird\".

By the way, Mitchum and director J. Lee Thompson showed you can still come across the screen as a nastier villain without the profanity. Scorcese hasn't figured that out, yet, insisting of 200-300 f-words in many of his gangster films following this one. In 'The Departed,\" which shamefully won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2006, all the characters use the f-word almost every sentence, not just the crooks.This is a scary movie and an entertaining one to the secular world but a sickening display of anti-Christianity to anyone else, or anyone who sees hatred and bigotry for what it is.",

            "content": "While I can't deny that his movies are often entertaining, I have always personally felt that Martin Scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities. His use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream \"Look at me, aren't I an imaginative director?\". His best film that I have seen is the one with the least added flourishes, the superlative \"Raging Bull\".For this remake it appears it was business as usual, though. The dull film stock to convey a 1950's setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself. The melodramatic close-ups combined with the sub-par imitation of the classic \"Psycho\" score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror. The score for \"Psycho\" was brilliantly unnerving, this 'homage' just sounds shrill and annoying. Even the cast, who can be decent at times, deliver histrionic performances that just scream 'caricature'; the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by Lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the Bowden family.The worst acting offender here is surprisingly De Niro. Sure, he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away. Now I'm no expert on American accents, me originally coming from near Manchester in England an' all, but surely he could've come up with a more convincing Southern drawl than that? Being the gifted physical actor he is, he almost overcomes this fatal flaw, but not quite. It was disconcerting for me, as a De Niro fan, to be wishing he was off screen, rather than rapt at his performance.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS.)The over-the-top style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale. When will Scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment? I also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the 'killer-not-dead-yet' cheap trick that less talented individuals might employ.All in all, a thoroughly ridiculous 'thriller'.

The sounds that accompany the film add to that classic feel of the movie, its always there adding atmosphere to the film like movies used to do.The film deals with many things though its main themes are class, hate, and violence.Class and power are brought up. The wealthy in the film seem to wield power casually over those they view as not of their caste. The lawyer omitted evidence that would have resulted in a dismissal just because he 'knew' this rough white guy had to have done the crime. The way he gets favors from his wealthy pals its obvious that if he defending someone of his caste he would have presented the evidence.In fact the ease with which someones life is ruined and the world doesn't even pay it an ounce of attention, this is one of the most terrifying things in the film. The film really shows the impact of power unlike any film i've seen.How does someone hate? To many people its some vague notion. To others its a sin. The 'christian' judge in the film represents this viewpoint, chastising a man who has been abused and hounded by a psychopath because he is 'displaying' negative emotions. While he himself has probably never experienced any major wrong inflicted on him by another, he has never had to resist hate.De Niros character never tried to resist it, he dove straight into it. 14 years in prison breeding and brewing hatred. Thats the films point, this guy is no saint and we have no doubt about that. But the viewer struggles with his feelings because he knows Noltes character was wrong, and we see how 14 years of prison has twisted De Niro and we hear about what happened to him there. One is forced to think, if someone set me up and got me put in prison would I hate to the point that De Niro would?The flip side of this course is how easy Noltes character loses it when faced with a similar situation to the abuse De Niro experienced in prison. How easily he breaks rules, how he seems ready to do anything to get rid of this character. Isn't this also hate? This culminates with the final scene, Noltes character bellowing like a wounded animal lifts a giant rock over his head ready to crush De Niros skull. We are used to the hero coming to his senses and renouncing violence. Not Nolte, he follows through smashing the rock down where De Niros head should have been.This is a powerful statement and the finale.The film pulls back the pretense most of us have about ourselves, how we are more like those 'on the other side of the tracks' than we can imagine. It just maybe that they have had to deal with these issues of hate, class, and violence and we have not.A great film that allows you to relax into it, its both ugly and beautiful at the same time. Truly a masterpiece, my highest recommendation.",

In this version Cady (De Niro) is even more violent and deviant and even Bowden (Nolte) is flawed, as seen by his less than stellar defense of Cady, his dysfunctional family life, and his dalliance with a co-worker. It is interesting to note that Cady's behavior is totally contrary to his professed devotion to Scripture. Could Scorcese be inferring that many openly devout Christians are really perverse monsters like Cady? The acting is superb and a real treat is provided in the form of cameos from Balsam, Mitchum and especially Peck as a smarmy lawyer. The only reason I don't give this film a perfect score is that as good as it is it is still a remake and in my opinion the ending while competent imparts a slight feeling of letdown.

The original starred Greggory Peck and Robert Mitchem (Mitchem as the antagonist), and said original experienced a rather high estimation of its worth within the thriller genre.M. Scorcese, who has finally won an Oscar (for The Departed), with another 78 wins & 57 nominations (for such milestones as Raging Bull, The Gangs of New York, and The Aviator), has also been labeled a Christian-hater, and is accused of allowing his personal views to infiltrate his works. Honestly? Most fans/people who attend his films are aware of his personal views concerning religion, and support him due to his gifted talent. Frankly, his religious views have nothing to do with his talent, and his works have been known to cause one to pause and reevaluate perspectives.The truth is, his works are compelling and bestow something worthy to the audience, regardless of his religious affiliations (or lack thereof) because no one CARES! He makes good movies! And Cape Fear is among his best. Nick Nolte and Robert DeNiro have assumed the roles of the attorney Bowden and his antagonist Max Cady, respectively. Juliette Lewis (only 16 at the time of release) takes on the role as Bowden's daughter, contributing a brilliant performance - the best of her career.This work generates an almost tangible suspense wherein one must stop for a moment and reconsider the happy existence one may enjoy in an effort to evaluate the possibility of something similar to this story line, happening to them, as it is SO realistic.DeNiro's performance is beautiful. His treacherously psychotic portrayal of the Cady character is unnerving and poignant in his struggle to bring Bowden to task. His self-righteous indignation at having been incarcerated for over a decade is one hundred percent believable, and the details down to the look in his eyes, are pure perfection.All in all? This time, the original WAS a masterpiece, but the remake doesn't fall far from the tree. This is definitely worth your time, but unless you're a fan of retros, this isn't a Friday/Saturday night movie, as it is a bit (if only a bit) dated.

Now Sam finds himself stalked by Cady at everything including his family. Which there's rising tension at the Bowen's. But they are not prepared what Cady has in store for them for a personal vendetta.Directed by Oscar-Winner:Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas, The King of Comedy, Taxi Driver) made an entertaining psychological thriller, which is based on the 1962 movie of the same name. DeNiro gives an over the top performance in this, which he is very menacing and at times darkly humorous.

Perphas the problem with the remake is the last act of the feature.

This is hard to believe that Steven Spielberg was going to directed the remake at first but wisely step aside, letting his production company Amblin making it instead. \"Cape Fear\" was hugely successful at the box office and it was very popular with the public over the years by making parodies (Like one of the best The Simpsons episode \"Cape Feare\") and more.

            "content": "To be successful, any remake of an old movie needs to establish an identity of its own. This revamp of \"Cape Fear\" (1962) achieves this by being a colourful widescreen production in which dramatic camera angles, extreme close-ups and a distinctive style of editing, contribute to a hyped-up sense of drama and danger that prevails throughout the whole movie. Its plot about a violent ex-con who, after being released from prison, decides to take revenge on his defence attorney, follows a very similar course to the original, but instead of being a straightforward story of good versus evil, it becomes slightly more complex because of significant changes that are made to the characters of the lawyer and his family.Saul Bass' opening credits, Bernard Herrman's original 1962 score (reworked by Elmer Bernstein) and some other striking visual techniques, make the introduction to this movie very Hitchcockian and in a nod to the original film, three of its stars, Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck and Martin Balsam, are all featured in significant cameo roles.After having served 14 years in prison, Max Cady (Robert De Niro) travels to New Essex, North Carolina to take revenge on Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), the public defender who'd represented him on the rape charge which led to his imprisonment. Cady, who was illiterate at the time of the trial, spent his years in prison learning to read (literature, philosophy, law and the bible) and having discovered that Bowden had withheld information at his trial (which could possibly have won him an acquittal), blames his lawyer for his incarceration and the loss of 14 years of his life. He initially harasses Bowden and his family in fairly subtle ways that don't risk him getting into trouble with the police and it soon becomes clear that his bete noire is getting rattled.Bowden, who is now a partner in a private practice, had managed to get Cady's charge reduced from rape to criminal battery but had chosen not to divulge information he had about the victim's promiscuity because after having seen the extent of her injuries, he'd decided that Cady's crime really shouldn't go unpunished. As well as being unprofessional, Bowden is also a serial adulterer whose dysfunctional marriage has made his wife neurotic and caused his 15-year-old daughter to become troubled and insecure. As Cady's behaviour becomes increasingly threatening, Bowden turns to the police, a fellow attorney and a private investigator for help, but all of their efforts on his behalf prove to be futile because of Cady's cleverness at keeping his actions within certain boundaries. When the ex-con eventually goes beyond these limits, things change rapidly and lead to the story's final confrontation between the two men.The decision to make Bowden a flawed individual instead of the paragon of virtue that he was in the original movie, introduces some moral ambiguity into the plot and certain family dynamics which Cady is able to exploit for his own ends. Although these changes add some interesting and enjoyable new elements to the story, they do nothing to justify Cady's brutality or his misguided beliefs.Robert De Niro makes his character an extremely powerful presence throughout the whole movie. As Cady, he's convincingly sinister, diabolically vicious (when he sexually assaults one of Bowden's work colleagues) and incredibly creepy in a memorable scene that he shares with Juliette Lewis who also turns in a fantastic portrayal of Bowden's daughter. Nick Nolte shows all the anxiety, anger and frustration that Bowden feels during his ordeal as well as the overwhelming sense of guilt that haunts him because of the responsibility he feels for the terrifying experiences that his family get put through.Overall, the sheer vitality of this ramped-up remake together with some great acting, makes it worthwhile, riveting and very much, a thriller of its time.",

However, what I can't understand is people who prefer the whimpy 1962 original to what is obviously a far superior remake - in terms of acting, editing, cinematography and just plain thrills and chills.As much as I admire Robert Mitchum and as effective as he was as Max Cady in the first film, Robert De Niro is a hundred times scarier. I've seen his charactrization at least five times and I still want to hire three guys of my own to beat this creep with tire irons. As for Nick Nolte, not only is he vastly superior actor to Gregory Peck (who reminds of a well-meaning high-school principle who wants to relate to the kids, but can't for the life of him loosen up) but his characterization of Sam Bodin is a believable, three-dimensional portrait of a terrified father and husband. Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis - who has since become a rather annoying actress, I'll admit - give their best performances ever.The greatest improvement over the original, though, is the inclusion of the obsessive religious angle in Cady's character, which is clearly an outgrowth of Scorcece's own obsession with Catholicism. Many people cite, understandably, that Cady's ability to withstand being beaten and set on fire - not to mention riding for several hundred miles while tied to the bottom of a station wagon! - stretches credibility. But after several viewings, I see that the point was to make Cady out to be not so much a human or even sub-human but a supernatural demon not of this earth. To wrap it up, I say to the purists who thought Scorcese and company disgraced J. Lee Thompson's directorial original, take a second look at the 1991 version and see if you feel like hiring some thugs to perform a hospital job on Maximillion Cady.",

How far more interesting in 1991 to make him Cady's defence lawyer, singled out for retribution because he didn't do a good enough job. In this light Cady's justification for his vengeance almost seems credible, and the adaptation has to work harder to present him as a criminal monster. Essentially characters are far more developed in the 1991 Cape Fear. It really milks the Hannibal Lector approach, that there are few things more terrifying than an intelligent psychopath, to menacing effect.As a director Martin Scorsese is a flamboyant stylist, whose overt camera trickery sometimes threatens to get in the way of everything else. It has to be said though that he knows how to tailor his stylisation to the needs of the movie. For Cape Fear he sacrifices a little of his usual snappy ostentatiousness and directs with a drawn-out, creeping pace. Whenever De Niro is on the screen it's all slow, static takes, a series of moody standoffs where the actors are allowed to just do their stuff. When he does throw in something more obtrusive like a whip-pan or a quick zoom it's usually to give a sense of dynamic urgency to the beginning of the scene. Sometimes you can see he has really thought about how one sequence follows another. For example, the scene where De Niro confronts Jessica Lange at home ends with him speeding off in his car. We then cut to a scene between Nick Nolte and Joe Don Baker, which opens with a burst of whip pans, keeping that sense of sudden moving going even in this unrelated exchange, before the scene settles down to a more typical shooting pattern. Still, Scorsese is what he is, and the finale is sometimes spoiled by too much camera movement.Fortunately Scorsese was always one to coax good performances from his players. Robert De Niro is in the most atypical of all his Scorsese roles, and yet still one that benefits from his trademark meticulousness and exaggerated presence. He really seems to relish the bible-bashing white trash take on the criminal genius, cultivating a kind of exuberant creepiness. With his slicked back hair and gawky glances, De Niro is even physically revolting here. The real standout though is Juliette Lewis. She treads a line, effortlessly it seems, between teenage flirtatiousness and childlike fear. She is also by far the most realistic performer of the whole ensemble. Apart from some neat cameos from Robert Mitchum and Gergory Peck (stars of the 1962 movie), the cast isn't that exciting. I don't know why, but I find Nick Nolte strangely unlikeable whatever role he is in (which seemed to be every other male lead for a couple of years in the early 90s), although he is certainly not a bad actor. Jessica Lange is fairly good, if a little overwrought at times.Essentially Cape Fear is a decent remake because it retains (most of) what was good about the original movie, and polishes up what wasn't, helping to fulfil the potential of the earlier effort. It is also undeniably a more modernist take on the story, with a level of violence distressing enough to jolt a contemporary audience, while never being needlessly gory. The only shame is that it adds a few new flaws of its own, as the occasional over-the-topness of it all borders on the silly. But by and large this is a worthy thriller, and a notable exception to the rule of unflattering remakes.",

With this in mind, you know the film can't fail.  I first viewed this film at the cinema, and I have to say I walked out of the theater predicting that De Niro had the Oscar in his pocket.  Sadly however he didn't win.Robert De Niro plays Max Cady, a convicted rapist of a teenage girl. He is released from prison years later, and vowes revenge on his lawyer, and his lawyers family.  This is a strong suspense film that reaches to a breathtaking climax on a lake called Cape Fear.  That is all I'll say, without giving away to much.This film doesn't reach Martin Scorsese at his top form like he did in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Mean Streets.  But it still shows that he is a genius, and the most talented man in Hollywood today.  I highly reccomend this film.I give it an A+!",

The 1962 version is in black and white, which is more appropriate for a film in this genre (see Psycho). The music is by the same person who scored Psycho as well. Scorsese is a different director from Hitchcock, and not quite as good at suspense. De Niro is always very good, but he is not as disturbing as Mitchum was in the original. Lange and rest of the supporting cast are fine, but are really not better than the original as well. The low-cost production values of the original actually added to the suspense of the film (see Psycho; Scorsese tries to imitate it but falls short). The cost of this film was enormous, and not really a script or story that deserved the big remake. There were at least a couple of dozen films that deserved the big remake more. Gregory Peck, Mitchum and one or two others make cameos as a tribute to the original, and that was a good idea. It's too bad Kevin Spacey has a wussy body, or he would have been perfect casting for Cady. I don't buy Nick Nolte as a lawyer, by the way.

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear dresses itself up as a thriller where an outsider attempts to destroy a family, but that is not a completely accurate description. It is instead a film about a man who uses the decay at the core of this family unit to rot away the ties that bind, and by doing so, make them easier prey. While it isn't completely successful, Scorsese's film is an effective drama about the darkness that is hiding within us all.Cape Fear is a remake of a 1962 film of the same name, which starred Gregory Peck as lawyer Sam Bowden and Robert Mitchum as ex-con Max Cady, the roles portrayed here by Nick Nolte and Robert DeNiro (Peck and Mitchum both make cameo appearances). Bowden is a former public defender who defended Max Cady at his rape trial 14 years earlier. Cady, a rather despicable fellow, was convicted, but it turns out that Bowden had performed a history of the girl he raped and found that she was promiscuous, but Bowden considered Cady so detestable that he buried the report and allowed Cady to be found guilty. 14 years later, Cady, who taught himself to read and study the law while in prison, is released and goes looking for Bowden. Cady discovered the truth about the report while in prison, and has decided that Bowden must pay for his failure to provide an adequate defense and keep him out of prison. Bowden, meanwhile, is settling into a new, calmed life after going through some difficulties with his wife, Leigh (Jessica Lange). Their daughter, Danielle (Juliette Lewis) has also seen some rough spots recently, having been caught smoking marijuana at school. Sam's prior infidelity has caused cracks in the family, and Cady arrives and quickly begins to attempt to take advantage of these fissures. A law clerk Sam is friendly with, but not having an affair with, Lori (Illeana Douglas), is picked up in a bar by Cady and beaten, but she is so familiar with the system that she does not want to press charges. Sam hires a private detective, Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to shadow Cady, but as events unfold, Sam begins to look like the one harassing Cady to the law, not the other way around.The Bowden clan at first appears to be a rather normal group: successful lawyer father, graphic designer mother, young, pretty daughter. Yet, there is weakness aplenty in this triumvirate. Sam was unfaithful to his wife in the past, and she has apparently never completely forgiven him, so when Cady makes his move on Lori, Leigh is quick to assume that it is the same as in the past and accuses Sam of cheating. Danielle, in the midst of puberty, finds Cady somewhat charming and seductive, as he uses his considerable abilities of manipulation to attempt to make her more sympathetic to him, knowing that she is not on the best of terms with her parents after the incident with the marijuana. Sam is also tainted by his past, when he buried the report on Cady, believing that he should see justice, but not fulfilling his requirements as his lawyer. Scorsese and screenwriter Wesley Strick mine the sides of our personalities that we all attempt to keep hidden, the flip side to the proper American family, the dark truths we all pretend not to see. This is a family falling victim to a marauders advance by succumbing to the weaknesses inherent in their own tortured pasts. Cady is not a standup citizen by any means, he preys on the family through their dark recesses, but he would not be so successful without those cracks in the foundation.Robert DeNiro extends himself into somewhat new territory with the character of Max Cady. Cady is a man who believes himself betrayed by the one man who was supposed to be his advocate and has appointed himself a soldier of God to bring Sam Bowden to the same level of justice and loss that he himself experienced in prison. Cady is a muscled, brutal man who has a rather intense streak of intelligence that belies his outward appearance of poor white trash. He is no fool, and it is his nose for human weakness and frailty that makes him so successful at his task. DeNiro is effective in the role of Max Cady and gives a tour de force performance as a madman out for revenge.Nick Nolte is also effective as Sam Bowden, who doesn't view his choices as wrong, and now finds himself at the mercy of a madman due to an action that seemed morally proper at the time. The law doesn't provide much support, as Cady works Sam up into a frenzy and making him appear to be stalking Cady. He must also confront the unhappiness of his wife, and the rebelliousness of his daughter, and quickly finds himself in a pressure cooker that seems to have no release. Nolte portrays a man being ratcheted up notch by notch, ready to blow at a moment's notice as his world collapses around him. Juliette Lewis is also a standout as the young, impressionable Danielle. She is not sure what to make of Cady, a man who is both intriguing and creepy at the same time. She hears her father talk about how bad he is, while she finds him to be in touch with her concerns and feelings at the mid-teen years.Visually, Scorsese uses as lot of quick camera movements and fast zoom-ins to heighten the tension in various scenes. He also elects to adapt Bernard Herrmann's score from the original film and Herrmann's thundering brass and heavy strings prove a bit more bombastic than today's modern, more subdued scores, but which set the mood appropriately.Scorsese and Strick don't quite wrap everything up at the end, but nonetheless, Cape Fear is a worthwhile look into the human heart of darkness.",

His use of colors also paint the film with a certain artsy flair and his quick cuts add to the tension. I do have one big detraction with this film though... it's a bit cartoonish at times. Some of what happens is a tad over-the-top and undercuts a lot of the genuine fear Scorsese generates. There's enough good in the rest of the film to carry it into \"great\" territory however.

            "content": "Those soul wrenching words uttered by Robert De Niro's \"Max Cady\" in Martin Scorsese's 1991 Thriller Classic, \"Cape Fear\" gives a lot of us, the chills, even today. But while we're at it, let's think back to the original Cape Fear from 1962 first, with silver screen greats Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum as the leads. The movie was the pinnacle of suspense in the early 60s' (except Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho) with Mitchum's Max Cady being the epitome of creepy. His sole intent was to terrorise the family of his former lawyer Sam Bowden, and succeeding, until Bowden pulls a gun and ends the reign of terror without further conflict. Bowden lives happily ever after, Cady goes back to prison, the end.Territory like that was only beginning to be approached in the early 60s', and viewers were legitimately disturbed by the film's content; in the era of creature-features and sock hops, the scariest monster was the human one. However, come 1991, the true definition of the human monster was returned to the big screen when Martin Scorsese brought back Cape Fear with Nick Nolte as Bowden and Robert De Niro as Cady. The remake took the extra steps that the original couldn't, and as a result, the film was much grittier and darker as De Niro's Cady stole the show with a very terrifying interpretation.\"I am like God, and God like me. I am as large as God, He is as small as I. He cannot above me, nor I beneath Him be.\" \u2013 Max Cady.De Niro's Cady was the perfect villainous specimen. He was lean and muscled from his time in prison, heavily tattooed, eloquently spoken, and (go figure) his heavy Southern accent was both charming and unsettling. But the most unsettling aspect was his intensity. Cady came out of prison a hardened convict bent on revenge. He wanted recompense for the lost years that he received courtesy of Bowden and he wasn't afraid to cross that line.That's what defines De Niro's Cady as a villain. He wasn't above invading the Bowdens. He invaded them personally, emotionally, mentally, and literally. He invaded their sense of peace, their security, their privacy, and even went as far as seducing Sam's teenage daughter. He raped their sense of normalcy and forever changed their lives. He was a plague who made your skin crawl just by looking at him.Of course, that doesn't mean we didn't enjoy De Niro's Cady. His performance made the film. Only De Niro could properly perform a character as psychotic as Cady. His performance was so in depth that he even playfully tormented Scorsese while in character. De Niro was committed to the role, going as far as having a dentist alter his teeth for the role as well as study the \"Southern dialect\" by recording a bunch of Southern people talking into a mic. Somehow, someway, everything in the South only adds an element of terror in films.With all that being said, it's a smart film with a ripped, tatted, Southern, and just outright psychotic, De Niro's Cady is the epitome of a horror villain.",

Well, I am glad they enjoyed it, though even if it's a very good film, I am loathe to call any film a classic if it's a remake...one of several, actually, of the 1962 film. In about 95% of the movies that have been remade, the first is better...if only because it has originality. If an original film is seriously flawed and the remake corrects this, then, perhaps it could be considered a classic. But the old Gregory Peck/Robert Mitchum version was an exceptional film...perhaps even a classic. So why did I watch this remake when I usually hate remakes? Well, like the original, Robert Mitchum is in this one (as is Gregory Peck) and I recently decided to try seeing all his films....and I am nearly there.As I watched \"Cape Fear\" I noticed that the screenplay was not identical to the original...that's clearly a plus. In this case, the crazed ex-con, Max Cady (Robert De Niro), is angry because his defense attorney (Nick Nolte) apparently deliberately tanked the case that sent him to prison many years ago. As for Sam Bowden (Nolte), he was horrified by the rape that Cady committed and didn't feel terribly inclined to defend him as well as he might have...making him different than the lawyer in the original...who was simply an innocent man harassed by evil. Here, it's evil harassing a morally ambiguous man and the people (and dog) he loved. The film also is quite different from the original because it's a lot more violent and sexual....disturbingly so. In fact, I found the sexual violence too intense and it showed way too much for my taste. The attack on Illeana Douglas' character was more like rape porn than a drama...and I strongly recommend you think twice about seeing the film if you've been a victim of sexual assault.Overall, a film that started off well enough but became so distastefully violent and gross that I finally just turned the movie off as I didn't find it entertaining...just cruel.",

Now, if you're not intimidated by the old school film noir, B/W and such, you are likely to find this remake far less upsetting - and believable - than the original picture of 1962.Firstly, the build up here is all wrong: though DeNiro's portrait of Max Cady is credible per se, his way of stalking Sam Bowden and his family is - by 1990s standards - a bit too crude and ungainly to become as menacing as the story suggests. The steadily increasing threat that characterizes Mitchum's Cady in the 1960s version is much more effective.Secondly, there is a certain hypersensitivity to Nolte's Bowden that kind of spoils the plot, making him a sort of a house tyrant that is otherwise out of character. Fairly unlikely, for instance, that he would be successful in locking up his wife and daughter (as if back in the old prudish days of 1962) without thoroughly informing the two of them about his fears regarding the situation, the looks of Mr.Cady, what kind of car he drives, and so on. Thirdly, Juliette Lewis is best cast of them all as the gullible teen daughter, given that you accept her lack of normal teen social life with friends, guys, parties etc. She would most likely not have been the least attracted to Cady, if the setting was different, i.e. the regular 1990s one.This version relies more on action and less on psychology than its precursor. The part where Cady picks up the \"promiscous\" lady demonstrates this to the point: Mitchum and the lady share seductive glances in an unusually erotic scene for its time, and the impact when Mitchum's Cady turns out to be totally out of control is immediate. DeNiro's Cady is very talkative, and his lady counterpart is too drunk to sense that anything strange is going on, which makes the brutal treatment of her later just pure gore.",

            "content": "Often described as a contemporary homage to \"grand guignol\" horror films, a school of Gothic, sensational psycho-thrillers in the 1960s and early '70s, Cape Fear gave Martin Scorsese the chance to both frustrate devotees who wanted to see him continue making more personal and ambitious movies like The Last Temptation of Christ and GoodFellas, and to make the movies he actually always dreamed of making. He draws upon a knowledge of classic Hollywood and imbues this massive production with homage, shooting wider than he ever had, reviving the career of Saul Bass to create a truly go-for-broke opening title sequence, using Herrmann's exact score from the original Cape Fear, and casting Gregory Peck, Martin Balsam and Robert Mitchum in wickedly ironic cameos.At any given moment, you can see a markedly unsubtle but extremely precise mastery of well- rounded, always specific and highly confrontational film technique. I suppose that's not just Scorsese waving a magic wand Robert Aldrich gave him. Luckily, for a 1990s stalker thriller, it gets an unusual amount of power from its extremely mature, sensitive and uncompromising script, which ultimately serves as a telling measure meant for how dramatically an audience's stimulus had heightened in the thirty years since the very visually and thematically black and white original.If Scorsese would have relied on his talent for revelatory camera movement and access to Thelma's sharp cutting skills while working from the average Hollywood suspense script, it would have probably ended up as high camp, and the volcanic performances by his cast would have looked like laughably over-the-top grandeur. But I am going to give Wesley Strick some well-deserved press by typing his name there just now because every scene and even line has real content.The entire cast is aggressive, bold in their own ways, and confrontational. They are all in some sense the primal animalistic core of human nature with that tapering lather of manners on top. Nolte plays an accomplished, organized lawyer and family man, unusually presenting himself with a mild-mannered Clark Kent image, an image that is gradually chiseled away. De Niro is a very convincing monster, a truly terrifying psychopath, not just playing his ordinary mean ol' tough guy. Juliette Lewis, very early in her career, has scenes of great dramatic volume, a mysterious but naive young girl whose weakness for the attention her bickering parents have hardly given her is something she has to fight hard to keep from being exploited. And, though her role is small, Illeana Douglas blows me straight away in the limited amount of screen time she has. She is so real and convincing that she was constantly generating squirms and winces from me.In the original Cape Fear, the story was simple. It was the good, righteous, scrupulous American family against practically the Big Bad Wolf. It worked. But to build upon that story is interesting, and the difference between the 1962 film and the 1991 film is that in the 1991 version, no one is entirely good, righteous, or scrupulous. The image the family has is a delicate glass against the boiling pressure of their inner violence.",

As is common to the genre, many of the contrivances have to do with the actions of law enforcement. An ex-con is accused of harassing the lawyer who worked on his case, yet police regularly take the side of the violent felon over the decorated lawyer or insist nothing can be done?

            "content": "When I first saw J Lee Thompson's \"Cape Fear\", it struck as strange that, although Sam Bowden is by profession a lawyer, he played no part in Cady's trial other than as a witness. Would it, I felt, not have made for a more dramatic confrontation if he had been Counsel for the prosecution at that trial? It seems that Martin Scorsese's mind was working along similar lines to my own, except that he came up with an even better idea than mine. In his version, Bowden was not the prosecutor at Cady's trial but rather Counsel for the defence.The plot broadly follows the lines of the original. After his release from jail, Cady moves to Bowden's home town (in this version in North Carolina rather than Georgia) and begins a campaign of harassment against him, his wife and teenage daughter. He never makes any direct threats which would enable the police to take action against him, but rather relies on indirect innuendo which leaves Bowden in no doubt that Cady means him harm. As in the original, Bowden tries to obtain help from the police, then tries unsuccessfully to frighten Cady off by having him beaten up. Both films end with a tense finale on the family houseboat on the Cape Fear river after Bowden has resorted to a ruse to lure Cady into a trap.There is, however, one very important shift of emphasis between the two films. In Thompson's version Bowden, played by Gregory Peck, was a rather idealised figure, a calm, rational liberal and a loving husband and father. Scorsese moves away from this idealised conception; his Bowden, played by Nick Nolte, is in many ways an unlikeable character. His marriage is on the verge of breaking down because of his infidelities and he has a difficult relationship with his daughter (here called Danielle rather than Nancy as in the original film). Most importantly, he is hiding a guilty secret. When defending Cady for rape, he received a report indicating that the alleged victim was promiscuous. Instead of using this report as part of his client's defence, Bowden, motivated by sympathy for the woman and belief in his own client's guilt, simply buried it without showing it either to his client or to the prosecution.In the 1962 version, there was a sharp contrast between Bowden, the model citizen, and Cady, the villain. The character portrayed by Robert Mitchum certainly brooded on the imagined wrongs committed against him by Bowden and by society in general, but this was no more than a hypocritical way of avoiding thinking about the very real wrongs which he had committed against others. In Scorsese's version, the contrast becomes blurred. Cady, who has discovered the truth about the buried report, has a genuine grievance in that he was denied a fair trial by his own lawyer's dereliction of duty.This does not, however, mean that Cady becomes a sympathetic figure. Ever since \"Godfather II\" and \"Taxi Driver\" in the seventies, Robert de Niro has been an actor best known for his portrayals of criminals or anti-social individuals; attempts to widen his range into comedies or romantic dramas such as \"Falling in Love\" have not always been successful. His Cady, however, is one of a long line of memorable de Niro villains. Whereas Mitchum played the character as evil but sane, de Niro plays a man on the edge of madness. Had Mitchum's Cady been in a similar position, he would doubtless have hired another lawyer, won himself a retrial and then asked the Bar Association to discipline Bowden for his breach of professional ethics. De Niro's character, however, is in the grip of religious mania and believes that he has a mandate from God to avenge himself on Bowden.Another shift of emphasis is in the way Bowden's daughter is portrayed, possibly reflecting changes in the way society viewed young people over the intervening three decades. In Thompson's film Nancy, as played by Lori Martin, was a meek, demure child, seeming younger than her fifteen years. In this film Danielle is a truculent, rebellious teenager, seeming older than her fifteen years. (Juliette Lewis was actually eighteen at the time). Whereas Nancy was frightened of Cady even before she discovered who he was, Danielle at first befriends him, seeing him as a rebel after her own heart. Later, after his threat to her family becomes obvious, she fights back bravely against him.Thompson's film has many virtues, being a tense, well-made noir thriller. Scorsese's film was clearly intended as homage- three of the original cast members (Peck, Mitchum and Martin Balsam) make cameo appearances and Scorsese keeps the Bernard Herrman score that was so effective in the original. The original film was, however, a black-and-white film in two senses- not only in the sense that it was shot in monochrome, but also in the sense that it took a black-and-white view of morality. Bowden and his family were good and Cady was bad, with few shades of grey in between. By blurring these sharp moral distinctions, Scorsese is able to make his film something more than a thriller- it is also a study of the nature of good and evil, of revenge and of justice (Frequent themes with this director). An outwardly respectable professional family man hides guilty secrets. A criminal with a legitimate grievance sets himself up as a divinely ordained avenger. I am not normally a great admirer of remakes, but Scorsese's is one of the few in recent years to have surpassed its original. 8/10",

The Scorsese - De Niro combo has literally never disappointed me ever. These combo of these two fine men is the single greatest thing that has happened to Hollywood.

My review is based on the merit of this film alone as I have never seen the original; however, after seeing this, I wanted to. Nolte gives an equally strong performance as the milquetoast lawyer pushed to his limits by this madman. Lange and Lewis offer strong support as Nolte's family (Lewis received an Oscar nod for this, her first starring role).

As he walks out of the gates there's this ominous music playing foreshadowing that he has ill-intentions. Almost immediately he makes contact with Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), his defense attorney who allowed him to be put away for 14 years. He has no intentions of hiding and slinking around, he wants Sam to know that he's there and he has no plans to leave.De Niro does an exceptional job playing the sly menacing southerner out for revenge. He knows that Sam hid exculpatory evidence 14 years prior that maybe could've gotten him a lighter sentence--for that he wants to make Sam Bowden pay.You can't help but be infuriated by Sam's daughter Danielle aka Danny (Juliette Lewis). Part of Cady's plan to hurt Sam was to get at him through his daughter. She was all too na\u00efve and receptive of Cady's statutory advances. She only made it harder for her dad to protect her and her mother.Scorsese put together an all-star cast for this production: De Niro, Nolte, Jessica Lange, Juliette Lewis (before she was a star), Joe Don Baker, Gregory Peck, and Fred Dalton Thompson. With so many professionals I'm sure Scorsese had no problem directing this. I'd say the reboot is on par with the original which means if I had to choose which one is better I'd have to give the nod to the original because it was first.",

He (or she) exerts a progressively more malignant influence that almost wrecks their relationship, but they pull together at last (ah, that all-American family again) and are reluctantly driven to kill. Of course he (or she) is not quite killed first time around. Just as you think it's safe to kiss and cuddle and relax - he (or she) springs back for a shocking finale!'Let me see, there's 'Play Misty', 'Fatal Attraction', 'Pacific heights', 'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle', 'Cape Fear' x 2, 'Dead Calm', 'Misery', 'The Fan'; lunatics are all around us. It just ain't safe any more. Mind you; they're awfully good for the movie industry. The benefit of 'psychos' to directors is that they can be made to do anything at any time, however implausible. One day they bring you tea, the next day they break your legs. It's the cheapest, most hammy way of introducing a shock or propping-up a failed plot. And if they've got religion? Whew! - watch out, that's all. They are always the grudge-masters from hell. They always know the law by heart and are careful not to be seen straying beyond it. Their game is to antagonise you into criminality instead. You'll crack here first because they cracked long ago. They've nothing left to break. And because they're psychotic, somehow they're superhumanly strong, agile and quick, and likewise supernaturally clever in a meticulous, cunning and predatory way. Naturally - loonies always are.Remember the excellent 'Terminator'? 'It can't be reasoned with. It feels no pity or remorse or fear, and it absolutely will not stop - ever - until you are dead'. I'm quoting Kyle Reece, its time-travelling trouser-stealing hero. His dire warning was a summation of every psycho-grudge plot ever written. Taken to their most preposterous extremes we have Micheal Myers and Freddy Kruger.Of course the victims are always such innocents they might have come from Greenland. They're gullible, they've no imagination, no defensive instinct. It never occurs to them what the villain might get up to. And they never want to make a fuss. They're nice people, for heavens sake. They're respectable, honest, hardworking. They celebrate Christmas and Thankgiving. They're kind to their dogs and friendly with their neighbours. Of course, there is usually just a teeny little skeleton in the closet, but that only serves to highlight their vulnerability. They're just normal - like you and me. A little flawed, but basically decent.And because the antagonists are always beyond reason, there's only one thing to be done in the end: kill them - if you can. Don't pity them; don't come to an understanding; don't catch them and cure them. Just kill them; there's really no alternative; they're mad. And do it in a nasty, explicitly brutal way. They've deserved it. The whole movie has been staggering up to this predictable culminating denouement.Pathetic.It gets 2 stars for a substantial but woefully misguided cast.Keep taking the tablets.",

Max Cady (Robert De Niro) gets out of prison after 14 years and proceeds to harass Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) and his family (Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis). It turns out that Bowden is the defense lawyer that Cady feels did him wrong. Joe Don Baker, Illeana Douglas, Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck appear in peripheral roles.I like this one better than the original because it's more modern and compelling, not to mention in color. The best character, by far, is Max Cady. One of the best scenes is the long quasi-seduction sequence between Cady and Bowden's daughter. Both De Niro and Lewis pull it off superbly. Cady's almost fascinating -- and even respectable & likable \u2013 before taking a decidedly diabolic turn. Once this happens, though, it's impossible to root for him.Some Christians have criticized the film on the grounds that Cady's a Pentecostal and the story portrays him as a malevolent nut-job. Actually, Cady's not genuinely Pentecostal or Christian. If he were, he would've sincerely repented of the heinous offense that landed him in prison rather than seek revenge on the lawyer who defended him. He would've praised God for a second chance at life and the finances that were available for him to start over. Instead, like a fool, he blames his misfortune on someone else and everything he does proves beyond any shadow of doubt that he's not Pentecostal or Christian whatsoever; he merely wears the garnishment of Christianity. Jesus had something to say about such people in Matthew 7:15-23.Since Cady is easily the most interesting character in the film they could've taken the story in a completely different direction and made him the protagonist and Bowden the villain, but of course this would've totally deviated from the plot of the original story. Still, this would've made for a better film IMHO; as it is, \"Cape Fear\" plays like \"Fatal Attraction\" without the attraction element. But it's very well made, which is to be expected with Scorsese at the helm. Unfortunately it's overlong and could've easily been trimmed by 15-20 minutes.The film runs 128 minutes and was shot in Fort Lauderdale & Hollywood, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia (the ending boat sequence).GRADE: B+",

Lee Thompson's 1962 thriller Cape Fear sees director Martin Scorsese at his most mainstream, tackling the then very popular psycho-thriller genre; but this being Scorsese, the film is a cut above the rest, benefitting from masterful storytelling, dazzling visuals (including opening credits by Saul Bass), unflinching violence, and a stellar cast: Scorsese regular Robert DeNiro is on top form as the film's vengeful, psychotic, cigar chomping ex-con Max Cady; Nick Nolte is great as Sam Bowden, the defense lawyer menaced by Cady for burying information during his trial; Jessica Lange is Nolte's estranged wife Leigh; cult favourite Joe Don Baker plays shady private eye Claude Kersek; and nobody does jail-bait like Juliette Lewis. There are also fun cameos from Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, the stars of the original movie.DeNiro's Cady is such a slimy, reprehensible character that the tension is palpable from the moment he leaves prison, roiling clouds above signalling the impending doom; by the time Cady has raped and beaten loveable law clerk Lori (Illeana Douglas), the viewer will be on board with whatever Sam does in order to protect his family. Unfortunately for the lawyer, paying three thugs to put the ex-con in hospital backfires, and following Kersek's plan to kill Cady in self-defense results in one dead private eye (and a dead house-maid). In the film's suspenseful final\u00e9, Sam takes his family to their houseboat in the Everglades, where he believes they will be safe - but Max has followed them there (by suspending himself under their car) and is hell-bent on carrying out his version of justice.I rewatched Cape Fear hoping that my memory of Cape Feare, the hilarious The Simpsons parody episode, wouldn't ruin the experience; on the contrary, I enjoyed Scorsese's film even more thanks to the antics of Bart and Sideshow Bob (how I wish DeNiro had been driven over a cactus patch!).

The truth is that, without wanting to legitimize the practice, which is often taken to exaggeration, there are remakes that manage to justify themselves, not only for the quality they demonstrate, but also for the gift, not to mention, of drawing the public's attention to the older movies. I can give my personal example: it was the contact with some remakes that made me know that there were older films and go looking for them to be able to see them.This film maintains, without significant changes, the story told in the older film, which dates from 1962 and was starred by Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum: very briefly, it is the story of a lawyer who finds himself persecuted and threatened, with his wife and daughter, by a spiteful ex-con who blames him for many years of incarceration. Of course, there are things that change between the two films, and this film has the advantage of not giving us a simple story where a terribly bad man wants to harm a very nice man. Bowden, the lawyer, is a man with a past full of mistakes (much like many of us) who hasn't always been good at his job and his role as a husband and father, and we see that, and the way character is called upon to face the consequences. The sexual theme, which the original film attenuates a lot (due to the restrictions imposed on cinema at the time), is also more pronounced here, transforming Max Cady into an almost perfect pervert.In addition to the nuances that make the film denser and with a more complex story, we can count on an excellent cast where Robert De Niro steals all the attention, thanks to a powerful, convincing and genuinely menacing interpretation. This film is worth seeing just to savor the actor's performance. Nick Nolte played attorney Sam Bowden, a man who desperately seeks to protect his family. The actor is good and does a good job. Much less interesting, Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis play the lawyer's wife and daughter in an ambiguous and sometimes very unpleasant way: Lange can still reasonably extricate herself from the challenge she has, but Lewis has turned her character into a kind of teenage nymphet who sees Cady as a terrifying sexual temptation rather than having the discernment and intelligence necessary to at least realize the risk her entire family is running. Also a reminder of the cameos of honor by Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam, three actors who were pivotal in the original film. Incidentally, this film would end up being the last in the life of Peck, who died shortly after.Martin Scorcese made this film as a means to an end, that is, a way to get the studio to invest in another film he wanted to make. Anyway, and for whatever reason, it was a good bet by the director. The film deserves our attention and is full of merits. The filming work and cinematography are excellent, the sets and costumes too, with an emphasis, of course, on the scenes on the Bowden houseboat. The effects were also well done, although not particularly extraordinary. The central score of this film is the same as its older counterpart, composed by Bernard Herrmann, one of the best and best conceived by the composer, and which is already part of the collective memory.",

Scorcese really knew how to pay a nice tribute to his source material without it being cliched.Also De Niro's performance is simply one of his best, and I felt a lot more empathy for Nick Nolte as the lawyer as well as Jessica Lange as his wife. I haven't seen much with Lange outside of Tootsie so it was nice to see her in this and she was fantastic.I also liked Juliette Lewis and she brings a lot more dimension and depth to this character and makes the daughter more compelling.If you haven't seen the original Cape Fear I still recommend seeing it before viewing this superior remake. Again in it's own right it is still a very good film, but see it first because things will make a lot more sense in this remake and will allow you to appreciate this film even more.Scorsese's visuals in this are simply fantastic.

            "content": "Massively \"pimped\" and slightly overblown 90's remake of the semi-classic 60's thriller with the same name, directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Gregory Peck and the phenomenal Robert Mitchum. Although not so much the case yet in the early 1990's, the term remake usually causes a lot of frustration and hatred among horror/cult fanatics, but this is of course an exception. With a man like Martin Scorsese in the director's chair and a cast full of superb names, you naturally don't have to fear that this will be a bland and uninspired re-telling of the same story solely intended to raise maximum profit with a minimum of cinematic effort. Scorsese's main contribution is that he pulled the image of the Bowden family severely through the blender\u0085In the 60's original the Bowdens were a picture-perfect model family, whereas here they are your average US citizens with vices and guilty of certain sins. Patriarch Sam flirts with adultery (and clearly has done before in the past), his wife Leigh is manic depressed and their rebelling teenage daughter Danielle even allows psychopaths to tingle her sexual curiosity! Their life already isn't much of a Sunday picnic even before Max Cady appears on their doorstep to extract sadistic revenge on Sam Bowden's family, as he was the defense attorney who deliberately withheld evidence that could have kept Cady out of jail fourteen years earlier. Robert De Niro gives his umpteenth extremely powerful performance as the terrifying, maniacal, deranged and bible-quoting scumbag Max Cady\u0085 And yet, to me at least, the Cady character here isn't half as disturbing and appalling as Robert Mitchum portrayed him in 1962. Mitchum depicted the ultimately evil being of flesh and blood, while De Niro's Cady resembles more of a nearly indestructible and comic book like monstrosity. Like the case in the most dreadful teen slasher movies, Max Cady repeatedly pops back up after \u2013 supposedly \u2013 being beaten during the finale, which gives the film somewhat of a cheap popcorn entertainment touch. Many sequences in \"Cape Fear\", particularly the ones proving that the illiterate thug Max Cady turned into an intelligent and excessively eloquent criminal, are overlong and rather boring. Only two sequences truly qualify as genuinely nightmarish and horrifying, namely Cady's encounter with Sam's lewd mistress Lori and the confrontation between Cady and private eye Kersek inside the Bowden family mansion. The supportive cast is amazing, especially because Martin Scorsese presents the brilliant idea of casting the protagonists of the original movie in opposite roles. Good guy Gregory Peck appears as Max Cady's slimy new counselor and madman Robert Mitchum stars as the veteran police lieutenant advising Sam Bowden to seek specialist assistance. Technically and cinematographically speaking, \"Cape Fear\" is a superior movie, and inarguably one of the best thrillers of the overall disappointing 90's decade, but \u2013 unlike the original \u2013 not fundamental viewing as far as I'm concerned.",

The first time I liked it so and so, but on the second view I appreciated it even more.Since there are lots of reviews for this remake already and also many for the 1962 version, I'll be short. While Nick Nolte was on par with Gregory Peck as Sam Bowden, Robert de Niro was MUCH better than Robert Mitchum as Max Cady. He was much more crazier and villanious and hysterical in a great way, and with the second viewing I appreciated his performance even more. The rest of the supporting cast (Juliette Lewis, Fred Dalton Thompson and Martin Balsam that has a cameo just like Mitchum and Peck) are great.While not an excellent remake is still a good one even tho I must warn sensible viewers that there are some very gory scenes (and I can't mention them here), but still, also one of Martin Scorsese's best movies.",

            "content": "Only Scorsese could do this remake justice. It's a much more vivid and violent telling of one man, Max Cady, an unstoppable machine of madness and fury, a much deserved Oscar nomination for Deniro who knows how to bring characters to life. His portrayal of Cady, a man wronged, by the guy who defended him, is worlds apart from Mitcham's take on the vile, illiterate, ex con/rapist, who keeps coming at his defence, Sam Bowden (here a solid Nolte) until he's finally forced to strike back, where only one can survive. Lange again is in top form, equal with Nolte, where Newcomer, Lewis, as the sexy, troubled and innocently led, virtuous, daughter (a role a younger Reese Witherspoon actually read for) is a major talent to behold, where many other great character performances, followed. This is a more firey, sting in your tail, present day version, that I must say works better, than the original black and white one. There are two ugly scenes of strong violence, one of course not for the easily disturbed, that caught me out, I must say. Played out over two hours, this successor of a remake, really works to the dilemma of poor Nolte's situation, and Deniro's issues with him, out there to break him, and avenge his injustice, with the intention of never stopping, where eventual murder may not even by on the agenda. Nolte had buried the file of his client who had severely raped and beaten a teenage girl. We even hear his own words, defending himself to a colleague, over the girl's state, leading us to draw pictures in our mind of what she must of looked like. I gather a lot of people out there who have really been wronged, will relate with this movie. Like a jilted lover, stalker, etc, Cady keeps coming back at Bowden, who resorts to dirty play, by hiring out a pi, and some of his heavies, to cease this harassment. And you'll like how that fight pans out. Then came a sudden turning point I didn't buy that had Lawyer, Peck defending a smacked up face, Deniro, that kind of made me sick in one sense. The scene just seemed fake. Was it Peck, overacting, or how could he believe Deniro, in light of all the mayhem, he's caused prefore, where Nolte gets the wrong end of stick here. This poses the question, \"How could you make money defending people, where you no most of them are guilty, and sleep well at night\". What I loved about Lewis was her different plays of emotion, and she reacted off Deniro. That long theatre room scene between the two was hot, and the wall phone scene with him, informing her to meet at the school while hanging upside down, was an impressive shot, among some others, (Cady's ECU, walking straight into the camera, while walking outside the gates of the joint, another mention) This is something else, this genius director knows how to do. The long drawn out ending, breathtaking and hairy, on the houseboat, and I don't want to know how they did it, was the most impressive action piece of the movie, unbearably suspenseful at times, where this underestimated bastard, doesn't let you forget who he is. Nolte screaming, in crazed vented fury, \"I'M GONNA KILL YOU!\" sounded so real, it not only made him feel good, but us audience. This whole climax and it's lead up was well staged, where Deniro, like a tooth absess, has to be taken out. Exciting movie experience, all the way. Don't miss out.",

            "review_title": "Scorsese channels Hitchcock",
            "content": "It seems like most directors want to make a tribute to Hitchcock at some point in their careers. Zemeckis did it with What Lies Beneath, and even the original Cape Fear by J. Lee Thompson was an homage to the then living master. Scorsese comes along and take an homage to Hitchcock and makes another homage to Hitchcock, using color to directly invoke Vertigo in particular.Ironically, I feel like the movie's greatest strength and the source of most of its problems is the same: Robert de Niro. Scorsese had been working with de Niro since Mean Streets and had developed a strong sense of trust for the actor's instincts, apparently letting de Niro find his Max Cady and run with it. De Niro's work ends up making Cady both quietly terrifying in his best moments and cartoonishly extravagant in his worst. I think that by allowing de Niro to go so far, especially in the film's third act, Scorsese undermined the type of tension and release he was trying to mimic. But, we'll get to that in a moment.Sam Bowden is a lawyer in North Carolina with a pretty wife, Leigh, who does graphic design, and a fifteen year old daughter in high school. They have a happy life together, but there are hurts lurking under the surface. Sam cheated on Leigh some years ago, forcing a move to North Carolina where they could start anew. The opening scenes, though, show none of the underlying tension of their marriage. Everyone seems happy in a functioning and prosperous system. Sam may be playing racquetball with a young woman from the office, but he hasn't done anything untoward with her despite her obviously flirtatious attitude towards him. No, he's learned his lesson and he's going to keep an appropriate distance.Into this comes Max Cady, fresh out of prison after fourteen years for the rape of a young woman. Sam had been his defense attorney and buried a report that could have saved Cady at least some time if not his entire sentence that showed the girl was promiscuous. I like how the movie reveals this early on, not trying to leave it as a piece of information for Cady to scream in the third act at some point. We know from the first act why Cady is after Sam, coloring his interactions with the rest of Sam's family, especially Danielle, the daughter. Sam thought Cady was violent enough that he should bury the report to protect the other young women of the world, and now Cady is getting close not only to the man who wronged him, but his fifteen year old daughter as well.Cady begins a campaign of near harassment that keeps him on the right side of the law but picks at Sam's sense of calm. Cady sits on the wall that borders Sam's back wall, but doesn't go any further. He follows Sam around, paying for his meals, smoking cigars in theaters while laughing loudly, and just looking at Sam from his car (an echo of Travis Bickle, to a certain extent). There's obviously enough malicious intent so that Sam can easily start the process for a restraining order, but the legal process is slow and Sam gets impatient, especially with Cady being able to sidestep every police intervention Sam can manufacture.The most compelling moment in the whole film for de Niro is when he sneaks onto Danielle's school, pretends to be her new drama teacher, and gets to meet her alone in the auditorium. This is a small moment of aggressive seduction on his part, playing up Danielle's questions about the truth of her parents' marriage based on what she knows about the affair, her generalized desire to rebel as a teenager, and her questioning of all sorts of norms to get in close. It becomes a violation due to his incredible level of manipulation. This is Cady at his absolute most terrifying, far more than when he becomes a cartoon villain in the final act.In comes the private detective, Claude. He investigates, still finds nothing, but offers Sam more extra-judicial means including access to a gun and men who will beat a lesson into Cady with their fists, an offer Sam takes Claude up on. Cady, though, is almost an elemental force, so dedicated to his revenge that he can beat off three men with blunt weapons, taking a beating himself in the process. A beating that he uses to hire one of the best attorneys in the state to file a restraining order against Sam. With that, Sam takes his family to the titular Cape Fear.Up to this point, the movie felt like it was really building to something interesting, but it kind of devolves into generic monster movie territory. Cady becomes almost as indestructible as The Terminator as he sneaks up on the family houseboat and demands, in Biblical terms and the voice of a Pentecostal preacher, that Sam pay for his sins. It's so over the top, that I find it more ridiculous than terrifying. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's bad. It's technically adept in a way that you would expect from someone as good at making films as Scorsese with solid model work on the boat and convincing use of sets, but it does seem like a letdown on the promise of the movie's quieter menace from the first ninety minutes or so. Part of it was that the ending was obviously written this way, but another is de Niro's performance that goes so far off the deep end of shouting and screaming, especially when you combine the burn makeup.It's an imperfect thriller that seems to end up giving into genre thrills to the max rather than focusing on a more effectively thrilling, but smaller, ending. This feels like Scorsese selling out, to a certain extent. He does it well, but Cape Fear is a well made and entertaining film more akin to Boxcar Bertha than the direction he had been taking ever since.",

Robert  De Niro is evil, some people's main personality traits can simply be described as evil.  I like the part where he studies Neitch, a major personality trait of his being.  His 14 years in prison were only training in education, philosophy, exercise, and the art of war. Equally evil as when he entered prison, but even more dangerous when he left.  I understand the frustration he felt working in a little 4 by 4 sortation case at the post office, when they show the scene of him being frustrated in his cell waiting to be unleashed.  He plays the art of psychological warfare, and slowly turns the violence up.  The private eye character is great, and the only expert to handle him.

            "content": "Cape Fear was an experience I was excited for: Martin Scorsese was taking his genius from mob movies and serious dramas and using it in a horror movie? Maybe it'd give horror flicks a more serious name? Maybe he'd be the one to break the barrier of the flat-lining genre in the early '90s. Well, Cape Fear examined all my hopes and did the exact opposite, causing an eruption of banality in Scorsese's followup to one of the best films of the '90s, Goodfellas. The score is chilling. From the moment the opening credits begin, the music punches you in the gut, and makes you scared in your seat. You wait for something really terrifying to happen, but the problem is, nothing worthy to that terrifying score ever surfaces. Robert DeNiro gives a good performance that scares the audience, but besides his decent character, everyone else seem flat and uninteresting. Jessica Lange's acting is noticeably bad. There are some moments where Scorsese really got me and was successful at making suspense, but those moments are scattered. Mostly it's filled with \"Gotcha!\" moments and the same horror clich\u00e9s, that we've seen a hundreds of times before, melt off the screen. But most of the time, especially in the finale, it feels like we're watching a B-List Monster movie, DeNiro's character not even possessing human qualities anymore, transforming into that metaphoric monster. Cape Fear creates an odd distance between itself and the audience. It had the potential to be a great movie, but keeps the viewer at arm's length, far away from any point of connection. Though it includes a couple of nice twists, it's an over-the-top, disappointing dud. I did really draw to the last line of the picture though, \"When you live in the past, you die a little bit every day,\" it's the most moving moment of a picture that idolizes intense sexual scenes an an adult man and a minor.Rating: 4/10Grade: C-",

As anybody who's ever seen TAXI DRIVER will tell you, De Niro makes a mean psychopath and he absolutely burns up the screen here as Max Cady, a truly awful creation and one of those characters you love to hate.Scorcese goes for a deliberately old-fashioned approach to directing in this film, with lots of OTT melodrama and snazzy editing. The movie is technically proficient and the gradual unfolding of the family-in-peril menace is handled well, wringing maximum suspense from the premise. Nolte and Lange are okay as the main couple but the best performances are the supporting ones. Juliette Lewis stands out in a debut turn and would find herself menaced by further psychos for a half decade to come, while Joe Don Baker is excellent as a gumshoe character.CAPE FEAR has some notable set-pieces, such as the house siege scenario and of course the ending, which has that expert touch of a character speaking in tongues to add to the eerieness. I didn't find the film a masterpiece on the same level as some of Scorcese's other movies like GOODFELLAS or CASINO - it is a little cheesy and dated in places - but it's certainly up there as a very good effort a la GANGS OF NEW YORK.

            "content": "As if The Simpsons couldn't make it any clearer, Robert De Niro's Max Cady is a cartoon villain. With his outrageous accent, his muscular physique, his frightening intelligence and his ability to get the crap kicked out of him and come back harder and tougher, he's completely removed from reality. But that doesn't mean he isn't fun. I mean, in the aforementioned scene where he gets the crap kicked out of him \u0096 with lead pipes and bicycle chains, no less \u0096 he gets to quote Silesius while adjusting his cute little hick hat. Awesome.Then there's the scene where he holds a smoking flare in his hand. \"Granddaddy used to handle snakes in church, Granny drank strychnine. I guess you could say I had a leg up, genetically speaking.\" This sort of person only exists in nightmares and movies. He's nothing like the Max Cady that Robert Mitchum played, a character who was more believable and therefore scarier.However, De Niro's Cady does have his moments. The scene where he picks up a drunk woman at a bar and then proceeds to bite a chunk out of cheek is truly shocking. But although that moment still makes me wince, I actually find the way he punches the woman more disturbing. The brutality of it is quite overwhelming.But the film's best scene is actually the one where Cady talks to Danielle Bowden (daughter of Sam Bowden, Cady's lawyer who screwed him over). He pretends to be her drama teacher and the two have a little chat. What makes the scene so gripping is the fact that we've already seen the brutality that Cady is capable of (the biting and the punching). Therefore, when you first watch it, you're on the edge of your seat. And then there's the whole queasy sexual quality it has. Cady flirts with Danielle (Juliette Lewis' reaction when De Niro asks to put his arm around her is brilliant \u0096 the shyness and the excitement is completely genuine) and has her suck on his thumb. And then when they kiss you feel like Cady has violated the family in the sickest way possible. He's going to seduce the women of the family before tearing them apart.The seduction of Sam's wife Leigh (excellently played by Jessica Lange) is less obvious, but it is there. Right at the beginning, there's a scene where the married couple make love and afterwards we see Leigh applying her make-up. It's like she's not quite fulfilled, that she's waiting for a real man to turn up. And later on, when Leigh first meets Cady face to face, she seems disappointed by him. It's like she's been fantasising about him in private and the reality has failed to live up to expectations.But although of all of this stuff is great, and ultimately makes it a more rewarding experience than the original film, you do have to take a couple of silly moments. For instance, there's the bit where we see Cady tied to the bottom of the Bowdens' 4 x 4. By this point he's too much like a hick Terminator. And then there's the bit where Cady disguises himself as the Mexican housekeeper so that he can kill Sam's private detective. It just seems out of place in a film that, most of the time, tries to stay on the right side of reality. However, this killing is made worthwhile by the moment when the Bowden family slip on the blood surrounding the body. It's an absurd moment of clumsiness that would be left out by 99% of directors but which makes the events seem more believable somehow.But I do love the moral ambiguity that's present in the film. Yes Cady is a monster, but he also seems to be a monster of Sam's making. He suppressed evidence that might have got Cady acquitted. Therefore, as reprehensible a person as Cady is, you feel that he has a right to be angry with Sam. No matter how disgusting a person is, they're entitled to a fair defence. It's not up to a lawyer to make moral judgements (I didn't even know they had morals). So, to some extent, Sam has inflicted this misery upon himself.And it's telling that, in the end, Sam doesn't even get the satisfaction of killing Cady. Just as he's about to slam a rock into his face, Cady drifts off into the river and drowns. But in a way this also saves Sam. Killing Cady wouldn't cleanse him or purify his soul. It would be another nail in the coffin.But Cady's death is superbly filmed by Scorsese. Cady speaks in tongues and then begins singing as he disappears into the river. Even though he's dying, Cady behaves like he's victorious. Throughout the film his belief that he's on the side of the righteous is unwavering. And the way that he disappears into the water is actually quite creepy \u0096 he's like an animal vanishing into the wilderness; his death is so inhuman that you fear he'll return at any moment.Another moment I like: the way that Cady walks straight into the camera when he's released from prison. He's like a missile locked on his prey. And then there's the scene where Cady sits on the Bowdens' wall as hundreds of fireworks explode in the background. Scorsese's visual sense adds immeasurably to the film. Really, I'm not sure how anyone can claim the original is better.",

            "content": "****SPOILERS**** \"Cape Fear\" is a movie about revenge and personal guilt. The revenge is that of a recently released convict Max Cady, Robert De Niro, who spent 14 years behind bars for assault and battery. The personal guilt is that of Cady's court appointed lawyer at the time of his trial Sam Bowden, Nick Nolte, who \"buried\" evidence, that Cady's victim was very Promiscuous, that could have gotten Cady off or at least have had his sentence greatly reduced if Bowden had it admitted in court. To Bowden's credit he did have the rape charges against his client Max Cady dropped which if convicted could have had him put away for life or even executed. Never the less Bowden felt that he had to have Cady put behind bars for if he was let out he would have committed the same crimes that he was indited for or eventually murdered one of his future victims.Cady told Bowden that he really did brutalized and raped the 16 girl that he was charged with as well as committed a number of other vicious rapes that he got away with. While in jail Cady educated himself to first read and then in reading the law books in the prison library he got to know what he can and can not do to. Cady used that knowledge of the law to make life a living hell for Sam Bowden and his wife Leigh, Jessica Lange, and 15 year-old daughter Danielle, Juliette Lewis. Killing the family dog and then savagely beating Sam's law clerk and lover Lori Cady zeros in on the Bowden's for the final kill. Gripping crime drama that uncoils like a giant python and then strikes with the lighting speed of a deadly cobra as Cady drives the Bowden's out of their home and almost out of their minds. Bowden goes to the lengths of getting three thugs at the insistence of PI Claude Kersek, Joe Don Baker, to attack and beat Cady which backfired. Cady not only clobbered those three thugs who were to do the job on him but had something on Bowden because of it. Cady had secretly taped Bowed telling, and paying off, the tugs to beat him up! This had Bowden in danger of not only getting disbarred but even arrested. Bowden in desperation uses himself as well as his family as bait to get Cady to break the law and have him put away but Cody outsmarts him and ends up murdering Kersek as well and their in-house maid Garciela. The Bowden's have no choice but to leave their home in a panic to the boat-house they have docked in Cape Fear to escape the cunning as well as savage Max Cady. What Bowden, and his wife and daughter, doesn't realize until it's too late is that Cady secretly hitched a ride with them. the clever and very dangerous Cady is planing to do the Bodwen's in at the very place where they think they'll be safe and far away from him!Solid thriller that keeps you at the edge of your seat until the final credits. Only the ending is overdone by stretching it out a bit and making Cady not only incredibly smart and preceptive but also superhuman. The not so believable conclusion still didn't spoil the rest of the movie which more then made up for its endings excesses.",

I've seen many movies that scared me as much or more on different levels. This one just didn't cut it for me, there was to much INTENT to scare, that seemed the sole purpose of the movie. I prefer a good thriller to tell a story in such a way where the plot just flows and doesn't seem contrived.Now maybe the original, which I have not seen, does not have that feeling, but for me, Cape Fear, while being scary at times, as well as creepy, was trying so hard to scare that it was hard to relax and enjoy the movie. It keeps you wound up throughout and also seems overly long and while there are some positives and this isn't awful, it isn't a movie I really would want to see again.I think Cape Fear wins 5 stars on ATMOSPHERE but as to the actual movie as a whole it didn't leave me with much except \"I'm glad it's over.\"",

Scorsese has his own twisted brand of humor and horror to the story, but he also goes for so many elements that were prevalent in the original version. This makes the film feel artificial and cameos abound by actors from the first take (Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam) are more distracting than anything else.

The progression of the movie is of a downward spiral and rather predictable, however most scenes with Deniro are highly entertaining and ones with Nolte and Deniro are exceptional. Juliette Lewis puts in a satisfactory supporting role, although her character is made a complete and utter nit-wit, at times detrimentally so to the script.

Max, who educated himself in prison, now has a crazy side of logic that makes him believe he is right in what he is doing, and it soon becomes apparent that he will not stop until Bowden gets taught the \"true meaning of suffering and justice\"This is another brilliant movie from Scorsese. Robert DeNiro plays another infamous psycho at his terrifyingly best, and earned an academy award nomination for best actor.

            "content": "Martin Scorsese has directed some of the greatest films ever made: Taxi Driver, GoodFellas, Mean Streets, and Raging Bull to name a few. Now he attempts for the first time to direct a remake, not only better, but a masterpiece of punishment and guilt that will leave audiences in a shock.To those who have or haven't seen the original black and white starring Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, the film plot involved Sam Bowden (Peck), an attorney who loves his family who is being stalked Max Cady (Mitchum), a former prisoner who wants to attack Sam and his family after being falsely accused; in the new version Nick Nolte plays Bowden, whose family life is not what is seemed to be, but he's cheating with his wife, and Robert De Niro portrays the role of Cady, who's out of jail and wants to punish Sam for not getting the facts straight on his trial for which he could've been a free man fourteen years ago.Like most of Scorsese's movies, his films have narrators who tell the stories of the situation, but this one is different. Scorsese doesn't have a character narrating throughout the film like GoodFellas or Taxi Driver, but has a character do a prologue and an epilogue.As for Sam's family, his wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) is a painter who doesn't know that her husband is cheating with a legal clerk (Illeana Douglas), but at the same time is being stalked by Cady who is not after her, but after Leigh and Sam's trouble teenage daughter, Danielle (Juliette Lewis, the narrator of the film) who doesn't know that the man who's after the family is a convict, but is portrayed as a teacher and in one of the climatic scenes, the scene is portrayed as a seduction instead of a chase.The films supporting casts includes veterans in the original 1961 classic. Martin Balsam who played the cop in the original plays the judge; Robert Mitchum who played the villain plays the lead detective; and Gregory Peck who played the hero plays Cady's attorney (in which he is dress like Atticus in \"To Kill A Mockingbird\") Though this is the first film that Scorsese has directed that is not part of his roots, the film is a classic of character study in which everybody is not what they seem to be, and to show that there are bad people who are innocent and good people who have flaws.",

            "content": "If there's one thing that gets the blood of the cinema-goer boiling as their eyes light up with fury and anger, it's the word \"remake.\" Or \"reboot.\" Or \"re-imagining.\" Or whatever other flowery terms that producers throw together to describe a former franchise reborn for new audiences. Just look at the inane controversy surrounding 2016's \"Ghostbusters\" reboot or the reaction to the recent strain of horror-film retreads to see audiences practically frothing at the mouth in rage over the concept of remakes of earlier classic films, whether or not the new films themselves are decent or not. But every so often, you encounter that rare diamond in the rough... a remake that is widely appreciated and beloved, and is allowed to stand on its own without negative comparison to the original source material. Those rare films that audiences embrace despite their status as remakes of old classics. Martin Scorsese's 1991 retelling of the classic thriller \"Cape Fear\" is most certainly one of these films. It's an excellent and tense thriller in its own right, and is never weighed down by the expectations brought about by the previous iteration. It's one of those rare remakes that people adore and enjoy, able to look past its labeling as simply a modernized version of an established story.Nick Nolte stars as Sam Bowden, a lawyer who is living with his wife and daughter (Jessica Lange, Juliette Lewis), trying to rebuild his life. However, a former client named Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is released from prison, and becomes obsessed with tormenting Bowden and his family, seeking retribution for 14 years of imprisonment that he blames Bowden for, knowing that he suppressed evidence that might have lessened his sentence. Cady is cold and cunning, obsessed with vengeance and having transformed his body and mind through fanatical religious obsession and constant physical training, and seeks first to corrupt and damage everyone and everything around Bowden before targeting him for his final depraved act of vengeance. And so, Bowden and his family, torn apart from past events, must band together and work through their issues to try and stop this madman from destroying them...This very much is a film all about the performances and visual direction, where the actual storyline more-or-less takes a backseat to keen use of character and devilish aesthetics. Nolte and De Niro in particular are absolutely magnificent, and serve as just an incredible duo of adversaries to follow. Nolte's transformation from a man who is essentially a wannabe \"perfect guy\" into a terrified and damaged figment is just stunning, and De Niro hams it up to perfection with his fire-and-brimstone performance as a deranged, sociopathic lunatic who is just as entertaining as he is deadly. I also highly admired Juliette Lewis' role as Bowden's daughter, who becomes one of Cady's prime targets. She's exceptional, and it's honestly a shame she's not been getting as much high profile work over the past decade. I also really admired supporting roles by the likes of Joe Don Baker and original cast members Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck. All play their roles to perfection despite the amount of screen time given, and all help to build up the oppressive and intense world Scorsese sculpts.Scorsese delivers one of his most stylish and devious turns as a master visual storyteller in this film, and he relishes in piling on the tension and suspense with each passing moment. I've always highly admired Scorsese, even if I've only really seen a handful of his films. He's one of the great minds in cinema and he never delivers anything less than stellar in terms of storytelling. Here, he goes full-on into the insanity with a child-like glee, tossing and turning and tilting the camera whenever he can and expertly using a keen mixture of extreme close-up and wide-shots within every given seen to craft slow- building senses of paranoia and claustrophobia. But he never pushes it too far, and it always organically builds off of the scene and the emotional state of the characters he's exploring at a given moment. And he knows precisely when to slow it down or ramp it up, giving us a varied but also harrowing and entertaining experience in terror.Were I to lodge any complaints against the film, it would be that fundamentally, it's a bit overstretched and loses some steam in its second half, with a slower pacing that doesn't always match the manic energy of the performances and Scorsese's visual aesthetic. It feels as though a good 10 to 15 minutes of screen time are spent on meandering long-shots and sequences that could easily have been condensed together. Case in point is a prolonged sequence involving a sting operation lead by Joe Don Baker's Claude Kersek, with could have been pretty seamlessly cut down to a much more startling and impactful scene if its editing was a bit more abbreviated. Still, this is only a minor complaint against an otherwise exceptional thriller.As it stands, \"Cape Fear\" is definitely amongst the ranks of \"The Thing\" and \"The Fly\" as one of the more startling and high-quality remakes to come out of the Hollywood system. It's an intense and often terrifying feature that stands proud alongside the original as a valid and important retelling. And I think it's a film that's very much well worth experiencing for fans of terror and pure, emotional suspense. And so, I give it an excellent 9 out of 10.",

With thirty years between the original starring Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, and the remake with Nick Nolte and Robert De Niro, an entirely new generation can grow up with their own idea of what this scary classic is all about.The skeleton of the story is the same in both films: a paroled convict seeks revenge on the lawyer who put him behind bars. In the original, it's earie, tense, and creepy for the time. But, since the bad guy is hunky Robert Mitchum, it's a bit of a toss-up as to whether you want to root for the good guy or the bad guy. The remake is infinitely scarier. Put your kids to bed early if you rent this movie. And if there's ever a re-release in the movie theaters, don't do what my mom did and go see a late night showing by yourself. You won't be able to sleep.Nick Nolte, the charming Southern lawyer who loves his family, is easy to root for and wins over the audience in the opening scenes. Robert De Niro is the horrifying bad guy, and director Martin Scorsese takes full advantage of filming him from different scary angles and building unsettling tension during his entrance scene. If this is the first Robert De Niro movie you watch, you will be scared of him for life. In his quest to torment Nick Nolte, he starts up a relationship with Nick's underage daughter, Juliette Lewis. Those scenes are not Lolita; it's not a little taboo and a little sexual tension-this movie is frightening, upsetting, and completely earns its 'R' rating.That being said, now that I've scared the pants off you with my warning, this is a well-made movie, if you think it should have been made at all. Martin Scorsese creates an incredibly scary atmosphere, and Robert De Niro makes The Silence of the Lambs look like Dr. Seuss. This was one of the first Jessica Lange movies I ever saw, and not only does she look beautiful in this movie, but she gives a wonderful performance. I'm not even a mother, but I was moved to tears by her protectiveness of her daughter.I can't in good conscious recommend watching this movie, because of how scary it is. However, if you have your remote control nearby and are prepared and willing to fast-forward the scary scenes, then I can recommend it-but only if you really love someone in the cast or if you like horror movies. Or if you're obsessed with the original and want to see Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and Martin Balsam thirty years later! To me, those cameos were the best parts.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to extremely frightening scenes and violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.

            "content": "Scorsese's films are always clouded.  There really never seems to be a good guy and a bad guy.  It's never black and white, just lots of shades of grey. Take for example Rupert Pupkin, Henry Hill, Michael Corleone and Travis Bickle to name just a few.  Well you can add Sam Bowden to that list. Played by Nick Nolte, he is a lawyer that represented Max Cady ( DeNiro ) years ago in a rape case.  Bowden knew he was guilty and he purposely did a terrible job of representing him and consequently Cady was sent to prison for years.  Now he is out and he has revenge on his mind.This film does a magnificent job of examining two characters that hate each other and are essentially hoping to get rid of each other... for all of eternity.  But Cady has a little more evil intentions than Bowden thought he did.Cape Fear tells us that everybody is tainted.  Everyone has that dark side to them.  From Cady, to Bowden's wife and daughter right down to the police officer that tells Bowden to take the law into his own hands.  Cape Fear is about our dark side.  And if this isn't Scorsese's best film , it certainly is his most entertaining.  Teaming with Scorsese's Amblin Entertainment seems to have given him a bigger budget to try a few more things than he could in past movies, and this has angered some purists that think that Scorsese should remain Scorsese.  But I like the slight change.  It looks good and I like this film.  It is a fun and interesting look at fear and darkness.  And the tag line is great.  There is nothing there in the light that isn't there in the dark, except fear itself.  That kind of sums up the creepy feel of the movie.",

So now DeNiro has come back to stalk Nolte and his family for revenge. Quite predictable and few surprises. And somehow, DeNiro's character is just super, super smart, savvy and able to accomplish anything so he can be creepy.Robert DeNiro's horrendous southern accent is horrendous, making what could be a serviceable but predictable thriller into a comedy in every scene he is in. Sometimes you have to question the decisions of directors to force actors to play parts that may not be necessary, such as that of a southern criminal. But if you're going to butcher it so badly that any American will laugh his/her ass off, you're never going to pull off a thriller. As it moves on, it becomes more preposterous and choppy editing and absurd ending that is more worthy of a first time director. It was hard for me not to get a good long laugh at the twisted, overly long ending. If this movie didn't have the cast and DeNiro's name it would probably rate a 3-5.This film is only redeemed by mostly excellent performances by the cast, a great Jessica Lange and a fantastic Juliette Lewis. DeNiro does what he can but that accent is truly cringeworthy and out of place. This is a \"nothing to do what's on cable?\" movie.

            "content": "The film starts with a teenage girl recounting her time in \"Cape Fear\", supposedly setting the scene for what's to follow, yet it's never actually established where Cape Fear is - do the characters ever actually visit Cape Fear? It's not clear to me.Either way, the crux of the film is indeed fear - Max Cady / Robert de Niro is released from prison and seeks retribution against his public defender (Sam Bowdon / Nick Nolte), on the basis that the lawyer didn't do his job sufficiently well. Whether that allegation is justified is an ongoing question in the film and is left for the viewer to judge, which I feel is engaging and is reminiscent of Studio Ghibli's blurred lines between good and evil.Murky moral questions furthermore arise amongst other characters; perhaps as murky as their backstories. Sam Bowdon and his love interest (Leigh) speak to the girl (Danielle) in a way like they only recently met her (maybe a step-child?); and he speaks to Leigh like they've been together a year or two. It eventually becomes apparent (not through any plot twist or shock announcement) that we were meant to understand that in fact, Leigh has always been the wife; and is the mother to Danielle.The lack of clarity about the characters' relationships is perhaps correlated to the difficulty in deciding who to support, as a viewer. Is this person good? Are they bad? Well who are they anyway?In seeking revenge, Max is revealed to be quite capable and on multiple occasions, he surprises his victims, leaving little to no explanation for them, or even the audience, as to how his actions could've actually been possible. A common explanation for viewers seems to be \"prison stuff, you know\".This lack of believability only continues to build upon itself as the film progresses. Events occur with explanations that are weak or even incongruent; and no resolution for what's supposed to happen next - are things supposed to just work themselves out?The plot holes happen least with Sam, so we're kind of pushed to siding with him, but I just never ended up liking him too much; and couldn't really see why the characters liked him either :/",

Why in the name of all that is holy would you want to come off a professional high like \"Goodfellas,\" and remake a film that was a substandard piece of filmmaking in all areas? (with the exception of Robert Mitchum as Max Cady) Not a smart choice here. Marty tried to go commercial and created one of the goofiest films of his career. DeNiro's Max Cady is more humorous than Rupert Pupkin. Nolte is okay as the now corruptible lawyer. Jessica Lange tried to be a Method actor in this film. What results is a series of monologues that were obviously improvised with no real emotion and no real thought behind it. Strasberg rolled over in the grave a lot during takes. Most grating on the nerves is Juliette Lewis as the daughter who spends more time playing with her braces (lovely, by the way) than with her character. She ignores characterization at every turn and presents nothing but a whining, sex crazed cheerleader. Joe Don Baker gives the only interesting performance as the P.I./cop who tries to teach Nolte protection. His performance mirrors that of his chilling portrayal in the Don Siegel classic, \"Charley Varrick.\" Other than Baker, the performances are dull and flat, as is the film itself.",

Lee Thompson), where Gregory Peck was the attorney Sam Bowden, Robert Mitchum acted as villain Max Cady while Martin Balsam was Police Chief Mark Dutton. In this version, Robert De Niro is the wild beast Max Cady, Nick Nolte acted very well, a bit weaker than the former, as attorney Bowden, then Mitchum was the Lieutenant Elgart instead of Mark Dutton (Police Chief), Peck the Cady's Attorney, and old Martin Balsam acted as the judge. Instead of Teddy Savalas as the detective the film had an effective Joe Don Baker in this role. This version has some changes in the behavior of the main persons of the film compared with the former one, for example Cady, instead of causing panic to the Bowden's daughter, he tried to persuade her to consume marihuana and to do whatever was forbidden by her parents. He wanted her to fall in love with him. This Cady was also more violent than the previous one, and it seems that he had seven lives as a cat, because he was heavily attacked and hurt, but he continued to be as violent and aggressive as usual. Attorney Bowden had extramarital relationship with another lady. Always sexy Jessica Lange played the role of Bowden's wife in a more provocative way than Polly Bergen in the previous one. In general the film has more violent scenes than the first version, but technically and dramatically is a very good remake.",

            "content": "I remember when Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck starred in the 1961 version of \"Cape Fear\", and - no matter how dated it would be today - it scared the heck out of me. I was well into adulthood at that time, and can only surmise that I either wasn't paying too much attention to some of the gruesome crimes during that era - there must have been some! - or \"stalking\" was not as much as a phenomenon as we know it today. Too, if someone acted-out as menacingly as DeNiro did in the newer version, I'm sure they wouldn't have been walking-around on the streets then. Let's admit it, cops were feerer then to arrest kooky people and ask questions later. Maybe we should go back to that? I'm not really certain how I learned there was a newer version of \"Cape Fear\", but I snatched it up with enthusiasm in memory of the first. I did read, before I saw it, that DeNiro had \"bulked-up\" for the role. My hair stood on end from the first scene of DeNiro's tattooed, muscular body. My hair standing on end would have been a fete, because it was and is long. I was in so much shock to see the maniacal look in his eyes, I don't think I was able to make a decision \"should I or shouldn't I\"? No chance of me coming out of that trance through-out the entire film, so certain was I that he'd jump-out at any time. If his intention was to let you see the craze simmering beneath the surface, he didn't have to do much to convince me - I saw it! Yes, I did enjoy the mundane scenes with Nolte, Lange and Lewis - they all were terrific in their roles - but, the fear was in me. Reading some of the comments posted here, I now realize that was a messed-up family, pretty-much like today's. I now can understand that DeNiro was nuts because he had been done wrong to be sent unfairly to prison, but his openly vengeful approach to his role guaranteed he'd have gone insane, even if he'd been guilty. I tried to sympathize with him - from a distance. Had I seen him sitting on my fence, I just may have been scared enough to hire the goons to keep him away. After the family learned for certain he was out to get them, I was amazed Juliette Lewis found it arousing to talk to him on the 'phone - a fascination with danger? - NO WAY would I have gone to meet him alone, not even in a crowded park. I don't think I took one breath the whole time during their scene in the theater. It was brilliant. After she came to her senses to stay away and all those gruesome acts of violence occurred, following a night locked-up in my house, I would have been the one to cut-out, with disguises.I agree that DeNiro's hitching a ride under the car was a bit much - but I still look under mine. And, didn't that lady who saw him go in the restroom and come out with darker hair know there was something a little bit unusual going-on? You can be sure I was in total shock during the entire finale. He couldn't have done anything to hurt me during the scenes inside the boat - I'd have died at his first appearance. All this craziness was entirely appropriate for the maniac he'd become, but it was superb - his death-scene was entirely fitting for such a ranting monster. Thank heavens no one knocked on my door.....I come late to watching all these marvelous movies, in the safety of my home.....VHS and DVD. I know nothing about insightful collaboration between certain actors and directors, but if that's what made this film so sensational, I'm voting for it - 9-to-10 - but, I can still watch it only up to a certain point.

She, in the beginning, thought that DeNiro was a good guy, but then suddenly she changes her mind, so it didn't make much sense the impression of her becoming a DeNiro's character's ally.

At first I felt the urge to snicker. Everything seemed so much more overdone - too many zooms, camera going everywhere, almost needlessly. Upon first watching Robert DeNiro so quickly after Robert Mitchum's masterful performance, DeNiro seemed kind of jokey -- but I have to admit that the longer I stayed with it, the more I loved DeNiro's performance. And the more I liked everyone else's performance, too. The only thing I remembered about seeing this movie theatrically in 1991 was how very good Juliette Lewis was - and that impression was reaffirmed tonight, 12 years later.So, I had a good time with the remake too, and I think both films are good, just different. If I had to pick only one I'd stick with the original for sure -- but I must say that despite some flaws in the 1991 version (it's too long; the cameos by Peck, Mitchum and Balsam are corny IMO), it was entertaining. And Robert DeNiro's interpretation of this villain was positively deadly, fearful and intimidating. *** out of ****",

The plot is essentially the same but some gratuitous profanity and sexual content has been added to cater to the elements of modern day cinema. That certainly doesn't improve it any. Nolte's character seems a little whiny, nothing like Peck's more courageous portrayal in the original film and DeNiro, excellent actor that he is, actually can not save this film. Director Martin Scorsese also tries but also can't make this film work. A usually dependable supporting cast is also wasted. One of the ultimate wastes of star talent.

            "content": "Director: Martin Scorsese,Script:Wesley Strick/James R.Webb Cast: Robert De Niro, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Juliette LewisThis is a Martin Scorsese remake of Cape Fear from 1962. It is about a convict who is out of prison after 15 years of incarceration. We are not talking about a nice man here to say the least. He committed horrific crimes against women,brutal rapes etc. The convict,Max Cady(played by Robert De Niro), goes after his lawyer(played by Nick Nolte) for withholding evidence that could have resulted in the charges being dropped. He starts to terrorize his family and eventually befriends their daughter.Although a remake, it is not the exact same script. Wesley Strick makes a few changes. I will stop short of saying this is the better film but some of the changes in the plot are actually an improvement. For example, the motivation for Max Cady to terrorize Sam Bowden(his former lawyer)was because as I stated earlier, he withheld important information that would have kept him from getting convicted. I can't remember the motivation in the original but I remember it being much weaker. Secendly, in this remake, Sam Bowden(Nick Nolte) is truly terrified by this guy whereas Gregory Peck in the original doesn't show the same level of fear and actually stands up to Max Cady much of the time. Thirdly, the scenario with the daughter is different. Here we have the opposite. In the original the daughter(Lori Martin)is terrified of Max Cady while in the remake, the daughter(Juliette Lewis) is distrustful at first but she eventually becomes intrigued by him.That being said, I thing the original had a better overall style. I actually think the Cape Fear remake to be more like Taxi Driver (another Scorsese/De Niro production)and the original Cape Fear to be more like Night of the Hunter(also starring Robert Mitchum). Robert Mitchum is very creepy as Max Cady (much as he is in Night of the Hunter). His style makes him the ultimate bad guy. Robert De Niro is adequate and even creepy at times but as is typical of most of his acting it is often over the top. The original is one of the last of the \"Film Noirs\". Its black and white photography works in its favor.",

Too long if you would ask him. Too long because of an error that his defender committed. Since he has been in jail, he has learned to read and has studied all the laws himself and he's convinced that his attorney didn't use a vital document, which would have kept him out of jail. Now he is free again and he is looking for revenge which he'll ultimately find by stalking and trying to murder his ex-defender and his family.Like I already said, this movie could have gone by unnoticed, but thanks to the actors' performances and the good direction, this movie is certainly worth a watch.

            "content": "The original Cape Fear is one of those hidden gems that was well-reviewed and well-revered, but so few people discuss it that when one catches it on TV they are taken aback by how potent and suspenseful it truly is. This works somewhat against Martin Scorsese's remake in that the original is a film that does not show its age and thus is not really a necessary candidate for a remake. Those who have not seen the original may well rate this film higher than I have.The film opens with the release of brutal ex-con Max Cady (Robert DeNiro) who makes a beeline to a small Southern town to launch a reign of terror on attorney Nick Nolte and his family. Apparently Nolte did not represent DeNiro at his best when he realized DeNiro was guilty in an assault and DeNiro holds him responsible for his time served. The harassment systematically escalates from pettiness to outright physical assault to murder culminating in a confrontation at Cape Fear.There are a number of things that work well in the remake. Scorsese's decision to keep Bernard Herrmann's chilling score from the original and the surreal Saul Bass-inspired opening credits are among them. The screenplay remains largely faithful in its essentials to the original film and that is for the best.Whereas Gregory Peck, Polly Bergen and especially Robert Mitchum were performing at their peak, the acting in the remake is a mixed bag. Nolte turns in his best performance as the morally ambiguous attorney - a strong piece of acting much more impressive than his Oscar-nominated turn from The Prince of Tides the same year. Jessica Lange, fury barely repressed as his put-upon cuckolded wife, turns in the best performance in the film in a role that could have been forgettable. By contrast, the much-acclaimed work from DeNiro and Juliette Lewi (as the teenage daughter) seems less impressive. The daughter has been re-imagined from a normal red-blooded young girl into a paragon of dysfunction. Lewis plays with her hair, mumbles her lines and fidgets all over the place. This may be an actress's dream role, but she comes across as dim-witted, slightly trashy and annoying - attributes that limit the concern we have for her when DeNiro begins to menace her. DeNiro is off the deep end, and not in a good way. Mitchum's Cady was utterly chilling, in part because he was always credible and was able to attack the family in such brilliant ways that they could do nothing about it. DeNiro plays the part as though he were auditioning for Freddy Kruger. His Max Cady is a fantastic boogeyman capable of near-ludicrous feats that ultimately - particularly in the final third - strain credibility at every turn. The incident under the car may be creepy on first glimpse, but utterly foolish when one thinks too long on it and far less convincing than how Mitchum trailed the family in the original.The update also makes a mistake that modern films make in thinking that it is somehow more fascinating/terrifying by showing morally flawed protagonists being victimized. Underneath the surface, there seems to be a Puritan mindset that maybe they have it coming a little bit because they are so dysfunctional. In reality, the opposite is far more frightening. It is infinitely scarier when an upright person does all the right things and manages to still be targeted by evil - it happens all the time. One does not have to do something to invite it in as this (and many) films seem to believe.Scorsese's direction is first-rate throughout and he demonstrates what a flair he has for thrillers. He does lose it a bit at the climax though with the old is-he-dead-or-is-he-coming-back clich\u00e9 and setting everything during a howling storm with white water rapids gushing about. It has a tendency to come across as an assault on the senses and a wall of noise. Even wih those flaws, this definitely ranks as one of the better remakes, but one would do even better by catching the original film on cable. Or, even better, see them both and contrast.",

From quickly edited uses of negatives, spinning disorientating camera movements, to the iconic scene of Cady walking into the camera, it's very bizarro stuff, you can almost hear Stone making notes for NBK.But seeing now as an adult and a parent, it's very disturbing stuff, especially the scenes involving Lewis and De Niro. Seeing the film as a fifteen year old gave me a very different experience to what it saw recently.

There's a palpable sense of suspense to the picture, an ominous quality that you can never quite put your finger on. The strength of this aspect allows the movie's sillier moments to sort of slip between the cracks, adding to its off-kilter vibe rather than ruining its horror. The film is tense and engaging throughout. It's often rather uncomfortable, too, and Cady truly is a creep. You're firmly on the side of Nolte's increasingly dishevelled protagonist, which makes the experience all the more compelling. It heads towards an inevitable, explosive finale and manages to stick the landing, even if it does get a little too over-the-top for its own good. It also features some almost avant-garde directorial decisions which, for the most part, work well. They add to its somewhat 'Hitchcock' feel, something that's hammered home even more by the use of Bernard Herrman's score from the original movie. It proves that scariness doesn't have to be conventional or, even, 'modern'. It's pretty great. 8/10",

            "content": "Riveting. Suspenseful. Thoughtful. Well-planned. Well-acted. If this is Scorsese's bid for the commercial big time, then let the cash registers ring. Menacing. Psychologically thin. Routinely generic. Excessive. Misanthropic. These things are also true of this Cape Fear remake. I'm sorry. My words are all coming in fragments. This movie is so overwhelming that distanced critical perspective has not yet fully taken hold...which is exactly what Cape Fear wants. This movie aims for your gut. And Scorsese is a precision marksman. Here's one or two things I do know about Cape Fear. This is a very smart remake of what was already a remarkably disturbing movie in 1962. It adds putrefactive psychological dimensions to 1962's perfect little family unit set upon by a mad stalker (De Niro's Max Cady) determined to mete out his own brand of justice to the attorney (Nolte) whose lax defense was responsible for the harsh prison term Cady served. Instead of 1962's righteous and unblemished family, the new version depicts them as already crumbling from within before Cady ever appears to shake up their world. Infidelities plague the marriage and the 15-year-old daughter's emergent sexuality and rebellious streak troubles her parents. Cady cunningly grabs hold of those fissures and rips them wide open. Aspects that were only nuances in the original are more disturbingly overt in the current go-around. Also using three actors (Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck and Martin Balsam) from the original in cameo roles in the remake is a nice touch. Equally successful is Elmer Bernstein's adaptation of Bernard Herrmann's dynamic 1962 musical score. The acting performances in this remake are also extraordinary with De Niro brilliantly essaying another one of his lunatic fringe characters (even if at times you suspect that his goal is to out Travis Bickel, Travis Bickel). Nolte is in top form and as the daughter, Lewis is a perfect blend of precocity and innocence. Lange's character, however, has potential depths that are never plumbed -- she's more of a connective character than a true protagonist. Whether this is due to Scorsese's \"woman problem\" or Lange's acting skills, I'm not fully sure. It's also a true fact that Scorsese is one of the cinema's most gifted practitioners, one who both builds on the past and sets the agenda for the future. Cape Fear abounds with stylistic flourishes and razor-sharp edits. Still, one gets the feeling the Scorsese may have kept some of his bravura strokes in check with the goal of achieving more mainstream box office success. And along those lines, Cape Fear may not be as menacing and evil as it sets out to be. For when all is said and done, the family unit survives and perseveres. In fact, it has probably been made stronger by this test and thus, the status quo is upheld. They were right to worry about their daughter's rambunctious sexuality. They were right to presume that infidelity could tear them asunder. As with all Scorsese movies there's also a moral battlefield that must be crossed before closure is reached. Cape Fear raises complex questions regarding justice, though Cady's depiction of such utter evil is an unequal match for his former attorney's more nebulous moral position. With his torso tattooed with Biblical vengeance references, Cady is almost a cartoon of evil incarnate. (His multiple deaths and returns to life during the film's final half-hour are straight out of generic suspense formulas.) In the end, traditional morality is upheld, the bile has been eviscerated and humanity has been dragged down just one notch further in its attempt to outwit the Devil.The blood is on our hands, though we've spent the last two hours on the edge of our seats.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear is an example of an auteur bringing his personal style of film-making to a genre movie. The result is a film that straddles both the director's unique sensibility and more generic thriller elements. The original Cape Fear was a straight thriller, albeit one which was controversial in its day; Scorsese's version takes that template and complicates things. The Bowdens here are no sanitised nuclear family, instead they are a family in crisis. The father is an adulterer, the mother is indifferent and the daughter, as a result, is deeply unhappy. The psychopath Max Cady is not only a sadistic menace but also a catalyst for all the problems inherent in the Bowdens already. In this way Scorsese creates a narrative with a lot fewer moral certainties than the original. Nothing is black and white here but various shades of grey. Even the historical connections between Sam Bowden and Cady are made less certain. He is not a man who bravely intervened when Cady was assaulting a woman, instead he is a lawyer who withheld evidence that would have helped his client. Although the latter action is completely understandable given Cady's vile nature, it is a considerable difference from the original good vs. evil relationship between the two men. While the other significant difference in character relationship is between Cady and the daughter Danielle. In this film he gains her trust and plays on her difficult relationship with her father; this of course results in a very uncomfortable and transgressive scene in the school basement. All in all this is a much more complex film.It isn't one of Scorsese's best though, because eventually he has to adhere to more clich\u00e9d genre conventions. The final confrontation on the boat seems like it belongs in a different film. Its an overly sensational finale that feels like it was a requirement fulfilled by Scorsese as part of his agreement to make a commercial movie for the studio. That said this is still a good film helped rather a lot by the cast. De Niro is pretty unforgettable of course. But Juliette Lewis really impresses in an emotionally deep and difficult role, while Nick Nolte's character is a complex one which he handles with great skill. Add to this some nice visual touches and a new version of the classic Bernard Herrmann score and you have some great cinematic aspects to add to the quality dramatics from the great acting ensemble.In many ways this was a very different kind of film from Martin Scorsese. Even though he is a great lover of genre cinema, up to that point in time he hadn't really made many such pictures. The film itself proves that he can never truly abandon his personalised uncompromising style, and while this provides most of the most interesting elements of the movie it doesn't entirely gel totally successfully with the standard thriller and action scenes that typify the final section of the movie. But a not entirely successful Scorsese film is still a pretty good one by most people's standards.",

            "content": "Preliminaries are the most enjoyable sexual moments, the growing intimacy, the warmth, a progressive sensation of hotness and a frenetically built up pleasure before it reaches its climax \u0085 now, consider this climax as the final confrontation between you and your personal enemy, the one who reminds you of your inner demons, those you'll only get rid of through a confrontation. Imagine this is the climax, well, Martin Scorsese's \"Cape Fear\" is about the preliminaries \u0085 the set-up before the inevitable culmination of violence \u0085 and fear as the insupportable preliminaries: waiting before the ultimate fight \u0085These are the ingredients of suspense: waiting with the perfect awareness that there will be a confrontation \u0085 we just don't know when, where and how it will happen. And we don't know what will be the conclusion. But fear is so intolerable it either defeats you before the fight, or awakes an inner part of you that needed a shock to resurrect. This shock is Max Cady, an ex-convict who was just released from jail after 14 years, and the target is Sam Bowden, who was his lawyer and hid some precious information that might have served Cady's case, a serious one : rape. Those two characters were portrayed by Robert Mitchum, in an iconic villainous performance ranked as #28 in the American Film Institute's Top 50 Villains, and Gregory Peck, as the lawyer. Now, this is Marty's remake with Nick Nolte, and Robert De Niro, in one of his most memorable, and hypnotic performances.And when you read the story, you realize the relevance of Marty's remake. This is indeed a Scorsesian theme, a man sinned and was condemned, but behind the sin, another fault has been committed by Sam Bowden. He's not a bad man actually, he lives in a nice small town's residence in the South, with a nice family, a nice doggy, a big house, nothing is missing, not even the Mexican maid \u0085 but these are not clich\u00e9s, because Jessica Lange as the wife perfectly highlights the uncertainty of the family's happiness and Sam's own male weaknesses. The movie starts as a cat-and-mouse thriller without a chase; Max harasses the family, without letting much knowledge about his intentions. He doesn't seem to need money \u0085 he doesn't attack directly the family, but each of his hits, leaves a powerful impact, showing how he's to be taken with a lot of seriousness. Here starts the fear \u0085. And if in the beginning, we feel empathetic towards Sam, his reactions in the Cady situation are revealing of some weaknesses that help the story because they elevate him above the uninteresting status of victim, and prevent the film from falling in the trap of victim vs. bad-guy formula \u0085 but Scorsese would never allow that.In this film, Nolte plays a rather 'uninteresting' character, but interesting in this characteristic, not particularly handsome, very frightened, and passive, he never confronts Max while Max is more direct, takes risk, sounds more fearless \u0085 in a way, Max is more a man than Sam, he's got guts, he's got passion, he's got a way with women \u0085 while Sam just hides himself, when he's talking to an ex-mistress, when he knows Max is coming to him after beating the three men hired to hit him \u0085 he just hides, because he knows for once, Law can't protect him. To make things clear, he didn't sin by letting Max in jail, but because of his cowardice, his attitude, of letting time do its job, and the police its duty. Now, whatever he tries, he fails, and Max will progressively increase the pressure by approaching him through the most precious thing he has in this world, his daughter, Danielle, played by a superbly fragile and emotional Juliette Lewis.Fear poisons Sam's heart, and the more he hides it, the more it follows him \u0085 when he admits his fears to Kersek, Joe Don Baker as the private eye helping him, there was an interesting conversation about the South historically built on fear, of the Natives, the slaves, the North etc. And this is the central element. I don't think the point of Marty, a man from the North, was to say that the significant cultural elements of a region's identity should be tolerated even if they were built on fear, no, these things are negative and must change. Fear develops the lowest instincts, killing from behind, refusing the confrontation, escaping, until fighting when you're cornere, like a rat \u0085 Escaping might help you on the short term but sooner or later, the problems you try to escape from, comes back. As Cady points out: \"you can't escape your demons just by leaving home\" And this is how the thriller is even more powerful.Indeed, a thriller loses its intensity when you know the goal of the villain, here you don't know exactly. If Max wanted to kill them, he would have done it. And he didn't plan to kill them while they were in the boat in \"Cape Fear\", otherwise, he would have done it in their home \u0085so his desire was more profound, it was to make Sam face his own faults, admit them, and let the truth be spoken, for a last burst of anger, an explosion of all the dark feelings and resentments repressed for so many years \u0085 Cady was Sam's redemption as Sam was Cady's redemption.Marty's remake is a powerful retelling of a thrilling suspense movie, revisited with the Scorsesian touch, inviting the stars of the original film Martin Balsam, Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum to memorable cameos. The casting is superb and Robert De Niro as Max Cady is absolutely frightening, and contrasting with Nick Nolte's ordinariness, as a man whose last fight against fear was won in a cape of the same name \u0085 a man who had to be cornered like a rat, to fight, but ultimately, he fought",

Taking many elements from Hitchcock films, Scorsese directs the plot in ways that maintains the tension & suspense throughout and doesn't hold back when it comes to violent aspects either. Fans of the filmmaker may consider it a departure but it still delivers the goods.What gives the film its uneasy ambience is Robert De Niro's downright demented & ruthless performance. His character is as despicable as he is dangerous and every time he's on screen, he gives off a creepy vibe that further ratchet up the unnerving aura. Nick Nolte holds his own and the rest chip in with solid inputs too while kinetic camerawork, gruesome violence & steady pace make sure the interest never fizzles out.Overall, Cape Fear is a skilfully directed, finely scripted & brilliantly acted thriller that packs enough style and isn't devoid of substance either. The barbarity depicted may turn away some viewers and the climactic sequence appears a bit overdone too but this psychological shocker nonetheless remains a sufficiently satisfying entry, and is worth viewing for De Niro's chilling act alone. In short, another fabulous effort by the director-actor duo.",

While he's not considered as one who directs scary movies, thanks to all the elements he has implemented in the movie, Scorsese managed to create a good scary story.Elements in horror movies such as: suspense, tension, dark light, looming threat and dark secrets are key features that should be implanted in every type of horror movie.Our story focuses on a convict who seeks revenge against his lawyer who barried his case, in searching his lawyer, the convict wishes to hurt his lawyer badly in the ways of god.Robert DeNiro portrays (perfectly I should add) the criminal Max Cady, he was always one step ahead of his victims and the system, in some odd moments I found myself even rooting for him which was weird because I knew he was one heck of a villain.DeNiro stole the spotlight in this film so I don't have much to say or talk about the other characters, I just didn't find them as intriguing as I thought them to be.One thing I would have liked to see in terms of the story was if Max Cady would have achieved his goal, cause he was so smart and knew what to do that it only made sense for him to win.In conclusion, I did like this type of genre that Scorsese decided to direct, normally it's unusual for a director who is known for a specific genre to direct something different.

            "content": "**minor spoilers**It is with somewhat mixed feelings that I review Martin Scorsese's \"Cape Fear.\" Taken on its own, it is a well-made, tautly directed thriller with knockout performances from Robert DeNiro and Nick Nolte. However, as a Scorsese film, it is somewhat lacking. This is the most commercial work he has given us to date; although it has afforded him the opportunity to work with a larger budget, going mainstream has compromised its artistic qualities. Roger Ebert has stated it thus: \"The result seems to be a certain impersonality in a film by this most personal of directors - the Scorsese touch on a genre piece, rather than a film torn out of the director's soul.\" It lacks that \"special touch,\" and one can't shake the feeling that he may have been a hired gun this time around. Although I admired its craft--indeed, I would not have felt as ambivalent if it had been done by just about anyone else--this is just not a film he really felt passionate about. For him, it was probably little more than a career opportunity.Nonetheless, I cannot ignore its positive aspects. This is a very well-made film, masterfully done in all the technical areas; the photography and editing are first-rate. There is genuine suspense as Cady, an ex-convict stalks the family of his former lawyer, with a dark sense of dread hinting at something terrible on the horizon. Robert DeNiro's character is fairly two-dimensional, lacking the complexity of Travis Bickle in his earlier collaboration with Scorsese, \"Taxi Driver.\" Nonetheless, he plays a very convincing psycho. As the daughter, Juliette Lewis does an adequate job, but I have always been somewhat lukewarm towards her as an actress, and quite frankly she isn't much to look at. Nonetheless, the most intriguing aspect of the film is her attraction towards Cady, ready and willing to take advantage of her budding sexuality. There is a moment where it seems she is prepared to run off with him, and on some level, I wished that she had done so. Jessica Lange has a somewhat thankless role as the wife.Nick Nolte plays the lawyer determined to protect his family at all costs. Yet, there is a degree of moral ambiguity at work; as it turns out, he deliberately withheld information during the trial--information that could have helped his case--simply because he personally found Cady's crimes too repugnant to deserve a fair hearing. Chances are the result would have been the same, but then again he might have been a free man if he played his cards right. He is also willing to resort to shady measures against Cady--even hiring goons to beat him. In such a situation, how far is too far?The finale is well-done, to be sure, but lacks inspiration; one could forget that Scorsese directed it at all. It also recalls memories of these old slasher movies where the killer has superhuman strength beyond that of ordinary mortals. Granted, it is satisfying and viscerally compelling, but not worthy of many of the director's achievements. \"Cape Fear\" happens to be a remake of a 1962 thriller, which was a much better film from all accounts (incidentally, its star, Gregory Peck, has a supporting role as Cady's own lawyer), so why bother? Still, it's much better than the \"Psycho\" remake. Scorsese's themes of guilt and redemption are present as always, but the film still feels like something any competent director could do.*** (out of ****)Released by Universal Pictures",

Fourteen years later, the psychopath, who worked on his body and education in prison, comes out of it even crazier and more dangerous and begins to stalk and terrorize the lawyer and his family.This psychological thriller by Martin Scorsese is a remake of the eponymous 1962 film, starring Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, who both, in supporting roles, also appear in this film.The basic premise promises a tense and heavy film that will keep you on the edge of your chair. Unfortunately, it did not. Although it has a quality script, Scorsese's direction is good by default, and the cast is even better, the film was unconvincing to me and did not for a moment draw me into an atmosphere of tension and anxiety.I think the problem is that the actors, although otherwise fantastic, somehow didn't fit into these roles. Scorsese and De Niro seem to be tied with an umbilical cord (nine films and the tenth on the horizon) and that combination has brought us some cult classics. But this time, De Niro is so over-the-top that, instead of being scary, he turned out to be comical, Juliette Lewis unconvincing, and Nick Nolte plain boring.Ironically, it was De Niro and Lewis who were nominated for an Oscar that year, as the only two nominations for this film. I'm not saying that they acted badly, but that, at least from my perspective, they are not compatible with the roles assigned to them, which are probably intended to deepen the characterization, quite two-dimensional in the original, but now too overemphasized, and at moments even ridiculous.It is also interesting that Scorsese directed \"Cape Fear\" somewhat based on Hitchcock's style, and in several scenes, one can recognize quite obvious homages to some of Hitchcock's classics. Even the music for the film, in addition to rearranged music by Bernard Herman from the original, includes unused parts of Herman's composition for Hitchcock's \"Torn Curtain.\"All in all, although Scorsese can do it much better, and I certainly wouldn't rewatch it, \"Cape Fear\" has its moments and it's worth a look.7/10.",

That being said, I have looked into it a bit and feel that Martin Scorsese did make some worthwhile additions to the story.Turning the focus of the film towards the flaws in the legal system and the moral ambiguity of it's protagonist adds a layer of depth to the cat and mouse tale. It makes some compelling points on the way rape cases are mishandled that have grown all the more relevant since the film's release.Outside of the messaging, it's just a straight to the point and very effective thriller. Robert De Niro's portrayal of the smart mouthed villain is pitch perfect, and an important reminder that despite his more recent string of Grandpa/Focker embarrassments, that he is one of the all time greats, with this role sitting among his finest performances.I would have almost given this movie a perfect score if it weren't for the downright silly notion that someone could hitch themselves underneath a car and ride undetected all the way to a lake house. An idea so laughable that it was almost begging for The Simpsons' inevitable parody.Since it's now been a good 30 years since this film was released, I suppose it's high time that someone remade it again, though if they do, I'll probably roll my eyes and skip it.",

            "content": "The very logic of the film is quite common (Stephen King or Richard Bachman among many others have used it in his novel Thinner). A criminal is sentenced to a long term in prison but the sentence is all the longer because the criminal's lawyer decided that since his client was guilty he could forget some important element that would have changed the length of the prison term. The prisoner gets out of prison one day and comes back to haunt the lawyer and get his vengeance. That's when the film gets particularly nasty and the lawyer reveals himself quite ugly when fear grasps his guts, revealing the little trust he has in justice and the police. And sure enough the end will be positive for that ugly character of a lawyer who deserved to really suffer and die. But that's when Scorsese plays with our nerves and makes the lawyer's daughter fall in love with the criminal for all the bad reasons you can imagine but then she will turn nasty with him for all the good reasons you may find. In other words everything is upside down and nothing will ever bring them back upside up because what counts is what we have in our minds and memories and not what the world believes. A great small little film that does hold us in suspense and apprehension.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",

The outline is basically the same, with Max Cady(DeNiro) out of jail after eight years for rape. His lawyer, Sam(Nick Nolte, Gregory Peck in the original) gave little effort in his defense, and so the ex-con tracks down the attorney and his family and the bad times begin. Their dog is poisoned and Sam can't prove it. He hires thugs to beat up Max, but he injures them. He then hires a lawyer(Ironically Gregory Peck in a role reversal) to file charges against Sam. The other casting twist is having Mitchum play a police lieutenant this time, who fails to prove anything against Max. It all leads to an epic battle at Cape Fear, and Scorcese did nothing to improve on the already weak ending of the first film. Overall, not a bad movie, but I personally prefer Mitchum and Peck over DeNiro and Nolte.",

Here is the project Scorsese swapped with Steven Spielberg who ended up doing Schindler's List and both men made wise choices, playing to their own strength. Here Scorsese shows remakes can be good if the right people are involved.Set in the small town of New Essex in Southern America, private practice lawyer Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) lives happily enough with his wife Leigh (Jessica Leigh) and 15-year-old daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis), who has to go to summer school for smoking cannabis. Max Cady (Robert De Niro) had just been released from prison after serving 14 years for raping a 16-year-old girl. During his time in prison he ends up reading law books, philosophy and the bible, exercises and tattooed his body. He blames Sam for why he was sent to private and starts to stake his family, following them, killing the family pet, hoovering outside their property, basically making their live hell. He even attacks and rapes a friend of Sam who was a law clerk. Cady is also a cleaver, arrogant and psychopathic. He tries to justify his actions, plays mind games and uses the law against Sam and make him feel powerless. Sam ends up taking desperate messages, hiring a private investigator (Joe Don Baker), and even ends up using violence to try and stop Cady. Cady use mind games and even tries to get at Sam by using his daughter.This is a strong film, with Robert De Niro on form as a psycho, and Martin Scorsese direction is brilliant always. He has such a good style and wonderful shots, as well as good casting choices, especially in the supporting cast. There is a strong script and a powerful score by Elmer Bernstein. Sam is a sympathetic and well-developed character and Cady would be anyone's worst nightmare. Cady is how a stalker would functioned and use the outskirts of the law to avoid getting arrested. As well the law is shown to be hopeless like it did in real life, with the police and court sometimes targeting the wrong person. The film is about how someone could be driven to they dark side to protect their family and how someone else could be so warp in the head to justify what they have done. Cady also shows that he can be charming which proves to be a useful weapon. The film also raises a good point about rape cases, with the idea just because a victim may be promiscuous it doesn't mean someone has a right to rape her.The film is brutal and violence, which is excepted from a Scorsese film, but he never over does it. There are reasons behind it and not over done compared to say someone like the overrated Mel Gibson.However, they is one problem with this film, which is no fault of its own: I kept thinking of the Simpsons' parody episode Cape Feare.4 out of 5.",

            "review_title": "Overblown, but it's still a more than satisfying remake (MINOR SPOILERS)",
            "content": "After spending 14 years in prison Max Cady (Robert De Niro) turns his attentions to Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) whom acted as his defence attorney at his trial. After being incarcerated for 14 years Cady starts to unearth a few things about his attorney and believes that he wasn't given a fair trial. Having being released from prison, Cady quickly turns his attention to Bowden and his family and is intent on seeking revenge at any cost...I've had the advantage of watching the original film and the remake back to back so it's a little easier for me to be able to analyse both versions. Truth be told I did like both versions, but for different reasons so here are some of my thoughts...As I stated in my review of the original film, the set-up explaining Cady's need for vengeance is more plausible and is certainly better developed in this version of the film. The idea that Bowden withheld evidence which effectively could have given grounds for a mistrial would make any prisoner angry, but when someone as psychotic as Cady finds out then no-one wonder he's angry. The glib way that Bowden dismisses it by saying Cady wouldn't know about it because he couldn't read only for Bowden then to discover that Cady learned to read whilst he was in prison was a stroke of genius and the look on Bowden's face upon releasing this was priceless.Whilst Cady's motivations are more plausible and his desire for revenge is more believable it does cause a slight problem when it comes to rooting for our protagonist. If you couple this with Bowden's infidelity in the remake (which wasn't featured in the original film) then you find yourself with a sleazy edged film and a flawed protagonist. I mean are we supposed to root for a lawyer who withheld evidence and a man who cheats on his wife? Sure Bowden says he did it to make sure Cady got locked up, but do 2 wrongs make a right? As for the affair whilst it didn't cause a major problem I just didn't feel it was necessary. Then again perhaps Scorsese was trying to give the film a more modern edge whereby, regrettably, marriages don't last as long and divorce rates are higher. Still with all that being said it was much easier to root for Bowden in the original film until he gets desperate and hires 3 heavies to beat up Cady (this was featured in the original and backfires on Bowden in both films). I think the difference was that I could feel Bowden's desperation in the original film, but with Bowden's lack of scruples in this film I just didn't care quite as much.Having said all that, the remake of Cape Fear is still very good and De Niro still manages to be creepy as Cady. Having said that, with this being a Scorsese film then De Niro's performance isn't particularly subtle and there is one truly sickening moment where Cady bites part of Bowden's mistresses face off and this is one particular moment where you feel a little restraint could have been employed as it really wasn't necessary. Some people have criticised De Niro's performance for being a bit cartoonish, but I disagree. I think it was overblown compared to Mitchum's, but he still managed to be terrifying and creepy. One thing I could have done without was all the bible-quoting which is an overdone clich\u00e9 used for prisoners dating back as far as when Noah had his ark.Despite my reservations above, this remake of Cape Fear is still a very enjoyable film and I have to admit that 2 hours pass by very quickly (the only other criticism I have is that the climax of the film was a little ridiculous and far too drawn out). Still those who know Scorsese and know his style should still find this a very satisfying film. If you haven't seen it I would recommend watching the original version which although containing some differences is still a brilliant film in its own right.",

            "content": "Love it or loathe it, Scorsese's CAPE FEAR is at the very least a remake which tries its best to distinguish itself from the 1962 original. Too often, remakes are just watered down wastes of time that ape too much of the original, playing on audience nostalgia, easily forgotten once they leave the theater. However, this CAPE FEAR is successful in (mostly) updating the original to the 1990s, using a different style from the sober original, and adding new elements to shake things up. While I still much prefer the 1962 movie, the 1991 version turned out much more enjoyable than I'd anticipated.It mainly comes down to the direction, which borders on camp at times. Dramatic zoom-ins during intense scenes and colored filters over sexual or violent scenes bring to mind the sort of grotesque psychosexual thrillers Brian De Palma put out in the 1970s-- but I could see them inspiring laughter rather than chills. As a whole, this is a very formalist movie, interested in a bombastic style that occasionally works at the expense of the story, too overblown for its own good.The same could be said of De Niro's performance. His repulsive manner and cruelty contrast well with his intelligence and pain-induced rage. He is often quite frightening, especially during the climactic scenes. However, sometimes he just chews a little too much scenery and wanders into outright parody, breaking the tension. Part of my preference for the original comes in how much more grounded it feels and how much more realistic Mitchum's understated Cady is-- as much as I enjoyed De Niro's ham, Mitchum feels more like a real criminal and his open-mouthed lust over the Bowden daughter is more chilling than any graphic scene.Anyway, even with these reservations, this is still a worthwhile thriller. Making the Bowden family dysfunctional will not please everyone, but having them initially broken makes their eventual trial by fire more satisfying. While there is the bloodletting expected of a Scorsese movie, he also employs more slow-burn tension in other scenes, such as the celebrated \"seduction\" of Danielle Bowden in the school auditorium. Themes relating to class conflict, the demonization of female sexuality, and spiritual redemption are touched upon without turning the movie into a sermon.The ending is without a doubt the showstopper. Here, the over the top reactions are very much in favor of the movie, since the Bowden family themselves are becoming more animalistic in their fight to survive Cady's homicidal vengeance. It's wonderful work, intense and atmospheric. These are adjectives that could describe the movie as a whole.",

Jessica Lange, who was soooo beautiful, adopted a, in the current vernacular, \"resting bitch face\", to excellent effect. Juliette Lewis was fantastic, playing the adolescent rebel, but still with some shyness and childish charm. But what was rather off-putting was Scorsese's direction. I know, I know, Scorsese is a genius, but there were so many self-indulgent director's tricks that it distracted from the rest of the film.

He's trying to get back at him for the wrongs that he feels Nolte did in his case. Max, Deniro's character, believes that his 14-year jail term would not have happened if Nolte would have done right. Deniro is kind of a mixed-up religious freak who is pretty ruthless and manipulating as he goes about his task of disturbing his family. Scorsese does a good job of keeping the tension high by blending close-up camera-work and a searing Bernard Hermann score reminiscent of Hitchcock's style. The last half hour is a little far-fetched but everything up to that point is well done and leaves you on the edge of your seat as you watch the creepy Deniro character and wonder what he's going to do next.

            "content": "Already filmed under the same title in 1962, this 1991 remake of John D. MacDonald's novel The Executioners is a tense, deliberately unpleasant thriller distinguished by strong performances and a well-maintained atmosphere. The '60s version was a tough flick for its day, but Martin Scorsese pushes right to the very edge of moral boundaries with this later version. The violence is intense, the psychological probing is disturbing, and the shocks are tremendously effective. Having said all that, there is something strangely unattractive about the film that makes it hard \u0096 for me, at any rate - to come back for repeat viewings after seeing it once.Lawyer Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) leads a seemingly normal family life with his wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). One day, he is confronted by a recently released convict named Max Cady (Robert De Niro). Many years previously the thuggish and illiterate Cady was jailed on a rape charge, with Sam appointed as his defence lawyer. At the time Sam uncovered some evidence that might have got Cady off the charge, but decided to hide the evidence so that his client would be jailed (Sam considered Cady a brutal thug fully deserving of imprisonment). Whilst in jail, Cady learned to read and gradually familiarised himself with law books. Upon discovering that his lawyer could and should have put together a stronger defence on his behalf, Cady has spent his time behind bars burning for revenge, planning in terrifying detail how he will make Sam and his family pay for his years of incarceration. Cady's campaign of terror is far from the crude and thuggish approach that Sam is expecting. With great cunning, Cady exploits the tensions and cracks within the Bowden family, taunting and provoking Sam while toying with the fragile emotions of young Danielle. Sam has to resort to desperate measures to defend his family, but everything he does backfires as Cady turns the screw. Finally Sam decides to take his family to hide somewhere where Cady can't find them \u0096 the Everglades. But their \"safe haven\" becomes a battleground for a final terrifying confrontation as Cady follows them to finish the job he has started\u0085.De Niro is excellent as the psycho of the piece, physically intimidating and totally convincing as a deranged thug. Nolte and Lange are good too as the uneasily married victims, while youngster Lewis is outstanding in her morally complex role as the misunderstood daughter of the family. Bernard Herrmann's haunting score is kept from the 1962 original - a wise move as it turns out, as the music adds considerably to the film's air of menace. Perhaps the biggest flaw with Cape Fear is the excessively hysterical final quarter. In these closing scenes, Cady becomes less and less believable as a character \u0096 he performs impossible feats and survives extraordinary injuries, and just keeps coming at his victims with relentless intent. Such scenes are implausible in the extreme and resemble events from movies like Friday The 13th or Halloween. After such a careful build-up of tension and psychological intensity, it seems wrong that Cape Fear resorts to cruder slasher movie tactics for its climax. On the whole, though, this is a powerful and exciting thriller which equals \u0096 and in some aspects surpasses \u0096 the original upon which it is based.",

Lee Thompson. The remake character is stressed by giving the leading actors from the 1962 version (Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck) a supporting role in the 1991 version.Both versions are about an ex con (Max Crady played by Robert de Niro in the 1991 version) seeking revenge on his former lawyer (Sam Bowden played by Nick Nolte in the 1991 version). In the 1962 version the lawyer is a careful citizen, in the 1991 version he is definitely not.This is what I read before I saw the film. Does it mean that in the 1991 version the good guy and the bad guy are trading places? Certainly not! The flaws of the lawyer are in the first place that he is a womanizer and in the second place that he withhold some exculpatory information in the trial. The first puts his marriage to the test but has nothing to do with the crime of Crady, the second is a serious professional defect for a lawyer (every criminal has a right to the best defense) but would earn Crady a reduced sentence at best.The belief that he is the innocent victim that has spent 14 years in prison for no good reason exists only in the twisted mind of Crady. He is absolutely convinced that his (very violent) mission of revenge is fully justified. In that respect he is not unlike Travis Bickle (also Robert de Niro) from Taxi driver (1976, also Martin Scorsese) in his self proclaimed mission against the degradation of New York.Unlike Travis Bickle however Max Crady has a considerable insight in the psychology of his victims. In this respect he is more like Hannibal Lector from \"The silence of the lambs\" (1991, Jonathan Demme). A last comparison that can be made is with Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) in \"The night of the hunter\" (1955, Charles Laughton). Harry has the words \"love\" and \"hate\" tattooed on the fingers of his hand. Max Crady has the words \"truth\" and \"justice\" on his back.Turning our attention to the Bowden family, a comparison with \"Straw dogs\" (1971, Sam Peckinpah) can be illuminating. In both films a man that ought to resolve conflicts without violence (a scientist and lawyer respectively) by way of challenge and taunt is ultimately seduced to use violence after all.The rape scene in \"Straw dogs\" is highly controversial, in that some people are of the opinion that the woman is shown to enjoy the rape. In \"Cape Fear\" (1991) the scene in which Max Crady is seducing the adolescent daughter of Sam Bowden (Danielle Bowden played by Juliette Lewis) is also pushing things to or over the limit. The way Danielle sucks the thumb of Max Crady is suggestive enough, the kissing scene immediately after is in my opinion a little bit too much.To be honest I liked the 1991 version. The fact that the bad guy is right in some respects and the victim is evidently flawed gives the movie an unusual dynamics. This dynamics justifies the remake. I still haven't seen the 1962 version, but I am not convinced at all that it will be superior.",

            "content": "Cape Fear is well made, nicely shot thriller made by acclaimed film maker Martin Scorsese. This is one of many collaborations between Scorsese and powerhouse actor Robert De Niro. While the film itself, overall feels pretty standard for late 80's/early 90'S, Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances as former convict and revenge obsessed psycho Max Cady. De Niro hit the weights and physically embodied, an intimidating ex convict covered in tattoos with a southern accent and a white trash hair helmet. His approach to the psychology of the character is equally impressive and effective. Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange and Juliet Lewis all give good performances, but De Niro steals the show from everyone here in all the scenes he is in. Overall, this is a pretty solid thriller, but I prefer Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas to this,a personal preference, but also the three aformentioned films are total classics and hard to top.",

            "content": "In Martin Scorsese's remake of the 1962 thriller, \"Cape Fear,\" Robert De Niro is cast as the villain with a vendetta, Max Cady. Max was put away for fourteen years for battery (but is later revealed to be rape) and finds the time to educate himself. He reads lots of books, gets close with God and eventually comes to the conclusion that his lawyer, Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) wronged him. It turns out Bowden suppressed evidence that would have at least lightened the sentence, and upon his release, Cady sets out to make sure each and every day of his life is a living nightmare. He covets Bowden's wife (Jessica Lange), corrupts his teenage daughter (Juliette Lewis) and nearly destroys his career and credibility, forcing the family into hiding. It seems there is nothing Cady isn't willing to do to seek vengeance and he is so smart about it that it leaves the slippery lawyer helpless and desperate, much in the same way he left his client all those years before.While it's not one of Scorsese's best or most critically beloved films, \"Cape Fear\" is at least a rarity in that it is a remake that is better than the original. Sam Bowden's character in this film, as portrayed by Nolte, is a much more layered and complex one than in the original, thus making it difficult to distinguish who the bad guy is. Heck, if it weren't for a few scenes of graphic violence that show off Cady's mean-streak, you'd likely be left in the dark as to who you're supposed to root for. De Niro's turn as Max Cady is possibly one of his most colorful and most intense since \"Taxi Driver,\" and even went as far as to earn him an Oscar nomination the following year. His performance in this film is a testament to how versatile an actor he can be, and his portrayal of the cold-blooded yet well-read killer will stick in your head for days. Take a scene where he seduces Juliette Lewis' character. Taboo for its time (yes, even for the 90's) it is no doubt one of those scenes that will make your skin crawl and marks the point where you realize these aren't stock characters we're dealing with here.Scorsese's take on the material is very much old-school and Alfred Hitchcock inspired. The original score from composer Bernard Herrman is left intact and helps push the mounting terror over the edge, making the film seem like a nightmare you just can't wake from. \"Cape Fear\" is, at its core, a chilling thriller where its characters spend most of the time desperate and frantic. They make bad choices that lead to an intense final act that has earned its place in Hollywood history. Truly an intense film about ugly characters delivered with a touch of class by its director and filled out with performances that range from great to legendary. If one thing can be said about this movie, it's that it will stay with you for a long time after watching it.",

            "review_title": "Cape of Fear dialogues with complex and controversial themes, such as rape and the taboo of sexual relations. A simple thriller, but very well conducted by master Scorsese",
            "content": "In 1991, Martin Scorsese achieved a feat that few directors achieve: transforming a remake into a film superior to the original. That's exactly what happened with Cape of Fear, a remake of The Circle of Fear (1962), by J. Lee Thompson - which, by the way, was already great. After having his Goodfellas (1990) nominated for an Oscar in six categories (including Best Picture and Direction), the filmmaker invested in the thriller and, despite dividing the critics at the time, managed to raise the status of his work.Scorsese maintains one of its outstanding features by creating interesting and creative shots, such as the one in which Sam brushes his teeth in front of the mirror, in addition to using many zooms to enhance the actors' frightened reactions. The director also demonstrates during a police search Max's enormous desire for revenge, through several close-ups of the tattoos spread across his body of biblical verses such as \"Vengeance will be mine\" and \"Time will avenge us\". The screenplay by Wesley Strick, based on a book by John D. MacDonald, cleverly uses expository dialogue to explain the reason for Max's stalking, as Sam explains to a colleague who withheld the information that the victim was promiscuous in his case. . In addition, it creates a growing atmosphere of suspense, culminating in the exaggerated (and tense!) final sequence on the boat.The threat posed by Max's presence causes a conflict in the relationship between Sam and Leigh, exposing past problems and creating doubt about the couple's present. It's amazing how a mistake made a long time ago can damage a person's life so much. It is also interesting to note that with this error the script avoids characterizing Sam as a hero, fleeing Manichaeism. As we can see, it is not possible to label Sam as a good or bad person. And not even the other characters can be labeled this way, as even Max has his qualities as a human being.Max seems like a shadow in Sam's life, a real nightmare. Aware of his rights, he never crosses the line allowed by law, but manages to make Sam's life hell to the point of making him reach (and exceed) his limit. Whether at the restaurant, at the movies, or outside his own house, the image of Max inside his convertible haunts Sam. The tense scene in which Max rebels against the aggressors hired by Sam and goes looking for him also symbolizes an inversion of values in the viewer's mind (and within the narrative itself). From now on, Max is the victim.Max, by the way, has one of the most complex arcs in what can be said of big screen villains. Whether he was wrongfully imprisoned or not, the script tries to give the answer only later on. With a firm but soft voice, the character uses religion as a way to abstract the guilt for his crimes. But the brutal way that is revealed to the character of Illeana Douglas in the rape scene is of a physical and psychological violence that the director dared to show. Max's intelligence is a counterpoint to his well-crafted physique and body full of tattoos. His knowledge acquired in the long years of prison on legal issues ends up becoming one of his main weapons to terrorize Sam (Nolte), Leigh (Lange) and Danielle. And, by working magnificently in each of these aspects, DeNiro delivered one of the best performances of his life.Scorsese revives elements in this remake of \"Circle of Fear\" and recycles them with mastery and strength very typical of his vision, adopting in the film the intensity of the murderer to translate, in the most striking and dramatic way possible, the astonishment that the lawyer's family goes through. To live, all paying for their father's mistake. In the same way that Max plays with Sam's daughter, manipulating her in a game of seduction and subjective pedophilia, Scorsese instigates us about the next steps that the villain will take, unpredictable and visceral, in a 'because of pain' style.The pedophile relationship between Max and Danielle is one of the most interesting aspects of the film. Scorsese does not judge his two characters, despite making it clear that the villain only uses his power of seduction to get closer and closer to the antagonist's family. The disgust and attraction that the girl feels at the same time are reflected by the look and shyness of the then rookie actress, who, deservedly, was nominated for the Best Supporting Award at the Golden Globes and the Oscars the following year. In the film's tensest scene, the meeting between Max and Danielle at the school theater also features a performance by the duo Lewis and De Niro. Danielle exudes sensuality and innocence in the face of a dark and threatening Max, who in turn, uses the girl's rebellious feeling in her favor.With no buckets of blood or iconic deaths, here's the curiosity of a cinematic detective poring over the possibilities that good old-fashioned tension adds to such a story, and Scorsese does it with gigantic pleasure and a lust for irresistible suspense - the scene of the teddy bear is better than many entire movies. Throughout the 128 minutes of film, perhaps the only compromising narrative element, as it greatly expands the narrative that would remain excellent with a smaller length, Cape of Fear brings excellent dramatic performances, accompanied by aesthetic choices that transform the film into a dazzling spectacle. Of horror. The aforementioned score emulates the atmosphere of mystery of classic horror films, adorning the exposed images through frantic cuts unusual in Scorsese's cinematography. Adopted by publisher Thelma Schoonmaker, the dynamic rhythm of some passages does not prevent the viewer from contemplating the excellent production design by Henry Bumstead, captured and presented through the direction of photography of Freddie Francis, efficient in the use of frames, in the temporal composition of the planes and sophisticated handling.Given the above, Cape of Fear dialogues with complex and controversial themes, such as rape and the taboo of sexual relations, in addition to bringing insecurity in the face of an ineffective police, a wife to be deciphered, among other elements that resonate with the Hitchcockian legacy. With his masculinity tested in the face of multiple challenges, Nick Nolte's character will experience moments of physical and emotional instability, in addition to the feeling of powerlessness in having to face the sum of all his fears, in a situation that makes him feel like the \"man wrong\", save its due proportions, after all, the term from Hitchcock's films has broader meanings.His daughter is as distant and apathetic as Lester's daughter in American Beauty. The wife, dissatisfied, exhales the possibility of adultery through every pore. It is in this atmosphere of tension that the character follows his life, threatened by the omnipresence of Max Cady, increasingly adapted to physical contact, announced between the middle and the end, through the hysterical and sensational soundtrack, orchestration of the ideal horror for the crash of the dramatic curve in a swampy region. Among so many films portrayed by visual homages, narratively, Cape of Fear is very close to Frenesi, Hitchcock's penultimate thriller. In the production, the filmmaker advances in sex and blood previously veiled, given the censorship codes, in a plot that portrays a murderer on the loose in London. Twists, a character in the wrong place and time, in addition to the spectator as an active agent in the conduct of conflicts. What about the turn of a character's supposed maid? The reference to Vera Miles' character's encounter with what's left of Mrs. Bates in Norman's basement in Psycho is triggered immediately. It is not a bundle of vulgar references with no narrative function. This makes the film worthy of standing among the best thriller films of the decade in which it was released.But not everything is perfect. Interesting how the law is ineffective in defending people under constant threat. As long as you know the law (as was the case with Max) it is possible to torment someone's life and, depending on the reaction of the persecuted, still come out as a victim of the case. The ending sounds unreal with the many attempts to kill Max, who always manages to escape. This exaggeration practically turns him into a superhero, which is not consistent with the rest of the narrative. On the other hand, the entire sequence is incredibly electrifying and frightening, fulfilling the film's purpose well, which is to generate fear in the viewer.With a decoupage filled with whips (fast camera movements) in key moments of Cape of Fear, combined with an interesting montage that sets the pace for the horror to establish itself not only in the minds of the persecuted family on screen, but also in the audience., Scorsese signs one of his trademarks as author. The film ends up not only dealing with Max's persecution of his lawyer, but also suggesting that a crisis of this size can end up breaking a family completely. A simple thriller, but so well conducted, that it became a great work.",

This is a balls-out, brutal revenge/thriller flick that doesn't hold back it's punches. De Niro delivers one of his best performances, and he pulls off the 'homicidal, god-mode psychopathic ex convict' roll better than most other actors ever could dream of (although at times, he goes a bit over the top, and his character seems a bit unrealistic in some scenes). Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange are both very above average actors and portray a married couple with conviction and realism, and Juliette Lewis was an exceptional child/teen actor at the time. Directing is Martin Scorsese, and that's all I really need to say about that. He uses a snappy, shocking style of directing here that makes everything darker and more psychopathic, and I can think of so many horror flicks that would be better if the directors followed Scorsese's path here.There isn't really much room for thought here, though, since this is a pretty straightforward movie. If you're looking for a deep, psychological brain-warp of a movie, this one's not your best bet. There are no plot twists lurking behind any corners here; you pretty much know what you're getting if you've read the back of the DVD box: A violent, creepy little thriller by one of the best directors of our time, with some absolutely outstanding scares. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, and certainly go full-throttle for the whole 2+ hours of it's duration, but it's not really that surprising or innovative.

Let's pretend there's nothing they could do-- which instantaneously makes it loose some points, since there is no pretending in good movies. The writers were lucky that the psychological thriller genre was very fresh in 1991 due to Silence of The Lambs' success, so this one surely got more attention than it would if released randomly.I don't believe that someone would be that revengeful with the lawyer; usually, if they want revenge, they prefer the prosecutor or the judge. This is an unusual case of lack of ethics which caused big tormenting to the lawyer's family.

For me that's something unique and therefore great, because it fits the theme of the movie. Justice and Injustice: How we see it as ordinary people and how the justice system sees it, because without it, our society would crumble.But even without those themes and interesting ideas this would be a great movie on a technical level alone. The camera-work is exceptionally great, and very much like Hitchcock would have done it, if he had directed this film, same for the editing (that's one reason for the Zemeckis reference above, the other reason is...). The score by Elmer Bernstein is based on the original score from Bernard Herrman, and some pieces he originally composed for Hitchcoks \"Torn Curtain\", is amazing, although it feels odd at first hearing such music and seeing such a Hitchcockian intro sequence in a movie from 1991, but it works.Now to the acting: Everyone is superb in this film. Most of all Juliette Lewis, who plays one of the most believable teenagers i ever saw, most of all in a scene she shares with Robert De Niro, where he lures her on his side. Speaking of him, he is more frightening in this movie as ever and it's great.There are even some visual effects used in this movie (the first time for Scorsese, who used effects for great use ever since, most effectively in his masterpiece \"Shutter Island\") which hold up so well, that i wasn't even sure at times if there where any to begin with.If we have to talk about weaknesses, there is only one scene in the movie which feels like it had no purpose whatsoever, but to create a bit more drama. It's the scene in the final act, where Juliette Lewis character burns De Niro, so that he jumps off the boat into the water. Now she and her mother free Nick Nolte and they could try to flee, but De Niro immediately comes back and everyone is in the exact same situation as before. It's even more strange because De Niro showed them only minutes before how it doesn't bother him that much to get burned...it's not a bad scene and nice to see that the little teenage girl is capable of helping herself, but in the end it had no effect on the final act. Except for that tiny little weird moment i loved the movie very much and think it's one of Scorsese's best with \"Bringing out the dead\" and \"Shutter Island\" which are my favourites...",

Nothing about this remake and I mean nothing in my personal opinion is remotely good about this movie. The writing is awful, there's no build-up or proper suspense, things just happen on a whim. The acting is atrocious and De Niro's Max Cady was tolerableNone of the characters are likable or engaging, maybe it's just me, and I'm an idiot. But I'm not a big fan of this movie, from start to finish I was bored out of my mind and thought of better ways to make this movie and write the story. Every time it seems it was going to get good for me, I completely lose interest in the next scene or twoI haven't seen the original and now I'm inclined to give it a go at some point. Maybe the original is far better than this piece of trash. Sorry, De Niro, Nick Nolte, and Scorsese, this movie sucked big time. I couldn't wait until it was over and cheered when it did. Honestly, I could have written a better version for this remake and put everything not only in place but build up good suspense. The Simpsons parody episode of this movie with Sideshow Bob is way better.",

This film could have been destined for greatness were it put in the hands of a director used to this sort of thing suck as Oliver Stone or David Lynch. But all is not lost, DE NIro and Nolte make the best out of what they were given here and it is also fun to see how De Niro handles himself, who is also trying to achieve his best in new territory and even though the accent is cheesy, fro the most part he succeeds. In the eyes of most Scorsese's fans this will be a let down, to everyone else, enjoy.",

It is an excellent thriller that makes you wonder if one person will go that far. I find it superior to the 1962 version, but only because the ending was a huge bust(in my opinion). Robert DeNiro has once again proven his supurb acting skills. One of the things I found most interesting was the dimensions added to Cady's character, to the 1962 film, such as his faith towards  God , and how he was always quoting from the Bible.  Juilette Lewis was perfect as the confused daughter, and how Max manipulates her into thinking he is a kind, poetic man. Jessica Lang did a very good job, and Nick Nolte's character also had dimensions, in which he isn't the perfect, \"faithful\" husband and father as Gregory Peck ( Peck did a great job as Sam though). So in closing, I find this film thrilling and intense! 9/10",

            "content": "Like the title says, fear is the main theme in Martin Scorsese's remake of the 1962 film about a lawyer and his family being terrorized by an ex-convict recently out of prison and on the trail of vengeance and justice for the lawyer who defended him, but withheld information that could have reduced or prevented his sentence. This in itself is a great premise for a thriller, but Scorsese goes one step further in giving us no likable or sympathetic characters at all. With this unique touch, we are now forced to sit back and objectively view what is to unfold, without our own feelings and emotions involved.With this setup, the payoffs become all the more frightening and unsettling as we watch a sadistic madman methodically go after the family of the man he considers fully responsible for the injustice and torment he has suffered the previous 14 years. Robert De Niro, if there was any doubt previously, permanently cemented himself as one of the greatest of all American actors with his completely believable and terrifying performance as Max Cady, dominating every scene he is in with a creepy Southern accent and biblical tattoos. The Bowden family, however, has plenty of its own troubles to begin with. The parents are fighting, the daughter feels neglected and is sexually unsure of herself and the entire family feels open to a change of their otherwise boring and pedestrian life. Unfortunately, Cady is the one to provide such a change.To understand Scorsese's reason to remake this film requires only to look at the character of Sam Bowden. He is not a particularly nice man, stepping out on his wife at times and other times ignoring his daughter and her needs. He is, like many other Scorsese protagonists, a conflicted and tortured soul. He bears traits similar to Charlie from Mean Streets, Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver and Jake LaMotta from Raging Bull. He feels the inner guilt and pressure from not doing what he is supposed to do. For this reason, Scorsese felt a need to explore the darker side of human behavior and the journey a family must take to defeat pure evil trying to invade an infected household. While the screenplay lags at some key moments, such as the titillating scene between De Niro and the wonderful Juliette Lewis, Scorsese nevertheless preserves the film with his superior technical strength, drawing from Hitchcock, utilizing Bernard Herrmann's score and creating a very moody and atmospheric genre piece that must be considered one of the more frightening and unsettling films of the last 20 years. If only others would heed his teachings, horror might become respectable again.",

            "content": "Remember the good old days when Martin Scorsese used Robert De Niro as his primary actor instead of Leo Di Crap... Cappi.. something or other? Cape Fear will jog your memory of just how talented these two were, and how well they worked together. De Niro plays a hardened and learned criminal named Max Cady who has just served a 14 year sentence in prison for raping a teen-aged girl. Nick Nolte plays the attorney who defended him at his trial, but apparently didn't use all the evidence he had that might have at least lightened Cady's sentence. It was obvious to him that Cady was in fact a dangerous creep who needed a long stay behind bars. While in prison, Cady has been studying up on the law and acting as his own lawyer. And you'd better believe he knows all about what his lawyer didn't do for him. Now, he's out and looking to pay that lawyer and his family a visit. Make that several visits... each one creepier than the last! How can an average guy like Nolte's character protect his family from the guy when the legal system seems to help criminals more than regular citizens? How far can a man be pushed when his family is in jeopardy before he steps outside the boundaries of law himself? These are the questions posed by this remake of Cape Fear, and it will pull you in and make you think long and hard about them.The film basically centers around De Niro's creepy performance as the newly-freed criminal who not only has a strong body, but now a sharp mind honed by years of obsession behind bars. Nick Nolte gives a generally understated and effective performance as the lawyer who now finds himself the subject of this animal's wrath. As a rule, lawyers are mostly portrayed as flawed at best, and sinister at worst by American cinema. Nolte's character would be on the good side of that spectrum. He has not always been faithful to his wife, and sometimes he explodes at his daughter. Ask me, this daughter deserved a trip to the old woodshed. Too bad it took a maniac like De Niro's character to open her eyes about how the world can work.The film is quite gripping and graphic in its depiction of the violence and terror that Max Cady brings to those in his path. The film isn't as tight as you might hope, and some scenes end up rambling. The scene where Cady tries to seduce the teenager in a school auditorium comes to mind in that sense. The conclusion on a house boat is also a bit drawn out, but you will probably enjoy the final outcome. Scorsese and De Niro have done better work, but they handle this material about as well as anyone could. See it! 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

            "content": "Cape Fear is a character acting driven suspense, but it is very well did. The individual characters of Cape Fear all have their own faults, but nothing like Cady. Nick Nolte's character, Sam Bowden, is too caught up in his own profession becoming dishonest to himself he has lost touch with what truly matters in his life. Jessica Lange's character, Leigh Bowden, is growing unfulfilled in her own married life, unsatisfied she is holding herself back at the cost of her family. Juliette Lewis' character, Danny Bowden, suffers from lack of parental guidance from Sam and Leigh who too often are too busy fighting over their marital affairs, they sometimes forget about Danny causing further friction in the home. And Robert De Niro's character, Max Cady, is a full blown psychopathic killer, the worst kind of breed, and as dangerous as they come. Max Cady is an all-time nasty movie villain and Robert De Niro is purely great as Cady. Cape Fear's main imprint is Max Cady by Robert De Niro with a great lead from Nolte and Lange. Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange are truly outstanding, and all these 3 are among the very best in movies, De Niro, Lange, and Nolte. Juliette Lewis is just a teenager in Cape Fear though she's so cute in her undies. The writing of dialogue is excellent in Cape Fear. The characters and character interactions are as well. Cape Fear is pristinely crafted. The scenes are presented in a way with very vivid storytelling. There's no detailed story set up in Cape Fear, just the story. Things happen in an instance and before you know it, Max Cady is too near to you. Cape Fear deals in the difficult nature of proving doubt within the U.S. justice system, and how the courts deem Sam Bowden more of a loose cannon than Cady. Max Cady is a disturbingly gross villain, and Cape Fear is a terrifying and terrific movie. Martin Scorsese directed an unmistakable scary suspense. Cape Fear has stretches where it is a masterful 10 outta 10, but there's a lot of sort of random disconnect in its story progression.\"Do you notice these young people? They don't look very happy. They're committed to their professions and ambitions, but not to each other... Cady, shut up and listen.\"",

            "content": "Above-average thriller that sees it's impressive cast on adequate form.First of all, I must confess I haven't seen the original Cape Fear. I did note that the 1962 version was higher regarded than this '91 remake (To date, a significant 0.7 points ahead). I also noted that whereas the original was slightly more popular with male voters, this one has an equal score between men/women. Maybe that's DeNiro's involvement?What stunned me about this film is the small canvas Scorcese plays on. Surely one of the three greatest directors of all time, this one is more suited to the small screen, as it largely consists of head shots and close-ups. There is none of the grand scale that marked out Casino, for example; and it perhaps lacks the intensity of Taxi Driver; or Nolte's bare obsession achieved in the slightly dull Scorcese segment of New York Stories. There are times when you wish the camera would pan out a little, or try a few of the director's trademark sweeps; as it is this can occasionally seem like \"Scorcese does TV movie\". It also feels a little like the stock, conveyor belt movies of the mid-eighties.There are no flaws in the film, and, as a cursory glance of the cast list should tell you, acting is at a premium. Lewis, in only her sixth cinema film, gives her best performance to date, and I was amazed to discover that the scene where DeNiro flirts with her in the auditorium was completely ad-libbed between them both for a single take.The running theme throughout is that if a man threatened everything you held dear, could you then take that man's life? This is a basic ethical debate (punctuated throughout by DeNiro, as Max Cady, coming on the receiving end of Nolte's paid-for violence. By the end of the film he resembles the part he was to later play in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. DeNiro, for his part, generally threatens and we get to see him fulfil little of his menace), a simple yes/no answer, and not on the sheer scale of Taxi Driver's sociopathology.If this all sounds like detraction, then it's certainly not, and if you want an evening's entertainment, then Cape Fear will certainly fulfil that quota. But for a Scorcese-DeNiro collaboration it's unambitious, it achieves it's aims without breaking any new ground. For a film, then, it's a pure 7, but for a Scorcese picture it's perhaps his least essential work.",

The same can't be said for \"Cape Fear.\" Scorsese's remake of the 1962 is very entertaining and features dynamic imagery, thought-provoking themes, and haunting performances from Robert De Niro and Juliette Lewis. But to the film's detriment Scorsese turns the Hitchcockian nightmare of the original into an often silly, over the top potboiler.The original \"Cape Fear\" is an excellent example of less is more, relying on its noir atmosphere and strong performances to tell a compelling story. Scorsese's remake adds new layers of depth that make the story more engaging, but this is undermined by an uneven tone that veers from serious at one moment to comedic at the next. Some of the choices here are embarrassing: cartoon sound effects are used in scenes of intense drama and De Niro literally mugs at the camera (such as when his chin nearly hits the lens during his introduction, or when he smiles and winks like Bugs Bunny while hanging under the Bowdens' car). The characters aren't well developed, Leonard Bernstein's bombastic score is used ad nauseam, and the third act goes on for far too long.Would I recommend \"Cape Fear\"? Yes, but only just.

It's a fascinating film that goes over-the-top, but not in a negative way, but in a great and enjoyable way. Looking further into Scorsese's film there's a lot of complex psychology and philosophy to it, and those critics and viewers that have hatched it as flawed, too boisterous and odd, it really deserves a second chance. Every aspect of the film is great, and it bares Scorsese's trademark of great editing (from Thelma Schoonmaker), serving an entertaining and rather upbeat film that holds complex and dark matters, brutal violence and rather unsympathetic characters. The performances are probably the film's greatest achievement; the risky casting of Nick Nolte works fine, and his rambunctious persona works to the benefit of the clearly dis-likable character he plays, but what truly lingers is Juliette Lewis' absolutely amazing performance as the sexually curious, rebelling, naive and troubled fifteen-year old daughter of the married couple (Nolte and Jessica Lange), and off course Robert De Niro's disturbing, forceful, repellent yet fascinating Max Cady, recently released from prison after fourteen years. CAPE FEAR works multi-layered psychology seldom seen in mainstream box office films, and goes off immediately introducing us with its opening credits, in true Hitchcock style, thwarted and blurred images working our sub-conscience.

There's is no simple concept of black and white good versus evil, but rather the many flaws that everyone has inside them. Nolte bring his own take to the character of Sam, as oppose to being just this pure wholesome Saint that was Gregory Peck's character. In many ways he's just as guilty in his actions. Also I like having this tradition that's more perfect without any flaws. His marriage is already in bad shape as he's having affairs with his wife and his daughter just a blatant mess. He also has more of an attitude problem. Robert De Niro as Max is an entertaining sociopath. He actually does have a reason to hate Nolte's character given that he was is his lawyer back during his trial, and choose to withhold evidence from it. He's still a monster though he does messed up things. Despite his appearance he's very intelligent and very manipulative. While not as good as some his characters in raging bull, Taxi driver or Goodfellas. He gives this performance and hams it up this madman. It terrifying and great at the same time. Jessica Lange has a few freak out moments that I don't even know really how to describe them it's just feel like she possibly giving to much emotion if that make since that in some parts it breaks the illusion.

These two have given us some of the most sublime entertainment available. Their collaborations have produced movies no less than \u0091Taxi Driver' and \u0091Raging Bull'. Although this one did not achieve the lofty heights of these two, it was still one of the most memorable movies to come out of 1991.\nThis year was also the year of \u0091Terminator 2' and \u0091The Silence Of  The Lambs'. Big movies like this released around the same time can diminish other top movies which may not achieve the mass audience attention of its competitors. Notwithstanding this fact, for me, \u0091Cape Fear' was more memorable than \u0091Silence Of  The Lambs' The reasons are numerous, but it mostly appealed to me because of the way Scorcese fully utilises the language of the movies. The language of movies, from my point of view, involves utilising images, sounds and the actor's ability to relay a particular emotion, theme or element of the story. The first example of this is within the rolling of the credits. We have the image of still water over which booms an ominous track and we see dark shadows in the shape of a man. This sets the tone for the movie perfectly. The serene family life of our heroes is about to be viciously disrupted by a malevolent man who has overbearing power. This is carried on over the next two scenes, which is \u0091far more on the nose' than the opening credits. We see Juliette Lewis nervously delivering her oral English class project. Her final line leads us to the next scene where \u0091reality comes crashing in' in the form of De Niro who is up until the last minute preparing himself for the battle ahead. As he leaves the prison, a storm is approaching symbolising the approaching terror for the family. This message is further accentuated by De Niro walking right up to the camera. The storm finally crashes in on Nolte on the river in the form of a squall heralding De Niro's boarding of his boat. It dies down during the rolling of the final credits as the storm subsides following the death of De Niro.Another example of the language of film is where Lewis runs into her room following the witnessing of an argument between her parents. She puts on her earphones to listen to \u0091Guns and Roses' \u0091Patience', but the video that is playing is one by \u0091Janes addiction' showing someone shoplifting \u0096 a paradox. This is a favoured tactic by Scorcese who always likes to create paradoxical images. This makes it more interesting for the audience as sometimes these types of images do hold some meaning for the story. In one scene Lewis is again watching TV where a woman methodically covers her eyes with her hands. This symbolised the shielding from the world that Nolte was doing with great fervour as the threat from De Niro became more ominous. The audience is drawn into the movie as they try to identify images that may relay a message for them. Although this was done in \u0091Silence Of The Lambs' with the theme of the degrading of American society, Scorcese has much more artistic flair for this and demonstrates it.The acting is strong throughout, but two stand out above the rest. The first one is Robert De Niro and the other is Juliette Lewis. De Niro is deservedly renowned as one the greatest actors ever. He is the complete actor and fully immerses himself with the character. He not only takes on the personality of the character, but physically adapts himself. His collaborations with Scorcese are prime examples of this. In \u0091Cape Fear', Max Cady prepares himself for his vengeful plan against Nolte. He develops himself to be an angel of vengeance by strengthening his body and using it as a means to deliver messages to his enemies by way of tattoos. The tattoos were not real, but I am sure that they would have adorned his body throughout most of the production of the movie - a trail in dedication. De Niro has now taken the portrayal of Cady more than one step further. He is now the character in mind as well as body. This far exceeds the usual blockbuster ploy of employing an actor who has mass box office appeal rather than casting an actor who can bring the character to life and add substance to the story.Cady has also developed his mind, but he could not fully escape years of neglect. De Niro realistically relays by way of incorrect usage of words. His tattoos indicate his fanatical devotion to revenge. The righteousness that Cady experiences through the realisation of the betrayal by his lawyer, translates itself into religious fanaticism as he seeks to punish the sinner who suppressed one of Gods children. This never subsides as Cady faces his end and whilst sinking, he leers at his foe, hatred carried in life and through till death.His past life is used to advantage as he is able to use his experience as a con \u0096 man to destabilise the fragile family by identifying their weaknesses and targeting them. He upsets the wife by killing her dog and also by launching a hideous attack on the object of one of Nolte's infidelities. He takes advantage of the rebellious stage in the life of Lewis. She is also at the door of sexual sensibility. Cady utilises these two elements of her teenage life during the scene where they meet each other at the drama set.The top accolade may go to De Niro, but Lewis did not pale too much by comparison. When considering her comparative experience, we realise the magnitude of her achievement. Lewis was consistent with her performance and was able to realistically portray the girl at the brink of womanhood. She never faltered once and even her eyes were in tandem with the moment. She had grasped the emotion that the director wanted. No mean feat for an actress of this age. Her character was a perfect target for De Niro, as she was not strong enough to stand up to the persuasive con \u0096 man. She had weaknesses as a consequence of her life \u0096 stage which further diminished her in relation to De Niro.The editing in the first half an hour presented a story which did not flow and seemed choppy. Whether this was due to pressure by the producers to shorten the movie or a conscious effort by the director to show the spiral that the characters were entering would be immaterial since story flow is paramount in keeping audiences attention uninterrupted and giving continuity to the story. On second viewing this problem becomes more evident. It indicates an attempt at showing the audience the complexities of the characters which would create conflict during the movie. It is always difficult in criticising a director as acclaimed as Scorcese, but attention to this problem would have led to the creation of an almost perfect movie.   Italian directors always have a yearning to explore the extremities of violence and sex in movies. This may be due to the fact that they may feel that to explore these areas is to fully exploit their emotions and to leave themselves bare to their chosen art form. Scorcese definitely portrays the extremities of violence in this movie, but it is not out of place with the character. De Niro is a depraved, vicious man who is completely devoted to revenge and wants to dehumanise his oppressor by making him experience what it is like to be an animal as he was in prison. The psychological exploits by Cady are not overawed by these scenes, but supplement them by visually revealing his hellish intent and dedication.The fear of a stalker is a fear deep set into many members of the audience. The feeling of helplessness pervades as we sense a powerful presence, but cannot see it. The unseen is terrifying since we know something is there, but cannot locate it and we anticipate the forthcoming attack. When this fear consumes us within the confines of our own home, the fear reveals the person that we are and we will either stand and fight or run for our lives. Even the weaker ones like Nolte will have to stop running and face their foe. Scorcese knows this fear uses it to give impetus to the story.",

            "content": "I have not seen the original Cape Fear, so therefore cannot compare the two films, but from what I saw of this one, it is surely to be the most violent one. The film has a criminal getting released from prison and going after the lawyer who screwed him over. But he also deals with the man's wife and daughter, weaving his way into their lives and making it known he's out for a little vengeance. The potential is all here -- a great director, a nice cast, and a good story to begin with, but the film simply can't manage to rise above anything other than slightly above average. For starters, the film opens very well, jumping right into the tale of this obsessed madman, but towards the end the scares wind down into silliness and predictability. After the great first act, the end is a huge letdown. Another tired horror movie cliche showdown between good and evil. You know the film is leading up to this, and are hoping the director will shock you by throwing in some surprises to throw you off. But he never does. What this film does have going for it are great actors -- especially Juliette Lewis -- and a director who handles the material the best he can, judging by what he has. Great camera angles, tense close-ups...he does fine. But the script manages to be nothing more than a Fatal Attraction/Dead Calm/Basic Instinct clone. For the most part, this film is better than those in the sense that it works more on a psychological level. But the methods used to get there are all the same old tricks. Many scenes are too long and overly drawn out, while others fall helplessly into conventions and stereotypes. The film itself is too long as well. In the end this adds up to nothing more than an average psycho-thriller with the exception of good acting and direction. Watch if you dare.",

Great shape he was in as well as the southern drawl with which he spoke in this one.  As for the others, I thought Nick Nolte was absolutely strong in this one as a man tormented and driven by his past as well as on-going family problems.Jessica Lange was very strong, so strong to be there for her husband and daughter as well as be willing and able to stand up to Nick at the same time.  But who surprised me here:  Juliette Lewis.  Great insight she had at top and finish, as well as a pained tormention from having to endure her parent's constant arguments.  Very well-done.  Very believable.  One that drew me in from start-to-finish with the loud, bright musical score which harkened back to old-time Hollywood thrillers as in days of yore.  With DeNiro's sadisticness, Nolte's torn drivenness, Lange's hardened womanly strengh and Lewis' tormented enduringness, a movie which is one crazy thrill-ride from start to finish.  A scored this one highly, 10 of 10.  To me, the rating should have been 10+.  As far as I was concerned, it was THAT great!",

Of course, it's been a couple of years since I watched this one for first time.Anyway, what's the post-Goodfellas Scorsese like? Well, he seems pretty cool. Why is he so popular? Because he has always been on top, regardless of his success. Scorsese never fears of changing gears. He has done pretty much everything. Cape Fear IS NOT a typical Scorsese film.Yes, everybody knows the plot. De Niro plays a recently released prisoner, seeking revenge. The main character... oh well, I'm not sure whether he is the main character, but anyway, Sam, played by Nick Nolte, is a lawyer who hasn't managed to save De Niro from 14 year sentence. Now, Sam's whole family is put at risk although they are not familiar with his past.Cape Fear does enter a \"top\" Scorsese list in my book. As I said, it's different. Style, camera, dialog, character development. It's nothing like Scorsese has ever done. Small, but brave experiment from an already experienced filmmaker. As I think about it, this is probably the main reason I liked the movie. After the second viewing, I even respected it as a solid piece of art. Very thrilling and intense. But it's not the sharp dialog that makes it such. It's the technical stuff. It's almost like a horror movie. No, not the movie itself, but the viewer's reception of the events in the film. The experience if you will. There is only one word to describe De Niro's character - unforgettable. Would I like Cape Fear without De Niro? Nah, not a chance. Very underrated performance. People got used to see him in very mature roles, with masterful character development, used as an example of both good acting and writing. This is not the case here. An old fashioned villain. Very few lines, lots of facial expressions, provoking the audience. Stuff that is usually retarded, when delivered by amateur actors. Thank God somebody realized De Niro is suitable for all characters. Talking about his acting in Cape Fear is not a good idea. People have covered it all in the past 16 years. Well, at least those who appreciate the... change. Both De Niro and Scorsese put a scary mask, displaying their creativity.Things, I haven't mentioned: Quite memorable performance by the otherwise annoying Juliette Lewis. She is the queen of the sick sub-plot.It's a remake. It's based on a novel. Basically, I never cared about the screenwriters, because they are obviously doing an easy job.The third act has got to be my favorite. Wow, spectacular. Scorsese at his best... if you recognize him.Cape Fear is Scorsese's \"you thought I can do only mob movies?\" film. Nice job.",

It merges some fine acting talents, most of all DeNiro who is given the chance to shine in all his acting glory as a psychopathic revenge seeker, hell-bent on wrecking the lives of Nick Nolte and his family played well by Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis. Nick plays the lawyer who buried a document whilst defending DeNiro, which could have saved him fourteen years of a prison sentence, who now must battle this aggressive character who taunts and stalks his enemy until the grisly finale. The film is not for the faint hearted as DeNiro does go to some extreme lengths to seriously shock, he even bites off part of his victims face in one scene. The directing is slick and tense as you might expect from Scorsese and the overall film is brilliant, and a lot better than the original in my opinion. Watch it if you want a fright night.

Not that a typical thriller is realistic but this one seemed to be trying to, and yet the woman who got rapped didn't press charges because she didn't want to be cross examined in a court even though she would be putting the man who broke her arm beat the crap out of her and raped her away for life not but also protecting the lawyer whom she had feelings for and his family not just random people she didn't even know. There were other similar problems with the movie which would have been all right if there was some kind of moral to take away from the movie but the few moral questions like whether it was right to try to kill/beat Kady before he did anything illegal were presented a little one sided since Kady ended up being just a crazed bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since waiting for Kady to actually rape his daughter so he could do something legally about it would be a bit absurd.

First of all how did he get in to poison the dog, because he did, as everything that could be closed and locked was, and secondly, how did he get to the dog a second time in order to get the lead?

The Cigar Smoke, the Bikini Lighter, the Tattooes, the Hell bent, well thought out Plan for Revenge. The interaction of the Brutalized Family was acted out Well too. Juliette Lewis just missed the Oscar as Dani. Jessica Lange and Joe Don Baker very convincing as well. The scene where Sam and Leigh banter in Bed while sharing a cigarette has great close ups !

Lee Thompson's 1962 original as well as offering small roles to Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck (who played the original Max Cady and Sam Bowden respectively), but this brash re-imagination is largely its own beast. And beast is the word: a snarling and visceral creature. It is also an exercise in sustained psychological horror, as Robert De Niro's fearsomely muscular, tattooed rapist is set free with a score to settle with his own defence lawyer (Nick Nolte).Some have cited Scorsese's dizzying camera movements and Thelma Schoonmaker's zippy editing as crassly manipulative. But that's the point, for \"manipulative\" is the adjective that describes Cady best. He's a self-destructive psychotic for sure, but he intends to teach family man/adulterer Bowden a lesson about living by a principle before he goes down for good.Scorsese's ability to wring breathless performances from his cast has rarely served him with such stark success: here we have career-best work from Nolte as well as Juliette Lewis as Bowden's teenage daughter. To coin a cringe-worthy phrase, she's a blossoming flower - the scene in which Cady lures the brace-wearing Danielle onto an eerie school theatre stage, decked out with a Hansel & Gretel set (no one claims the symbolism is subtle!), is a childhood rite of passage as seen in a nightmare; it's also very skilfully paced and played.For all the fizz and suspense and manoeuvring, the climax, which takes place in the stormy waters off the titular cape, is somewhat disappointing. Where Lee Thompson's movie ended with a nail-biting game of cat-and-mouse in the shadowy reeds, Wesley Strick's screenplay resorts to genre convention, stripping Cady down to a babbling monster.

It was that the original lacked any real characterization esp. among the supporting characters (the daughter was one of those 50s fembots who says things like, \"Oh thank you ever so much, mother.\") Then there was the bathos of an ending - (spoiler to the earlier \"Cape Fear\") - in which the villain does not die, but goes back to prison, a compromise in plot that occurs probably because to have shot the villain the hero himself would have had to face some kind of punishment, because censorship wouldn't allow anyone to get away with a crime; plus the standards of the time required that law and law enforcement officials be treated as above reproach.This version fleshes out the characters, including and especially the wife and daughter into fully realized beings with interesting subplots and complex inner lives.The suspense is heightened and Scorcese adds great dramatic scenes (you're nothing until you've been parodied on The Simpsons).All those who list greatest suspense movies of all time - such as AFI's Thrills list - should spurn the original in favor of this update. And those who seek to remake a classic (i.e. Psycho or The Stepford Wives, or the upcoming third update of King Kong) should note how Scorcese uses his update to add material to improve upon the original, not merely to rehash it.",

It breaks my heart to see films like Lord of the rings entering the IMDb's top 250 so quickly scoring almost nine points and a real good film like Cape fear having to wait in the shadow with a rating of 7.1 just cause a large number of Americans think \"they've seen it the first time around and it wasn't that good\".

But I can't.Cape Fear (1991) is a technically excellent film, with good effects and excellent acting from all the players. I can see where Scorcese was coming from with his update, but there are key plot elements that just won't allow it. Peck's Bowden was a paragon of moral virtue, with a doting family and a seemingly idyllic life. This is a character fundamental, as we have to believe that this man would find the idea of carrying a gun abhorrent, and even knowing the threat to his family from Cady, has grave reservations about hiring some heavies. Nolte's updated Bowden is a semi-bent lawyer with a dysfunctional family and so the more believable 'nineties' character makes the plot less plausible.Similarly, Mitchum's Cady was a nasty, nasty piece of work. When he rapes a girl and beats the s*** out of her it's believable enough to be deeply disturbing. De Niro's massively overblown, bible spouting, tattooed crackpot who rapes a girl and chews off half her face is so over the top it divorces itself from the viewer and you KNOW you are watching a film. I personally found Mitchum's silent drowning of the local officer much more chilling than De Niro's gorefest piano wire slaughter. In it's own right it's a good film. As a remake, I can't help but think that it backfired a little. Worth a view.",

Sam, Leigh, and their 15 year old daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis) have moved to a backwater Florida town for a new start, but Sam is already showing signs of fooling around with his clerk, Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas). Meanwhile, Leigh broods at home, venting her bitterness on Danielle. But Sam's unfaithfulness becomes the least of Leigh's worries. Years ago, as a public defender, Sam had a client named Max Cady (Robert De Niro), who was accused of assaulting and killing a teenage girl. Sam put up a lousy defense for Max after discovering that Max was guilty of brutalizing the girl as well as a few others. Now, 14 years later, Cady has been released from prison and he's hungry for revenge on Sam, having spent his sentence making himself a literate man who's well-read in philosophy and literature. Cady's plan is to destroy Sam's career and family. Sam has Lieutenant Eigert (Robert Mitchum) of the local police department and sleazy private eye Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to help him with his problem.I haven't seen the original 1962 film of the same name, but from what I've read about it, the remake is a superior version compared to that movie. Directed in the early 90's, Martin Scorsese crafts a seemingly impersonal and highly stylized thriller that goes a little beyond the usual norm of most of its kind. Scorsese's touch can be seen in the little things. He gives us a villain who has been wronged, seeking to harm a hero who has sinned. Every character has their grey area and there are no true heroes in this tale. Cady is not just a bad man, but he's an evil one who relentlessly pursues his desire to make Sam accept that he's as much of a criminal as Cady is. Sam cannot do anything by the law since Cady is just openly toeing the line of the law while harassing him.Cady's brand of evil is quite disturbing and he brutally takes it out on the clerk, Lori who has a crush on Sam. The scene with him seducing the young Danielle who's just started to explore her sexuality and is mainly attracted to the bad guys and anyone who makes her father angry, was chilling to say the least. Danielle is a little dumb, but she can be forgiven because of her age and innocence, but her family's stupidity, especially Sam's cannot be overlooked. Being a lawyer, he should have been a lot smarter in dealing with Cady than what was shown on screen. All the actors embody their characters perfectly, while De Niro gives a little over-the-top performance. The Oscar nomination for Juliette was earned. The movie loses it a little in the last act by portraying Cady as an almost supernatural evil being. The soundtrack, while perfect for the movie, does tend to make the movie feel dated. But, the climax was surprising with all the family members being alive and the movie is rather gratifying.7/10",

This film has excellent direction, screenplay, settings, cinematography, editing, score and acting. The entire cast, including a few from the original, deliver great performances. In particular De Niro, Nolte, Lange and Lewis standout. De Niro's portrayal is absolutely horrifying and he creates one of the most memorable psychopaths ever seen on film. This is a film where the score sets the creepy tone of the film and eludes to the impending horror. The plot revolves around defense attorney Sam Bowden and a former client of his Max Cady. When Sam defends Max, who is a violent sex offender, years earlier he withholds evidence that could have acquitted his client. He chooses to do so knowing his client is a menace and extremely dangerous. After spending 14 years in prison, Cady has learned of the cover up, has had plenty of time to study the law and has had time to plot his revenge. Cady is hell bent on destroying Sam's life. Cady initially enacts his revenge through psychological torture but soon he reverts to his brutal physical assault on Sam's family and the people around him. Sam tries to stay within the limits of the law to stop Cady but eventually realizes Cady is much to cunning and intelligent for conventional tactics to work. That is when Sam will resort to any means neccessary to save his family. The plot is clever, psychological, thrilling, brutal, violent, disturbing and has a cathartic ending. This is a truly terrifying vengeance story that remains one of the best in it's genre.",

Unfortunately, the film does suffer from him too. While Scorsese has made three masterpieces and one near masterpiece, he is not as successful here. The film becomes gratuitous in areas. The acting is a mixed bag. Robert De Niro received an Oscar for his work as the sadistic Max Cady, but this is one time I dont think he deserved a nomination. For the most part he is good, but ends up overacting in a few areas. Some of the things the character does are completely ludacris. Juliette Lewis is the standout, she is brilliant in this role. It remains her best performance to date. I didnt like Jessica Lange. Nick Nolte was adequate. Cape Fear is entertaining, and it does have some gripping scenes.

I must honestly say now i've never seen a movie with this type of plot packing this big a punch. Not only does De Niro \"seems\" (seem simply because the other actors have more restrained, calm roles) to act the other actors off the screen. He almost acts people right out of their seats with his super-intense performance. Yes, sometimes he over-acts a little, but he doesn't even have to fight to be violent. His whole demeanor is violent. He can smoke a cigar and it even seems a violent act.The editing and photography of the movie is fantastic, with tilting and spinning cameras.

            "content": "First off, this is without doubt, one of the finest remakes ever and a true rarity in a movie market, that is utterly rife and over-flowing with many, many, remakes - of which most are terrible.Compared to the original film nearly 30 years earlier Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear is quite brilliant and vastly more entertaining than the somewhat underwhelming and ploddingly-paced original. In this 1991 remake of the film you'll notice that it's principle characters are far more lively then they were before, especially so with the character of Max Cady, who is -brilliantly- portrayed by Robert De Niro. De Niro infuses the role with an incredible level of energy and panache; and it's his brilliant portrayal as Max Cady that flavors the movie with an unmistakably foul and odious presence. Cady is utterly bad to the bone and projects, quite effortlessly, demonic charisma and unrepentant evil. In other words, Bob's just smarmy as hell and he's simply a blast to watch in virtually every scene. On a visual level, I find that due to all his cryptic tattoo's and unruly hair, that frequently alternates from wild to greased back, De Niro's physical appearance is far more menacing/convincing then the image Robert Mitchum projected with his take on Max Cady; which I found to be dull and rather mundane. Though at the same time one could say Mitchum did a better job at blending into society than De Niro's louder, flashier and more violent take on the character and that's something that plays a big role as to why I find this remake to be some much more entertaining. De Niro stands out in his surroundings, from all that is wholesome and he very much so comes across as the oily and odious opportunistic bastard that he is: a recently paroled ex-con, always on the prowl, plotting and carrying out his multiple stages of revenge.To my perception the cast in this film exude a lot more energy and create far more vivid characters, compared to the cast of the original film, which, to my senses, never seems to get too exciting at any point and ends abruptly in an astonishingly lame and anti-climatic finale. Those glaring faults have been rectified with this new take on the tale and when it comes time to wrap things up, the endings of these two films contrast immensely in their intensity; as Scorsese staged an exhilarating finale over troubled waters, one that comes loaded with many desperate moments (and tingling nerves). The electrifying finale of this film is quite literally a, wet, wild, bumpy and thunderous ride; as De Niro (in what is surely the most animated moment of his career) holds court right there and then, intent on trying the Bowden's, at gun-point, in a sort of self-styled brand of perverted justice. As Max Kady, De Niro takes on the role of judge, jury and executioner, who is by then disfigured by fire and at his most depraved, boiling with revenge, he launches into a furious diatribe that's studded with legal questions, proclamations of justice and Bible scripture, all while ranting at the top of his lungs - practically foaming at the mouth. But before the Bowden's sentencing can be carried out, a bend in the river throws Kady a curve-ball, which abruptly interrupts his trial and a spectacular storm of wet n' wild visuals sweep across the screen; involving rotating camera-work, some amazing film-editing and what looks like reverse film-footage. Scorsese pulls-off this sequence ever so slyly, it's really quite a marvel of film-making and a thing of great beauty, which in stark contrast to the first film, ends the movie in a most exciting and satisfying way.In hindsight if there's one thing I'll always be convinced of, is that had it not been for Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lector, De Niro would have taken home the Oscar for best actor..... that being said, I find The Silence of the Lambs to be a better movie anyway.",

Apparently there was some production legalities etc., behind the making of this film.The film also stands as Scorsese's most outright \"violent\" and \"heinous\", borderlining on horror-esque at times, with Cady serving as this \"cannnot be killed\" evil villain.This film, in my opinion, also serves as Scorsese's most \"trope\" heavy production - many shots, and music, and themes play on already known and well used \"revenge\" or \"stalker\" tropes.Like with most of DeNiro's serious/dangerous roles, his performance here is really intimidating - he has a way about him, his posture etc., which is quite terrifying at times.The film has no wind up, within 5 minutes Max Cady is pressuring Bowden, so there is no let go, the entire film being one big nervous anticipation and worry.Act 1 and 2 are the best and most interesting parts, and do have some legal dynamics and it has Bowden falling prey to doing ill-advised things to try and stop Cady. The final Act is a bit bloated and at times over the top, however this was to be expected given the tone of the rest of the final, there had to be a big climax.",

When the music is bad, the movie is bad most of the times, when the music is good, it can make a movie soo much better (it's never enough to save a bad movie though). And that is the case with this movie, Martin Scorcese choose to keep the music from the original 1962 Cape Fear, and I am glad he did!. The music creeps up on you, get's you by the throat and is even more violent than Max Cady will ever be.\nThe acting is also great, I love Julliette Lewis, she has kind of a lost puppy look, but as always she can be real mean when you least expect it. Nick Nolte was brilliant, I think this is the best performance I have ever seen of him. I think it's part the script and part the fact that he wasn't on the booze at the time this movie was made. Downpart is Jessica Lange who delivers a hysterical \"screaming wive in distress\". There should have been some more depth in her character. Robert de Niro, he looks a bit old for a tough inmate guy. He claims to have learned a lot of filosophy, and talks wise.. but on the other hand he is a stalking murderer. I think these contradictions are a bit strange and unbelievable. But it does not ruin the movie.The biggest flaw in this movie, in my opinion, is the whole \"rape- non-rape\" issue. Cady (de niro) claims that Nolte held back some information, the girl he \"raped\" was a slut.. and this information would have gotten him out of prison, he claims. I think that is a bit far off, besides, who get 14 years for rape?.But if you take this for granted, then you will enjoy this movie. The use of the water and the darkness is great, the tattoo's the strange tension between the daughter and Max Cady is brilliant. The directing work is great. I give this movie an 8 out of 10.

At first i didn't think De Niro can be scary! I was most definitely wrong!!! He was as scary as possible! He just had that crazy guys look in his eyes that scared me all the way through the movie! Such a brilliant performance. This is De Niro at his best! One of his best roles.I think he was even scarier than Nicholson in The Shining! Many disagree with me on that one but... I still think so. He really scares me in this movie.I also have to mention Juliete Lewis's great performance and Scorseses, as always, brilliant directing. Juliette was quiet convincable as a naive, even foolish, rebel daughter that tries to contradict her parents in everything possible. Jessica Lange was brilliant, too. Nick Nolte also, even though he had plenty of better performances than this one. Scorseses directing is really superb and somehow dark even in the sunny moments of the movie.

            "content": "Remaking \"Cape Fear\" was a Bad Idea. (In some ways the original film was a Bad Idea, too.) It's rather interesting tracing the changes in the story from John D. McDonald's original book, a compact little thriller titled \"The Executioners\", through the first film to this travesty.The first film follows the book fairly closely, though i think i recall that the book sets the rape just after the Korean War and has Bowden and Cady both in the Army.The remake takes the ludicrous tack of making Bowden, to a great extent, a villain himself, by making him a public defender who suppressed testimony that might have mitigated Cady's sentence by impugning the moral character of his victim.Thus, when Cady views himself as a man wronged in the first film, it's all part of the malice and evil of the character. In the remake, if one takes the view that attacking the young woman's moral character -- \"She was asking for it, Your Honour!\" -- might have gotten Cady off or at least gotten him a lesser sentence, he has a legitimate grudge against Bowman, who did, indeed, violate the Canons of the Bar Association by not providing the best defense possible.This moves the conflict to a lower plane, making it essentially one evil character seeking revenge on another less-than-morally-pristine character who has genuinely wronged him, which, to me at least, reduces the tension considerably.DeNiro's performance is so totally over the top that it's often laughable. Nolte successfully fills up screenspace, but doesn't really engage the viewer for good or for bad.The best part of the film, to me, was Robert Mitchum (whose original portrayal of Cady is a LOT more effective and not nearly so broad) as the police lieutenant who can't move against Cady who hasn't done anything actually illegal yet. His playing of the \"You didn't get this advice from me...\" scene advising Bowman to have Cady dealt with ... informally ... may he the best thing in the remake.Read the book by McDonald. Watch the original film version.Skip this one.",

Unfortunately for me, I watched it only about 10 years ago (16-17 years old). And I couldn't sleep for a month!!! Still, even then, before I became the movie-maniac I am today, I characterized the movie as \"masterpiece\".And I never changed my opinion since. The powerful, dark and \"hypnotistic\" direction of Scorsese's early days can only be matched by De Niro's hypnotizing, absolutely terrifying performance and the latter is additionally surrounded by actors who not only are not overshadowed by him but they deliver performances equal to his. Agony, terror in its most magnificent form, a twisted comprehension of a psychopathic behavior and a plot ingenious in its simplicity construct this motion picture, which cannot be referred to as a mere \"remake\" but at least as a complete \"re-construction\" of an old successful film. While Max is tailing his ex-lawyer and his ex-lawyer's family, our emotions change rapidly from curiosity, uncertainty and disbelief to pure fear and absolute terror and, in the end, we are certain the something of Max's evil has remained;because no such evil could ever be extinguished... Bottom line, one of the best movies of all times and a really intense experience to live...",

Sam lives a simple blue-collar family life with his wife and 15-year-old daughter but soon they all may be in very real danger as the crazed Max has his sights set on Sam and his family and is bound and determined to teach the family what real loss feels like.Martin Scorsese does it again teaming up with a favorite in Robert De Niro playing the enigmatic Max Cady. He plays his role so disturbingly it almost feels like he's not acting, at times it feels very real. One of his most convincing roles playing a violent psychopath and my does he shine in this. With Scorsese behind the camera and De Niro in front of it it usually results in magic and this film holds it own with other great Scorsese films. One of those thrillers that puts you on the edge of you're seat and keeps you there. The intensity is amplified throughout with a truly iconic score that promotes this eerie feeling from start to finish. Any hardcore 90's fan or fans of these 'real life' thrillers can find massive enjoyment in this film.",

It's about a convicted rapist fresh out of prison who is taunting/stalking and messing around with a lawyer. His own defence lawyer none the less, who he believes has done him wrong. The directing in the film is great and it was nice to see Martin Scorsese doing a different type of thriller, some camera angles and the way things are shot really remind me of movies like Psycho and help build suspense in the film along with the violent scenes seeming a lot more realistic. What made this film even better is Robert De Niro. I'm used to seeing him play the part of a gangster in movies, which don't get me wrong I love, but in this film he is brilliant and most of all you actually feel the suspense and threat that his character is imposing on the lawyers family. The only thing that lets this movie down for me is the last fifteen minutes which to me feel rushed along with some of the acting been a little too over the top; the film could have been wrapped up a lot better. The suspense should have carried on!This movie is still an awesome film showing the brilliant talent De Niro has as a actor and Scorsese as a director.

            "content": "Everyone has fears. Fear is a part of life everybody must go through and sometimes it is difficult to overcome a fear. In Cape Fear Robert De Niro plays an ex-convict who is looking for revenge on the lawyer who could have gotten him out of jail earlier. Cape Fear is a movie that has been spoofed time and time again, most notably The Simpsons, and is a chilling thriller. Nick Nolte plays the lawyer and he struggles with problems in and outside his family while being stalked by his former client. The story is an interesting one as Max Cady, De Niro, is the bad guy but at the same time you sympathize for the guy and don't blame him for wanting revenge. Sam Bowden, Nick Nolte, is an anti-hero. Anti-hero may not be the right word but it's the one I am using. In a way he is no better than Cady. He is a shady lawyer, he cheats on his wife, mistreats his daughter, and much more. He is the main character and the story is told from his perspective so you pity the man for being terrorized but at the same time you think he deserves it. It is a nice twist for a movie like this. This could have simply been a stalker movie about a creep harassing a family because he is crazy. Instead we get conflicting emotions for the main hero and villain. Now that is rare.The best part about this movie is its simplicity. If this movie was made today it would have an awful story back behind a lot of CGI and fake blood. This movie was made in 1991 and instead of using special effects to make the movie good it focused on the characters, the story, and the music. The music in this movie is bone chilling. I love the score to this film and it mixes in perfectly with every scene. The blaring trombone or whatever brass instrument was used was perfect. The acting on all parts, even the daughter, was great as well. De Niro was the star performer but everybody involved was fantastic. Robert De Niro is an incredible actor and I think this is one of his most underrated performances. Max Cady is a creepy villain and even his presence is scary. The best scene is with Cady and the fifteen year old Danielle. Danielle is the daughter of Bowden and the entire scene Cady seduces her and it was so believable. It was believable throughout the acting. I was scared sitting in my living room. The way Cady used his words was perfect and my eyes barely blinked until the scene was over. Danielle acted really dumb but watching it again I didn't blame her. This movie is far from perfect but I did enjoy it. There are scenes that are boring and some characters I didn't really care about but overall it was a good movie. I watched this when I was little and I didn't really know or understand what was going on. I watched it again in blu ray and I appreciated it more but I stand by what I originally thought as a kid. This was a very good movie and is underrated, but it is also forgettable. I forgot all about this movie until I saw it in a buy two get one free bin at Best Buy. I liked the movie but it isn't a groundbreaking classic. I walked away entertained and weirded out, but that's really it. I really wish this movie was better but it was missing something. There was a twist or another character missing. I loved the character complexity in almost every character. Cady was written and acted perfectly and I think Nick Nolte did his part as well. The wife bothered me but she wasn't a big part of the movie. She has issues with her husband and there is one intense scene but other than that she was in the background doing nothing. Cady affected each member of the family in some way before the big finale, except for the wife. He has many confrontations with Sam and the one with Danielle but nothing major with the wife. I could think of a few scenes that probably have been cut out and/or replaced by better ones.Overall, Cape Fear is a very good time. You will walk away from this movie scared and freaked out. When this movie is good, its good, but when its bad, its bad. The movie slows down and is very long. I don't usually complain about length but in this case I was waiting for it to wrap up. I will probably watch this movie again because I do enjoy it but it will sit in my movie collection and be forgotten. It's really a shame because there are so many things I loved about this movie but it had that one missing link. Cape Fear is a solid movie and gets a solid High WillyT Recommendation.",

At its heart, this film mocks the \"sheep herd\" mentality of relying on social systems (law enforcement, criminal justice) to resolve one's problems.

            "content": "Cape Fear is a remake of the 1962 film of the same name. Surprisingly enough, it is one of the rare times that a remake is better than the original! Robert De Niro is a huge reason for this. He plays psychotic killer Max Cady, who is out to get Sam Bowden (Nolte), who was his corrupt defence attorney when Cady was convicted of rape. De Niro is clearly Nolte's superior, physically speaking (a huge problem in the original, where the villain was physically inferior to the hero). He melts into the role, and becomes unforgettably menacing. He sports tattoos all over his body, mainly of ominous, threatening quotes from Scripture. Honestly, how many things are scarier than a bad guy quoting Scripture? Another thing that is improved upon is that the characters are oh so much more flawed than in the original film. Gregory Peck in the original had a picture-perfect family. He was the perfect husband with a loving wife and an obedient daughter. Times have changed. This daughter, Danielle (Lewis) is attracted by Cady, despite how dangerous he is. She is no innocent. The father may or may not be having an affair with a clerk, but he has had affairs in the past. In short, the family is no longer perfect. They are miserable, and I love it! Cady has been betrayed and seeks vengeance. Is he sympathetic? Far from it. His scenes are consistently terrifying, such as in a disturbing sequence where he poses as Danielle's drama teacher. He goes on to nearly seduce her, even after she has figured out who he is. However, he never feels like a caricature of a villain; his scheme for revenge is also quite terrifying.This movie feels so much like a Hitchcock film. Look at the unusual opening titles by a frequent Hitchcock collaborator, Saul Bass, accompanied by music written by the legendary Bernard Herrmann (although conducted by Elmer Bernstein). Herrmann's music plays a significant role in creating tension. Scorsese's directorial choices were heavily influenced by Hitchcock, and you can tell. Although it is a Martin Scorsese picture, the thrills it delivers are Hitchcockian in proportion. Want proof? Look at how a mere teddy bear can look evil. I was on the edge of my seat half the time.Of course, Cape Fear at times shows that it is a remake. The final river sequence, for instance, takes place during a storm, while the waters were calm in the original film. Is this a good or bad move? You decide for yourself.The Verdict: Cape Fear may be a remake, but it feels very little like one. It stands as a movie of its own, and not a mere shadow of the original thriller. Martin Scorsese's direction is brilliant, and Robert De Niro gives an unforgettable performance. This is a fantastic movie\u2014 not Scorsese's best, but great nonetheless.Overall Rating: 10/10",

The acting was nothing extraordinary and were perhaps limited due to the sometimes odd dialogue - which most of the time was realistic while still having a purpose. The fighting scenes was really badly acted however.The story's premise is intriguing, and with it starting right away makes for a really compelling experience with good characters. However, despite numerous attempts at building up suspense with new events - it fails. So instead, the background of the threat is then given and immediate speculations regarding its intent. Albeit realistic behaviour benefiting the realness of the characters, it certainly does not offer anything in terms of mystery, thrill or suspense - the complete opposite - it makes the final act extremely predictable and dull.",

The music and the scenes with the car are very reminiscent of Hitchcock's Psycho. The special effects are okay but nothing else, I personally didn't like them since they created an unrealistic look. Not especially beautiful either. Scorsese is one of favorite directors and I have seen more or less all of his pictures. I would regard this one as one of Scorsese's weaker productions. There are some very good scenes, I personally liked the meeting in the school between Niro and Lewis the most. Even though I were in a theater, as the movie went on I more and more got the feeling I was watching TV. It's a good TV movie rather than a cinematic masterpiece. Having said that, it's worth watching, compelling and far from boring, a good thriller, but nothing too special.6,5",

Julitte lewis shows in this movie she has a modicum of talent,and can be quite attractive with the proper look. Nick Nolte is solid, Scorcese direction is okay,and the cinematography is decent, although a bit pretentious. Pretty much a waste.",

            "content": "A remake of the original 60s film, Scorsese's Cape Fear is a psychological thriller about Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), a criminal lawyer stalked by Max Cady (Robert DeNiro), a rapist he helped put behind bars fourteen years earlier. When unable to resolve the problem in the right way, Bowden is forced to take matters into his own hands.I've not see the original movie, so I'm not gonna try and make comparisons. Just taking it on it's own merit, I think Cape Fear is one of the best films Scorsese has made in his directorial career (and he's made some great films). It's not just the thriller aspect of the movie that he directs so well; Scorsese excels in his portrayal of the Bowden family unit, and how their disintegration plays into the film's events. Unlike Raging Bull, where the film is poetically shot, Scorsese goes for a much more abrupt and unflinching approach. It fits the mood of the film, and works well.Just like this might be Scorsese at his directorial best, I think this is also probably DeNiro at his acting best. Yes, there's The Godfather and Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, who all have as much claim to that title, but I think his performance in this film is terrific. He does menacing beautifully well, and you can see a lot of Travis Bickle in him. Just watch the slow-burning scene between DeNiro and Juliette Lewis (also terrific as Nolte's daughter): it is a lesson in being sinister and, in my opinion, the best scene of the film. And let's not downplay just how good Nolte and Jessica Lange are. They are wonderful as the husband and wife in the middle of this chaos.My only gripe with the movie is that it is perhaps too abrupt at times: there are moments in the film, or certain sequences where I wanted to see more, for it to play out more, and it never always did. The music got on my nerves a bit, too. There seemed to be too much of it. The score is great, don't get me wrong, but it should have been used sparingly. Instead, we see that stereotypical thriller music almost every scene, and it got boring and annoying.I wanna see the original movie even more now, just because this was so good. Robert DeNiro has never looked better, in my opinion, and he's helped by a very strong script and, of course, the fantastic Martin Scorsese.",

The movie is very violent and has plenty of shock values its not for the faint hearted , deniro steals the show with an OTT performance that is psychotic,brutal and boderline super human, nick nolte delivers as the lawyer , jessica lange plays the sexy sultry artist wife and an earlier role for julliet lewis( natural born killers ) also there are cameos from robert mitchum, gregory peck,, and martin balsam who graced the original cape fear (1962).

On the other hand, you have some elements blown entirely out of proportion. Although I will admit that the pros in this movie outweigh the cons.First, I must compliment Thelma Schoonmaker for her outstanding editing (as per usual,) and the Freddie Francis-Martin Scorsese cinematography team. I love Scorsese's use of the stacatto camera movements and zoom ins and outs. Also, the long shots and steadicams are also commendable.\nThe music, although originally by Hitchcock's own Bernard Herrmann, fails to live up to some of Herrmann's other scores such as PSYCHO, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, VERTIGO, CITIZEN KANE, or JANE EYRE. Though it is not his worst, and Elmer Bernstein has done well arranging it to this remake.\nThe acting. The grades are given on a scale of one to five.\nRobert De Niro as Max Cady                3, Nick Nolte as Samuel Bowden               4, Jessica Lange as Leigh Bowden             4, Juliette Lewis as Danielle Bowden         5, Joe Don Baker as Claude Kersek            3, Robert Mitchum as Lieutenant Elgart       2, Gregory Peck as Lee Heller                2, Martin Balsam as the Judge                3, Fred Dalton Thompson as Tom Broadbent     3, Illeana Douglas as Lori Davis             3, & Zully Montero as Graciela                 2      Need I say more?The only poor part of the film, in my opinion, is the ending. Once the Bowdens arrive at Cape Fear, the film just slips in to an unbelievable, over-blown ending that basically ruins the rest of the movie. It just doesn't seem to end and the climax was very disappointing. Instead of building suspense and having a surprise twist, which very well could've happened, Strick and Scorsese decided to have a special effects enhanced showdown on the Cape Fear River. I thought that this was one of the only pitfalls of the film. Although, it was a major part, I still enjoyed the rest of the film.It's not nearly as good as GOODFELLAS, but it's far better than THE AGE OF INNOCENCE. 3 stars out of 5.",

In other words, De Niro's seventh movie with Scorsese is another brilliant story that manages to be good even though it is a \"horror\" movie.Cape Fear takes place after the psychopath Max Cady, played by De Niro, is fresh out of prison after a long time. But there's a twist: Cady wants revenge on his lawyer Sam Bowden, acted by Nick Nolte, because Cady feels he wasn't defended the way he should have been. This triggers a fire in the ex-con and he wants revenge on Nolte. Along with his determination, Cady takes many brutal actions knowing that no matter what he does Bowden cannot defend his family from the animal.There are so many great things about Cape Fear but little things that take away from the movie. De Niro and Nick Nolte give outstanding performances to make this thriller even more thrilling.Cape Fear is held back from telling who really is the antagonist and protagonist. The Bowdens and Cady take matters into their own hands that may cause you to think all of them deserve to be in jail. It also may cause you to wonder if killing is ever needed.Cape Fear succeeds on every level delivering a great movie with an outstanding cast and tremendous camera work. Little things like De Niro constantly working out or stalking someone ring back memories of Taxi Driver: good memories.

Moral equivalencies of a broken criminal justice system are paraded on the screen as a criminal defense lawyer Bowden (played by Nolte) fends off attacks on his family by a crazed, ex-con rapist Cady (played by De Niro) bent on revenge after spending 14 years in prison. The lawyer admits at the outset of the movie that he withheld potentially exculpatory evidence at the rapist's trial, and the rapist tells the lawyer to his face that is why he is coming after him and his family so that justice will be served. The plot is very simple and taps into one's worst fears - that a crazed rapist/killer could break into your quiet suburban home at night and do the worst imaginable things to your family. Unsettling moral equivalencies are presented throughout the movie, such as when Bowden slips in blood on the kitchen floor or tries to wash blood off his hands at the end of the movie. The message is clear - even though Cady did the bad deeds, the lawyer has blood on his hands and is just as morally depraved as one who swore to uphold the law. An angry court of nature is ultimately given jurisdiction over the case at Cape Fear and the final hearing held on a house boat being tossed by a raging storm. After attacking his wife again and teenage daughter, Cady confronts Bowden with the essence of the claim - that in withholding the evidence, he violated his ethical duty as someone who swore to uphold the law and zealously defend his clients interests and that for that he is condemned to die in hell.The scales of justice get pretty banged up in the movie but in the end we are convinced that good prevailed, but just barely and only because Cady went way overboard.While perhaps not intended, the movie provides some insight on the mind of conniving, psychopathic killers/rapists. They depend on the rest of us obeying the law and acting in a predictable way. That is how they prey on us. They think they are smarter then law abiding citizens and like to see themselves as cool. Witness Cady in the convertible wearing sunglasses and trying to get under Bowden's skin. The psychopath's MO depends on the rest of us not breaking the rules. What fueled Cady's rage more than anything else was not the time in prison and prison conditions, or even the justice issue. It was that someone else beat him at his own game, someone he trusted.",

I watched Scorese's Cape Fear long time ago, and last night I re-watched it again, but this time with different approach to the cast ensemble and cinematography Mr. Scorsese served us. I could say that it was the golden age of acting of Mr. Robert De Niro that shines in its best. I could only say he is really a master of acting. Even today when he is rather old, he still have that shine in all of his movies even not top notch of acting, but anyway he have that special bouquet. In my opinion he is most comfortable doing villains, as it is with his part in American Hustle, which proves that. This remake reminds me on De Niro from for example Goodfellas, with his mean face you can see when he left the prison. I need to add, that Mr. Scorsese may have his valuable new actor in Leonardo Di Caprio which are great actor, but never could have that charisma De Niro had and have.This Cape Fear remake lay on a bit of Hithcockian style in a way I see it, definitely in a way of atmosphere and camera work. I really did enjoyed it, and Scorsese proves that he is great in managing characters and overall tension, no matter what. In his world there is no strictly black and white, rather a vast grey world which is actually realistic. That's why Mr. Scorsese is I can say, one of the most influenced and notable directors of this new age of cinematography. His newest works are ambitious and you must respect it, but his earlier works proves what a masterpiece cinematography is. Also notable is a great acting of then young Juliette Lewis, as she really involve herself so realistically in her part. The big veteran stars G. Peck and R. Mitchum which where part of the main cast in original Cape Fear, had their good moments here, but nothing special. Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange had really good performance here, but the center of attention and tensions are mostly made by De Niro and Juliette Lewis. I only did not like that negative film type of visual effect which I would rather replace with clean B&W shots (which are also presented) but who am I to suggest that? :)",

            "content": "After getting out of prison, Max Cady (Robert De Niro) plots revenge on Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), the lawyer who failed to defend him fourteen years ago. Max's approach to revenge is not directly violent - at least not at first. Instead, he slowly encroaches on Bowden's life, harassing his family and torturing the man into realizing his own moral shortcomings.This is the plot of Martin Scorsese's \"Cape Fear\". Like all movies from the incomparable director, \"Cape Fear\" is masterfully done. Up until \"Shudder Island's\" release nineteen years later, this was Scorsese's deepest dive into horror. He endorses something Hitchcockian here, as suspense seeps into the film's every scene. Never does the audience feel safe, for the antagonist always seems to be watching.De Niro's portrayal of that antagonist is appropriately disturbing. In fact, I might call it his greatest performance since his past collaboration with Scorsese in \"Taxi Driver.\" Watching the actor retain his cool while nonchalantly explaining his vengeful philosophy in a southern accent is brilliantly chilling. Although Cady might be methodically patient, the prospect of him breaking out into a violent fit never leaves the table. Likewise, the villain's persistent confidence adds to the relentless suspense and the rightful assumption that he always has the upper hand.Also, there is a striking physical transformation from De Niro here. While the actor gets much praise for his bloated shift in \"Raging Bull,\" his transition to intimidatingly buff in \"Cape Fear\" is equally impressive. His size is threatening and captivating, fueling the idea that Cady could murder with his bare hands at a moment's notice.The other actors and actresses might fall in De Niro's shadow, but they each deliver good performances. Nolte wonderfully portrays an established man haunted into a state of mental and moral instability. Meanwhile, Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis respectively do their part in portraying Bowden's wife and daughter- especially the latter, who plays a very complex role at a young age. There are also cameos from Gregory Peck and Martin Balsman, who both starred in the original \"Cape Fear\" back in 1962.If there is one area that Scorsese's remake could improve upon, it would be making Sam Bowden more likable at first. While I appreciate the fact that Bowden does not remain morally invincible throughout, this is somewhat undermined by the fact that he seems deceitful from the very beginning. We feel like we can't fully trust him, and his love for his family comes off as more of a social chore than something genuine.This was no doubt Scorsese's aim with the character, portraying Bowden as imperfect even before Cady reenters his life. However, if he were more endearing at face value, then his dissent into madness via Cady's psychological torment would hit even harder.Furthermore, there is a scene towards the end where Scorsese gets a little wild with the editing and camera angles. He captures De Niro's face in a way that is meant to communicate the character's insanity, but it feels somewhat gratuitous. De Niro is great at playing the violently unstable, so the actor should have been trusted conveying Cady's mental state in this instance without the camera doing so much talking.Anyway, criticizing Scorsese always feels sort of uncomfortable. Over the past fifty years, he has created some of the greatest pieces of American cinema, with very few flops in between. \"Cape Fear\" is far from a flop, but it is also far from Scorsese's best. For a director's first shot at a pure thriller, though, it's pretty top-notch.",

Cady has just been released from prison, after 14 years, and he feels it is Bowden's fault he went to jail in the first place. What starts as idle threats escalates until Bowden must decide how far he will go to protect himself and his family.Martin Scorsese's take on Cape Fear is actually an improvement on the original. The characters are more well developed and aside from Robert De Niro the acting is better in this one. Not to say that De Niro's Max Cady is bad, just that it can't compare to Robert Mitchum, who was made for the role. This version is a lot more intense as well. Film violence was much more limited in the 60s and as a result Max Cady was much less threatening in the original.All that said, the final act is so bad it almost drags everything good about the movie down with it. Logic no longer exists and neither do the limitations of the human body. Max Cady like so many horror figures before him is bestowed with otherworldly powers as the climax is taken to the umpteenth degree. If this could have been rained in just a little bit, Cape Fear would have been a horror classic, instead of just an above average outing.So, it's intense and enjoyable enough for an initial viewing, but by the end you'll be ready for it to be over.",

The plot does sound a bit old, where a prisoner upon release seeks his lawyer, who abandoned his duty by concealing evidence that could've saved his client.But this film took that plot and decided to go with the best - Robert de Niro as Max Cady and Martin Scorsese behind the camera. I had already fallen in love with de Niro's portrayal of the Taxi driver, by Martin Scorsese in 1976. And as Max Cady, he has again proved why he is the go-to guy when Scorsese comes up with such projects.De Niro steals the show as soon as it begins. Max Cady's entry, his tattooed chiselled body and the look in his eyes - we know we're in for a treat. And when he hospitalises one of the lawyer's love interests, one gets the vibes of \"the silence of the lambs\". Though his character is completely different than of Hopkins, one gets similar levels of petrifying fear when he is near any of his future victims. A feat only De Niro could've achieved. His mere presence around them gets your heart racing.Scorsese successfully maintains the tension till the end, and it begins to raise its levels as it approaches the finish line. The climax in the boat was shot beautifully with the storm outside. And when the final conversation happens between Cady and the lawyer, it is a battle between ethics and morality. Cady appears convinced that he was betrayed by a lawyer who could've saved him and feels he has nothing to fear, even assuming God on his side as he chants the verses in the final scene.So a great movie that is not just an extremely satisfying thriller, but also a take on ethics and morality.",

Prior to seeing it, I hadn't known it was directed for him, and had never seen a movie done by him. I wasn't too sure I was gonna like it cuz for one I usually hate remakes. But I really enjoyed this remake. I also liked that it didn't seem to have the same dialouge as some remakes do.         I liked the additions Scorcese made not seen in the original. Like the relationship between Cady and Daniele. It was eerie and at the same time, it worked for the story. I mean we're dealing with a psychopath and will stop at nothing to creep out this family. I also liked how this version was scarier. LOL Not only that near the end of the movie it got more and more so.I loved the references to Hitchcock, pretty cool. As well as the cinematography. All those intense close ups, worked nicely for this chilling movie. I recomend this movie because of great acting in part from De Niro--who by the way I never really got why people think he's so great...till now I can totally see it! He was a bit over the top but it worked for his psychotic character--and as well as great cinematography.I give it a 10/10 stars",

Max Cady is definitely one of the most terrifying characters in cinema, and his character was justified by the superb De Niro.The Acting by the whole cast is superb, all the actors including Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange as the Lawyer and his wife and their daughter Danielle(Juliette Lewis) have done a great job in their roles and have really perfected the portrayel of their characters, BUT Robert De Niro really takes the cake with his portrayel of the Dangerous Psychopath Max Cady who is obsessed with taking revenge against the family of Sam Bowden(Nick Nolte) and De Niro has really imperfected the character through his extraordinary acting skills and deadly expressions and dialogue delivery and really scares the audience in many times.The Direction by Martin Scorsese is as good as ever as he has yet again produced a master-piece with De Niro, and has done a magnificent job in making the movie. He Helped all the experienced actors give excellent performances in their respective roles and yet again has made De Niro give a superb performance under him and really has perfected in the other aspects of the film such as the Music, Direction in harsh areas. He Has really imperfected the use of the story and has made one of the best thrillers which will literally give you chills and with the help of his old friend De Niro and the other great actors, he really has added another gem to his treasury.The Story of the movie which is based on the novel(The Executioners) written by John. D Macdonald, and the screenplay is done by James R Webb and Wesley Strick, is really great showing the obsession towards the family of this dangerous Psychopath who can literally do anything to make life miserable for the lawyers family, and great job to both the Author and the screen writers for doing such a fine job with the story.The Music which is another Scorsese classic really sets the tone for the movie and really helps to the atmosphere of the movie with its chilling like music and great job from music directors Elmer Bernstein and Bernard Herrmann for doing such a fine job with the music for the movie.This Movie really is one of the better thrillers in the history of Cinema, which will keep you at the edge of your chills,and De Niro's acting will ensure the chills to run down your spine, and Martin Scorsese just makes the even better with his marvelous direction as always and has made another superb movie.My Rating: 8/10",

Sam's defended psychopaths and murders all his life, but was disgusted and uphauled by what Max Cady did to the young girl he raped, so he lets him rot in jail, but Max Cady knows all this, and hasn't forgotten.Max has had prophetic apocalypse scripture passages tatooed onto his arms, let his hair grown long, and hass gone completely insane with revenge and death fantasies he wishes to carry out. Max stalks Sam following him around everywhere, telling Sam \"Loss, you don't know loss.\" Max goes to a parade where Sam and his family are at and just watches, as Sam threatens Max that he'll kill him if he comes close to his wife and daughter, and punches Max in the face, letting the whole crowd see this event. When Sam files for a restraining order, he is quickly turned down because of the attack he pulled on Max at the parade, realizing he can't escape, and Max will eventually get to him.Sam Bowden calls up the witness protection service as he fears for his and the life of his family, as they are at the will of Max Cady, always being watched. Placing traps around the house and having an armed guard isn't nearly enough to stop Max from breaking into the house, killing the guard and maid, and is completely ready to kill Sam and his family. The Bowden's get to their house boat and leave, in hopes of escaping the nightmare, but Max is right there on the boat, always there, as he was before.Robert DeNiro is at the top of his game in Cape Fear. We totally forget that he even is DeNiro as he dominates the role of Max Cady, who represents everything evil and disturbing in human revenge and madness. Max and Sam's back and forth threating of each other is great, and raises tension throughout the entire film, just building and building incredible suspense. Juliette Lewis plays Sam's daughter, Danielle and is great. She is terrified of Max and what he might do to her, only that she finds him waiting for her in the school, smoking his cigar, in one of the most suspenseful and frightning scenes in the movie. Danielle also turns out to be the most quick witted and bravest in the end of the story, in suprising and scary ending.1991 Oscar Nominations Robert DeNiro: Best Actor (nomination) Juliette Lewis: Best Supporting Actress (nomination)",

Peck character is especially strong as he must counter two threats to his integrity and the safety of his family; that is, an internal threat - his own guilt; and an external one - Cady.  Another weakness in characterization is Lewis' role as the daughter, she comes across as a saucy, little tart who is simultaneously attracted and repulsed to the charming, but psychopathic Cady.  However, Martin, as the fragile, innocent doe creates more dramatic impact through more contrast and vulnerability vis-a-vis Cady, thus more tension, terror and believeablity.  To wit:  the scene where Martin runs from her parents car, is pursued by Mitchum off the city street, then unwittingly runs right back into his arms, is one of the most terrifying scenes in the entire movie!  While the remake has it's strong points and is a riveting movie at times, in the final analysis, the original \"Cape Fear\" gets my vote as the better of the two - a minor classic as it were.",

To avenge his punishment, Cady stalks Bowden's family, lurks in the shadows outside their abode and even intoxicates their pet dog. His actions magnify in ambiguity and austerity as the film lurches forward. He even rapes the girl with whom Bowden is having extra-martial with, gets intimate with Nolte's daughter Danielle and despicably harms the family emotionally and physically too.Its Scorsese's fame and mastery that has brought Universal Studios and Amblin Entertainment in collaboration with Steven Spielberg to work as the production team for Cape Fear.

Robert De Niro is an excellent choice for the leading role of Max Cady. Though Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), playing the role of Max's old lawyer, is as well intriguing.  Cady wants nothing more than to obtain his revenge on Sam after fourteen years. Danielle Bowden (Juliette Lewis) is the narrator at the beginning of the film.  It is like she is telling us the story, and all she has to remind her about \"Cape Fear\" are bad memories.  Jessica Lange also plays an excellent role as Leigh Bowden, Danielle's mother and Sam's wife.  Max Cady is an ex-con and has just been released out of prison from a fourteen year sentence.  He wants to acquire his revenge on Sam Bowden for hiding evidence from the court during his trial. This evidence could have granted Cady a lighter sentence, or possibly no sentence at all.  Sam was Cady's lawyer and Max feels that he should have help him better instead of getting him sentenced to fourteen years; no matter what the case.The story within the film gets under my skin.  Max Cady was on trial for battery and rape.  The evidence that Sam found said that the woman that Max supposedly did this to was promiscuous, and had up to three different lovers at one time.  This piece of information was very crucial, but after what Sam had seen in the photos of the beaten and raped victim, there was no way he could give it to the courtroom.  Instead, he buried the evidence.  Max Cady was sentenced to fourteen years in prison and when he was released, he wanted his revenge.  When Cady is released from prison, he lives in the same town as the Bowden's, so it is fairly easy for them to meet.  He tries to rape Sam's wife, daughter, and he also rapes and badly beats Sam's \"close friend Claude Kersek\" (Joe Don Baker).  Sam can never get rid of Max. Everywhere he turns, there Cady is.  Cady even follows the Bowdens' to \"Cape Fear.\" I think that \"Cape Fear\" is a very well directed and produced movie.  The plot is simply revenge.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, except if they have personal issues on rape or battery. \"Cape Fear\" can simply be described as this: exhilarating actors and actresses with well written roles in an excellent film.",

De Niro is subsequently convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison, the film starts upon his release. Cape Fear (1991) is a remake of the 1962 movie featuring Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck. These two actors are now replaced with Robert De Niro and Nick Nolte as Max Cady (ex convict) and Sam Bowden (yuppie lawyer) respectively. Mitchum and Peck both feature in cameo roles which will undoubtedly please fans of the original. During his 14 years in prison Max Cady educates himself as a lawyer and in the words of the bible. He also develops a formidable six pack and muscular physique with which he presumably wishes to use as a tool in exacting his revenge on Bowden and his family. De Niro, known for his ability to transform himself physically (Raging Bull) does well in creating a physically intimidating character with an equally menacing performance. Cady frequently quotes from the bible and has carefully planned his revenge against Bowden aiming to break up his family emotionally before physically killing them. De Niro's performance as a psychopath is excellent and undoubtedly steals the show. Nick Nolte (surprisingly thin and clean cut) is also good as the defence attorney who has made questionable decisions in his career and family life. The relationship between Nolte and his wife (Jessica Lange) is well depicted and in a realistic manner. A very young Juliette Lewis is consistently annoying throughout the film (and in all her films) but is probably well cast for Scorceses' view of a less than angelic daughter. Scorceses' remake is quite stylish and makes some interesting use of black and white/ X ray close ups of the characters at certain moments of the film. The score is also very good with a thunderous and chilling tune symbolising De Niro's malevolent and dangerous character. Overall, Cape Fear is quite an entertaining movie but nothing special and feels like it is a little too long. The finale of the movie (filmed on Bowden's boat at Cape Fear) is dragged out and uses the Terminator model where the villain just keeps coming back. This loses steam after a while and was probably unnecessary. Not a great movie but worth watching for De Niro's performance alone. Note should also be given to the Simpsons parody of Cape Fear which for any one who has seen the movie is intensely amusing.",

He is menacing, malevolent & devilishly seductive - the perfect villain.I really loved the shots of Cady in prison, where the camera gazes on his chiseled body, the muscles in his back and his multiple tattoos & the shot of him outside for the first time, (the camera pans wide and the sky casts grey, lightning tumbles, and eery music plays)- it's all very atmospheric and sets the tone for the rest of the film.Cady is not a white-trash psychopath, but an 'enlightened' psychopath - one who is well versed in law & philosophy, and believes he has the same weight of God. There is something darkly humorous about this - evident in one of the final scenes where De Niro acts as a prosecutor. The camera quickly cuts back and forth, from Sam & Cady > Cady's face up close, his eyes directly staring at the audience - breaking the fourth wall as he addresses us as though we are the jury in this trial.The encounter between Juliette Lewis and Robert De Niro alone in a darkened theatre is spine chilling. Cady, sadistically feeds on the 15-year olds innocence, feelings of resentment towards her father & indeed her sexual curiosity. Scorsese really has a way of making you feel like you're in the room in this particular scene, and although disturbing it is so hard to look away- which makes you feel quite seedy. (Juliette Lewis had no idea De Niro was going to put his thumb in her mouth during this scene, which makes it even more squirm-worthy)In another scene, De Niro's facial expressions alter dramatically - from chagrined smiles & charming laughter to evil facial contortions, leering grins and demonic eyes. It is of no surprise that he was nominated for best actor in this film, his conviction to the role is sublime. Cape Fear is a great psychological thriller (perfect for a family movie night).

I detected scenes of this film in Hitchcock manner i.e., use of unusual camera angles, lighting, opening credits and editing techniques.The scene where De Niro laughs so bloody good was good acting. I do believe, Joaquin Phoenix's has incorporated this in the Joker.Martin Scorsese must have been obsessed with whole pages of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo in his mind as to he's incorporated a favourite scene from it, like the scene where the character Sam awakens after seeing images(illusions) of Robert De Niro in his sleep.The scene on the boat where a badly burnt and deranged De Niro enacts on a mock trial the performance of his was the best and certainly deserved an Oscar.Notable lines:\nIf you're not better than me, then I can have what you have.I will let no man drag me down so low as to make me hate him. -Booker T WashingtonIf you hang on to the past you die a little every day.",

            "content": "\"Cape Fear\" is one of my favorite thrillers of the 90's. Although I agree with many critics and users that this film too often gets bogged down in contemporary horror (aka slasher flick) trappings, it's redeemed by intelligent writing and an outstanding cast. Robert DeNiro plays Max Cady, a whacked-out ex con just released from prison and dead set on destroying the life of the defense attorney (Nick Nolte) who let him get set up the river 14 years prior. By including Notle's wife and daughter (Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis respectively) in his diabolical plans, Cady sets off a trigger of events that quickly turns his entire world upside down. Martin Scorsese directed this remake of the 60's b flick of the same name, but his version adds some fantastic new dimensions to the story that take this film beyond the standard thriller status of the original. As stated before, the only problem with this film is in it's tendency to allow itself to shift from a tense, suggestive thriller that leaves you on the edge of your seat to a blatant horror flick that instead leaves you cringing. However, even at it's most outrageous, \"Cape Fear\" never becomes too unbelievable thanks to the cast. DeNiro has never before or since been more menacing; with his portrayal of a self-educated, manipulative redneck pervert he commands the attention of the viewer every solitary second he's on the screen. As Sam Bowden, Nolte does paints a portrait of a sympathetic yet highly flawed character that's every bit as strong as DeNiro's. As Sam's wife, Jessica Lange goes a long way to elaborate on the character of the wife from the original; while the 60's version was a typical ornament female character, Lange brings the same sympathetic humanity to the film as Nolte. Juliette Lewis really got noticed for the first time here, and deservedly so-she's charming, innocent, cute and unnerving-just like your average teenage girl. With his direction, Martin Scorses turns \"Cape Fear\" into somewhat of a hyperbole, with varying success. The frantic camera work and extreme color schemes become contradictory-at once his style damage the attempts at suspense while taking the tension to extreme heights. Aided by Bernard Herrman's intense score (adapted from the original version of the film), \"Cape Fear\"-though flawed-is ultimately a fun, fascinating and often terrifying film that is part psychological thriller and part slasher flick.",

            "content": "The original \"Cape Fear\" was much more suspenseful and foreboding,not to mention, more believable. You must suspend disbelief to watch this version as too many things are, to say the least, implausible. Take for instance, when Max Cady kills Claude Kersek (played by Joe Don Baker), Kersek is sitting on the floor with gun in hand and all entrances wired for sound. He is alert and the scene is deathly quite, yet Cady manages to kill the maid not more than a room away without ever alerting Kersek. And after spending a good part of the movies plot building up Cadys massive strength and problem solving ability, he can't figure out how to break himself free of the last remaining piece of pipe holding his ankle to the last remaining piece of the houseboats flooring. Much less, getting a handcuff quickly around someone's ankle. In the original version, Bowden's daughter was terrified of Cady. Instead, in the new version, Danielle Bowden sucks Cadys thumb, deep kisses him, believes his lies and even relates to him. This is too hard to swallow, even with todays ultra liberal attitudes.Believability aside,this new version is simply an exercise in revenge without the utter nail-biting suspense of the original. De Niro's Cady is indeed menacing, but without the cool persona of Mitchum. This Cady is angry and it shows in every frame. Mitchum's coolness itself was menacing. Nolte's Sam Bowden is not the cool, clear thinking Bowden so aptly portrayed by a far superior Peck. Peck brought the cool clear thinking mind of a lawyer to the role while Nolte played the role as an \"act before you think\" scared rabbit. Juliette Lewis is very good but certainly not Oscar worthy. If you haven't seen the original 1962 version, then you will probably be entertained. Oddly, as superior as the original is, it garnered no Oscar nominations in a year when Peck won best actor nod for \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" while both De Niro and Lewis were nominated in this version (neither won). Go figure. If you haven't seen either, than go with the better Mitchum/Peck version.",

The Joe Don Baker cameo is actually a welcome development! Although the pacing, editing and sound are very much up to Scorsese standards, the new CAPE FEAR is more silly than suspenseful. The \"horror\" climax of this remake is more reminiscent of FRIDAY THE 13th (and is just as hackneyed) than the original, tense noir ending.

            "content": "Out of all of Scorsese's films that are heavily inspired by neo-realist Italian cinema, this one I can only describe as the most Hitchcockian - from the plot, technique, camerawork, acting, score. It is hard for me to describe something as Hitchcockian, especially when it comes to judging the story but this one really fits the book in my opinion. Phenomenal acting by Robert De Niro, I couldn't believe he could pull of a portrayal that is so entirely different from his usual roles. The fact that Nick Notle did The Prince of Tides and this picture in one year is very very commendable. Jessica Lange, I mean what can I say. In addition to the acting, Scorsese must have had his actors to act in resemblance to the acting style of a 1970s thriller. That, and the camerawork in the transition from scene to scene and reaction to reaction, also gives this film the 1970s feel. Plus, the score as well. And the use of distorted imagery that also resembles that of say, Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. The plot is not just about a psychotic quest for some stupid vengeance, but a psychotic quest for vengeance with depth. Max Caddy seeks revenge against his former attorney not just out of what he sees as injustice and unfairness but also from the philosophizing he accumulated during his time in prison. This idea is represented metaphorically in the scene where we see one of Caddy's tattoo is a scale where \"truth\" and \"justice\" (or biblical justice) are balanced. The tattoo represents all of Caddy's psychology and philosophy and that his actions are justified to him by some biblical notion of justice and truth. Caddy also says that they will experience loss, \"loss of freedom\" and \"loss of humanity\". And I guess in the end, the Bowden family did lost that because they have become forever frightful and traumatized. Overall, this may not be on my top 10 of Scorsese's best but it was a very very smart venture into Hitchcockian cinema style.",

            "content": "Going into this film, I had very high expectations. Starring Robert DeNiro, Jessica Lange, and Nick Nolte, visions of intense sequences and perfected cinematic segments danced in my head. Much to my disappointment, I was instead met with awkward dialogue that was poorly recorded and a climax that was further over the top than a Michael Bay action shot. In summation, this film follows small-town lawyer Sam Bowden (Nolte), stalked by ex-con Max Cady (DeNiro) who served 14 years for rape due to Bowden's dereliction to acquire him a lesser sentence. Not surprisingly, Cady unleashes his wrath, liberating his pent up rage by threatening the Bowden family in addition to preying on Sam's teenage daughter and other significant women in Sam's life. Minus some slightly awkward dialect, I did enjoy the first half of the film. It kept me enthralled and built suspense similar to that of John Boorman's \"Deliverance,\" which isn't necessarily a compliment, considering Boorman's masterpiece was released in 1971, whereas Scorsese's was in '91. Nonetheless, some of my personal favorites are 70's movies, however THOSE movies actually capitalized on the tension they built, while \"Cape Fear\" only fell short. Many times, the film dragged me into its thickening plot, only to throw away what tension they'd built with unnecessarily graphic violence or ridiculous conflict successions that did not add to the plot or even remotely make sense. Furthermore, the production value of this film seemed to be particularly low, especially for a Scorsese film starring DeNiro, among other big-name stars, even though its budget was 10 million dollars higher than my personal favorite Scorsese: \"Goodfellas.\" To further remove value from the film, the effects were horrid. Colorful swirls and X-Ray camera filters dominated some of the intense scenes from the first half of the movie, taking away moments that could have been apprehensive or even frightening. These effects looked similar to those of Apple's built in \"photo booth\" app; cheap and easy to create. I do understand that this is a 90's movie, but in my opinion, that only strengthens my point. An experienced, accomplished director such as Scorsese should have been able to pinpoint what he could do effectively, special effects not included. I will give credit to a deep depth of field used in the film to give it more of an indie feel, creating an unsettling, disturbing aura. Unfortunately, this aura was put to waste through violent scenes that surpassed the savagery of other Scorsese films such as Goodfellas, a feat I did not consider to be possible. Something I very much appreciate about most Scorsese films has repeatedly been his ability to highlight the sadistic nature of the world's criminals, however he went overboard in \"Cape Fear.\" There comes a point that even the heaviest of crime-drama fans cannot bear to watch. I hadn't experienced that until I saw this film. Now that I have bashed it enough, I will end on a good note from this movie. DeNiro was brilliant, as always. A perfect embodiment of the southern rapist that his character was, DeNiro depicted an interestingly mixed character that was filled with ruthlessness, maniacal tendencies, and surprising charm. While Jessica Lange played the same, tedious character she perpetually plays, DeNiro again knocked his role out of the park. Final decision: 3/10.",

I remember my Dad having several of Macdonald's books, but I have not read any of Macdonald's books. However, I subscribe to the belief that one does not need to read the book on which a movie is based -- on can approach a movie adapted from a book based on its own merits; the director should not feel compelled to require viewers to have read the book nor feel bound to satisfy fans of the book. This remake features several stars from the 1962 version in different roles.I have also not seen the 1962 version, but I have read that the character of Sam Bowden is played as a less-flawed character trying to defend his family from a crazy man by the name of Max Cady. In this remake by Scorsese, Bowden is presented as a character who has his own flaws. In other words, there is no hero in this movie that wears a white cap and prevails in the end. This is typical not only of Scorsese but other movies of this time made by movie creators who do not subscribe to the belief that right and wrong are so black and white.I also read that this movie was being made around the same time as Schindler's List and that Scorsese had been originally tapped to direct it and Steven Spielberg was to direct Cape Fear. Scorsese felt Spielberg was more suited to Schindler's List and so they swapped films. That got me thinking, though, how Schindler's List would have turned out with Scorsese at the helm.In Scorsese's directorial resume, Cape Fear comes just after Goodfellas and before The Age of Innocence. This movie was definitely sub-par for Scorsese considering the quality of Goodfellas. Many of Scorsese's directorial touches can be seen, but they seem less refined rather than more.I did not know much about the movie going into it. It has its scary moments and it made me look in the dark corners that night. It is not scary overtly so much, and I see that the 1962 version is even less overt -- but the scariness is still there.The most memorable and creepy scene is the one ad-libbed and gotten right on the first take by Robert De Niro and Juliette Lewis where Max lures Danielle to a secluded part of her school. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole scene waiting for De Niro to attack.As far as casting goes, I think De Niro plays the part sufficiently, but it is nothing spectacular. Nick Nolte was a second choice, and I believe Harrison Ford would have played the part better and may have stolen the spotlight from De Niro. Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis both played their parts well.Overall, this film was average. I enjoyed it, but it was nothing that stood out either from a directorial standpoint or acting standpoint.",

I liked the fact that all the characters had some moral ambiguity, although this is clearly not a film that goes for subtlety or complex plot points.All in all, a classic 80s thriller, but I'm looking forward to renting the original 1962 film upon which this is based, which I suspect may be better overall (Gregory Peck as Sam Bowden!)",

            "content": "This was truly two of the most intense hours of film I have ever seen. Even in the tiniest of details such as Jessica Lange putting on her make up, it is built up so much and it keeps you on edge the whole way through. Robert De Niro gives a mind blowing performance as the psychotic vengeance seeker with a fantastically murderous accent and his mannerisms, costumes and hairstyle all subtly blend to give what I would describe as the perfect villain for a movie. Nick Nolte as the increasingly frustrated lawyer is often shadowed by De Niro much like Heath Ledger's Joker to Christian Bale's Batman; He still delivers an excellent performance but for a protagonist role, it shouldn't work out that way. The standout scene for me was between De Niro and Juliette Lewis who plays Nolte's daughter. She easily portrays the innocence of a young teenager exploring with her sexuality, craving a bit of danger in her life. In the scene they share together, the chemistry between the two actors is immense, every single line brings shivers to the back of your spine, culminating in the deliberately anti-climactic kiss. I do, however, find that some of the directing technique is rather strange, the water theme is rather tedious throughout the film and seems a tad unnecessary. Also, some of the bizarre camera angles and even predictable settings (not counting the location shot featuring a red sky which I thought was genius!) make for what I believe to be a medium effort by Scorcese, not his best film by any means. However I still loved the film, it's not for the faint hearted and it's not easy going, just what I want!",

This movie deals with topics such as corruption, justice and social classes. The movie showcases that an ex convict, Max Cady, a terrible person, can indeed be smarter and tougher than some big shot lawyer. Robert DeNiro's performance was as per usual amazing and Scorcese's directing shines once again. But in my opinion there are some things missing in the script. It was not explained exactly how Max Cady got into the house, which I would have loved an explanation for. Also, the daughter of the family who was previously scared of even hurting a bug, later on decides to turn to the dark side and nearly burns Cady to death, whose life only remained due to him jumping in a river. Also, how in the hell did Cady get up from the river? Are you telling me he grabbed onto that one small rope in all that chaos, not likely. Would have loved for them to rewrite that scene. Either he dies, is driven to the riverbank or does not jump into the water at all. Overall I liked this brutal, political, almost thriller like movie. It was engaging and a good watch.",

            "content": "Cape Fear (1991) is Scorsese's most under-appreciated film in this author's opinion, hands down. It's almost never venerated like some of the top-tier works in his oeuvre and while that's not a slight by any means, Cape Fear is hardly among his worst.I, for one, am all praise for De Niro's outstanding portrayal. He inhabits the character emotionally as well as physically to showcase a powerhouse performance that's easily in his all-time top five, in my opinion. Nolte -- who's pretty damn impressive himself -- selflessly allows the more imposing character Max Cady to be in the saddle. You watch The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and you see prisoners come out after completing their sentences as shadows of their former selves, bruised and broken by the prison system. But Max Cady is hardly written as your typical low-life criminal... more like a formidable personification of cataclysmic ideas: A larger-than-life figure who quotes literary texts, solves complex arithmetic problems in his head, charms women whenever the situation demands, and bashes the living daylights out of hired crooks even when he's outnumbered. As the tattoos inscribed on his brawny body read, vengeance is his -- the thirst for divine retribution steering his schlep. Samuel Bowden's judgmental, self-righteous ways have come back to haunt him big time.Against the backdrop of this terrifying nightmare inflicted upon the Bowdens, Scorsese is saying something about the American Dream and its fragile nature. Things were already less than perfect before Max's unwelcome arrival, but they were surely never going to be the same after his exit. Cady menacingly enters the places they frequent, the home they dwell in, the life they once cherished, and in consequence the dark memories they'll be sweeping under the rug long after his departure (pardon the Semantic Syllepsis). Cady's comfortably sprawled-out frame on the compound wall etched against the blaze of a firecracker-lit July Fourth sky drives the point home with splendor and visual acuity. The tragedy is ultimately young Danielle's -- our narrator of these events -- who's forced to let go of her innocence and embrace womanhood against her will.Who exactly has the final privilege of judgment? Of course, that's assuming it is a privilege and not a crippling burden. Samuel's decision (a judgment call) to withhold the promiscuity report triggers the prime conflict. Should he be commended for listening to his higher voice of conscience, or should he be proscribed for holier-than-thou dereliction? Cady is 100% correct when he reminds Bowden that a lawyer is supposed to ZEALOUSLY represent his client. Scorsese, rather intelligently, is more interested in posing than answering this question. For a brief moment during the powerfully acted mock trial on the boat, Cady's eyes look directly into the camera while presenting his case, as if we, the viewer, are the Judge and he the plaintiff. The Court of Justice awaits our verdict, even though it won't have any bearing on the characters' fates.I've never seen the original with Robert Mitchum and so have little idea regarding the sweep of its thematic coverage. But a pall of blinding darkness hangs over Scorsese's version -- there's a genuine horror to uncover in its thematic core. It exhibits filmmaking of a high standard, offers spine-chilling thrills, and launches a realistically disconcerting assault on our frangible repose. In hindsight, Cape Fear was an absolute gem of a thriller.",

The movie instills terror into the audience from the moment it begins, and I mean that every bit. The moment the story begins we become more and more terrifed. Elmer Bernstien's adaptation of Bernard Herrmann's music gives the film a great atmosphere of unrelenting suspense.Let us not forget that Robert De Niro plays a great Psychopath. I must warn that Cape Fear does have some things in common with Slasher Films, but it is more like an old fashioned suspense thriller.

The ways things are presented in this movie are in Scorsese style; The plot is interesting, the first 30 minutes were used by Scorsese to make the viewer familiar with the setting and characters, after that moment you know what type of movie you're going to watch, a movie which has the style and feeling of a Scorsese movie, and to be a honest, one of the first movies I've watched where we are told a story of blackmailing and stalking in which we come to realize that some of things that the antagonist does things that ourselves are able to do if we are betrayed and let to rot in a prison for 14 years just because the lawyer made a decision to hide some case details away from the grand jury in order to make sure that his employer gets to pay the prize for his crimes.To make this short, a man (De Niro) gets out of jail after a 14 year sentence and seeks revenge by stalking and blackmailing his lawyer (Nolte) for the things he hid away from the jury. The acting is great, but De Niro fits the role perfectly and plays it in the same way, making me feel uncomfortable in some scenes, almost as if he was messing with my mind. Nolte and his family are perfect picks too; the whole cast of this movie was downright great.It's a very interesting thriller which seeks to intrigue the average viewer by presenting a plot that is very plausible to happen and I really hope that some day you will be able to watch this movie if you haven't already.10/10",

            "content": "Cape Fear was originally made in 1962 and was adapted from John D. Macdonald's novel The Executioners. The story follows a rapist who has been released from prison after 14 years and is out to find the lawyer who was supposed to represent him. Already, after hearing the summary the constant film-goer is enthralled into what will happen, I for one was, and by God, I was pleased. The film is strikingly original and fresh, and plays out like a horror story but turns out to be a thriller of many complexities. Robert De Niro stuns again as the horrible Max Cady and he definitely packs a wallop with a very well executed performance. He is supported by a good performance by Nick Nolte who plays the cheating lawyer Sam Bowden. It is a shame to say that Juliette Lewis was awful and had no apparent connection with the rest of the cast who I thought all brought in good, solid performances. Martin Scorsese directed this film after much reluctance but was eventually persuaded to direct and once again with Robert De Niro he did a great job, this being his penultimate partnership with De Niro, they always seem to have a chemistry that no other partnership of actor and director have. The score for Cape Fear is very haunting and fits in well with the suspenseful atmosphere, and holds in your head for a long while afterwards, reminding you of the encounters between Cady and Bowden. The set design was well done and is very real, especially at the end when they actually shot on location, the fact that the most part of the movie is set in a very normal place makes it all the more creepy. Overall, this movie, compared to other De Niro and Scorsese films such as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Casino, is not as good but it is still a supremely good achievement and stays with a long time, although I would not recommend that this film is watched by anyone who is very disturbed by violence and scary characters or is easily creeped out as it is not a very nice film and is certainly very scary, although it is not a horror. A must watch for Robert De Niro or Martin Scorsese fans, or any film buff like me! 9/10",

Another scene that solidifies De Niro as a psychopath is the one with Juliette Lewis in the theatre where it builds and builds to the point where you want to run away and never see his face again, he plays a maniac so convincingly its hard to believe that at the end of the scene he could just turn it off.The relationship between Jessica Lange and Nick Nolte is unbelievable and strained at moments but with performances from Juliette Lewis and Robert De Niro stealing the show it doesn't let the film down.This is the first Martin Scorsese film where he uses optical FX and you can tell with excessive use of solarisation and filters, he turns the sky into what looks like fire during one scene while magnifying the stars in the next.The cameos from Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck are nice and ending the film with a visual metaphor Nick Nolte washing the blood off his hands was a good touch.",

That's the basic story. There were tons of TV and straight to VHS/DVD movies with the same story or variation of it, which we didn't even notice. This movie just proves that talented directors and actors are the ones who carry the movie, not the story itself. That said, it must be noted that screenplay, although with simple premise, have lots of details which enrich the characters and relationships between them.If you liked Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver, you'll also like him here. In my opinion, Max Cady in Cape Fear is even crazier than Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. Nick Nolte was his usual self, good but nothing extraordinary. Juliette Lewis in one of her first bigger roles was fantastic in portrayal of young, emotionally volatile teenage daughter.The most fascinating thing about the movie is the building of suspense and horror. It seems most contemporary movies can't pull this thing anymore. Although the movie has some usual tactics (the villain is supposedly dead but we know he'll show up again in a second), with Cape Fear I found myself sitting on the edge of the seat more and more, while with most thrillers today I almost sleep and just wait to see how the villain dies in the end.",

Trust me when i say during that 30 minutes you will be breathing through your mouth, with a dilated pupil and a pounding heart, with no reckoning of your surroundings, for that is the longest, most disturbing and haunting climax i have seen in any movie.Robert De Niro plays a psychopathic, in\ntelligent and extremely manipulative brutal rapist, an underestimated ex-con, who comes down after 14 years in prison to haunt and destroy the life of his defendant lawyer, Sam Bowden who deliberately failed him. Now most of the Scorsese movies feature lead antagonists, but De Niro's character Max Cady would stand out on all of them. The loath, the anger, the vengeance. It was all there on his face, for which he earned his 4th Oscar nomination for Best Actor.Through all these, the screenplay on its own is a satire on the impotent legal system, bad parenting and the society's crucifixion of rape/assault victims.Incredible and unforgettable character play by Jessica Lange, who plays the wife of Sam, she would make you cry, make you wish all this is over soon. And the talented Juliette Lewis, Sam's daughter, she surprised the Hollywood with her Oscar nominated performance.I had my hopes low as i knew it's a commercial thriller that Marty was bound to do for Universal Pictures, but uff!, along with 'the' Bernard Herrmann's music and Hitchcock-ian direction style.

Adding more to the tension is how she allows him to kiss her talk to her even after she finds out his true identity and its so disturbing to watch him converse with such a young girl and to know his intentions. I think the reason this movie is so well done is because it plays on everyone's fear of someone that's capable of hurting you or your loved ones, but there is no way to stop them.
